The defendant, charged with Shaheed\u2019s murder, posited at trial that a third party had been the shooter. A Superior Court jury returned a conviction of murder in the first degree on a theory of deliberate premeditation. The defendant filed a motion for a new trial, asserting, among other things, that his trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance. The motion was denied by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>the judge who had presided at trial. Before us is a consolidated appeal from the defendant\u2019s conviction and from the denial of his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">There is no dispute that the defendant\u2019s counsel did not prepare for trial in an adequate manner. Among other things, defense counsel did not familiarize himself with the Commonwealth\u2019s discovery file, did not examine the physical evidence collected by police, did not conduct any independent investigation of the case, and did not consider seeking exclusion of any of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. Because of counsel\u2019s inadequate preparation, significant pieces of evidence supporting a third-party culprit defense were not introduced at trial. In addition, two in-court identifications of the defendant were admitted that, if objected to, could have been excluded. Although the case against the defendant was a strong one, it was not overwhelming, and we are persuaded that \u201cbetter work might have accomplished something material for the defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>460 Mass. 294, 303 (2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>435 Mass. 113, 123 (2001). In essence, the defense available to the defendant was aired so inadequately at trial as to create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, we vacate the defendant\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Shooting and trial. </em>The evidence at trial centered on an incident that occurred outside a pub in Lowell one night in July, 2006.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Two separate groups of friends visited the pub that night. One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>group included the victim; his fianc\u00e9e, Arlene Cruz; his cousin, Keash Hardin; and two of their friends, Luis Parella and a woman named Tammi. This group was planning to attend a birthday party at a house located across the street from the pub. Other partygoers, including Leslie Berube and Benjamin Jones, witnessed the victim\u2019s killing from the area of that house.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The other, larger group included the defendant; five of his friends: Oriol Kedgy Dor, Estevenson Etienne, Fritzgerald St. Preux, Robenson Brinville, and Jimmy Semextant; and at least four unidentified individuals, who met with Dor in Boston that day and followed him back to Lowell.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The group that included the victim entered the pub briefly. So did several members of the group that included the defendant. The rest of the defendant\u2019s group remained outside, near the pub door. All of the individuals who had gone into the pub trickled back out, beginning with the victim\u2019s group. When the victim\u2019s group was again outside, by the door, and as the remaining members of the defendant\u2019s group were leaving, the two groups began arguing. Dor asked, \u201cWho\u2019s Keash?\u201d or \u201cAre you Keash?\u201d or words to that effect. Hardin, the victim\u2019s cousin (who was, in fact, Keash), answered that he was not. The victim then asked, according to Hardin\u2019s testimony, \u201cIf it was Keash, what would have happened?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Semextant, another member of the defendant\u2019s group, told Hardin and the victim not to ask any questions. Hardin responded by punching Semextant in the face. The crowd dispersed in a frenzy of running, perhaps (as Hardin testified) after a man standing next to Semextant brandished a gun.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The victim ran away from the pub, and later circled back around <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>toward it. Semextant was heard calling out, in Haitian Creole, \u201cShoot! Shoot!\u201d Two shots were fired. One bullet hit the victim in the back of his head, killing him. Two casings from a .380 automatic caliber weapon were later found at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The background to this encounter remained murky at trial. Estevenson Etienne (one of the defendant\u2019s friends) testified that Dor (another friend) had initiated the visit to the pub because Dor had been \u201carguing with a guy in there.\u201d According to Etienne, he and Dor knew that \u201cthere could be a fight\u201d that night. Another member of the defendant\u2019s group, Fritzgerald St. Preux, said that Dor had traveled to Boston that day in order to \u201cpick up some of [Dor\u2019s] boys.\u201d Both St. Preux and Dor reported that Dor had been in a squabble at the pub on some earlier date, but they both said that that argument was resolved on the spot, and that it involved neither the victim nor Hardin.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The disputed question at trial was whether the defendant was the man who shot the victim. The murder weapon was not recovered, and no forensic evidence identified the defendant as the shooter. The Commonwealth\u2019s case thus relied heavily on the incriminating, and generally consistent, testimony of the defendant\u2019s friends, Etienne, St. Preux, Robenson Brinville, and Dor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Close ties were shown between these friends; in particular, Dor\u2019s sister and the defendant\u2019s brother have two children together. All four of the defendant\u2019s friends described statements in which he admitted to shooting the gun. In addition, Etienne testified that he witnessed the defendant lift his hand just before a gunshot rang out and the victim fell; Brinville testified that Semextant had given the defendant a gun earlier that night; and both Etienne and Dor testified that Semextant was addressing the defendant when he said, \u201cShoot! Shoot!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Two other eyewitnesses identified the defendant as the gunman: Hardin and Howard Jewell, who was checking identification documents at the pub door that night. Hardin testified, on direct examination, that he had been unable to pick the defendant out of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>photographic array approximately one week after the shooting. Subsequently, however, according to Hardin, he saw the defendant\u2019s photograph in a newspaper, and he then recognized the defendant as the shooter. Hardin\u2019s cross-examination revealed that the newspaper article he had seen was about the shooting, and that the only photograph included in the article was of the defendant. Jewell, on cross-examination, revealed that the background to his identification was similar: at a photographic array conducted soon after the shooting, Jewell picked out the photograph of the defendant, but wrote on the back of the photograph only that the man \u201c[ljooks familiar. Was there.\u201d Jewell also initialed a second photograph in the array, of a person who was never identified. By the time Jewell testified at trial, he had seen a photograph of the defendant in a newspaper. Unlike Hardin, Jewell testified also that, about two weeks before the trial, he was shown a single photograph of the defendant at the district attorney\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Benjamin Jones, one of the friends of the victim who witnessed the incident from across the street, did not identify the defendant. Jones stated, however, that the shooter had a \u201clow, tight, bald haircut.\u201d According to several witnesses, the defendant had short hair at the time of the shooting, whereas Etienne, St. Preux, and Dor reported that they had each then worn dreadlocks or braids.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Jones testified also that the shooter ran to a light- or tan-colored Honda Accord. The defendant\u2019s vehicle was a blue-grey Dodge sedan. The other vehicle in which friends of the defendant traveled that night was a van.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Leslie Berube, another friend of the victim who was standing across the street when the shots were fired, was eighty per cent confident that the defendant\u2019s photograph in a photographic array was that of the shooter. Berube also testified, however, that the shooter dropped a cellular telephone while running; other evidence revealed that the man who dropped his telephone during the incident was Dor, not the defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Berube acknowledged that, immediately after the shooting, her attention was focused on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>locating her flane\u00e9, Eric Wilkins, who also was at the pub that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Finally, evidence was introduced to suggest a consciousness of guilt on the defendant\u2019s part. The defendant changed his telephone number two days after the shooting. Additionally, an officer testified to statements that the defendant made to police following his arrest, approximately nine days after the shooting. While sitting in a police cruiser, after being read the Miranda rights, the defendant was told that he was being charged with murder for a shooting in Lowell. At first, the defendant responded that he did not know anything about the shooting. After he was informed that he had been identified as the shooter, the defendant said that he had been in Lowell a week or two earlier, but that nothing had happened. The defendant initially denied any memory of the names of the friends with whom he had been on that occasion. He stated also that there had been a \u201cproblem\u201d that night, but that he himself had not been involved.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, the defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty. The judge allowed the motion only as to the theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty, and otherwise denied it. The defendant did not present evidence. The theory of the defense was that a third party, probably Dor, had been the shooter. Defense counsel\u2019s closing argument focused on Berube\u2019s testimony that the shooter was the same man who had dropped his cellular telephone, namely Dor, and on certain inconsistencies between the versions of events provided by the defendant\u2019s friends. Counsel suggested that Etienne, St. Preux, and Brinville \u2014 who had gone to speak to police of their own volition \u2014 falsely incriminated the defendant, presumably in order to protect Dor. The prosecutor did not argue the case as a joint venture, and no jury instructions on joint venture were given. On their fourth day of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">b. <em>Postconviction proceedings. </em>Represented by new counsel, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial, which we remanded to the Superior Court. The primary argument made in the motion was that the assistance provided by the defendant\u2019s trial attorney was constitutionally ineffective. The defendant maintained also that the prosecutor erred by eliciting false evidence and by arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>in his closing facts not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance claim relied on materials from the Commonwealth\u2019s pretrial discovery and on an affidavit of his trial counsel. According to that affidavit, the defendant\u2019s trial was counsel\u2019s first murder trial. Counsel was paid approximately $12,000 for his services. He averred that, at the time of the trial, he was unaware of much of the contents of the Commonwealth\u2019s discovery file. He did not visit the Lowell police department to examine the physical evidence collected in the course of the investigation. He rarely, if ever, \u201cengage[d] experts or investigators to assist in the defense.\u201d He did \u201cnot independently investigate this case and ... did not attempt to contact and interview any of the witnesses identified in the discovery materials.\u201d In addition, it was \u201cnot [counsel\u2019s] habit to engage in motion practice,\u201d including motions to suppress.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The defendant argued that the discovery materials produced to his attorney included potential evidence that would have supported the theory that Dor was the shooter. This evidence included: (a) a description of Dor\u2019s clothing on the day of the shooting provided to police by his neighbor, Heidi McLean,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> coupled with a matching description of the clothing worn by the shooter provided to police by Luis Parella, one of the victim\u2019s friends; (b) a statement to police by the same neighbor, Heidi, that she had been told by Hipolita Gabin, Dor\u2019s girl friend, that \u201c[Gabin\u2019s] man shot somebody\u201d; (c) accounts by Dor\u2019s friends and neighbors, contained in police reports and grand jury testimony, about prior incidents at the pub, and about statements made by Dor after those incidents, indicating that Dor intended to harm Hardin and his friends; and (d) information that police found a nine millimeter bullet while searching Dor\u2019s apartment. The defendant argued also that his attorney should have sought the exclusion of the in-court identifications of the defendant by Hardin and Jewell.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The trial judge did not grant the defendant\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing. After receiving memoranda and hearing argument, she denied the motion for a new trial in a detailed written decision. Focusing implicitly on whether trial counsel\u2019s perfor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>manee prejudiced the defendant, the judge concluded, first, that some of the potential testimony on which the defendant relied would not have been admissible, given the restrictions on the admissibility of third-party culprit evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, </em>453 Mass. 782, 800-801 (2009) <em>(Silva-Santiago). </em>Other testimony, according to the judge, \u201csuggested] that [Dor] was the shooter.\u201d But the judge concluded, relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Laughlin, </em>446 Mass. 188, 204 (2006), that this evidence was \u201cnot \u2018so overwhelming\u2019 to affect the sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d The judge reasoned that any motions to suppress the identifications by Hardin and Jewell would have been denied under the then prevailing case law. Finally, the judge discerned no impropriety in the evidence presented by the Commonwealth or in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. The defendant appealed from both his conviction and the denial of his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">2. <em>Applicable standards. </em>We focus our analysis on the defendant\u2019s primary claim, that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance from his trial counsel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Ordinarily, a defendant asserting a claim of this kind must show \u201cthat \u2018there has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,\u2019 and that, as a result, the defendant was \u2018likely deprived ... of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boria, </em>460 Mass. 249, 252 (2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). When an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is made on direct appeal from a conviction of murder in the first degree, however, we apply the standard \u201cmore favorable to a defendant\u201d of whether there is a substantial likelihood that a miscarriage of justice occurred. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrero, </em>459 Mass. 235, 244 (2011), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>453 Mass. 203, 204-205 (2009). Under this standard, \u201c[i]f we conclude \u2018that counsel erred by failing to raise a substantial defense, \u201ca new trial is called for unless we are substantially confident that, if the error had not been made, the jury verdict would have been the same.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spray, </em>467 Mass. 456, 472 (2014), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sena, </em>429 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Mass. 590, 595 (1999), <em>S.C., </em>441 Mass. 822 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">In our review for a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice due to ineffective assistance of counsel, we consider whether the defendant has made \u201csome showing that better work might have accomplished something material for the defense.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>460 Mass. 294, 303 (2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>435 Mass. 113, 123 (2001). One type of situation in which such a showing may be made is where counsel neglected \u201cevidence that another person committed the crime,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>446 Mass. 155, 163 (2006), <em>S.C., </em>448 Mass. 621 (2007), and that evidence, \u201cif developed, might have raised a reasonable doubt about whether the defendant or someone else had killed the victim.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farley, </em>432 Mass. 153, 156 (2000), <em>S.C., </em>443 Mass. 740, cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1035 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">We review a judge\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial for \u201ca significant error of law or other abuse of discretion,\u201d granting \u201cspecial deference to the rulings of a motion judge who was also the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forte, </em>469 Mass. 469, 488 (2014), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 307 (1986). When we review such a decision in the context of an appeal from a conviction of murder in the first degree, the defendant nevertheless \u201chas the benefit of our independent review, pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E ... of the entire record.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>423 Mass. 506, 513 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">In the current case, we cannot defer in the usual manner to the trial judge\u2019s assessment of the defendant\u2019s claims against the backdrop of the evidence heard at trial. Throughout her decision denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, and intertwined with her discussion whether the information offered by the defendant would have been admissible as third-party culprit evidence, the judge indicated that she was guided by the standard described in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Laughlin, </em>446 Mass. at 204.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The defendant in that case was convicted of burglary and other offenses. See <em>id. </em>at 189. Circumstantial evidence was presented \u201cof motive, opportunity, and means, as well as consciousness of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199. The defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict, relying in part on evidence suggesting that a third party had been the culprit. See <em>id. </em>at 203. We held, however, that, \u201cif the Commonwealth has presented sufficient evidence that the defendant committed the crime, the fact that the defendant has presented evidence that he did not does not affect the sufficiency of the evidence unless the contrary evidence is so overwhelming that no rational jury could conclude that the defendant was guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The defendant in the current case presents a claim of a different nature, namely that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. The defendant does not assert that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence at trial was insufficient to support the verdict, or even that the evidence would have been insufficient if the defendant had received effective assistance from his attorney. The standards that govern the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance claim do not demand evidence \u201cso overwhelming that no rational jury could conclude that the defendant was guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the defendant\u2019s claim was not assessed by the judge against the appropriate standards, we are constrained to rest our analysis on our independent review of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">3. <em>Analysis. </em>Our examination of the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, in light of the foregoing principles, proceeds in three parts. At the outset, we comment on the practices of the defendant\u2019s attorney in preparation for trial. We then scrutinize the missteps that, as a result of counsel\u2019s practices, occurred at trial. With those foundations in hand, we evaluate whether there is a substantial likelihood that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">a. <em>Counsel\u2019s practices in preparation for trial. </em>We begin by stating plainly what was implicit in the judge\u2019s decision denying the motion for a new trial: the practices of the defendant\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>in preparing for trial, as counsel has described them, were unacceptably remiss. Appropriately, the Commonwealth has so conceded. We do not undertake here an in-depth analysis of the professional obligations of defense attorneys. Suffice it to say that a reasonably competent attorney representing the defendant would have been expected to become familiar with the discovery materials produced by the Commonwealth; to examine the physical evidence available for inspection at the police station; to independently investigate at least certain aspects of the case, if necessary drawing on experts or investigators for help; and, barring strategic reasons to the contrary, to file any motions to suppress evidence reasonably likely to succeed. See, e.g., Committee for Public Counsel Services, Assigned Counsel Manual, c. 4, at 10-13 (Oct. 2011). The defendant\u2019s attorney, who failed to perform any of these tasks, did not arrive at trial prepared to provide the quality of assistance that would be expected of a reasonably effective attorney. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. at 97 (\u201cdependence on improvised cross-examination alone, even if it will surely be of virtuosic quality, is not to be recommended\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">b. <em>Specific lapses by counsel at trial. A </em>question more crucial to our analysis is whether defense counsel\u2019s careless practices compromised the defense ultimately presented at trial. For the reasons we explain, we conclude that the defendant \u201cwas denied a fair trial due to trial counsel\u2019s . . . failure to investigate and develop the evidence which could have supported the defendant\u2019s defense,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farley, </em>432 Mass. at 157, coupled with counsel\u2019s failure to challenge important inculpatory evidence of questionable reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">i. <em>Exculpatory evidence not presented. </em>The defense offered at trial, that a third party had been the shooter, relied wholly on portions of the evidence put on by the Commonwealth. Predominantly, the defense focused on Berube\u2019s testimony that the man who shot the victim was the same man who dropped his cellular telephone (i.e., Dor). Standing in isolation, this piece of testimony was vulnerable to the suggestion, made by the prosecutor in closing, that Berube \u2014 who later identified the defendant from a photographic array with eighty per cent assurance \u2014 was merely confused and distracted immediately after the shooting. Because defense counsel neglected to explore the potential for a third-party culprit defense in advance of trial, he did not identify, investigate, assemble, and present additional evidence that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>have buttressed the theory that Dor was the shooter. That evidence, \u201cif developed, might have raised a reasonable doubt about whether the defendant or someone else had killed the victim.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farley, </em>432 Mass. at 156. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haggerty, </em>400 Mass. 437, 441 (1987) (new trial warranted by counsel\u2019s \u201cfailure to investigate fully and pursue\u201d defense raised at trial). Two pieces of information provided in the Commonwealth\u2019s discovery, in particular, could have added heft to the defense\u2019s hypothesis that Dor was the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The first of these was a description of the shooter provided to police by Parella, one of the victim\u2019s friends. Parella stated, first, that the shooter was wearing a red T-shirt, with gold print, and blue jeans. Dor, according to his neighbor, Heidi, was wearing a red shirt and blue jeans on the day of the shooting.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Parella also stated that the shooter had \u201cshort dread locks.\u201d This description fit Dor\u2019s hair, not the defendant\u2019s; while the defendant\u2019s haircut at the time of the shooting was reportedly a \u201cCaesar\u201d or a \u201cfuzzy head,\u201d Dor testified that, at that time, he had braids that \u201cwere hanging down,\u201d but \u201cnot long.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The second piece of information that could have fortified the third-party defense was that, also according to Heidi, Gabin (Dor\u2019s girl friend) said after the shooting that \u201c[her] man shot somebody.\u201d Whether or not Gabin herself might have been called to testify at trial, a reasonably effective attorney would have endeavored to call Heidi to recount Gabin\u2019s statement. Like all third-party culprit evidence, this testimony would have been admissible if the judge determined that it had \u201ca rational tendency to prove the issue the defense raises\u201d and was not \u201ctoo remote or speculative.\u201d <em>Silva-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number><em>Santiago, supra </em>at 801, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. 18, 22 (1996). In addition, because Gabin\u2019s statement would have been hearsay, its admissibility would have turned on the judge\u2019s assessment whether it was \u201cotherwise relevant,\u201d whether it would \u201ctend to prejudice or confuse the jury,\u201d and whether there were \u201cother \u2018substantial connecting links\u2019 to the crime.\u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>441 Mass. 291, 305 (2004).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Here, there were other links between Dor and the shooting, namely Berube\u2019s testimony that the shooter was the man who dropped his cellular telephone and Parella\u2019s description of the shooter, coupled with Heidi\u2019s description of Dor\u2019s clothing. And considering that Berube\u2019s testimony already implicated Dor, it is difficult to say that Gabin\u2019s statement to the same effect would have confused the jury. We have stressed that \u201c[i]f the evidence is \u2018of substantial probative value, and will not tend to prejudice or confuse, all doubt should be resolved in favor of admissibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conkey, </em>443 Mass. 60, 66 (2004). Accordingly, we assume, for purposes of our analysis of the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance claim,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that Heidi would have been permitted to testify to Gabin\u2019s statement incriminating Dor. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>446 Mass. at 163-164 (concluding that third-party culprit evidence not offered by trial counsel would have been admitted from judge\u2019s treatment of other such evidence).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Other potential testimony identified by the defendant, while less directly probative of the third-party culprit defense, might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>have enhanced it by establishing that Dor had both a motive and an intent to engage in violence toward the victim\u2019s group of friends. This testimony could have been provided by Crispina Mangual, Sanyph Pierre-Louis (Mangual\u2019s boy friend), and Stephanie McLean (Heidi\u2019s sister), all friends and neighbors of Dor. According to their pretrial statements, these individuals could have testified that, a week or two before the shooting, Hardin and an unidentified man harassed Gabin, Dor\u2019s girl friend, while Dor and St. Preux were outside the same pub smoking.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Dor was enraged, and he told his friends, \u201cThey\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t have a piece on me.\u201d Closer in time to the shooting, the same friends and neighbors heard from Dor and Gabin that Dor intended to go back to the pub to show \u201c[tjhese niggas from Lowell . . . who\u2019s a gangster\u201d and to \u201cshoot [Hardin].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">At least some of this information likely would have been admissible as third-party culprit evidence, namely evidence that tended to show that Dor \u201chad the motive, intent, and opportunity to commit [the crime].\u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 800, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>404 Mass. 378, 387 (1989). Like Gabin\u2019s statement that \u201cher man shot somebody,\u201d this information was supported by additional \u201cconnecting links\u201d between Dor and the crime, and it is difficult to say that this information would have confused the jury. See <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 801, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>441 Mass. at 305. Moreover, the observations of Dor\u2019s friends and neighbors about earlier goings on at the pub would not have been hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The potential testimony of Dor\u2019s friends and neighbors would not have been contrary to the evidence, presented by the Commonwealth, that Dor and his friends were at the pub because (in Etienne\u2019s words) Dor had been \u201carguing with a guy in there,\u201d knowing that \u201cthere could be a fight.\u201d Still, evidence of Dor\u2019s personal involvement in earlier hostilities, and of his personal desire for revenge, could have given form to the other indications that Dor was the shooter, by suggesting why Dor himself might have taken out a gun and fired it. By contrast, the only explanation offered at trial as to why the defendant might have shot the victim was that the defendant was part of Dor\u2019s group and was at the pub to support Dor\u2019s efforts. Especially given that the case was not put to the jury on a joint venture theory, this final set of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>information, unheeded by defense counsel, would have bolstered the prospect of a successful third-party culprit defense.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">ii. <em>Inculpatory evidence not challenged. </em>The other side of the evidentiary ledger, namely the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, also could have looked different if the defendant had received reasonably effective assistance from his counsel. The key issue at trial was the identity of the shooter. Dor, Etienne, St. Preux, and Brinville all provided incriminating testimony on this issue, describing either the shooting itself or subsequent confessions by the defendant. The defense was unlikely to succeed unless there were reason to think that these witnesses were lying to protect Dor. The challenge of generating such a doubt was made all the more difficult by the identifications of the defendant as the gunman by Jewell and Hardin, who knew neither Dor nor the defendant.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Exclusion of these identifications would have made a real difference, therefore, to the defense\u2019s prospects.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">These identifications suffered from serious weaknesses. At photographic arrays conducted soon after the shooting, both Hardin and Jewell failed to pick out the defendant as the shooter. Jewell, who thought that the defendant looked \u201cfamiliar\u201d and had been at the scene (a point not disputed), also marked his initials on another photograph of an unidentified individual. By the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the trial, Hardin and Jewell each had seen the defendant\u2019s photograph in a newspaper article about the shooting. Jewell testified also that, at the district attorney\u2019s office, about two weeks before trial, he was shown a photograph of the defendant unaccompanied by other photographs. In court, both Hardin and Jewell identified the defendant as the gunman without objection.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">We recently have held that, in the future, in-court identifications generally will not be permitted where a witness has participated in a pretrial identification procedure that \u201cproduced something less than an unequivocal positive identification.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>470 Mass. 255, 262 (2014). Our most up-to-date jurisprudence is not the applicable standard, however, because an attorney \u201c[i]s not ineffective for failing to make an objection that would have been futile under the prevailing case law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conceicao, </em>388 Mass. 255, 264 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boria, </em>460 Mass. 249, 253 (2011); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holliday, </em>450 Mass. 794, 813 (2008). We must therefore inquire whether, under the prevailing law, it would have been \u201cfutile\u201d for the defendant\u2019s attorney to have objected to Hardin\u2019s and Jewell\u2019s in-court identifications. In the circumstances, we cannot conclude that such an objection would have been futile.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">To begin with, the law has long been settled that \u201can in-court identification is excluded if it is tainted by an out-of-court confrontation arranged by the Commonwealth that is \u2018so impermis-sibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bol Choeurn, </em>446 Mass. 510, 520 (2006), overruled on another ground by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crayton, </em>470 Mass. 228 (2014), quoting <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 384 (1968). Jewell\u2019s in-court identification could have been challenged as \u201ctainted\u201d in this sense, given his testimony that, before trial, he was shown a single photograph of the defendant at the district attorney\u2019s of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>fice.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s attorney presented no such claim. When, at a sidebar conference, the judge offered to permit a voir dire of Jewell, so that defense counsel could inquire further into the circumstances of Jewell\u2019s identification, defense counsel declined repeatedly, stating that he would \u201clet it go.\u201d The Commonwealth has not identified a reasonable strategic reason that might have supported this decision, and none is suggested in trial counsel\u2019s affidavit. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dougan, </em>377 Mass. 303, 316-317 (1979), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>372 Mass. 783, 789 (1977), abrogated on other grounds by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paulding, </em>438 Mass. 1 (2002) (stating that \u201cfull exploration of the circumstances surrounding eyewitness identification is necessary to ensure a fair trial\u201d). There is thus no reason to conclude that a motion to exclude Jewell\u2019s identification would have been futile.</p>\n<p id=\"A6\">In addition, the identifications made by both Jewell and Hardin could have been challenged under our common-law rule that, \u201cin some circumstances [,] an identification that has been tainted, but not by the government, may become so unreliable that its introduction in[ ] evidence is unfair.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Odware, </em>429 Mass. 231, 236 (1999). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jules, </em>464 Mass. 478, 490 (2013); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>460 Mass. 590, 605 (2011); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvia, </em>456 Mass. 182, 190 (2010); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bly, </em>448 Mass. 473, 494 (2007); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>438 Mass. 160, 171 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>434 Mass. 823, 835 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>423 Mass. 99, 103-105 (1996). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dougan, </em>377 Mass. at 317-318, and cases cited (trial judge may grant requests for \u201cin-court lineup\u201d or \u201cphotographic spread\u201d and may \u201cseat [the defendant] among the spectators at trial\u201d to increase reliability of in-court identification). A judge\u2019s authority to exclude severely unreliable identification testimony is closely related to his or her more general \u201cdiscretion to exclude evidence that is more prejudicial than probative.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, supra </em>at 107. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonds, </em>445 Mass. 821, 831 (2006), and cases cited; Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 403 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">We have stated that \u201ca casual confrontation in neutral surroundings, such as those that occur through the media,\u201d ordinarily does not warrant the exclusion of identification testimony. See <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>423 Mass. at 109-110, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. 533, 542 (1990). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jules, </em>464 Mass. at 490; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvia, </em>456 Mass. at 190; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bly, </em>448 Mass. at 495. But the cases in which we have so stated did not involve the additional problem with the reliability of the identifications presented here \u2014 namely that, before seeing the defendant\u2019s photograph in the media, Jewell and Hardin failed to pick him out as the gunman in photographic arrays.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This factor would have provided further support for an argument that Jewell\u2019s and Hardin\u2019s identifications of the defendant were not, in fact, based on their recollections of the night of the shooting. Given this additional reason to consider the identifications \u201cso unreliable as to require exclusion,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, supra </em>at 108, we cannot conclude that efforts to exclude them would have been futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">c. <em>Review for a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. </em>The upshot of the foregoing discussion is that the defendant\u2019s counsel did not seek to introduce certain readily available pieces of evidence supporting the defendant\u2019s third-party culprit defense and failed, too, to challenge the admission of potentially excludable eyewitness testimony. We are persuaded that the cumulative effect of these errors created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u201cThis is not a case where \u2018arguably reasoned tactical or stra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>tegic judgments ... are called into question . . . .\u2019 Rather, in this case, defense counsel did not investigate the only realistic defense the defendant had to the charge of murder in the first degree.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haggerty, </em>400 Mass. at 441, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rondeau, </em>378 Mass. 408, 413 (1979). This also is not a case in which the defendant failed \u201cto point out. .. some issue of fact. . . that could have been but was not exploited ... in the original proceedings.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. at 98. Instead, for the reasons described <em>supra, </em>the substandard assistance provided by defense counsel deprived the defendant of an opportunity to put a reasonable version of the defense available to him before the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>446 Mass. at 157, 164 (affirming grant of new trial for failure to develop third-party culprit defense where evidence of two other third-party culprits had been presented at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Counsel\u2019s failure even to look into the Commonwealth\u2019s discovery required him to rely almost entirely, in support of the third-party culprit defense, on a portion of the testimony of a prosecution witness, Berube. On the evidence presented at trial, it would not have been difficult for the jury to discard Berube\u2019s testimony as the product of her confusion in the wake of the shooting. With the benefit of reasonably effective assistance from defense counsel, on the other hand, the defense could have combined Berube\u2019s testimony that the shooter was the man who had dropped his cellular telephone with Parella\u2019s description of the shooter, which matched a description fitting Dor and not the defendant; with Gabin\u2019s reported statement that her boy friend, Dor, shot somebody; and with accounts from Dor\u2019s friends and neighbors indicating that, because of a previous incident at the pub, Dor intended to hurt the victim\u2019s group of friends. These multiple suggestions of Dor\u2019s guilt, from different sources, would have been harder to dismiss as incidental errors. Their combined force would have made exponentially stronger the argument that reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt remained. On the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>side of the scale, counsel\u2019s failure to challenge the identification testimony of Jewell and Hardin seriously compromised the viability of the hypothesis, upon which a successful defense depended, that Dor, Etienne, St. Preux, and Brinville were lying on Dor\u2019s behalf. \u201c[B]etter work\u201d thus might have accomplished \u201csomething material for the defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>460 Mass. 294, 303 (2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>435 Mass. 113, 123 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The case against the defendant would have been powerful in any scenario. \u201cBut the point is that the defendant was denied the opportunity to present the evidence ... to the jury so they could weigh it against the testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s [guilt].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>446 Mass. at 167, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>435 Mass. 274, 279 (2001). Defense counsel\u2019s seriatim inexcusable failures to familiarize himself with discovery materials, to conduct an independent investigation, to present available third-party culprit evidence, and to challenge vulnerable identification testimony were laden with consequence. The evidentiary picture put to the jury in the wake of counsel\u2019s desultory efforts was sufficiently different from what it would have been under the direction of a reasonably effective attorney that we cannot say with the requisite substantial confidence that, in the absence of counsel\u2019s errors, the verdict would have been the same. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spray, </em>467 Mass. 456, 472 (2014), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sena, </em>429 Mass. 590, 595 (2004). Otherwise put, it would be unfair for the defendant\u2019s conviction of murder in the first degree to rest on a trial at which his defense was presented so poorly and incompletely. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahar, </em>442 Mass. 11, 20-21 (2004) (Sosman, J., concurring), quoting <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689 (1984) (\u201cthe purpose of the effective assistance guarantee of the Sixth Amendment is ... to ensure that criminal defendants receive a fair trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment of conviction is vacated and set aside, and the matter is remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\">For ease of reference, we provide a nearly complete list of the individuals involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Friends and relatives of the victim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">Arlene Cruz, the victim\u2019s fianc\u00e9e;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">Keash Hardin, the victim\u2019s cousin;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-12\">Luis Parella, known as \u201cOrel\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-13\">Tammi, last name unknown;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-14\">Leslie Berube; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVI\">Benjamin Jones.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">Friends and relatives of the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-16\">Oriol Kedgy Dor, known as \u201cKedgy\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-17\">Estevenson Etienne, known as \u201cSmoke\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-18\">Fritzgerald St. Preux, known as \u201cSpike\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Robenson Brinville, known as \u201cSon-Son\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab\">Jimmy Semextant, known as \u201cBig Jimmy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">And other friends and neighbors of Dor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\">Hip\u00f3lita Gabin, known as \u201cJosie,\u201d Dor\u2019s girl friend;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-12\">Crispina Mangual, a friend of Dor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-13\">Sanyph Pierre-Louis, Mangual\u2019s boy friend;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-14\">Heidi McLean, Dor\u2019s neighbor; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAN\">Stephanie McLean, Heidi McLean\u2019s sister.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b170-15\">Hardin ultimately identified that man as the defendant.

We agree also that the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance claim gains little support from defense counsel\u2019s failure to make use of information that police located a nine millimeter bullet in Dor\u2019s apartment. The defendant argues that this information would have shown, contrary to Dor\u2019s testimony, that Dor was familiar with weapons. Apart from serious questions about the admissibility of this information, however, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>463 Mass. 116, 122 (2012), we are not convinced that an effective attorney would have sought to introduce it in evidence. The defendant has not disputed the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion, supported by an affidavit of a firearms examiner introduced below, that a nine millimeter firearm could not fire .380 automatic caliber bullets such as those that left the casings found at the scene of the shooting. Evidence that Dor had access to a nine millimeter firearm might have harmed the defense, therefore, by suggesting that, if Dor had been the culprit, he would not have used .380 automatic caliber bullets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b182-8\">If Howard Jewell\u2019s and Hardin\u2019s identifications were excluded, the remaining identification evidence by strangers to Dor and the defendant would have been the testimony of Berube, which pointed to Dor as well, and that of Jones, who described only the shooter\u2019s hairstyle and the vehicle to which he ran (which, as described by Jones, resembled the defendant\u2019s vehicle but was not identical to it).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Counsel\u2019s failure to challenge these identifications apparently resulted from a combination of his inadequate trial preparation and his policy against motion practice. The photographic arrays administered to Hardin and Jewell were included in the Commonwealth\u2019s discovery, as was the fact that Hardin saw a photograph of the defendant in a newspaper. The fact of Jewell\u2019s encounter(s) with the defendant after participating in a photographic array was not revealed in the Commonwealth\u2019s discovery, although it may have been disclosed orally sometime before trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b183-8\">See note 14, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b184-7\">In the proceedings on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the Commonwealth submitted an affidavit of the trial prosecutor, who stated that neither he nor his co-counsel showed Jewell a photograph of the defendant. The motion judge did not hear oral testimony or make findings about this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. 533 (1990), is not to the contrary even though it, too, involved an unsuccessful pretrial photographic array. The array administered there did not include a photograph of the defendant; the in-court identification was not solicited by the prosecution, <em>id. </em>at 541-542; and that case predated <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>423 Mass. 99 (1996), in which we departed from the jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court by \u201creifying] on common-law principles of fairness to suppress an identification ... even where the circumstances did not result from improper police activity.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crayton, </em>470 Mass. 228, 235 (2014), comparing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, supra </em>at 109, with <em>Perry </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>132 S. Ct. 716, 720-721 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\"> As noted earlier, the rules announced in our recent decisions concerning certain eyewitness testimony are prospective only, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>470 Mass. 255, 265 (2014), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crayton, </em>470 Mass. at 241-242, and we do not apply them in considering whether trial counsel here rendered ineffective assistance. Nonetheless, we are not unmindful of the concerns that prompted those rules. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pring-Wilson, </em>448 Mass. 718, 736-737 (2007) (grant of new trial in light of concerns underlying subsequent prospective doctrine was not abuse of discretion); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>446 Mass. 155, 166-167 (2006), <em>S.C., </em>448 Mass. 621 (2007). In those recent decisions, we recognized that \u201c[t]he danger of unfairness arising from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>in-court showup ... is considerable\u201d where, among other circumstances, a pretrial identification procedure produced less than an unequivocal positive identification. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, supra </em>at 262. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crayton, supra </em>at 238-242. Given this, when discharging our duty under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and assessing whether, upon plenary review that takes into account the totality of the circumstances, relief may be warranted \u201cfor any ... reason that justice may require,\u201d <em>id., </em>we need not blind ourselves to the unfairness that may be created by in-court show-up identifications in certain circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
