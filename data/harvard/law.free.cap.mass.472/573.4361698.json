This commitment is embodied in the so-called Indigent Court Costs Law, G. L. c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 27A-27G (\u00a7\u00a7 27A-27G), which creates a mechanism for indigent persons to obtain waivers or reductions of court fees and other costs incurred during litigation. The statutory scheme defines \u201c[i]ndi-gent persons\u201d to include those with income below the poverty line; those who demonstrate that the payment of fees and costs would create a hardship; and those who receive \u201cpublic assistance\u201d under certain programs, including \u201cveterans\u2019 benefits programs.\u201d G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27A. The question presented in this appeal is whether a litigant such as the plaintiff, who receives Federal veterans\u2019 benefits and a Massachusetts property tax abatement that are not dependent on his economic circumstances, is considered indigent under \u00a7 27A and therefore entitled to a waiver despite having ample financial resources to pay court fees and costs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">We conclude that the statute was not intended to provide for a waiver under these circumstances. The history of the statute reveals an unbroken chain of legislative intent to limit the definition of indigent to persons whose limited financial resources prevent them from obtaining meaningful access to the Commonwealth\u2019s courts. In light of the statute\u2019s history and purpose, we interpret the phrase \u201cpublic assistance under... veterans\u2019 benefits programs\u201d as referring only to the Massachusetts need-based programs for veterans presently administered pursuant to G. L. c. 115, \u00a7 5. Because the plaintiff does not participate in such a program, his request for a waiver of fees and costs was properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>denied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The plaintiff, William Reade, is a retired lieutenant colonel of the United States Army Reserve and a resident of Massachusetts. In 1978, the Federal Veterans\u2019 Administration determined that Reade suffered a ten per cent disability as a result of an injury to his left shoulder and elbow incurred in connection with his military service. As a result of his injury, Reade receives a monthly disability payment pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1110, 1114 (2012), as well as a partial property tax abatement pursuant to a Massachusetts program for resident disabled veterans, see G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Twenty-second. His eligibility for the disability payments and property tax abatement is not dependent on his income or resource levels.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In 2013, Reade commenced an action in the Superior Court, alleging various constitutional violations with respect to the presidential ballot. Along with his civil complaint, Reade filed an affidavit of indigency pursuant to \u00a7 27B,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in which he requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>a waiver of normal court fees and litigation costs,* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as well as extra fees and costs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As grounds, Reade indicated in his affidavit that his income was at or below the poverty threshold for indigency.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27A (\u201cIndigent\u201d definition [b]). Reade also filed a letter in which he detailed his various sources of income.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>A clerk referred the affidavit to a judge because Reade\u2019s stated income suggested that he was not indigent and because Reade requested a waiver of extra fees and costs, which may be approved only by a judge. See G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27C (3). After holding a hearing, the judge denied the waiver on the ground that Reade\u2019s income exceeded the poverty threshold for indigency. A single justice of the Appeals Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Reade then filed a second affidavit of indigency, again requesting a waiver of both normal and extra fees and costs. This time, however, Reade claimed indigency on the ground that he was unable to pay the fees and costs without depriving himself or his dependents of the necessities of life. See G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27A (\u201cIndigent\u201d definition [c]). He also submitted the required supplement to the affidavit in which he detailed his assets, income, and expenses.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A clerk referred the affidavit to the same judge, again because of Reade\u2019s stated income and the request for extra fees and costs. The judge held a new hearing and, on the basis of Reade\u2019s available assets, determined that he was not indigent and again denied the waiver. A single justice of the Appeals Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Undeterred, Reade filed a third affidavit of indigency seeking a waiver of normal and extra fees, claiming indigency on the ground that he received public assistance in the form of veterans\u2019 benefits. See G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27A (\u201cIndigent\u201d definition [a]). Reade included documents demonstrating his receipt of the property tax abatement for Massachusetts veterans and the monthly disability payments from the Veterans\u2019 Administration. A clerk again referred the affidavit to the same judge, this time for the additional reason that the affidavit was not \u201cregular and complete on its face.\u201d The judge held another hearing and, after reviewing all three affidavits, concluded that Reade was not indigent because he had the ability to pay the normal and extra fees and costs. A single justice of the Appeals Court granted Reade leave to file an interlocutory appeal, observing that whether a judge has authority to deny indigency status to a person receiving \u201cveteran\u2019s benefits\u201d was a question with \u201cbroad policy ramifications for the administration of justice.\u201d Reade filed the appeal, the Appeals Court allowed the Office of Court Management of the Trial Court to intervene, and we transferred the case to this court on our own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The Indigent Court Costs Law entitles an indigent person to a waiver or reduction of certain fees and costs incurred during litigation. G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27C. Under \u00a7 27A, first definition, a person is \u201cindigent\u201d if, inter alia, he or she receives \u201creceives public assistance under . . . veterans\u2019 benefits programs.\u201d Reade argues that because he receives Federal disability payments and the Massachusetts property tax abatement for veterans, the plain language of the statute compels the conclusion that he is indigent and therefore entitled to a waiver. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">\u201c[I]t is a well-established canon of statutory construction that a strictly literal reading of a statute should not be adopted if the result will be to thwart or hamper the accomplishment of the statute\u2019s obvious purpose, and if another construction which would avoid this undesirable result is possible.\u201d <em>Watros </em>v. <em>Greater Lynn Mental Health &amp; Retardation </em>Ass\u2019n, 421 Mass. 106, 113 (1995). \u201cThe legislative intent in enacting a statute is to be gathered from a consideration of the words in which it is couched, giving to them their ordinary meaning unless there is something in the statute indicating that they should have a different significance; the subject matter of the statute; the preexisting state of the common and statutory law; the evil or mischief toward which the statute was apparently directed; and the main object sought to be accomplished by the enactment.\u201d <em>Meunier\u2019s Case, </em>319 Mass. 421, 423 (1946). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>De\u2019Amicis, </em>450 Mass. 271, 273-274 (2007) (interpreting indigent court costs statute in light of purpose and history). See also <em>Edwards, petitioner, </em>464 Mass. 454, 461 (2013) (same); <em>Underwood </em>v. <em>Appeals Court, </em>427 Mass. 1012, 1013 (1998) (same). With these principles in mind, we turn to the legislative history of the statute with an aim toward gleaning the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The seeds for the Indigent Court Costs Law were planted in 1970 by the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, Inc. (MLRI), a nonprofit legal advocacy group dedicated to promoting systemic legal changes that benefit the poor. Rodgers, Rap-ups of a Retired Reformer: Stories About How Legal Services Advocates Transformed the Laws for Poor People in Massachusetts 81 (2013). MLRI\u2019s efforts were focused on increasing access to the courts for poor people who could not afford to pay filing fees and other litigation costs. <em>Id. </em>These efforts eventually blossomed into 1974 Senate Doc. No. 1099, An Act to relieve indigent litigants of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>burdensome court costs in civil and criminal proceedings. See Rodgers, <em>supra. </em>The proposed bill defined a litigant as \u201c[i]ndi-gent\u201d where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">\u201c(1) he receives any federal, state or local public assistance, including medical assistance or any rental subsidy, or (2) his net income does not exceed the limits set out in [\u00a7 27E], or (3) he is otherwise indigent because wholly unable to pay the expected total of the fees and costs of the proceeding in which he is involved, or is unable to do so without depriving himself or his dependents of the necessities of life, including shelter, food and clothing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">1974 Senate Doc. No. 1099, \u00a7 2. The legislative purpose statement included in the bill made clear that the legislation was focused on providing aid to the poor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">\u201cThe General Court hereby finds and declares that many litigants in both civil and criminal cases are unable to secure due process of law and equal protection of the laws in the courts of Massachusetts by reason of being too poor to afford the fees and costs (not including attorneys fees) incident to such litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">\u201cTherefore, the purpose of this act is to provide for the absorption, payment or obviation of such fees and costs, initially by the counties and ultimately by the Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">\u201cThis Act shall be given a liberal construction to the end that its broad and humane purposes may be served.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">1974 Senate Doc. No. 1099, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">The Senate bill was ultimately superseded by 1974 House Doc. No. 5859, which trimmed the definition of indigent to a person who \u201cis unable to pay the fees and costs of the proceedings in which he is involved, or is unable to do so without depriving himself or his dependents of the necessities of life, including food, shelter and clothing,\u201d making it even clearer that the statute was intended to provide waivers only to litigants who could truly not afford to pay litigation costs. Under this version of the statute, which was enacted into law by St. 1974, c. 694, \u00a7 3, Reade would not have qualified as indigent.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">The Senate\u2019s version was resurrected in the 1980 amendments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>to \u00a7 27A,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which changed the definition of \u201c[ijndigent\u201d to a person who:</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">\u201c(a) . . . receives public assistance under the Massachusetts Aid to Families with Dependent Children, General Relief or Veteran\u2019s Benefits programs or receives assistance under Title XVI of the Social Security Act or the Medicaid program, 42 U.S.C. 1396, <em>et seq.\\</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">\u201c(b) [has] income, after taxes,... [125] per cent or less of the current poverty threshold annually established by the Community Services Administration pursuant to [\u00a7 625] of the Economic Opportunity Act, as amended; or</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">\u201c(c) ... is unable to pay the fees and costs of the proceeding in which he is involved, or is unable to do so without depriving himself or his dependents of the necessities of life, including food, shelter and clothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">St. 1980, c. 539, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Reade\u2019s position is that the 1980 amendments reflected an intention by the Legislature to broaden the definition of indigent to include a person who receives any type of veterans\u2019 benefit, regardless of the origin of or reason for that benefit. This position is not sustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The 1980 definitional changes may be best understood in the context of the amendments as a whole, particularly in tandem with the changes made to \u00a7 27C. Prior to 1980, relief from court fees and costs had to be approved by a judge. The 1980 amendments to \u00a7 27C altered this practice by directing the clerk to grant relief \u201cforthwith\u201d where a litigant files an affidavit that \u201cappears regular and complete on its face and indicates that the affiant is indigent, as defined in [\u00a7 27A], and requests a waiver, substitution or payment by the commonwealth, of normal fees and costs.\u201d St. 1980, c. 539, \u00a7 7. Empowering the clerk to grant relief clearly was intended to expedite the waiver process in cases involving routine costs and expenses. Without the definitional changes to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\u00a7 27A, the clerk still would have been required to engage in the cumbersome process of determining whether the payment of fees and costs would deprive a litigant of the \u201cnecessities of life.\u201d The definitional changes circumvented unnecessary delays by capitalizing on preexisting systemic determinations of financial need in the form of income-poverty guidelines and means-tested public assistance programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The first definition of indigent set out in the 1980 statute created two distinct categories of benefits: \u201cpublic assistance\u201d under three listed programs, and \u201cassistance\u201d under two other listed programs. St. 1980, c. 539, \u00a7 5. This structure is significant, as \u201c[w]ords grouped together in a statute must be read in harmony, and we are not free to interpret [one provision] in a way that makes it exceptionally broader than its neighbors.\u201d <em>Franklin Office Park Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Protection, </em>466 Mass. 454, 462 (2013). The first category began with the word \u201cMassachusetts,\u201d followed by three programs corresponding to statutes located in the Public Welfare section of the General Laws: G. L. c. 115 (veterans\u2019 benefits); G. L. c. 117, repealed by St. 1991, c. 255, \u00a7 3 (general relief); and G. L. c. 118 (aid to families with dependent children). Importantly, each of the three statutes \u2014 consistent with the original intent of \u00a7 27A \u2014 premised the receipt of public assistance on financial need.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That the Legislature was referring to those specific statutes in \u00a7 27A is reinforced by other instances in which the Legislature has referenced them in concert. See, e.g., An Act providing cost-of-living adjustments for recipients of aid to families with dependent children, general relief and veterans\u2019 benefits, St. 1974, c. 623 (amending G. L. cc. 115, 117, and 118).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Further, with respect to the second category, the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>included only Federal programs and referred to those programs specifically by statute. Had the Legislature intended to premise qualification for indigency under \u00a7 27A on the receipt of Federal veterans\u2019 benefits, we infer that it would have done so in a manner consistent with its treatment of other Federal programs in the same section of the statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>462 Mass. 676, 681 (2012), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fall River Motor Sales, Inc., </em>409 Mass. 302, 316 (1991) (\u201cStatutes should be read \u2018as a whole to produce an internal consistency\u2019 \u201d). It is also telling that both of the Federal statutes referred to in the amended version of \u00a7 27A \u2014 like the aforementioned Massachusetts statutes \u2014 made the receipt of benefits contingent on financial need,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> suggesting a continuation of legislative intent to restrict the meaning of \u201cindigent\u201d to persons with limited financial resources.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> St. 1980, c. 539, \u00a7 5. In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the 1980 amendment tying indigency to the receipt of \u201cVeteran\u2019s Benefits\u201d was intended to encompass only the receipt of Massachusetts need-based veterans\u2019 benefits under G. L. c. 115, \u00a7 5. St. 1980, c. 539, \u00a7 5. Because Reade did not receive such benefits, he would not have qualified as indigent under the 1980 version of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The next relevant modification to the statute occurred in 2000 in connection with a bill introduced pursuant to G. L. c. 3, \u00a7 53 (\u00a7 53). Section 53 allows counsel to the Senate and House of Representatives, see G. L. c. 3, \u00a7 51, to make recommendations for the \u201crepeal of such statutory provisions as have become obsolete or the reasons for the enactment of which have ceased to exist,\u201d \u201crejection of superfluous words, [and] condensation of all circuitous, tautological and ambiguous phraseology into as concise and comprehensive a form as is consistent with the full and clear expression of the will of the general court.\u201d In other words, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>linguistic changes made pursuant to \u00a7 53 are generally of a technical, rather than substantive, character. The changes made to \u00a7 27A in 2000 are no exception. See St. 2000, c. 313, \u00a7 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The 2000 bill, entitled, \u201cAn Act making certain corrective changes in certain general and special laws,\u201d suggested several linguistic changes to \u00a7 27A, including the removal of the word \u201cMassachusetts.\u201d See 2000 Senate Doc. No. 2212. The word \u201cMassachusetts\u201d was likely omitted because it was superfluous. As observed above, where the Legislature referred to a non-Massachusetts program in \u00a7 27A, it did so explicitly by including a statutory citation. The omission of such a citation when referring to the other programs sufficed to indicate their Massachusetts origins. See G. L. c. 3, \u00a7 53. See generally <em>Hartford Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>410 Mass. 279, 283 (1991) (\u201cAs a general rule, when the Legislature has employed specific language in one part of a statute, but not in another part which deals with the same topic, the earlier language should not be implied where it is not present\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Other modifications to \u00a7 27A were prompted by inaccuracies in the existing program descriptions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The final language choices in \u00a7 27A reflect an intention to conform the text to the language of the specific statutes referenced therein, which is consistent with the technical nature of the modifications contemplated by \u00a7 53. <em>See, Arthur A. Johnson Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>306 Mass. 347, 353 (1940), quoting <em>Main </em>v. <em>Plymouth County, </em>223 Mass. 66, 69 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>(1916) (\u201cIt is a familiar principle of statutory construction that mere verbal changes in the revision of a statute do not alter its meaning and are construed as a continuation of the previous law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">At oral argument, Reade pointed out the Commonwealth has a long tradition of providing preferential treatment to veterans. That is undoubtedly true, and where the Legislature has indicated such an intention, we have not hesitated to recognize the legitimacy of the public interest at stake. See, e.g., G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 26 (affording gradations of civil service priority based on veteran and disabled veteran status); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Director of Civil Serv., </em>324 Mass. 455, 461 (1949) (\u201cit is open to the Legislature to say that, whereas all veterans may be preferred because of their service in uniform, the public interest is served by additionally preferring those who have incurred disability in the course of their service\u201d). However, the Indigent Court Costs Law did not originate as a veterans\u2019 preference law and, as the foregoing legislative history demonstrates, the \u201cprinciple embodied in the statute,\u201d as it stands today, remains \u201cequal justice under the law: an indigent party should have the financial resources necessary to mount as effective a case as a party who is not indigent.\u201d <em>Edwards, petitioner, </em>464 Mass. at 461. Reade\u2019s argument, that the receipt of <em>any </em>veterans\u2019 benefits renders a litigant indigent, is incompatible with this principle because it would allow waivers for individuals who already have ample financial resources to afford court fees and other litigation costs. See <em>Underwood, </em>427 Mass. at 1013. We decline to construe \u00a7 27A in a manner that is plainly inconsistent with its central purpose, notwithstanding the susceptibility of the statute\u2019s plain language to such a construction. See <em>Watros, </em>421 Mass. at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Rather, we continue to read \u00a7 27A, \u201cIndigent\u201d definition (a), as referring to the five specific, need-based public assistance programs \u2014 three of which derive from Massachusetts law and two which derive from Federal law \u2014 that are listed on the form affidavit of indigency prescribed by the Chief Justice of this court pursuant to \u00a7 27B. This includes the \u201cMassachusetts Veterans Benefits\u201d program, which is presently codified at G. L. c. 115, \u00a7 5. Accordingly, Reade\u2019s receipt of Federal disability payments and the Massachusetts property tax abatement for veterans, neither of which is contingent on financial need, did not render him a \u201cperson who receives public assistance under . . . veterans\u2019 benefits programs\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 27A (\u201cIndigent\u201d definition [a]). Therefore, Reade is not indigent and his request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>for a waiver of fees and costs was properly denied by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The question remains, however, whether Reade\u2019s third request for a waiver of normal fees and costs even should have been referred to a judge. Reade contends that the clerk was required to grant the request forthwith, without further inspection of the circumstances, because his affidavit (i) was regular and complete on its face; (ii) indicated that he was indigent by virtue of his selection of \u201cMassachusetts Veterans Benefits\u201d on the form affidavit; and (iii) requested a waiver of normal fees and costs. We conclude that the clerk was correct to refer the affidavit to a judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The \u201cInstructions to Courts on the Administration of the Indigent Court Costs Law\u201d of this court direct the clerk to refer the affidavit to a judge where there is a \u201csignificant question about whether the applicant is indigent.\u201d Here, Reade did not simply select \u201cMassachusetts Veterans Benefits\u201d on the form affidavit. Rather, he attached a series of documents indicating that the Massachusetts benefit he was contemplating was a property tax abatement for disabled veterans, which, as discussed above, is not the benefit contemplated by the form. Thus, considered as a whole \u2014 i.e., the form affidavit along with the attachments \u2014 Reade\u2019s affidavit created ambiguity as to whether he received veterans benefits within the meaning of the first definition of \u201cIndigent\u201d in \u00a7 27A.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Moreover, the clerk was entitled to consider Reade\u2019s past affidavits pursuant to <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Rosencratz, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 903 (2007) (\u201cprevious court filings by the plaintiff for payment of entry fees and costs, in which she had represented that she had significant assets . . . justified further consideration by the clerk and referral to a judge\u201d). Those affidavits reflected considerable income and assets, casting additional doubt on Reade\u2019s claim that he received the need-based benefits afforded by the Massachusetts Veterans\u2019 Benefits program, G.

In view of these significant questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>about Reade\u2019s receipt of veterans\u2019 benefits, we cannot say that the clerk erred in referring the matter to the judge.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth herein, we conclude that the \u201cveterans\u2019 benefits\u201d program described in the first definition of \u201c[ijndigent\u201d under G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27A, refers to the need-based Massachusetts veterans\u2019 benefits program presently administered pursuant to G. L. c. 115, \u00a7 5. Reade does not receive such benefits and therefore he is not indigent on that ground. Consequently, we affirm the judge\u2019s decision denying Reade\u2019s request for a waiver of normal and extra court fees and litigation costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-6\">By order of this court, all information submitted in an affidavit of indigency is confidential unless otherwise stated in a specific court order.

L. c. 261, \u00a7 27A (\u201cIndigent\u201d definition [a]). Whether he actually received such assistance is a matter of considerable doubt, however, given his stated income and resource levels. See <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Rosencratz, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 901 (2007) (\u201cneither the statute nor the [Instructions to Courts on the Administration of the Indigency Court Costs Law (Indigency Instructions)] requires the clerk or the judge to ignore other court filings by the plaintiff that raise \u2018significant question[s]\u2019 regarding the indigency of the plaintiff\u201d). See also 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1205 (2014) (Supplemental Security Income resource limit for individual with spouse is $3,000). In any event, Reade does not make this argument on appeal, and we consider it waived. See <em>Merriam </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>464 Mass. 721, 722 n.7 (2013); Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). If Reade does, in fact, receive Supplemental Security Income, he is free to file a new affidavit so reflecting. See G.

No. 1099, which, in light of the legislative purpose statement, cannot be interpreted reasonably as applying to anything other than needs-based benefits. An important difference between those two versions, however, was in the language of the first definition of indigent, which in the 1974 version applied broadly to a person receiving \u201cany federal, state or local public assistance.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 2. In contrast, the 1980 version listed five specific public assistance programs.

See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Dana, 2 Met. 329, 339 (1841) (\u201cOne of the objects of the revision of our laws was to condense them by change of phraseology, and the rejection of all superfluous words, which has been frequently done, where there is evidently no change of meaning by the change of language or the omission of the superfluous parts of the former statutes\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\">For example, the term \u201cVeterans\u2019 Benefits,\u201d as it is spelled in G. L. c. 115, previously had been spelled incorrectly as \u201cVeteran\u2019s Benefits.\u201d The initial draft of the bill contained an oversight, however, insofar as it retained the reference to the obsolete general relief statute, G. L. c. 117, which had been superseded by G. L. c. 117A. See. St. 1991, c. 255, \u00a7 4. Correspondence from the Department of Transitional Assistance (department) while the \u201cdraft technical correction bill\u201d was still in committee pointed out that \u201cthe statutory definition presently, and as amended, incorrectly cites two department programs.\u201d The DTA then suggested that the term \u201cGeneral Relief\u2019 be replaced with \u201cEmergency Aid to the Elderly, Disabled and Children.\u201d This suggestion was partially adopted by way of a handwritten modification to the bill, replacing the term \u201cGeneral Relief\u2019 with \u201cprogram of emergency aid for elderly and disabled residents,\u201d which is the language used in G. L. c. 117A, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Nonetheless, we reject the argument of the Office of Court Management of the Trial Court that Reade\u2019s affidavit was \u201cirregular\u201d on its face because it contained an excessive estimate of his costs. The form affidavit instructs the applicant to \u201cindicate your best guess as to the cost, if known.\u201d The Indigency Instructions recognize that \u201c[mjost applicants will not know the actual costs of many of these services. Therefore, courts should approve otherwise appropriate applications for waiver or [Sjtate payment and insert in the approval the actual or estimated amount of the fee or service, as it is known to the court.\u201d In other words, where the only defect in a qualifying affidavit is an incorrect estimation of normal fees and costs, the clerk should approve the request at the correct amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Section 27C (3) also directs the clerk to refer the affidavit to a judge where the applicant requests not only normal fees and costs, but also extra fees and costs. This was, therefore, another ground on which Reade\u2019s affidavit was properly referred to the judge. The intervener goes one step further, however, by arguing that even if Reade had received veterans\u2019 benefits within the meaning of \u00a7 27A (\u201cIndigent\u201d definition [a]), once the affidavit was before the judge on the request for extra fees and costs, the judge had discretion under \u00a7 27C (3) to deny indigency status based on Reade\u2019s economic circumstances. Although the judge in this case appears to have agreed, we do not. If Reade had, in fact, received Massachusetts veterans\u2019 benefits within the meaning of the first definition of \u201c[ijndigent\u201d under \u00a7 27A, he would be indigent and entitled to relief. See G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27C (4) (\u201cIf the court makes a finding of indigency, it shall not deny any request with respect to normal fees and costs . . .\u201d). Under those circumstances, the judge\u2019s discretion would be limited to assessing Reade a reasonable partial payment as a substitute for the waiver. See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 27C (6). See also <em>Underwood </em>v. <em>Appeals </em>Court, 427 Mass. 1013, 1013 (1998) (\u201cRequiring litigants to pay a reasonably reduced filing fee, set within their limited financial means, serves the important dual purpose of providing equal access to the courts while simultaneously screening out frivolous claims\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
