Sherman appealed, and after an eviden-tiary hearing, a Division of Administrative Law Appeals (DALA) magistrate recommended that Sherman\u2019s appeal be dismissed. The Civil Service Commission (commission) adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings and recommendation, and dismissed the appeal, concluding that there was \u201cindependent and reasonable justification\u201d to bypass Sherman, although noting serious flaws in the town\u2019s interview process. Sherman sought review of the commission\u2019s decision in the Superior Court. A Superior Court judge denied Sherman\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and his motion for reconsideration, and judgment entered for the commission. Sherman appealed, and we allowed his petition for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Sherman argues that his bypass was impermissible because the personnel administrator of the Commonwealth (administrator)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> improperly delegated to the appointing authority its duty under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27, to \u201creceive\u201d statements of reasons for bypasses. He argues also that the town\u2019s decision to bypass him in favor of candidates with lower scores on the civil service examination was not supported by a reasonable justification because the commission determined that the town\u2019s interview process was \u201cfatally flawed.\u201d In <em>Malloch </em>v. <em>Hanover, </em>472 Mass. 783, 795 (2015), we determined that the administrator permissibly may delegate to an appointing authority its duty under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27, in light of the broad authority to delegate provided by G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 5 (/). Sherman\u2019s contention that the administrator could not delegate its authority to the town thus is unavailing. We address Sherman\u2019s alternative argument that the town\u2019s bypass was not supported by reasonable justification. We agree that the town\u2019s procedure for selecting candidates was seriously flawed. With this in mind, we have conducted an extensive review of the record to determine whether the flawed procedure indicated that the town\u2019s bypass was motivated by reasons incompatible with \u201cbasic merit principles.\u201d See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 1 (defining term). We conclude that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>this case, the record did not support the concern that the flawed procedure reflected a departure from basic merit principles, and that there is substantial evidence to support a reasonable justification for the town\u2019s bypass. Therefore, we affirm the Superior Court\u2019s denial of Sherman\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\"><em>Background. </em>1. <em>Civil service statute. </em>Police officer positions within the Commonwealth are subject to civil service law, both for initial appointments and for promotions. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 58. See generally Note, The Massachusetts Civil Service Law: Is It Necessary to Destroy the Current System in Order to Save It?, 40 New Eng. L. Rev. 1103, 1106 (2006). Applicants for a civil service position must take an objective examination developed by the human resources division (HRD), specifically designed for that particular type of position. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 16. The goal of the examination requirement is to ensure that employees are appointed or promoted on the basis of their abilities, knowledge, and skills \u2014 in other words, on the basis of merit \u2014 and are not selected arbitrarily or for improper reasons, such as political or personal connections. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">To achieve this goal, when an appointing authority notifies HRD of an open position, HRD certifies a list of eligible candidates for the position, and ranks the names on the list in order of the scores the candidates received on the relevant HRD examination, with the inclusion of veterans\u2019 preferences. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 25-26. Candidates at the top of the list, however, may be bypassed if the appointing authority chooses a candidate lower on the eligibility list based on reasonable justification. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27. If an appointing authority bypasses a higher-ranked candidate, it must submit to the administrator a written statement of the reasons for the bypass, and the appointment \u201cshall be effective only when such statement of reasons has been received by the administrator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The administrator, however, may permissibly delegate to an appointing authority its duty to receive the appointing authority\u2019s statement of reasons. See <em>Malloch, 472 </em>Mass. at 795. Candidates may challenge an appointing authority\u2019s decision to bypass them by appeal to the commission. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">2. <em>Facts. </em>The commission adopted all of the DALA magistrate\u2019s findings of fact. We recite the facts as found by the magistrate, supplemented with facts that have a substantial basis in the record and are consistent with the magistrate\u2019s findings. We reserve some facts for later discussion of specific issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>In June, 2010, the town decided to appoint three permanent, full-time police sergeants and to promote them from within the Randolph police department (department). HRD had certified nine candidates for the position of police sergeant in April, 2010, based on a previously administered promotional examination. Four of those candidates are relevant here: Sherman, who was ranked highest on the eligibility list, and the three candidates who ultimately bypassed him, whom we shall call Walter Burton, Blair Lewis, and Martin Duval.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The candidates had the following certification scores: Sherman (91), Burton (90), Lewis (82), and Duval (81). On June 17, 2010, the town notified the nine candidates of their certification, asking them to indicate whether they would accept a promotion. Sherman, Burton, Lewis, and Duval agreed to accept, and each was informed that he would be interviewed on June 25, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The department\u2019s outgoing chief of police, Paul Porter, established an interview panel to evaluate the candidates. The panel consisted of Porter, Sergeant William Pace (Porter\u2019s successor, who became chief of police when Porter retired on July 2, 2010, one week after the interview), Lieutenant John Hamelburg, and Officer Jeff Chaplin. The panel interviewed the nine candidates on June 25, 2010, each for approximately thirty minutes. Each candidate was allowed a brief opening statement and a closing statement. The panel asked each candidate the same eight questions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The panelists were directed to score candidates \u201con the totality of their interview performance,\u201d on a scale of zero to five, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>with five being the highest. Each panelist was allotted fifteen points and, as the magistrate found, was supposed to assign a five to the top candidate, a four to the second-ranked candidate, and so forth, with the fifth-ranked candidate being assigned a one, and the four bottom-ranked candidates to receive zeroes.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6After all the candidates had been interviewed, the panelists voted by a show of hands for each candidate. Because the panel\u2019s scores were not written down, the magistrate reconstructed the scores based on testimony at the hearing. The final scores were as follows: Lewis (19), Burton (14), Duval (13), and Sherman (4).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Following the interviews, both Porter and Pace spoke with Lieutenant Detective Arthur Sullivan, the commanding officer of the detectives (who supervised Sherman\u2019s supervisors), and learned that Sherman \u201chad difficulty following through on cases\u201d and \u201cneeded supervision.\u201d Sherman\u2019s supervisor on the day shift, Detective Sergeant David Avery, told Sullivan that Sherman had had \u201csome issues with timely reports being done, timely charges being taken out on individuals and/or arrests being produced in a timely manner.\u201d While Sherman had addressed those issues, he had ongoing issues with incomplete \u201clog items.\u201d Sherman\u2019s supervisor on the night shift, Detective Sergeant Anthony Marag, reported that Sherman had difficulty following through on cases,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, three or four times, had had to be reminded about \u201ctaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>those extra steps in an investigation.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Porter, with input from Pace, concluded that Burton, Lewis, and Duval should be promoted, basing this conclusion on the panel\u2019s interview scores; the candidates\u2019 conformance to Porter\u2019s \u201cpersonal and informal list of [ten] to [fifteen] factors\u201d concerning \u201ccommunity involvement and professionalism\u201d;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the candidates\u2019 past job performance \u201cas reported by commanding officers or supervisors.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Porter discussed this recommendation with the town manager, David Murphy, who was the appointing authority under the town charter. Murphy \u201cwanted to dig a little bit deeper,\u201d because such a promotion would involve a bypass of Sherman. He reviewed Sherman\u2019s personnel file, but \u201cnothing there made a strong impression on him\u201d \u2014 which, the magistrate found, was \u201cpossibly because the police department does not conduct annual performance reviews.\u201d Porter suggested that Murphy speak with Sullivan, and Murphy did so. Based on this conversation, Murphy testified, \u201cI think the feedback I got on . .. Sherman was that he\u2019s a good police officer, will be a good sergeant, but not yet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">On July 6, 2010, Pace wrote a letter to Murphy, recommending that Sherman not be promoted to sergeant. He wrote that several of Sherman\u2019s answers during the interview \u201cwere vague,\u201d and that in some areas Sherman \u201cdid not have a clear understanding of basic leadership qualities . . . such as leading by example and command presence.\u201d Pace also wrote that Sherman\u2019s supervisors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>had reported that Sherman had \u201cdifficulty in following through on cases and . . . needs supervision.\u201d On the same day, Pace wrote three very similar letters to Murphy recommending that Burton, Lewis, and Duval be promoted; all three letters stated that the reason for the promotion recommendation was the candidate\u2019s \u201cinterview and his overall work ethic and his solid command presence.\u201d The letters provided specific positive comments on the candidate\u2019s background and interview performance; cited the candidate\u2019s length of service in the department; and, in two instances, described the candidate\u2019s prior military service.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">On July 7, 2010, Murphy wrote to Sherman informing him that he had been bypassed, and explaining the reasons for the bypass. The letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-6\">\u201cThe reasons for your nonselection include the totality of the review process including the interview, review of your personnel files, and discussion with your immediate supervisor. Specifically the committee found that some of your answers were vague. You did not demonstrate a clear understanding of leadership qualities such as leading by example and command presence. Your supervisor noted that you had difficulty following through on cases and that you needed supervision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Murphy testified that he had based his decision primarily on Porter\u2019s recommendation and discussions with Porter, as well as his conversations with Sullivan and Pace.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">3. <em>Prior proceedings. </em>Sherman appealed the bypass, and following an evidentiary hearing, the DALA magistrate recommended that Sherman\u2019s appeal be dismissed, because, notwith<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>standing that the interview process had been flawed, and the evaluation of Sherman\u2019s job performance was \u201cpossibly flawed,\u201d the town had a reasonable justification for the bypass. The magistrate stated that the town\u2019s interview process \u201cwas not exactly a model to be followed,\u201d noting that the interviews were not recorded; that there was no \u201ccomplete and contemporaneous record of the interviewees\u2019 evaluations and scoring\u201d; and that the candidates\u2019 answers were not objectively determined to be right or wrong, or relatively better or worse compared to each other. The magistrate also noted the town\u2019s lack of an annual, written process of evaluating job performance as not \u201ca model to be followed,\u201d but concluded that the town had demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there were \u201csufficient reasons to justify [a] bypass\u201d despite an \u201coverly subjective\u201d interview process The magistrate observed that Sherman had \u201cat no time introduced any evidence, or even suggested, that the [tjown\u2019s decision to bypass him for promotion was politically motivated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">The commission adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings and recommendation, again noting that the interview process had been flawed. The commission stated, \u201c[W]e believe that the interview process was flawed and does not satisfy the standard we expect should be required to assure a properly reviewable \u2018level playing field\u2019 which \u2018protects] candidates from arbitrary action and undue subjectivity on the part of the interviewers,\u2019 which is the lynch-pin to the basic merit principle of the [cjivil [sjervice [ljaw\u201d (citation omitted). Nonetheless, the commission concluded that the \u201cindependent judgment of the [department\u2019s] senior commanders, including the former and current [pjolice [c]hief about [Sherman\u2019s] need to improve certain aspects of his job performance that would seem essential to the duties at a supervisory level, as well as the strong positive opinions about the ability of the selected candidates, provides sufficient independent and reasonable justification to bypass [Sherman] at this time.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The commission stated that \u201c[n]o substantial evidence appears to have been presented that these judgments were formed out of bias or other unlawful predisposition against [Sherman].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">After Sherman sought judicial review of the commission\u2019s decision, a Superior Court judge denied his motion for judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>on the pleadings and his motion for reconsideration, \u201cfind[ing] credible and substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the . . . commission\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Standard of review. </em>Judicial review of a final decision of the commission is governed by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. See <em>Police Dep\u2019t of Boston </em>v. <em>Kavaleski, </em>463 Mass. 680, 689 (2012) (Kavaleski). \u201cWe may set aside or modify the commission\u2019s decision if we conclude that \u2018the substantial rights of any party may have been prejudiced\u2019 by a decision that is based on an error of law, unsupported by substantial evidence, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We generally defer \u201cto the [commission] on questions of fact and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">It is the role of the commission to determine, \u201c \u2018on the basis of the evidence before it, whether the appointing authority [has] sustained its burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there was reasonable justification\u2019 for the decision to bypass the candidate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, quoting <em>Brackett </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>447 Mass. 233, 241 (2006). Reasonable justification \u201cmeans \u2018done upon adequate reasons sufficiently supported by credible evidence, when weighed by an unprejudiced mind, guided by common sense and by correct rules of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kavaleski, supra, </em>quoting <em>Brackett </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, supra. </em>\u201c[T]he commission owes substantial deference to the appointing authority\u2019s exercise of judgment in determining whether there was \u2018reasonable justification,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cdeference is especially appropriate with respect to the hiring of police officers.\u201d <em>Beverly </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 182, 188 (2010). Nonetheless, in determining whether an appointing authority\u2019s decision to bypass is justified, the commission\u2019s \u201cprimary concern is to ensure that the [appointing authority\u2019s] action comports with \u2018[b]asic merit principles,\u2019 as defined in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 l.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Kavaleski, </em>463 Mass. at 688. \u201c[T]he commission must focus on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>fundamental purposes of the civil service system \u2014 to guard against political considerations, favoritism, and bias in governmental employment decisions, including, of course, promotions, and to protect efficient public employees from political control.\u201d <em>Cambridge </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 300, 304 (1997). The commission must \u201cproperly place[ ] the burden on the [appointing authority] to establish a reasonable justification for the bypass[ ] . . . and properly weigh[ ] those justifications against the fundamental purpose of the civil service system... to ensure decision-making in accordance with basic merit principles\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Minority Law Enforcement Officers </em>v. <em>Abban, </em>434 Mass. 256, 264 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">2. <em>Reasonable justification. </em>Relying on the commission\u2019s comments regarding the town\u2019s \u201cflawed\u201d interview process, Sherman contends that there was no reasonable justification for the town\u2019s decision to bypass him. Specifically, Sherman argues that the bypass was not reasonably justified because it was substantially based on a \u201ctotally subjective\u201d interview process that was \u201cnot authorized by the [administrator]\u201d and \u201camounted to an attempt to circumvent the results of the [c]ivil [s]ervice examination.\u201d While we agree that the town\u2019s interview process was flawed, we do not agree that, as a result, the bypass was not reasonably justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">An appointing authority may conduct oral interviews of candidates who have been certified to it from the eligible appointment list. See <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 206, 208 (1983). While such interviews inevitably have a subjective component, they should be \u201cstructured in an attempt to protect candidates from arbitrary action and undue subjectivity on the part of the interviews.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We agree with the commission that the interviews conducted by the town failed to live up to that standard. The interviewers did not agree in advance on criteria for scoring the candidates\u2019 interview performance but, rather, scored the candidates on the \u201ctotality\u201d of their performance. The record also reflects a number of other irregularities in the town\u2019s proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>dure.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">We recognize that procedural flaws conducive to subjective or arbitrary decision-making could be a \u201cred flag\u201d signaling that a bypass decision resulting from the flawed procedures was motivated by political considerations, favoritism, or bias. See <em>Riffelmacher </em>v. <em>Board of Police Comm\u2019rs of Springfield, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 159, 164-165 (1989), quoting <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>457 F.2d 348, 358-359 (5th Cir. 1972) (\u201copen-ended and uncontrolled\u201d interview procedure is \u201cready mechanism for discrimination\u201d). Here, the commission considered this risk and found no evidence to support it. Nor does Sherman suggest that his bypass was based on an unlawful motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Nevertheless, because a flawed selection procedure raises the possibility of unlawful decision-making by the appointing authority, any decision arising from a flawed procedure warrants careful scrutiny by a reviewing court. We therefore have examined the entire administrative record to determine whether there is evidence that the town\u2019s bypass was motivated by an improper reason. See <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Minority Law Enforcement Officers </em>v. <em>Abban, </em>434 Mass. at 264-265 (examining \u201cthe entire administrative record . . . and tak[ing] into account whatever in the record would fairly detract from the supporting evidence\u2019s weight\u201d [citation omitted]). Although the record includes evidence that gives us pause,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we are satisfied that the commission\u2019s conclusion that Sherman\u2019s bypass was not motivated by an improper reason was supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>A promotional decision may be reasonably justified on the merits, even where the appointing authority uses flawed procedures for selecting candidates, in the following limited circumstance: where the appointing authority had a reasonable justification on the merits for deciding to bypass a candidate, and the flaws in the selection process are not so severe that it is impossible to evaluate the merits from the record. In such a case, the candidate\u2019s bypass appeal should be denied despite the presence of procedural flaws, because the appointing authority comported with \u201cthe fundamental purpose of the civil service system,... to ensure decision-making in accordance with basic merit principles.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Here, the town\u2019s decision to bypass Sherman is supported in part by the over-all low score the interview panel awarded Sherman relative to the promoted candidates. It is supported also by Pace\u2019s postinterview letters to Murphy, articulating reasons why the candidates\u2019 interview performances warranted the bypass. This would be a much closer case, however, if the candidates\u2019 interview performances were the only justification offered for the bypass decision. Aside from the interviews, there is, as the commission noted, reasonable justification for the bypass based on the evaluation of Sherman\u2019s past job performance by his superiors. The magistrate found that Sherman\u2019s supervisors had raised concerns that he had difficulty in following through on case investigations and needed supervision \u2014 concerns that were communicated to Porter and Murphy by Sullivan. Part of the job of a police sergeant is to ensure that those under his or her command follow through on the work needed to complete police investigations, and Sherman\u2019s failure to do so with his own cases is certainly reasonable justification to bypass him for promotion to that position.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The bypass therefore was properly affirmed by the commission because, despite the flawed selection process, the town was rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>sonably justified in deciding that Sherman was not yet ready to assume the duties of a police sergeant \u2014 a decision to which the commission appropriately showed deference. See <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 206, 208-211 (1983) (upholding bypasses against challenges to interview and scoring procedures used in selection process because there was \u201cno evidence to show that the appointing authority was motivated by anything other than merit or that its actions were . . . designed to conceal improper reasons\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b821-7\">The administrator is the personnel administrator of the human resources division (HRD) of the Commonwealth, within the Executive Office for Administration and Finance.

Detective Sergeant Anthony Marag testified that he had had to speak to Sherman three or four times about additional steps that needed to be taken in an investigation, and that, although Sherman improved immediately afterwards, the improvement was not sustained. Porter was familiar with one week where Sherman was \u201cin the office . . . almost every day . . . getting caught up on a multitude of reports.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b825-8\">The factors included \u201cleadership by example, which [Porter] considered the most important factor . . . ; civil service examination score; departmental seniority; experience; ranks and positions held; arrest and citation statistics; education; military background; \u2018discipline issues\u2019 (which [the magistrate understood] to mean the applicant\u2019s record of discipline); \u2018sick leave\u2019; command presence; community policing philosophy; dedication to and involvement in the community; and dedication and loyalty to the police department.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b825-9\">Porter testified that he used the interview panel\u2019s scores only as a general indication of who the panel members thought were the top five candidates, and that he himself independently had ranked the candidates according to his own criteria, \u201cpicking] who [he] thought were ... the top three\u201d candidates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b826-9\">Regarding the interviews, Pace wrote that Burton \u201cdemonstrated an excellent understanding ... of the use of progressive discipline in the supervision of police personnel and . . . exhibited a truly unique understanding of the use of mentoring and counseling in the role of police sergeant,\u201d and that he \u201cwas able to cite specific examples of how he has led during times when a police supervisor was not immediately available.\u201d Lewis displayed \u201cexcellent knowledge surrounding use of force issues and the role of the police sergeant as trainer on a continuing and daily basis,\u201d and \u201cimpressed the panel with some innovative and creative ideas\u201d about community policing. Duval \u201ctruly understood the need for the police to be compassionate and work with the community,\u201d and could \u201ccite specific examples of leading by example.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b826-10\">Murphy also testified that he would not have considered a negative opinion from an interview panel as a justifiable reason for a bypass of the highest-ranked candidate on the certification list.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b827-7\">The decision also stated that the commission expected that Sherman would improve his skills to correct his \u201cmanagement deficiencies,\u201d and commented that it had \u201cevery reason to believe\u201d Sherman would obtain \u201cpromotion to a management position in the future.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b828-7\">General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 1, defines \u201c[bjasic merit principles\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-8\">\u201c(a) recruiting, selecting and advancing of employees on the basis of their relative ability, knowledge and skills including open consideration of qualified applicants for initial appointment; (b) providing of equitable and adequate compensation for all employees; (c) providing of training and development for employees, as needed, to assure the advancement and high quality performance of such employees; (d) retaining of employees on the basis of adequacy of their performance, correcting inadequate performance, and separating employees whose inadequate performance cannot be corrected; (e) assuring fair treatment of all applicants and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>employees in all aspects of personnel administration without regard to political affiliation, race, color, age, national origin, sex, marital status, handicap, or religion and with proper regard for privacy, basic rights outlined in this chapter and constitutional rights as citizens, and; (f) assuring that all employees are protected against coercion for political purposes, and are protected from arbitrary and capricious actions.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b830-7\">For instance, there apparently was confusion among the panel members about how to score candidates. Among other things, Officer Jeff Chaplin had been unaware that he was supposed to score the candidates numerically and instead gave them letter grades. The panel\u2019s final scores for the candidates were not available at the hearing and had to be reconstructed, to the extent possible, from testimony, because some of the panelists\u2019 scores had never been written down. The reconstructed scores contained a few arithmetic errors. Some members of the panel did not take notes on Sherman\u2019s performance, although they did so for other candidates. And, in many cases, neither the panel members\u2019 written notes nor their testimony at the hearing provided substantive reasons why they awarded a given score to a particular candidate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b830-8\">We note, for example, Porter\u2019s relatively unconstrained postinterview ranking of the candidates, which formed the basis of his recommendations to Murphy. We note also that the record does not indicate whether the job performance of the other candidates was subjected to the same scrutiny as Sherman\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b830-9\">We recognize that a flawed interview process could serve to mask the presence of implicit gender and racial bias in the decision-making process. See, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>e.g., Morris <em>vs. </em>Braintree Police Dep\u2019t, Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, No. Gl-13-173 (Dec. 11, 2014) (commission allowed candidate\u2019s bypass appeal in part because police department \u201ctook few . . . steps to insure that the interview process was reasonably structured and capable of meaningful objective review,\u201d and candidate was bypassed \u201cbecause of [only] slightly better interviews\u201d by other candidates; bypassed candidate \u201chad a well-documented record as a successful law enforcement professional\u201d; and there were other \u201cred flags,\u201d including differences between bypassed candidate\u2019s age and race and those of selected candidates). No such claim was made here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b831-8\">The evidence that Sherman\u2019s job performance supported a reasonable justification for his bypass was somewhat limited, in part because the department did not conduct annual, written performance reviews under the perfor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>manee evaluation system established by the administrator pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 6A.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">An appointing authority may use any information it has obtained through an independent, impartial, and reasonably thorough review as the basis of its decision to bypass a candidate. See <em>Beverly </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 182, 189 (2010). The appointing authority may rely upon credible anecdotal evidence of job performance concerns to form the basis of a reasonable justification for bypass, so long as its decision satisfies basic merit principles. The decision may not be arbitrary, based upon political or personal connections, or applied unequally to other candidates. The closer that an appointing authority\u2019s procedures hew to those set out in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 6A, the more confident we will be that the evaluation of job performance was fair and not arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Here, the town\u2019s evaluation of Sherman\u2019s job performance was based largely on informal conversations with Sullivan, who had difficulty identifying at the hearing particular instances of poor performance. Testimony by Sherman\u2019s direct supervisors, however, did identify specific instances supporting the magistrate\u2019s finding that at least one of the supervisors had specific incidents to support his assessment of Sherman.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b832-9\">Sherman also argues that Murphy\u2019s bypass letter cited the three selected candidates\u2019 training, length of experience, and military service as reasons for their selection, and that \u2014 because these three factors are already considered by HRD in determining a particular candidate\u2019s final certification score \u2014 none of them is a valid reason for a bypass, and that offering them as reasons for a bypass is impermissible \u201cdouble credit.\u201d At least on the facts of this case, we disagree. Although credits are provided by statute to certified candidates for \u201ctraining and experience,\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 22, and the names of veterans are placed \u201cahead of the names of all other persons\u201d on the certification list, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 28, it does not follow that an appointing authority may not consider factors relating to a candidate\u2019s experience, training, or military service in deciding to bypass a candidate. As Porter explained during his testimony, for instance, where a veteran has been given a preference on the certification list simply by virtue of being a veteran, it is not \u201cdouble credit\u201d to consider what he or she \u201cdid in the military,\u201d and \u201cwhat sort of leadership qualities\u201d he or she has.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
