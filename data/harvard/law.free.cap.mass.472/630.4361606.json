His appeal raises two issues of particular relevance to the trial of medical malpractice cases: (1) whether the plaintiff, through her counsel, complied with the obligations imposed by Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (4) (A) (i), 365 Mass. 772 (1974), to disclose the substance of and grounds for the opinions of an expert witness; and (2) whether certain materials obtained from the Internet qualify as published treatises, periodicals, or the like within the meaning of the \u201clearned treatise\u201d exception to the hearsay rule adopted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, </em>413 Mass. 387, 395-396 (1992). See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 803(18)(B) (2015). On the issue of expert disclosure we conclude that the plaintiff met the basic disclosure requirements of rule 26 (b) (4) (A) (i), although the disclosure was not as clear or complete as it could have been and the expert witness\u2019s trial testimony was inappropriately used by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. With respect to the Internet materials, we conclude that the pages taken from two Web sites and used during the plaintiff\u2019s examination of the defendant did not qualify under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Despite the evidentiary errors at trial, however, we further con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>elude that reversal of the judgment is not required because in the circumstances of this case, the errors did not result in undue prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the facts of the decedent\u2019s medical treatment and death, taken from the evidence at trial, and reserve additional facts for later discussion in connection with the issues raised on appeal. On August 14, 2006, at approximately 10:56 a.m., twenty-three year old Jeffrey Kace (Jeffrey)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> entered the emergency room at Caritas St. Elizabeth\u2019s Medical Center (hospital) in Boston. A triage nurse noted that Jeffrey had chest congestion and discomfort, fever, cough, and pain in taking deep breaths. The nurse recorded Jeffrey\u2019s heart rate as 115 beats per minute; a heart rate over one hundred indicates the condition of tachycardia.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The defendant, who was at the time an emergency medicine physician at the hospital, examined Jeffrey at approximately 11:15 a.m.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to the defendant\u2019s notes in the medical record, Jeffrey presented with a cough, fever, slight sore throat, malaise, pleuritic chest pain,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the need to cough with deep inspiration. The defendant\u2019s notes indicate, contrary to those of the triage nurse, that Jeffrey had a regular heart rate. The defendant took Jeffrey\u2019s medical history, which included asking Jeffrey about his past medical issues and those of his family members,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and conducted a physical examination. The defendant then ordered a chest X-ray, which revealed no abnormalities and showed a normal silhouette of the heart; he did not order an electrocardiogram (EKG) or any blood tests. The defendant diagnosed Jeffrey with bronchitis and prescribed an antibiotic as well as Vicodin, a narcotic pain reliever. He did not consider as a diagnosis myocarditis, which is a condition that typically begins as a respiratory infection and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>spreads to the heart, inflaming and infecting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">According to the medical record, a nurse administered Tylenol to Jeffrey at 11:20 a.m. The defendant testified that typically a nurse would give a patient Tylenol only after the physician had concluded an examination of the patient, indicating that at least according to the medical record, the defendant\u2019s examination of Jeffrey lasted for five minutes, from 11:15 to 11:20 a.m. The record also reflected that Jeffrey was discharged from the hospital at approximately 11:25 a.m., twenty-nine minutes after he was first seen by the triage nurse.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The next morning, Jeffrey was found dead in his bed in his apartment. An autopsy revealed that he died of cardiac dysrhyth-mia<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> stemming from viral myocarditis. Myocarditis, which can cause sudden death, is often secondary to bronchitis, and the autopsy determined that bronchitis was a contributing cause of Jeffrey\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\"><em>Procedural background. </em>In 2008, Lynn Kace commenced this wrongful death action as the administrator of Jeffrey\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The complaint alleged, among other things, that the defendant\u2019s medical care and treatment of Jeffrey was negligent and grossly negligent, and that the defendant\u2019s substandard medical care caused Jeffrey\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">At the close of a jury trial that took place in late February, 2014, the jury found the defendant negligent in his medical treatment of Jeffrey, and that his negligence caused Jeffrey\u2019s death; the jury did not find the defendant to have been grossly negligent. They awarded wrongful death damages in the amount of $2,925,000 to Lynn Kace in her capacity as administrator of Jeffrey\u2019s estate, but did not award any damages for pain and suffering by Jeffrey. Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial or remittitur, in which he raised, among other claims, the issues he raises in this appeal. After a hearing, the judge denied the motion in its entirety. The defendant appealed to the Appeals Court, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Undisclosed expert opinion, </em>a. <em>Background. </em>The parties filed a pretrial memorandum in 2011, three years before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>trial, that included expert witness disclosures and in particular summarized the anticipated testimony of their identified expert witnesses. In the pretrial memorandum, the plaintiff indicated that she would call as an expert witness Dr. Alexander McMeeking, and then set out the \u201cfacts and opinions\u201d to which he would testify, including, as part of the \u201cfacts,\u201d Jeffrey\u2019s constellation of symptoms (cough, chest pain, malaise, and fever), the details of when Jeffrey arrived at the hospital (10:56 a.m.), when the defendant examined him (11:15 a.m.), when Jeffrey was administered Tylenol (11:20 a.m.), when he was discharged (11:25 a.m.), and that he died of cardiac dysrhythmia due to viral myocarditis. For \u201copinions,\u201d the memorandum stated that McMeeking would opine at trial that the standard of care in 2006 required a doctor in the defendant\u2019s position to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">\u201crecognize and appreciate that fever, chest pain, malaise, and tachycardia could be signs and symptoms of viral myo-carditis;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">\u201corder an [EKG] and cardiac enzyme testing to rule out viral myocarditis; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">\u201cimmediately admit the patient for cardiology and infectious disease consultations and steroid treatments if the diagnosis was considered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Accordingly, McMeeking was expected to offer opinion testimony at trial that the defendant\u2019s treatment of Jeffrey fell below the standard of care for the average qualified emergency medicine doctor when the defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-9\">\u201cfailed to recognize and appreciate fever, chest pain, malaise, and tachycardia as signs and symptoms of viral myocarditis;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-10\">\u201cfailed to order an [EKG] and cardiac enzyme testing to rule out myocarditis; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-11\">\u201cfailed to immediately admit [Jeffrey] for cardiology and infectious disease consultations, steroid treatments, and monitoring.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">At trial in 2014, prior to McMeeking\u2019s testimony, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel called the defendant as a witness, and inquired at some length on direct examination about whether a five-minute evaluation of Jeffrey was appropriate, without any objection from defense counsel. The defendant responded, in part, that five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>minutes was insufficient to take and conduct a proper medical history and examination of a patient with Jeffrey\u2019s symptoms. McMeeking testified next.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He opined that the defendant\u2019s treatment of Jeffrey fell below the standard of care of the average qualified emergency room doctor in 2006, a standard that required a doctor to recognize that pleuritic chest pain could be a sign of myocarditis and to administer an EKG to a patient presenting with pleuritic chest pain. He noted that the standard of care also demanded that a doctor, upon a suspicion of myocarditis, order blood tests to confirm the diagnosis and then admit the patient to a hospital for monitoring and treatment, and that myocarditis can be successfully treated if timely diagnosed. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then asked the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cI\u2019d like you to assume that [the defendant] saw [Jeffrey] at approximately 11:15, based upon the records, and had written an order for Tylenol and had completed his exam by 11:20, or possibly earlier. Do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, in a patient like [Jeffrey], whether it would ever be appropriate to do a history and physical exam ... in five minutes or less[?]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">A.: \u201cI do, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">Q.: \u201cWhat is your opinion?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">A.: <em>\u201c[I]t\u2019s . . . impossible to do a </em>. . . <em>competent history and a physical in five minutes. It would take at least 20 minutes to get an appropriate history and examination from a patient like [Jeffrey]\u201d </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">Defense counsel objected. Counsel complained that the plaintiff\u2019s pretrial disclosure had focused solely on the defendant\u2019s failure to order an EKG in light of Jeffrey\u2019s symptoms, and had not included an opinion that the defendant\u2019s examination of Jeffrey fell below the standard of care because it was too brief. The judge overruled the objection. Later, in his direct examination of McMeeking, plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number><em>Q.: </em>\u201cDoctor, do you have an opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, whether <em>the deviations from the standard of care that you\u2019ve listed here today, including the length of the interaction between [Jeffrey] and [the defendant] and his failure to obtain an EKG, </em>do you have an opinion as to whether those failures were a substantial contributing factor in causing [Jeffrey\u2019s] death?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">A.: \u201cI do, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cAnd what is your opinion?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">A.: \u201c[M]ost definitely and unfortunately, <em>these all contributed directly to [Jeffrey] dying.\u201d </em>(Emphases added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">b. <em>Analysis. </em>The defendant argues that McMeeking\u2019s opinion that the defendant\u2019s five-minute examination of Jeffrey was too brief and fell below the standard of care (exam duration opinion) was separate and distinct from McMeeking\u2019s disclosed opinions on the defendant\u2019s deviations from the applicable standard of care in the pretrial memorandum; that the plaintiff did not give any notice of this additional opinion before the trial began; and that the judge abused her discretion by permitting McMeeking to opine on the insufficiency of a five-minute medical evaluation. The defendant was prejudiced, he claims, by the nondisclosure in that he was unprepared to counter the opinion either through discovery aimed at impeaching its foundation or by further development of the factual record concerning the actual duration of Jeffrey\u2019s examination. The plaintiff counters that the pretrial memorandum did implicitly disclose that the duration of the defendant\u2019s examination of Jeffrey was a factor supporting McMeeking\u2019s disclosed opinion on the defendant\u2019s deviation from the standard of care and that, by including all the timing details in the \u201cfacts and opinions\u201d to which McMeeking would testify, the exam duration issue was raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">Our rules of civil procedure require a party to respond to expert witness interrogatories by disclosing the identity of each expected expert witness as well as \u201cthe substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. R 26 (b) (4) (A) (i). The rules also require supplementation of an expert interrogatory response if there are any changes or additions to it. Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (e) (1) (B). The goal is obvious: to facilitate the fair exchange of information about critical witnesses and to prevent unfair sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>prise. See <em>Resendes </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 344, 351 (1995). Cf. <em>Thibeault </em>v. <em>Square D Co., </em>960 F.2d 239, 244 (1st Cir. 1992), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Procter &amp; Gamble Co., </em>356 U.S. 677, 682 (1958) (Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 is \u201cconsonant with the federal court\u2019s desire to \u2018make a trial less a game of blindman\u2019s buff and more a fair contest with the basic issues and facts disclosed to the fullest practical extent\u2019 \u201d); <em>Licciardi </em>v. <em>TIG Ins. Group, </em>140 F.3d 357, 363 (1st Cir. 1998) (discussing Fed. R. Civ. P. 26). Preventing untimely disclosure of expert testimony is particularly important in a medical malpractice action because expert testimony is almost always required, and it is often <em>the </em>central feature of the case. See <em>Palandjian </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>446 Mass. 100, 105-106 (2006). It is also true, however, that a judge has broad discretion to admit or exclude \u201cexpert testimony when the proponent has not given proper notice of... the subject matter of the expert\u2019s anticipated testimony, either in his answers to interrogatories or in his supplementary responses.\u201d <em>Elias </em>v. <em>Suran, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 7, 10 (1993). In die absence of \u201cprejudicial error resulting from an abuse of discretion,\u201d we \u201cwill not disturb a judge\u2019s exercise of discretion\u201d regarding expert witness disclosures (citation omitted). See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Honeywell, Inc., </em>409 Mass. 803, 809 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">There is no question that the spirit and purpose of our discovery rules would have been better served by a direct disclosure of the exam duration opinion. Ultimately, however, we disagree with the defendant that the exam duration opinion was qualitatively different from McMeeking\u2019s standard of care opinions disclosed in the pretrial memorandum. We understand McMeeking\u2019s trial testimony about the duration of the defendant\u2019s examination of Jeffrey as a form of explanation for \u2014 and therefore as linked to \u2014 his disclosed opinion that the defendant deviated from the standard of care by failing to recognize that Jeffrey\u2019s chest pain, fever, tachycardia, and malaise could be symptoms of myocarditis, and by failing to order an EKG to rule out that possibility. Fairly considered in its entirety, McMeeking\u2019s exam duration opinion did not assert that a five-minute evaluation was always insufficient, but that it was insufficient time for the defendant to conduct a proper physical examination and gather an appropriate medical history <em>in Jeffrey\u2019s case. </em>Because a history and examination are necessary to understand the meaning and context of a patient\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>symptoms,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> McMeeking\u2019s exam duration opinion expresses the point that the defendant\u2019s brief evaluation of Jeffrey was inadequate for the defendant to acquire the information necessary to recognize the significance of Jeffrey\u2019s particular symptoms and arrive at an appropriate diagnosis. As such, it is a development of McMeeking\u2019s disclosed opinion that the defendant deviated from the standard of care by failing to recognize that Jeffrey\u2019s symptoms indicated a possible diagnosis of myocarditis. See <em>Gay </em>v. <em>Stonebridge Life Ins. Co., </em>660 F.3d 58, 63-64 (1st. Cir. 2011) (defense expert\u2019s pretrial disclosure stated opinion that stroke was contributing cause of death but did not say it was dominant cause; admission of expert\u2019s testimony at trial implying that stroke was, in fact, dominant cause of death was not error because testimony was linked to disclosed opinions that decedent suffered stroke and that decedent\u2019s excessive bleeding suggested she suffered from more than skull fracture).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Moreover, the pretrial memorandum specifically disclosed the facts supporting McMeeking\u2019s exam duration opinion and testimony, namely, that Jeffrey arrived at the hospital at 10:56 a.m., the defendant examined Jeffrey at 11:15 a.m.; the nurse administered Tylenol at 11:20 a.m.; and Jeffrey was discharged at 11:25 a.m. From this, the defendant was or should have been aware well before trial that the timing details surrounding the defendant\u2019s examination of Jeffrey were in play.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Hammell </em>v. <em>Shooshanian Eng\u2019g Assocs., Inc., </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 634, 636-638 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>&amp; n.3 (2009) (expert opinion disclosed prior to trial faulted multiple defendants, but opinion at trial changed to fault only one of these defendants; court held that trial testimony was not timely disclosed).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">That said, the plaintiff\u2019s failure to disclose explicitly Mc-Meeking\u2019s exam duration opinion is troubling, particularly when considered in light of how the plaintiff\u2019s counsel used that opinion at trial. Although McMeeking ultimately did tie his exam duration opinion to his disclosed opinion that the defendant failed to recognize Jeffrey\u2019s symptoms as indicative of myocarditis, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel worked assiduously to separate them into two independent failures by the defendant to meet the standard of care \u2014 as counsel\u2019s opening statement,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> closing argument,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and direct examination of the defendant reflect.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In the circumstances, it is difficult to interpret the plaintiff counsel\u2019s words as anything other than intentional encouragement for the jury to find the defendant liable simply for spending too little time in evalu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>ating and treating Jeffrey.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We recognize that the duration of the defendant\u2019s examination was plainly embedded in the facts of the case, and that independently of the plaintiff\u2019s expert McMeeking, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was entitled to ask the defendant about the duration of his examination of Jeffrey, and to comment on the length of this examination in counsel\u2019s opening and closing. However, counsel was not entitled to convert McMeeking\u2019s comments into an expert opinion about a separate deviation from the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Expert witnesses are both legally essential and factually key witnesses in a medical malpractice case. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel and his law firm specialize in this field. We expect counsel to litigate medical malpractice cases in good faith and with adherence to our disclosure principles under our procedural rules including, in particular, Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (4). The overarching obligation to conduct litigation with fairness and integrity demands no less. Cf. <em>Polansky </em>v. <em>CNA Ins. Co., </em>852 F.2d 626, 632 (1st Cir. 1988) (\u201cwe remind counsel that we do not view favorably any attempt \u2018to play fast and loose\u2019 with our judicial system. . . . Too often a lawyer loses sight of his primary responsibility as an officer of the court. While he must provide \u2018zealous advocacy\u2019 for his client\u2019s cause, we encourage this only as a means of achieving the court\u2019s ultimate goal, which is finding the truth. Deceptions, misrepresentations, or falsities can only frustrate that goal and will not be tolerated within our judicial system\u201d [quotations, citations, and footnote omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Counsel\u2019s conduct makes reversal of the judgment in this case a close question, and unnecessarily so: disclosure of the exam duration opinion was available.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In the end, however, we conclude that reversal is not required. Although McMeeking\u2019s exam <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>duration opinion should have been more clearly disclosed as the grounds of his ultimate opinion regarding the defendant\u2019s deviation from the standard of care, the exam duration opinion \u2014 as testified to by McMeeking himself \u2014 served as a permissible explanation for, and development of, the expert\u2019s disclosed opinion regarding the defendant\u2019s failure to meet the standard of care by not recognizing the significance of Jeffrey\u2019s symptoms. To the extent the plaintiff\u2019s counsel improperly sought to characterize the exam duration opinion as an ultimate or independent opinion regarding the standard of care, as previously stated (see note 17, <em>supra), </em>we conclude that the jury did not accept his view.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Accordingly, reversal on the ground of prejudicial nondisclosure of the expert\u2019s opinion is not called for. See <em>Wilson, </em>409 Mass. at 809; <em>Resendes, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">2. <em>Learned treatises, </em>a. <em>Background. </em>During his redirect examination of the defendant, plaintiff\u2019s counsel showed the defendant and questioned him about two printouts of Web site pages, both titled \u201cMyocarditis\u201d and both listing what the pages described as common symptoms of myocarditis, from the Web sites of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (Johns Hopkins) and Mayo Clinic, respectively. The defendant testified that he was familiar with the two medical institutions, but not with the content of their Web sites concerning myocarditis.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> After the defendant reviewed these Web site pages (Web pages), plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked him to read the text of each. The defendant complied, which amounted to him testifying that Johns Hopkins\u2019s Web site referenced fatigue, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, fever, chest pain, and congestive heart failure as symptoms of myocarditis, and that Mayo Clinic\u2019s Web site listed as common symptoms chest pain, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, fluid retention, fatigue, aches, and fever. The defendant then confirmed that Jeffrey exhibited certain of these symptoms when the defendant examined him. The Web pages themselves were marked for identification but not admitted in evidence. Defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>objected to this entire line of questioning; the judge overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">b. <em>Analysis. </em>The defendant argues that the use by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel of these Web pages to cross-examine him was impermissible under this court\u2019s prior decisions as well as Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 803(18)(B), because (1) the defendant was not testifying as an expert witness, and (2) in any event, the printed Web pages should have been excluded as unauthenticated and unreliable because they were undated and without a named author. We agree with the defendant.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Section 803(18)(B) sets out the general learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule. It allows a party on cross-examination of an expert witness to bring the expert\u2019s attention to, question the expert about, and read in evidence \u201cstatements contained in published treatises, periodicals, or pamphlets on a subject of history, medicine, or other science or art, established as a reliable authority by the testimony or admission of the witness or by other expert testimony or by judicial notice.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We adopted this section in <em>Sneed, </em>413 Mass. at 396.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In doing so, we described the procedure applicable to using a learned treatise on cross-examination of an expert witness at trial as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>\u201cProposed rule 803(18) [Mass.

The witness should be given a fair opportunity to assess the statement in context and to comment on it, either during cross-examination or on redirect examination. The judge, of course, will have to determine the relevance and materiality of the statement and should consider carefully any claimed unfairness or confusion that admission of the statement may create.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">We consider first the defendant\u2019s argument that neither of the Internet Web pages qualified as a \u201creliable authority\u201d that could be used in cross-examining an expert witness under \u00a7 803(18)(B) and <em>Sneed, </em>413 Mass. at 396. The standard for establishing the reliability of a statement varies depending on the context in which the statement is published. With regard to a \u201ctreatise,\u201d we have held that \u201cthe rule contemplates that an authored treatise, and not the statements contained therein,\u201d must be established as reliable. <em>Brusard </em>v. <em>O\u2019Toole, </em>429 Mass. 597, 602-603 (1999). As to a periodical or journal, however, \u201c[i]n these days of quantified research, and pressure to publish, an article does not reach the dignity of a \u2018reliable authority\u2019 merely because some editor, even a most reputable one, sees fit to circulate it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603-604, quoting <em>Meschino </em>v. <em>North Am.

Accordingly, a statement within \u201can article in a journal or periodical would be admissible under [\u00a7 803(18)(B)] if an opponent of the expert witness establishes that the author of the... article is \u2018a reliable authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brusard, supra </em>at 604 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Along the continuum from treatises to journals, it is readily apparent that the Johns Hopkins and Mayo Clinic Web pages are very different from a treatise and resemble far more closely articles in a journal or a periodical. Cf. <em>Jasper </em>v. <em>Tomaiolo, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 201, 204 (1985) (learned treatises \u201care subjected to careful professional criticism\u201d). Cf. also <em>Crispin </em>v. <em>Christian Audigier, Inc., 717 </em>F. Supp. 2d 965, 976 n.19 (C.D. Cal. 2010), and cases discussed (Internet encyclopedia \u201cWikipedia\u201d is not learned treatise). The content of the Web pages indicates that they are not medical \u201ctreatises\u201d of any sort intended to be read and used by physicians, but rather are directed at laypersons: both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Web pages list symptoms of myocarditis and direct the reader to call a doctor if he or she develops them. See Fed. R. Evid. 803, Advisory Committee Note to Paragraph 18 (1972) (commenting on analogous Federal rule of evidence on learned treatises; noting treatises are \u201cwritten primarily and impartially for professionals, subject to scrutiny and exposure for inaccuracy, with the reputation of the writer at stake\u201d). And significantly, the Web pages list no author or authors.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">To establish the admissibility of the statements taken from the Johns Hopkins and Mayo Clinic Web sites, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was obligated to show that the author or authors of the Web pages was or were \u201ca reliable authority.\u201d See <em>Brusard, </em>429 Mass. at 603, 604 n.8.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The credibility of Johns Hopkins and Mayo Clinic as highly respected medical institutions or facilities is not enough to demonstrate the reliability of statements on individual pages of each institution\u2019s Web site. There is nothing to say who wrote each Web page, or whether the author of each Web page was an appropriate source of information regarding the common symptoms of myocarditis. This is not to say that materials published on the Internet may never qualify as \u201clearned treatises\u201d as the term is used in \u00a7 803(18)(B).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The point, rather, is that the reliability of the material that a party intends to use pursuant to \u00a7 803(18)(B) must be established \u2014 which means establishing that the contents of the specific article, Web page, or other material was authored or prepared by a \u201creliable authority\u201d pursuant to one of the means spelled out in \u00a7 803(18)(B). See Mass. G. Evid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>803(18)(B) (treatise, periodical, etc., may be established as reliable authority by testimony or admission of testifying witness, other expert testimony, or judicial notice).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">In the present case, given that the Web pages in question did not reference a particular author or authors, it was not possible for the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to establish their reliability as required by the evidence rule. See <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Toledo Neurological Assocs., </em>20 N.E.3d 333, 343 (Ohio Ct. App. 2014) (\u201cfoundation could not be laid for establishing\u201d Internet article as \u201cauthoritative and reliable\u201d under analogous learned treatise exception to hearsay rule because \u201cauthor and original publication date of the article could not be ascertained\u201d). See also <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Lott, </em>964 So. 2d 1119, 1133-1135 (Miss. 2007) (judge erred in permitting counsel to use article printed from Internet to cross-examine expert witnesses where article was not established as reliable by these witnesses or other experts, and judge did not take judicial notice of article\u2019s reliability).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The defendant contends that independent of the question whether the Johns Hopkins and Mayo Clinic Internet Web pages qualified as \u201clearned treatises\u201d under \u00a7 803(18)(B), that section did not permit plaintiff\u2019s counsel to use the Web pages in his redirect examination of the defendant. The defendant is correct. <em>Sneed </em>and its progeny make clear that \u00a7 803(18)(B) shields a treatise from exclusion as hearsay <em>only </em>where the treatise is brought to the attention of an expert witness on cross-examination. See <em>Sneed, </em>413 Mass. at 395 (noting that this court\u2019s Advisory Committee, in proposing rule 803[18], \u201ccommented that the rule was limited to statements called to the attention of an expert witness on cross-examination\u201d; noting further \u201cpotential benefit, and little risk of harm\u201d in allowing \u201ca party challenging an expert\u2019s opinion to interrogate that expert\u201d about learned treatise). See also <em>Brusard, </em>429 Mass. at 602; W.G. Young, J.R. Pollets, &amp; C. Poreda, Evidence \u00a7 803.18 (2d ed. 1998) (learned treatises \u201care admissible to challenge an expert\u2019s opinion and to question that expert regarding a relevant, divergent opinion on cross examination\u201d). Here, however, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel referenced and used the Web sites of Johns Hopkins and Mayo Clinic in his redirect examination of the defendant, who, although a licensed physician and experienced in the field of emergency medicine, was not testifying as an expert witness at this trial; he was a party to the case, and was testifying solely in his capacity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>as such.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The defendant was asked and answered questions by both counsel that called for his opinion regarding the propriety of his own medical treatment of Jeffrey. His testimony, however, did not include an opinion on the appropriate standard of care in 2006, and did not turn him into an expert witness within the meaning of \u00a7 803(18)(B).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> As a result, \u00a7 803(18)(B) did not apply to plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s examination of the defendant, and in particular did not authorize counsel to use the Web pages during that examination in the manner he did. Therefore, evidence concerning the content of these Web pages, introduced for its truth, constituted inadmissible hearsay; the defendant\u2019s objection should have been sustained for this reason as well. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Reese, 438 Mass. 519, 526-527 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">We turn to the question of prejudice. The Web pages presented to the jury evidence that Jeffrey had certain symptoms of myocarditis when the defendant examined him. It was evidence that may have been enhanced in significance by the reputation of the two renowned institutions of medicine, and enhanced even more by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel mischaracterizing the Web pages as \u201cstudies\u201d in his closing. However, in light of other evidence properly admitted in this case, we cannot conclude that the defendant was materially prejudiced. The symptoms of myocarditis read from each Web page were cumulative: the defendant and his own expert witness, Dr. John Benanti, both testified, independently of the Web pages, that substantially all of these symptoms are associated with myocarditis. Reversal on account of the judge\u2019s error relating to the Web pages is not warranted. See <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Dong, </em>412 Mass. 682, 688 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">3. <em>Use of Jeffrey\u2019s prior medical record on cross-examination of the plaintiff\u2019s expert. </em>Finally, the defendant argues that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>judge abused her discretion and committed error in precluding his counsel from using one of Jeffrey\u2019s prior medical records in his cross-examination of McMeeking, the plaintiff\u2019s sole expert witness. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The relevant background to the claim is the following. Included in the agreed-upon trial exhibits were (1) pages of Jeffrey\u2019s medical records from the health center at the university that Jeffrey had attended, dated October, 2003, and May, 2004; and (2) a page from a pediatric medical record of Jeffrey\u2019s that was dated September, 2000. In his direct examination of McMeeking, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked the witness about these earlier medical records, beginning with those dated 2003 and 2004. In particular, counsel asked whether the records reflected that Jeffrey had been treated for bronchitis in 2003 and 2004, and whether they indicated any complaint of chest pain at that time.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Counsel then asked about the 2000 medical record, and simply inquired whether that record mentioned bronchitis (it did).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The 2000 medical record, fairly read, included a complaint of pain when coughing that one might reasonably infer to mean chest pain,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> but it contained no indication that an EKG was performed. When defense counsel sought to question McMeeking on cross-examination about the 2000 medical record, plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected, stating that one word of it was illegible. The judge sustained the objection, asserting that it would not be fair to question McMeeking about the record because it did not explicitly reference chest pain, and that she had previously heard counsel \u201con the standard of care issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The ruling was error. Where the medical record was in evidence by agreement and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel had specifically used it in his direct examination of the witness, defense counsel should have been permitted to ask questions about the same record in his cross-examination of the same witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cataldo, </em>326 Mass. 373, 377 (1950) (\u201ccross-examination on the same subject as the direct examination\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>appropriate). Similarly, the judge erred in refusing to allow defense counsel to mention Jeffrey\u2019s 2000 medical record, a trial exhibit, in his closing argument as part of his discussion of McMeeking. We are not persuaded, however, that reversal is required on account of these two errors. This is so because the record itself was very brief and contained a minimal amount of information, there was no evidence concerning the prior medical episode of bronchitis referenced in the record, and no evidence concerning whether an EKG even could have been administered at that time and in that setting. See <em>Adoption of Sherry, </em>435 Mass. 331, 336-337 (2001) (error in excluding evidence was not prejudicial where such evidence would not have affected central issue in case).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Aem\">The defendant also challenges in this appeal a ruling by the trial judge relating to the scope of defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the plaintiff\u2019s expert witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Because the plaintiff Lynn Kace, Jeffrey Race\u2019s mother and the administrator of his estate, shares the same last name, we refer to Jeffrey Kace by his first name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b650-8\">The trial in this case took place in February, 2014, approximately seven and one-half years after Jeffrey\u2019s visit to the hospital\u2019s emergency department in 2006. The defendant did not have any recollection of treating Jeffrey; the information concerning his treatment is derived from the hospital\u2019s medical record relating to the visit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b650-9\">Pleuritic chest pain occurs where the lungs and heart rub against each other, causing painful deep breathing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b650-10\">The defendant inferred from the boxes he had checked off on the medical record that he asked Jeffrey about his medical history and that of his family members.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Cardiac dysrhythmia refers to an irregular heartbeat the result of which is that the heart stops beating.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b651-11\">The original complaint also named Charles Kace, Sr., Jeffrey\u2019s father and Lynn Kace\u2019s husband, as a plaintiff in his capacity as administrator of the estate, but he died prior to trial, and the action proceeded with Lynn Kace as the sole plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b653-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel interrupted his direct examination of the defendant to accommodate the schedule of the plaintiff\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Alexander McMeeking. The defendant completed his testimony following McMeeking\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b653-11\">During redirect examination, McMeeking again testified that \u201c[y]ou can never get an adequate history and physical exam in five minutes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The defendant indicated as much at trial, testifying that a physician is to identify possible diagnoses after taking the patient\u2019s medical history and conducting a physical exam.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The defendant relies on <em>Licciardi </em>v. <em>TIG Ins. Group, </em>140 F.3d 357 (1st Cir. 1998), which interpreted Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e). In that case, the court found an abuse of discretion in a judge\u2019s decision to admit expert testimony that was not disclosed prior to trial. <em>Id. </em>at 359, 363. In <em>Licciardi, </em>a pretrial report concerning the defendant\u2019s expert doctor\u2019s medical examination of the plaintiff indicated the doctor\u2019s opinion that the plaintiff suffered a bruise as a result of an amusement park ride accident; the doctor then changed course at trial and opined that the accident did not cause the plaintiff\u2019s bruise. <em>Id. </em>at 360-361. In addition, the doctor testified at trial to \u201cthe engineering and physics of the ride\u201d even though this testimony was not discussed in his medical report. <em>Id. </em>at 362. Accordingly, <em>Licciardi </em>is distinguishable from the facts before us because, unlike McMeeking, the expert in <em>Licciardi </em>testified contrary to his pretrial report and included in his testimony opinions that were wholly unrelated to his pretrial disclosure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b656-8\">The plaintiff argues that the defendant also was put on notice that the duration of his examination of Jeffrey was at issue by the series of questions plaintiff\u2019s counsel posed to him, before McMeeking testified, about the adequacy of the defendant\u2019s five-minute examination of Jeffrey, and the defend-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>ara\u2019s response that five minutes probably was not an adequate amount of time for a proper examination. The defendant did not object to these questions. However, there is some truth in the defendant\u2019s position that posing such questions to the defendant does not, in and of itself, disclose that the plaintiffs expert will opine that this amount of time for an examination is insufficient and below the standard of care.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated in his opening, for example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">\u201c[I]n this case you\u2019ll hear a lot of medicine, but this case is going to be about how much time [the defendant] really spent with a gentleman who came to his emergency room with a significant condition. It will be about how much time is appropriate to spend with somebody who comes in with chest pains and I expect you\u2019ll hear the evidence to be less than five minutes is certainly not an appropriate amount of time to do a complete evaluation.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b657-8\">In his closing argument, the plaintiffs counsel stated: \u201cI would submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, that when a young man comes into an emergency department, feeling lousy enough to go to an emergency department at 23 years old and he has chest pain, discomfort \u2014 call it what you want \u2014 the standard of care is spend a little bit more than five minutes.\u201d He added that Jeffrey \u201cwas in that emergency room for half an hour\u201d and left ten minutes \u201cafter [the defendant] first laid eyes on him and [Jeffrey] was seen by the doctor, whose job it is to care for him, for less than five minutes.\u201d He then implored the jury to \u201cconsider five minutes or less\u201d in their deliberation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Before calling McMeeking as a witness, the plaintiffs counsel began his direct examination of the defendant and, perhaps in anticipation of Mc-Meeking\u2019s exam duration opinion testimony, asked the defendant repeatedly whether a five-minute evaluation of Jeffrey was adequate; the defendant conceded that such an evaluation was inappropriately brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b658-7\">It appears that the jury did not follow the plaintiff\u2019s counsel down the decisional path he proposed. In his closing, counsel argued that \u201cnot ordering an EKG on a patient with chest pain\u201d is negligence, but that \u201c[sjpending less than five minutes with that person, that\u2019s gross [negligence], because that\u2019s not even trying to do your job.\u201d The jury, however, did not find the defendant grossly negligent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Given that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel raised the duration of the defendant\u2019s examination of Jeffrey as a theme in his opening statement, used it in his direct examination of the defendant, and returned to it in his closing argument, it is certainly reasonable to infer that counsel knew that the examination\u2019s duration was going to be a major thrust of his presentation of the case well before the trial began. The appropriate approach would have been to disclose the exam duration opinion in a timely manner before trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Moreover, as discussed previously, separate and apart from McMeeking and his expert opinion, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was well within his rights to question the defendant about the duration of his examination of Jeffrey and to comment on that duration during counsel\u2019s opening statement and closing argument. It also is the case that the defendant\u2019s counsel did not object to the plaintiff counsel\u2019s opening, closing, or examination of the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b659-7\">No other expert witness testified to the reliability of these two Web site pages, and the judge did not take judicial notice that they were reliable authorities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b660-7\">We only consider here Mass.
