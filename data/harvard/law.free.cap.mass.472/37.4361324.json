The defendant was advised of the Miranda rights at the commencement of both interviews, but, in various ways, those rights were not accurately explained. Among other things, we are required to consider the effect of the inaccurate explanation of those rights in a noncustodial setting on the voluntariness of statements made thereafter, and on the knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of those rights in a subsequent custodial interrogation. We reverse the judge\u2019s ruling suppressing the prearrest statement, and affirm her ruling suppressing the postarrest statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\"><em>Background. </em>On June 27, 2012, members of the Palmer police department received a complaint regarding the sexual abuse of K.C., a six year old girl who resided in the home where the defendant was living. Shortly after police arrived at the home, the defendant voluntarily<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> accompanied them to the Palmer police station to discuss an allegation that he had inappropriately touched K.C. Sergeant Scott Haley was the only officer present during this conversation, and he began the interview by reading the defendant the Miranda rights. Haley then asked the defendant whether, with those rights in mind, the defendant was willing to talk \u201cabout these matters of concern.\u201d After a somewhat lengthy colloquy regarding the appointment of counsel and whether the defendant was under arrest, discussed <em>infra, </em>the defendant signed a Miranda waiver form and the interview proceeded. The defendant denied any inappropriate conduct with K.C. The interview concluded just after 10 p.m., and the defendant left the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">On June 28, 2012, Haley attended a forensic interview of K.C., during which she alleged that the defendant had sexually abused her. The defendant was subsequently arrested and brought to the police station. He was booked, fingerprinted, and brought back to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>the same interview room in which he had met with Haley the day before. Haley again read the defendant the Miranda rights, which the defendant waived in writing. After being told that additional evidence had been uncovered, the defendant again raised the issue of counsel. Ultimately, after another colloquy with Haley, the defendant said he did not want a lawyer at that time and the interview continued. The defendant proceeded to make inculpa-tory statements and admitted that the previous day, while he was tickling K.C., she had moved his hand to her inner thigh near her private parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><em>Procedural history. </em>In July, 2012, the defendant was indicted by a Hampden County grand jury on four counts of forcible rape of a child in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A, as well as four counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In April, 2013, the defendant filed a motion to suppress the statements he made to Sergeant Haley during both of his interviews. The Commonwealth filed a written opposition in response. At a hearing on the motion, the parties submitted digital video discs of the defendant\u2019s interviews; a stipulation as to the timeline of events; two signed Miranda waiver forms; a medical record of the examination of K.C., the complaining witness; and a police report authored by Haley. No testimony was taken. After a second, nonevidentiary hearing, the motion judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">In her decision, the judge concluded that the June 27 interview was noncustodial, but expressed some uncertainty whether Miranda warnings given in a noncustodial interview had to be scrupulously honored under Massachusetts law. She further concluded that the Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant understood the full import of his right to counsel and that he had voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived that right. The judge also concluded that reasonable doubt remained as to the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statements on June 27, given interruptions and misstatements made by Haley. With respect to the defendant\u2019s June 28 interview, the judge held that misstatements by Haley created a fundamental misunderstanding as to the defendant\u2019s right to appointed counsel. This, coupled with repeated \u201cclarifying\u201d questions that may have dissuaded the defendant from exercising his right to counsel, hampered the Commonwealth from establishing, beyond a reasonable doubt, the validity of the defendant\u2019s waiver. Additionally, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>motion judge found that the Commonwealth did not meet its burden of showing that the defendant\u2019s June 28 statements were voluntarily made in light of Haley\u2019s implicit offers of leniency in conjunction with misstatements about the defendant\u2019s right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Subsequently, the Commonwealth filed a motion to stay proceedings in the trial court, with a notice of interlocutory appeal. The case is now before us pursuant to an order of a single justice allowing the Commonwealth\u2019s application for leave to pursue an interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>Typically, when \u201creviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error, \u2018but conduct an independent review of [her] ultimate findings and conclusions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>461 Mass. 336, 340 (2012), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>440 Mass. 642, 646 (2004). \u201cA judge who has seen and heard the witnesses is in a better position to determine their credibility than is a court which is confined to the printed record.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novo, </em>442 Mass. 262, 266 (2004). However, \u201cwhenever the evidence before the trial court is reduced to a tangible form, and is therefore available to the appellate court in the same form as it was reviewed by the trial court,\u201d <em>id., </em>\u201cthe case for deference to the [motion] judge\u2019s findings of fact is weakened.\u201d <em>Clarke, supra. </em>In such circumstances, \u201cthis court stands in the same position as did the [motion] judge, and reaches its own conclusion unaffected by the findings made by the [motion] judge\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Novo, supra. </em>Accordingly, we take \u201can independent view of the evidence and analyze[ ] its significance without deference\u201d (citation and quotation omitted). <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">We have previously held that \u201c[t]he requirements of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966), are not triggered unless the interrogation is custodial, and a defendant\u2019s failure to receive or understand Miranda warnings, or police failure to honor Miranda rights, does not result in suppression of a voluntary statement made in a noncustodial setting.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>443 Mass. 597, 608-609 (2005), <em>S.C., </em>450 Mass. 173 (2007). \u201c[T]he premise of <em>Miranda </em>[is] that the danger of coercion results from the interaction of custody and official interrogation.\u201d <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>496 U.S. 292, 297 (1990). Accordingly, \u201c[t]he safeguards prescribed by <em>Miranda </em>become applicable as soon as a suspect\u2019s freedom of action is curtailed to a degree associated with formal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>arrest\u201d (citation and quotation omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kirwan, </em>448 Mass. 304, 309 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u201cCustodial interrogation is \u2018questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jung, </em>420 Mass. 675, 688 (1995). \u201cThe determination of custody depends primarily on the objective circumstances of the interrogation, and not on the subjective views of either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, </em>440 Mass. 216, 220 (2003). Accordingly, \u201c \u2018[t]he crucial question\u2019 ... is whether \u2018a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would have believed that he was in custody.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Molina, 461 </em>Mass. 65, 73 (2014), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baye, </em>462 Mass. 246, 253 (2012). Therefore, \u201cif the defendant reasonably believed that he was not free to leave, the interrogation occurred while the defendant was in custody, and Miranda warnings were required\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Groome, </em>435 Mass. 201, 211 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Whether made in a custodial or noncustodial setting, and even where there has been a valid waiver of Miranda rights, we must consider the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s statement, as \u201ca confession or an admission is admissible in evidence only if it is made voluntarily.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tremblay, </em>460 Mass. 199, 206 (2011). \u201c[T]he Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \u2018in light of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement, the will of the defendant was [not] overborne,\u2019 but rather that the statement was \u2018the result of a free and voluntary act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baye, </em>462 Mass. at 256, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durand, </em>457 Mass. 574, 595-596 (2010). \u201cA voluntary statement is one that is the product of a rational intellect and a free will, and not induced by physical or psychological coercion.\u201d <em>Molina, 461 </em>Mass. at 75, quoting <em>Tremblay, supra </em>at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The issue of voluntariness necessarily \u201cturns on \u2018all the surrounding circumstances \u2022\u2014 both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baye, </em>462 Mass. at 256, quoting <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>530 U.S. 428, 434 (2000). \u201cThis is not an area of the law that is governed by bright-line rules, but is one that requires a fact-intensive analysis.\u201d <em>Tremblay, </em>460 Mass. at 210. \u201cRelevant factors [to this inquiry] include, but are not limited to, \u2018promises or other inducements, conduct of the defendant, the defendant\u2019s age, education, intelligence and emo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>tional stability, experience with and in the criminal justice system, physical and mental condition, the initiator of the discussion of a deal or leniency (whether the defendant or the police), and the details of the interrogation, including the recitation of Miranda warnings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Molina, </em>467 Mass. at 76, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>420 Mass. 656, 663 (1995). While the \u201cuse of false information by police during an interrogation is deceptive and is a relevant factor indicating a possibility that the defendant\u2019s statements were made involuntarily,\u201d <em>Novo, </em>442 Mass. at 267, quoting <em>Selby, supra </em>at 664, \u201c[misinformation by the police does not necessarily render a confession involuntary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 395 (1997). \u201cThe presence of one or more factors suggesting a statement may have been made involuntarily is not always sufficient to render the statements involuntary.\u201d <em>Tremblay, supra </em>at 207, quoting <em>Selby, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">With these standards delineated, we turn to assessing the statements at issue and the judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">1. <em>June 27 statements. </em>As noted, the defendant voluntarily accompanied the police to the police station on June 27, 2012, to discuss an allegation that he had inappropriately touched K.C. The defendant, who was not under arrest, sat with Haley in an office furnished with two chairs and a desk with a computer. The interview was videotaped with the defendant\u2019s knowledge and assent.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Haley began the defendant\u2019s interview by reading him the Miranda rights. Haley then asked the defendant whether, with these rights in mind, he wanted to discuss the \u201cmatters of concern.\u201d The following exchange ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">Defendant: \u201cI\u2019m thinking with the circumstances I might need to get a lawyer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">Haley: \u201cWell, we can stop this right now if you want a lawyer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-10\">Defendant: \u201cBut where does that put me today?

And in that we\u2019re going to take the facts down, your side of the story about what happened here, alright?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-10\">Defendant: \u201cOkay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-11\">Haley: \u201cAnd then before we\u2019re done here, we read that statement back, and we correct anything that is not correct. . . .

So there isn\u2019t going to be stuff on here that you don\u2019t want to be on there, you know what I\u2019m saying? This is your statement of facts that you have to sign at the end. Alright? ... So this is your chance to tell me, okay, what happened here. So you\u2019re okay with that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-12\">Defendant: \u201cI\u2019m fine with that.

I just, like I said, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">The defendant then signed a waiver of the Miranda rights, and the interview proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">After discussing some background information, Haley again mentioned, and the defendant acknowledged, that the defendant had received and understood the Miranda rights and that he was not under arrest. When Haley asked the defendant, again, if he had waived the right to an attorney, the defendant responded, \u201cI just don\u2019t exactly know. Like I said, I don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s being alleged here. I don\u2019t know how to go about it. I\u2019m not \u2014 I don\u2019t want to put myself in any \u2014 get myself in any trouble because of the way that I word something.\u201d Haley responded, \u201cWell, it\u2019s in a written statement form that we\u2019re going to read back, so there\u2019s like no trickery here. You know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d The defendant said he understood, and Haley repeated that if the defendant wanted an attorney present he could stop answering questions at any point. The defendant acknowledged that he was not requesting a lawyer at that time. Haley asked the defendant if he was voluntarily giving his statement, to which the defendant replied in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">The interview continued, and Haley and the defendant discussed the substance of the allegations. Throughout the conversation, after typing a sentence or phrase, Haley would confirm with the defendant that he had accurately typed what the defendant said. The defendant admitted he had spent brief periods of time alone with K.C., but denied any inappropriate conduct. The defendant was given bottled water and took two unaccompanied bathroom breaks. Throughout the interview, the defendant was articulate and responded appropriately to all questions. Haley used a conversational tone and never raised his voice. The interview lasted approximately one and one-half hours, and after it concluded the defendant left the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">a. <em>Custody. </em>The defendant argues that he was in custody during his June 27 interview and accordingly the statements he made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>were obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, and <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 476. He also argues that his statements on this date were, as the judge concluded, not voluntary. In response, the Commonwealth contends that the defendant\u2019s June 27 statements should not be suppressed because <em>Miranda </em>does not apply to noncustodial interviews, the defendant only made an equivocal request for counsel, and his statements were made voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">We begin our analysis by agreeing with the motion judge that the defendant was not in custody on June 27. While some factors in the custody analysis weigh against the Commonwealth, they are not conclusive. For example, \u201cthe fact that the focus of the investigation was on the defendant,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 748, 752 (1985), and \u201c[t]he fact that the defendant\u2019s interview occurred at the police station [are] not, by [themselves], dispositive.\u201d <em>Hilton, </em>443 Mass. at 609-610. While a police station is not an entirely neutral setting, the defendant went there voluntarily and was expressly told several times that he was not under arrest. Moreover, while Haley explained to the defendant the focus of his questioning and revealed some degree of suspicion, on that date his general demeanor indicated that the \u201cexchange was explanatory rather than accusatory.\u201d <em>Molina, </em>467 Mass. at 74. See <em>Hilton, </em>443 Mass. at 608-611 (noncustodial interrogation where officers \u201cstopped short of an outright accusation\u201d). Whether an investigation has begun to focus on a suspect is \u201cmaterial to the custody inquiry only to the extent that an officer\u2019s suspicions influence the objective conditions of an interrogation, such that a reasonable person in the position of the person being questioned would not feel free to leave the place of questioning.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>427 Mass. 117, 124-125 (1998). To whatever extent the interview may have led a reasonable person to think he or she was not free to leave, \u201cany such mistaken impression was dispelled by [Haley\u2019s] correct explanation of the defendant\u2019s actual status.\u201d <em>Groome, </em>435 Mass. at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Of chief significance here is that the defendant went to the police station voluntarily, see <em>Molina, </em>467 Mass. at 73, and, once there, was told numerous times that he was not in custody. Both Haley and the defendant sat in a relaxed fashion. There is no evidence to suggest that the defendant\u2019s freedom to leave the interview was restricted at any time, and he took two unaccompanied bathroom breaks. Haley asked all questions in a conver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>sational tone and never raised his voice. Moreover, the flow of the exchange was predominantly influenced by the defendant\u2019s own remarks. When the interview was over, the defendant left the police station without hindrance. While a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position may have believed that he was a suspect in the investigation, these circumstances do not demonstrate an environment \u201cso dominated by the police that a reasonable person would perceive that his liberty was restrained to a degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d <em>Kirwan, </em>448 Mass. at 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Given our conclusion that the defendant was not in custody on June 27, his interview on this date was simply not governed by <em>Miranda. </em>Therefore, because his \u201cinquiry about an attorney occurred at a point well prior to the commencement of any custodial interrogation,\u201d <em>Groome, </em>435 Mass. at 216, he did not effectively invoke a \u201cright\u201d to counsel. \u201cThe fact that the defendant was read his Miranda rights when he arrived at the station may be understood to be only a step taken in an abundance of caution.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 752. While \u201c[w]e have \u2018encouraged police to give Miranda warnings prior to the point at which an encounter becomes custodial,\u2019 \u201d <em>Baye, </em>462 Mass. at 263, quoting <em>Hilton, </em>443 Mass. at 610 n.7, \u201c[t]he requirements of <em>[Miranda] </em>are not triggered unless the interrogation is custodial.\u201d <em>Baye, supra </em>at 253, quoting <em>Hilton, supra </em>at 608. See generally <em>Groome, supra </em>at 215-216. Therefore, the interview not being custodial, the defendant\u2019s musings about perhaps needing a lawyer, and his inquiry about how to get the court to appoint him a lawyer if he could not afford one, did not require the officer to cease all questioning, and did not render his June 27 statements inadmissible under <em>Miranda. </em>See <em>Barnes, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>b. <em>Voluntariness of the statements. </em>\u201cWhere a defendant makes statements to the police while \u2018not in custody, we focus solely on the question whether his statements were voluntary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Molina, </em>467 Mass. at 75, quoting <em>Durand, </em>457 Mass. at 595. The defendant argues that his statements on June 27 were not made freely or voluntarily and should therefore be suppressed. The Commonwealth counters that, given the totality of the interview\u2019s circumstances, the defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary and we should reverse the motion judge\u2019s order of suppression. We conclude that the Commonwealth has met its burden of establishing that the defendant\u2019s June 27 statements were voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u201c[Wjhere the police provide precustodial warnings but then ignore the defendant\u2019s attempts to avail himself of those rights, the \u2018coercive effect of continued interrogation [is] greatly increased because the suspect [could] believe that the police \u201cpromises\u201d to provide the suspect\u2019s constitutional rights were untrustworthy, and that the police would continue to\u2019 ignore subsequent invocations, rendering such invocations futile.\u201d <em>Baye, </em>462 Mass. at 263, quoting <em>Tukes </em>v. <em>Dugger, </em>911 F.2d 508, 516 n.11 (11th Cir. 1990), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Singletary </em>v. <em>Tukes, </em>502 U.S. 898 (1991). However, the totality of the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s June 27 statement was not sufficiently coercive to render his statements involuntary. Put another way, based on the record before us we cannot say that the will of the defendant was overborne.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The defendant\u2019s June 27 statements appear to be the result of free and voluntary acts, as the interview techniques employed by Haley were not so unfair or oppressive as to deprive the defendant of his rational intellect. The interview was reasonable in length, lasting approximately one and one-half hours. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brian, </em>445 Mass. 720, 728, cert. denied, 549 U.S. 898 (2006). Haley neither minimized the seriousness of the allegations the defendant faced nor made the defendant any promises. See, e.g., <em>Baye, </em>462 Mass. at 257; <em>Tremblay, </em>460 Mass. at 208-210; <em>Sneed, </em>440 Mass. at 222. Haley did not engage in any trickery, and this was not a case in which the police obtained a confession by materially misrepresenting the defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights. Contrast <em>Baye, supra </em>at 246, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>256-260 (statement involuntary where officers engaged in \u201cmultiple improprieties\u201d and employed deceptive tactics during ten-hour interrogation). Nor did he tell the defendant that this conversation was his sole opportunity to tell his story, that the strength of the evidence against the defendant was stronger than it was, or that he would charge the defendant with more serious crimes if the defendant did not confess. Contrast <em>Novo, </em>442 Mass. at 264-270 (statement involuntary where police officers repeatedly said interview was only chance for defendant to tell story).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The defendant was twenty-eight years of age, and while he appeared upset and nervous at points, there was no reason to question his mental capacity. Throughout the interview, the defendant appeared sober, alert, and lucid. He was coherent and articulate, and he consistently demonstrated his understanding of the nature of the interview. See <em>Molina, </em>467 Mass. at 77. Given the defendant\u2019s reference to a prior charge of operating while under the influence of alcohol, it was reasonable to infer that he had some prior experience with law enforcement officers and the court system. Significantly, the defendant\u2019s statements appeared to be the product of his own free will. He directly answered all questions and provided \u201cexculpatory explanation^] of events ... indicating an awareness of the consequences of . . . speaking to the police.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beland, </em>436 Mass. 273, 281 (2002). See <em>Durand, </em>457 Mass. at 597 (defendant\u2019s statement voluntary where \u201cable to decide what to tell the officers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">It is true that Haley provided the defendant with seemingly conflicting information with regard to obtaining appointed counsel. First, in the Miranda warnings, Haley advised the defendant that he had the right to an attorney (inferably at the interview), and that if he could not afford an attorney, one would be appointed for him. And, later, when the defendant asked whether if he needed a lawyer the court would appoint him one because he did not have the funds, Haley told him, \u201cthe court will appoint you a lawyer at arraignment\u201d \u201cif we get to that point.\u201d However, it does not appear that this conflicting advice coerced the defendant into making a statement. The defendant was consistently told that he did not have to say anything and could stop speaking at any time. Haley never suggested that he did not need a lawyer, and the defendant never unequivocally declared that he wanted one, only to be told that he could not have one.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Where the defendant had no right to appointed counsel because his interview was noncustodial and no legal proceedings had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>initiated against him, Haley\u2019s statements cannot be construed to be \u201cso manipulative . . . that they deprived [the defendant] of his ability to make an unconstrained, autonomous decision to [speak]\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Baye, </em>462 Mass. at 256. As \u201cthere is simply nothing about the interview . . . that suggests the defendant\u2019s will was overborne in any way,\u201d <em>Molina, </em>467 Mass. at 76, the totality of the circumstances supports the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s June 27 statements were voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">2. <em>June 28 statements. </em>On June 28, 2012, at approximately 12 p.m., Haley attended the forensic interview of K.C. at the Family Advocacy Center in Springfield, in which she alleged that the defendant had sexually abused her. Thereafter, at approximately 1:30 p.m., the defendant was arrested at the Palmer Division of the District Court Department where he was attending a restraining order hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">At the police station, the defendant was booked and fingerprinted. He met with Haley in the same room as the day prior. At the start of the interview, Haley read the defendant the Miranda rights, which the defendant waived in writing. Appearing disheveled and tired, the defendant said he had spent the prior night \u201cin [his] truck\u201d and later said he had not slept.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Haley then told the defendant that the police had uncovered additional evidence since the prior day and now knew that information the defendant had recounted was not true. He told the defendant that the police were positive \u201csome stuff\u2019 had been going on with K.C., and that the defendant was the one doing \u201cthese things.\u201d Haley asked the defendant to describe a \u201ctickle game\u201d that he played with his daughter. Regarding the defendant\u2019s previous denials, Haley said, \u201c[w]e\u2019re way beyond that now,\u201d and explained that he wanted to know what the defendant was \u201cgoing to take ownership of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">At this point, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">Defendant: \u201cI think with these questions I might need a lawyer.

Do I get bailed? Do I go \u2014 I mean, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>what measures do I need to take to, you know, find out, to make arrangements to figure out, you know, how I\u2019m?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">Haley: \u201cWell, I think I just mentioned to you that you\u2019re already under arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">Defendant: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">Haley: \u201cAnd I\u2019m still \u2014 it\u2019s still pending with me on what criminal charges I\u2019m going to bring against you.

I know you\u2019re not trying to be an ass----Very simply and equitably, right now, okay, we\u2019re on an interview here with the thing showing. Do you want to stop the interview and have a lawyer or do you want to talk to me for a while longer?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-12\">Defendant: \u201cI\u2019ll try to talk to you for a little while longer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3D\">Haley: \u201cSo right now you do not want a lawyer?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9q\">Defendant: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">During the ensuing interview that lasted less than one hour, Haley told the defendant, \u201cwe have clear-cut evidence that certain things happened here with this six year old, with you.\u201d Haley also told the defendant a few times that the police either knew K.C. had \u201cbeen penetrated\u201d or that they had \u201csome indication that she\u2019s been getting penetrated.\u201d The defendant made several incriminating statements, and admitted that while tickling K.C. on the previous day, she moved his hands to her inner thigh near her private parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-14\">In contrast to his June 27 interview, the defendant\u2019s June 28 interview was clearly custodial. He had been arrested, booked, and fingerprinted. Additionally, Haley explained to the defendant several times that he was under arrest and \u201clocked up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>The defendant argues that his June 28 statements should be suppressed because his Miranda waiver was invalid and Haley failed to cease questioning after the defendant invoked his right to counsel. The Commonwealth contends that the defendant validly waived the Miranda rights on June 28 and that Haley was entitled to continue questioning where the defendant did not unequivocally invoke his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u201c[Ajfter a knowing and voluntary waiver of the Miranda rights, law enforcement officers may continue questioning until and unless the suspect clearly requests an attorney.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Santos, 463 Mass. 273, 285 (2012), quoting <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 461 (1994). \u201cTo invoke the right to counsel, \u2018the suspect must unambiguously request counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morganti, </em>455 Mass. 388, 396-397 (2009), <em>S.C., </em>467 Mass. 96 (2014), quoting <em>Davis, supra </em>at 459. If a suspect makes reference to counsel in an ambiguous or equivocal manner such that \u201c \u2018a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect <em>might </em>be invoking the right to counsel,\u2019 the police questioning need not cease\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 397, quoting <em>Davis, supra. </em>Our precedent requires police to \u201c \u2018honor a decision of a person in custody to cut off questioning,\u2019 and prohibits such practices as \u2018refusing to discontinue the interrogation upon request\u2019 or \u2018persisting in repeated efforts to wear down [the defendant\u2019s] resistance and make him change his mind.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brum, </em>438 Mass. 103, 111 (2002), quoting <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 105-106 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The defendant\u2019s reference to counsel during his noncustodial June 27 interview did not preclude the resumption of questioning on June 28. Contrast <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Shatzer, </em>559 U.S. 98, 110 (2010) (custodial invocation of right to counsel followed by break in custody requires period of fourteen days before police may resume questioning); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>469 Mass. 531, 545-548 (2014). Moreover, the defendant\u2019s two direct references to counsel during the June 28 interview, after signing the Miranda waiver form, were equivocal. First, he said, \u201cI think with these questions I might need a lawyer. I don\u2019t know exactly what to say.\u201d Then, after being told by Haley, \u201cThis is your opportunity to say what\u2019s going on here .... If you want a lawyer I will shut this thing off right now and leave,\u201d the defendant subsequently asked, \u201cHow long would it take to get a lawyer here or an attorney?\u201d These remarks, as well as the defendant\u2019s ambiguous re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>sponses to Haley\u2019s direct lawyer-related questions, were not unequivocal refusals to speak until the defendant had an opportunity to confer with counsel. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>469 Mass. 786, 793, 796-797 (2014) (statement not suppressed where defendant asked officers whether he \u201cshould get a lawyer\u201d and said, \u201cI think I might need [a lawyer],\u201d and continued volunteering information about incident); <em>Morganti, </em>455 Mass. at 397-398 (defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cthinking I might need a lawyer and want to talk with him before talking to you,\u201d ruled too ambiguous to constitute unequivocal invocation of right to counsel).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The motion judge concluded, however, that when coupled with Haley\u2019s suggestion the day before that the defendant could only have a lawyer appointed for him by the court \u201cat arraignment,\u201d Haley\u2019s response to the defendant\u2019s question about \u201c[h]ow long\u201d it would take to \u201cget a lawyer here,\u201d specifically that the defendant had \u201ca right to call an attorney all you want,\u201d and \u201cthey don\u2019t just come running out and sit in an interview,\u201d \u201ceffectively precluded [the defendant] from understanding his ability to exercise his right to counsel\u201d at the custodial interview and, further, raised serious doubt that the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel was done knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">We agree. \u201cIn order for a waiver to be \u2018knowing\u2019 and \u2018intelligent,\u2019 the defendant must understand \u2018the [Miranda] warnings themselves.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hilton, </em>443 Mass. at 606, quoting <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. at 393. Where \u201cthe defendant manifestly did not understand the meaning of one or more of the rights described in the Miranda warnings, the Commonwealth cannot meet its burden of proving a valid waiver beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>461 Mass. 143, 153 (2011). Haley\u2019s statements that the right to appointed counsel does not attach until arraignment, that lawyers \u201cdon\u2019t just come running out and sit in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>interview,\u201d and that the defendant would have to \u201ccall\u201d a lawyer puts into question whether, having no funds to hire counsel, the defendant believed speaking with an attorney before speaking to the police was an actual possibility. That this fundamental misunderstanding went uncorrected hampers the Commonwealth in establishing, beyond a reasonable doubt, the validity of the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to consult with counsel. See <em>Clarke, </em>461 Mass, at 351 n.12. Therefore, the motion judge properly suppressed the defendant\u2019s June 28 statements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The suppression of the defendant\u2019s June 27 statements is reversed, and the suppression of the defendant\u2019s June 28 statements is affirmed.

See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>220 W. Va. 89, 98-99 (2006), overruled on other grounds by <em>State </em>v. <em>Eilola, </em>226 W.
