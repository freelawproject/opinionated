Although the plaintiff, Kristin Malloch, had scored highest on the civil service examination for promotion to a police sergeant position, the town decided to bypass Malloch and promote the candidates who had scored second and third highest on the sergeants\u2019 examination. Malloch appealed the town\u2019s decision to the Civil Service Commission (commission), pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2 <em>(b), </em>arguing that, where an appointing authority promotes a candidate other than the candidate ranked highest on the certification list, the promotion will not become effective until the appointing authority\u2019s written statement of reasons for the bypass \u201chas been received by the administrator,\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27; that \u201creceived\u201d in this context means substantially reviewed and approved by the administrator; and that the administrator<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> may not, in accordance with G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 5 (Z), delegate that function to the town\u2019s appointing authority. Malloch argued also that, even if the delegation were permissible, her bypass was not supported by evidence of a reasonable justification for the bypass. The commission denied her appeal, and Malloch sought review in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">Agreeing with Malloch that the statutory requirement that the written statement of bypass reasons must be \u201creceived by\u201d the administrator means \u201creviewed and approved by\u201d the adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>trator, a Superior Court judge concluded that it was not \u201cpracticable,\u201d see G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 5 (/), for the administrator to delegate that function. The judge allowed Malloch\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, ordered the town to submit its statement of bypass reasons to the human resources division (HRD), and remanded the matter to HRD and the commission, instructing HRD to decide, after having conducted a \u201csubstantive review,\u201d whether the bypass reasons should be approved. The administrator and the town, the defendants here,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> filed an appeal in the Appeals Court, and we allowed their petition for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">We conclude that the administrator may delegate its administrative function to receive statements of reasons supporting bypass promotions, and that it was \u201cpracticable,\u201d see G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 5 (/), to do so here. Because the judge remanded the matter to HRD to make such a determination without conducting his own review of whether the commission\u2019s determination was supported by substantial evidence, we vacate the judgment and remand the case to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Bypass of Malloch. </em>We briefly recite the facts found by the commission regarding Malloch\u2019s bypass, reserving the remaining facts for our subsequent discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">At the time of the decision to bypass Malloch, she had served as a police officer in the town for eight years. She was one of two female officers in the town. In October, 2011, Malloch took HRD\u2019s police sergeant promotional examination and received a score of eighty-six. In April, 2012, the town certified two vacant police sergeant positions. Malloch\u2019s name appeared first on the certification list provided to the town by HRD, ahead of three other officers. One of those officers subsequently withdrew his name from consideration. Malloch initially was interviewed by a panel of three senior police officers from the town and from neighboring municipalities; the panel ranked her last among the three candidates. She then was interviewed by the town manager and the chief of police, who also ranked her last. Based largely on these interviews, the town manager, who is the town\u2019s appointing authority, chose to bypass Malloch and promote the two other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">b. <em>HRD\u2019s delegation policy. </em>Effective September 1, 2009, HRD informed municipalities that it had delegated, pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 5 (Z), certain administrative functions to appointing authorities. In a memorandum issued in August, 2009, HRD wrote,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-6\">\u201cEach municipality will be responsible for . . . making appointments and promotions from the eligible list and providing bypass and selection reasons to the applicants in accordance with civil service law and rules. After August 31, 2009, HRD will no longer review and approve appointments and promotions. Appeals will be made directly to the [commission].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The memorandum further explained that HRD \u201cwill provide technical assistance as needed to assist the municipalities in making appointments and promotions from the eligible list.\u201d HRD sent \u201ca technical certification manual to each city and town,\u201d conducted training sessions to explain the type of analysis required, and provided a nonexclusive list of approved reasons for appointing authorities to consider when determining if a bypass promotion is reasonable. The manual states that reasons that are not specifically enumerated in that list \u201cmay be determined unacceptable.\u201d The manual notes also that the administrator retains the authority to audit appointing authorities to ensure compliance with civil service law.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">2. <em>Statutory framework. </em>General Laws c. 31 (civil service statute) governs civil service law in the Commonwealth and details the responsibilities and authority of the administrator, the commission,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the appointing authority.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">The civil service statute was first enacted in 1884. See St. 1884, c. 320. It created a three-member civil service commission to establish rules for the selection of civil service employees. See St. 1884, c. 320, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2. In 1939, the Massachusetts Special Commission Established to Study the Civil Service Laws, Rules and Regulations, with a View to Revision Thereof filed a report recommending that the commission no longer administer the civil service rules. See 1939 House Doc. No. 1722. Instead, it recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>mended, the \u201c[cjommission should be relieved of all technical and administrative matters. The only instances in which the [cjom-mission should function are in its participation in the adoption of rules, and hearing and deciding all appeals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Legislature adopted this report and created a separate agency, the HRD, to handle technical and administrative matters such as administering examinations and creating certified appointment lists. See St. 1939, c. 238, \u00a7 30. See also Note, The Massachusetts Civil Service Law: Is It Necessary to Destroy the Current System in Order to Save it?, 40 New Eng. L. Rev. 1103, 1106-1107 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The two separate entities have clear and distinct roles. The commission has the adjudicative duty to \u201chear and decide appeals by a person aggrieved by any decision, action, or failure to act by the administrator.\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2 <em>(b). </em>It also may hear appeals by persons aggrieved by a decision, action, or failure to act by the appointing authority. G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2 (c). By contrast, the administrator\u2019s duties, as detailed in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 5, are not adjudicative, but include, among other things, the duty to administer civil service law and rules, establish classification plans, conduct examinations, and maintain records. In creating the two separate agencies with separate roles, the Legislature indicated its intent that the commission adjudicate appeals and safeguard individual rights, while the administrator completes tasks necessary to the administration of the civil service system.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">To promote efficiency, the administrator has the power \u201c[t]o delegate the administrative functions of the civil service system, so far as practicable, to the various state agencies and cities and towns of the [C]ommonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 5 <em>(l). </em>Where an appointing authority identifies an open civil service position, the administrator has the duty to certify to the appointing authority eligible candidates for promotion or appointment. G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 25. The eligible candidates are listed in order of their civil service examination scores, with the inclusion of veterans\u2019 preferences. G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 26. An appointing authority may choose to promote a person other than the highest ranked candidate on the certification list. See <em>Brackett </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>447 Mass. 233, 253 (2006). Whenever an appointing authority chooses to bypass a higher-ranked candidate, it immediately must file a written statement of its reasons for appointing a candidate with a lower score. G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27. Such an appointment will not be effective until the written statement has been \u201creceived by\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>administrator.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>The question before us is whether the administrator permissibly delegated its function under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27, to appointing authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">We review questions of statutory interpretation de novo. <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>467 Mass. 734, 737 (2014). \u201cOur primary duty in interpreting a statute is \u2018to effectuate the intent of the Legislature in enacting it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Water Dep\u2019t of Fairhaven </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>455 Mass. 740, 744 (2010), quoting <em>International Org. of Masters </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., </em>392 Mass. 811, 813 (1984). We begin our analysis with the statutory language. \u201cOrdinarily, where the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, it is conclusive as to legislative intent.\u201d <em>Thurdin </em>v. <em>SEI Boston, LLC, </em>452 Mass. 436, 444 (2008). Accordingly, where the statutory language is clear, we must \u201cgive effect to the plain and ordinary meaning of the language\u201d (citation omitted), <em>Morales </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>464 Mass. 507, 511 (2013), \u201cin light of the aim of the Legislature,\u201d unless to do so would produce an \u201cabsurd\u201d or \u201cillogical\u201d result. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass. 353, 360 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">a. <em>HRD\u2019s authority to delegate. </em>Pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 5 (/), the administrator has the power \u201c[t]o delegate the administrative functions of the civil service system, so far as practicable, to the various state agencies and cities and towns of the [C]ommon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>wealth.\u201d The plain language of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 5 (Z), thus affords the administrator broad authority to delegate its administrative functions, with one limitation: any such delegation must be \u201cpracticable.\u201d \u201cPracticable\u201d commonly is defined as \u201c[c]apable of being effected, done, or put into practice; feasible.\u201d See American Heritage Dictionary 1421 (3d ed. 1992). Thus, in order to determine whether HRD\u2019s delegation was permissible, we assess whether the delegation was feasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">b. <em>Receipt of bypass statement. </em>In reaching his conclusion that HRD\u2019s delegation of receipt of bypass reasons was impermissible, the Superior Court judge interpreted the statutory requirement that the statement of such reasons must have \u201cbeen received\u201d by the administrator, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27, as also requiring the administrator to conduct a substantive review of the appointing authority\u2019s statement of reasons for the bypass, and to approve those reasons, in order for an appointment or promotion to become effective. The judge determined that it was not practicable for an appointing authority to conduct a review of its own reasons for a bypass.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">On appeal, Malloch contends similarly that HRD\u2019s delegation was not practicable, because G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27, requires the administrator to receive and approve the appointing authority\u2019s reasons for a bypass promotion, and it is not feasible for an appointing authority to approve its own reasons for its decision to bypass a higher-ranked candidate. Because we conclude that the statutory language means precisely what it says \u2014 that the administrator must have \u201creceived\u201d the statement of bypass reasons before an appointment becomes effective \u2014 we do not agree that HRD\u2019s delegation to municipalities, as appointing authorities, was not \u201cpracticable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">In ordinary usage, \u201creceive\u201d means \u201cto take into one\u2019s possession (something offered or delivered)\u201d; \u201cto have (something) bestowed [or] conferred\u201d; \u201cto have delivered or brought to one\u201d; and \u201cto get or be informed of.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary 1610 (1996). The statutory language thus indicates that the Legislature did not intend to require the administrator to approve a list of bypass reasons. To the contrary, other definitions of \u201creceive\u201d include \u201cto accept from another\u201d; \u201cto hold, bear, or contain\u201d; and \u201cto accept as authoritative, valid, true, or approved,\u201d <em>id., </em>suggesting that the administrator is to accept an appointing authority\u2019s reasons, as stated, rather than to approve them. This reading of the administrator\u2019s duty to accept and hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>the statement of reasons is supported by subsequent language in the same paragraph of the statute. General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 27, provides also that an appointing authority must \u201cimmediately file\u201d its written statement of reasons for a bypass with the administrator, and that the administrator must make such statements available for public inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">We read G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27, to require only receipt of bypass reasons by the administrator, and not approval thereof. To conclude otherwise in essence would require that we \u201cread into [the] statute a provision which the Legislature did not see fit to put there, [and to] add words that the Legislature had an option to, but chose not to include.\u201d See <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>458 Mass. 561, 567 (2010), citing <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>429 Mass. 798, 803 (1999). The Legislature\u2019s choice is clear when we \u201cread the statute as a whole.\u201d <em>Care &amp; Protection of Jamison, </em>467 Mass. 269, 276 (2014). In other parts of the civil service statute, where the Legislature intended the administrator to approve or authorize the actions of the appointing authority, it stated so explicitly. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>462 Mass. 676, 682 (2012) (\u201cWhere the Legislature used different language in different paragraphs of the same statute, it intended different meanings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">For instance, the Legislature gave the administrator the power and duty to \u201capprove or disapprove specifications and qualifications submitted by an appointing authority . . . , for any civil service position.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 5 (c). The Legislature provided the administrator with similar approval authority for provisional promotions and appointments. Under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 15, which governs provisional promotions, \u201c[a]n appointing authority may, with the approval of the administrator . . . , make a provisional promotion of a civil service employee in one title to the next higher title in the same departmental unit.\u201d See <em>Kelleher </em>v. <em>Personnel Adm\u2019r of the Dep\u2019t of Personnel Admin., </em>421 Mass. 382, 385-386 (1995) (construing level of scrutiny that should be used by administrator in approving provisional appointments). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>Similarly, under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 12, which governs provisional appointments, \u201c[a]n appointing authority may make a provisional appointment to a position in the official service with the authorization of the administrator.\u201d See <em>Kelleher </em>v. <em>Personnel Adm\u2019r of the Dep\u2019t of Personnel Admin., supra </em>at 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Moreover, it is the role of the commission, rather than of the administrator, to adjudicate bypass appeals in civil service appointments, in part by reviewing statements of reasons for a bypass and determining whether there is a \u201creasonable justification, \u2018sufficiently supported by credible evidence,\u2019 \u201d for the bypass. See <em>Police Dep\u2019t of Boston </em>v. <em>Kavaleski, </em>463 Mass. 680, 688 (2012) <em>(Kavaleski), </em>quoting <em>Brackett </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>447 Mass. 233, 241 (2006). We interpret separate sections of statutes as a whole, to produce internal consistency, <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. of Boston, </em>438 Mass. 187, 194 (2002), citing <em>Acting Supt. of Bournewood Hosp. </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>431 Mass. 101, 104 (2000), and to give a \u201crational and workable effect.\u201d <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. of Boston, supra </em>at 192, citing <em>School Comm. of Gloucester </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>324 Mass. 209, 212 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The legislative history in enacting G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27, further supports our reading. General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 27, originally was codified by St. 1945, c. 704, \u00a7 4, as G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 15 (c).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 10Before the law was codified in 1945, the Report of the Special Commission Studying Civil Service Laws, Rules and Regulations (Jan. 1943), 1943 House Doc. No. 1333, at 5, recommended that \u201cwhen the appointing authority names some one other than the person who is number one on the civil service list, the appointing official shall give the Director of Civil Service[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] his reasons for passing over the person or persons at the head of the list. These reasons shall be in writing . . . [and are] to be available for examination by the person or persons passed over.\u201d Another legislative report, Report of the Special Recess Commission Studying Civil Service Laws, Rules and Regulations (Jan. 1945), 1945 House Doc. No. 1675, at 6, similarly proposed that appoint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>ing authorities \u201cbe required to give reasons in writing for passing over persons at the head of civil service lists.\u201d The Legislature adopted these recommendations when it enacted St. 1945, c. 704, \u00a7 4. Thus, the purpose behind the administrator\u2019s receipt of bypass reasons was not to require the administrator\u2019s review but, rather, to make those reasons known and available in writing for bypassed candidates to examine in deciding whether to pursue an appeal. See 1943 House Doc. No. 1333, at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">In sum, we see no support for Malloch\u2019s contention that the administrator is required to conduct an independent review of a written statement of reasons where the Legislature did not plainly state its intention that the administrator do so, and explicitly awarded such adjudicative duties to the commission. See <em>Staveley </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 400, 407 (2008) (\u201cthe administrator\u2019s powers of delegation must be viewed in the context of the Legislature\u2019s decision to charge the commission with responsibility for smooth and consistent operation of [the civil service] system\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">c. <em>Delegation of functions under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27. </em>Nothing in the language of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27, explicitly prohibits delegation of functions by the administrator, nor does G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 5 <em>if), </em>contain language prohibiting such delegation. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schs. of Worcester, </em>421 Mass. 117, 128 (1995) (\u201cIf the Legislature intentionally omits language from a statute, no court can supply it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Conceding that the statutory language does not prohibit delegation of the administrator\u2019s authority under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27, Malloch relies on language in <em>MacHenry </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 632, 635 (1996) <em>(MacHenry), </em>in support of her argument that the administrator may not delegate its function to \u201creceive\u201d statements of bypass reasons. Malloch argues that <em>MacHenry </em>holds that G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27, requires the administrator to review and approve statements of reasons for a bypass. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">In <em>MacHenry, </em>the issue before the Appeals Court was whether the statutory scheme authorized the administrator to undertake to conduct a review of a statement of bypass reasons, or whether an appointment became effective \u201cmerely upon receipt by [the administrator] of the statement of reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634. The court noted several earlier decisions of this court and the Appeals Court where the administrator\u2019s role had \u201cnot [been] confined to mere \u2018receipt\u2019 but [had been] seen [in dicta] to involve acceptance or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>approval of the statement of reasons,\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s presumptive knowledge of those decisions\u201d indicated that this interpretation was correct. <em>Id. </em>at 635. The court did not address whether G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27, required the administrator to approve statements of bypass reasons, but suggested that it was reasonable to conclude that the statute authorized the administrator to approve or affirm such statements.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>MacHenry, supra </em>at 635. The court based its conclusion, in large part, on language in <em>Bielawski </em>v. <em>Personnel Adm\u2019r of the Div. of Personnel Admin., </em>422 Mass. 459, 466 (1996) (Bielawski). Like <em>MacHenry, Bielawski </em>did not hold that G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27, required the administrator\u2019s review,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> nor did the other cases cited in <em>Mac-Henry, supra. </em>See <em>Goldblatt </em>v. <em>Corporation Counsel of Boston, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>360 Mass. 660, 662 (1971); <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 206, 207 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">None of these cases concluded or relied upon a determination that G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27, requires the personnel administrator to review substantively an appointing authority\u2019s statement of reasons for a bypass, and we make explicit today that the statute contains no such requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">We agree with the Appeals Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>MacHenry, supra, </em>that the administrator is charged with evaluating the qualifications of applicants for civil service positions according to \u201cbasic merit principles,\u201d see G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 1 (defining term), and must administer, enforce, and comply with civil service law, pursuant to G. L. c. 31. To ensure that appointments and promotions are made only from a properly certified eligibility list, for instance, the administrator has implemented a rule that no appointment or promotion will be deemed effective until the appointing authority has \u201cnotified the administrator in writing that such person has been so appointed or promoted, or that the appointing authority has notified the administrator of its intent to appoint or promote such person, if the appointment or promotion must be delayed due to the scheduling of any training required by statute, or municipal ordinance or by-law, or departmental rule.\u201d Personnel Administration Rules par. 08(3) (effective May 1, 2010). If at any point, before or after it issues the certification, the administrator finds that the certification (based on an examination conducted by the administrator) was made in error, or a candidate was placed on the eligible list through mistake or fraud, the administrator may revoke the appointment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">The administrator may, in accordance with his or her duty, facially examine a written statement of bypass reasons to determine whether the candidate chosen satisfies the requirements for the position (as established by the administrator). Indeed, in <em>MacHenry, </em>the personnel administrator did just that, and found the statement of reasons for a bypass deficient because education, cited as a reason, already had been included in determining the candidates\u2019 civil service examination scores, which the administrator assigns. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 5 (e) (giving personnel administrator purview over civil service examinations). See also Charton &amp; Groll, A Civil Service Action: Hiring, Promotion, and Discipline at the Civil Service Commission (1999); Personnel Administration Rules par. 08(5), <em>supra. </em>The administrator is not, however, obligated to assume an adjudicatory role by substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>tively reviewing and approving an appointing authority\u2019s decision to bypass a candidate.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">We therefore conclude that the administrator permissibly could delegate its administrative functions under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27. Cf. <em>Staveley </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 400, 404-405 (2008) (determining that administrator may, pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 5 [Z], delegate its responsibility to create and administer process that produces civil service eligibility lists).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Malloch makes no additional arguments that delegation to the appointing authorities was impracticable, and we discern no such bar. According to the record, the administrator trained appointing authorities, provided each authority with a manual detailing acceptable and unacceptable reasons for a bypass, and retained the authority to audit appointing authorities to ensure compliance with basic merit principles. These efforts make it practicable for appointing authorities to create statements of bypass reasons and send them to bypassed candidates, safeguarding basic merit principles and allowing aggrieved candidates to obtain review by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">d. <em>Application to Malloch\u2019s bypass. </em>Having concluded that the administrator\u2019s delegation of receipt of the statement of bypass reasons was proper, we turn to a consideration of the commission\u2019s decision affirming Malloch\u2019s bypass. \u201cWe may set aside or modify an agency decision if we determine \u2018that the substantial rights of any party may have been prejudiced\u2019 because the agency decision is in violation of constitutional provisions; in excess of statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency; based on an error of law; made on unlawful procedure; unsupported by substantial evidence; unwarranted by the facts found by the court on the record as submitted or as amplified; or arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d <em>Rivas </em>v. <em>Chelsea Housing Auth., </em>464 Mass. 329, 334 (2013), quoting G.

See <em>id., </em>and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">i. <em>Conduct of the interviews. </em>The town\u2019s chief of police, Walter L. Sweeney, Jr., assembled an interview panel consisting of Hanover police Lieutenant Gregory Nihan, Marshfield police Captain Michael J. McDonough, and Rockland police Lieutenant Nicholas Zeoli.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In addition to Malloch, the two other candidates were Officer Thomas Burke (a pseudonym), who ranked second on the certification list, and Officer David Williams (also a pseudonym), who ranked third.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The panel asked each of the three candidates the same ten interview questions, which the commission deemed \u201cappropriate, job-related questions gauged to assess a candidate\u2019s ability to perform the duties of a police sergeant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">The panel interviewed the candidates in the order in which they appeared on the certification list. The panelists took notes and rated each candidate on a score sheet using a scale of 1 to 5 in each of four categories: communication skills, poise-presentation, appearance, and response to questions. After the interviews, the panel ranked Burke first, Williams second, and Malloch third, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>with average interview scores of 5, 4.6, and 3.5, respectively. The panelists compiled their notes into written statements; they delivered their score sheets and statements to Zeoli, who summarized their recommendations and submitted his written summary to the chief of police and the town manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">As to Malloch\u2019s score, panel members commented that she was \u201cnervous\u201d; lacked \u201ccommand presence\u201d; did not identify herself as a \u201cgo-to person\u201d on her shift; and, of particular concern, did not offer a tactical plan in response to a question on a hypothetical shooting, responding merely that \u201cwe go in.\u201d Citing Malloch\u2019s response to a question on her \u201cleadership style,\u201d the panel expressed concerns that Malloch\u2019s answer that she \u201ctends to ask a lot of questions of officers\u201d indicated a lack of decision-making ability or knowledge about her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">The panel noted also that Malloch\u2019s answer to the question on how to improve the operational efficiency of the department \u201cdid not appropriately address the question.\u201d The panel\u2019s report stated that Malloch responded that she would improve efficiency by \u201cmak[ing] sure the officers went out on the road.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> One of the other two candidates suggested a mentoring program for officers who had passed a \u201cbreak-in period,\u201d and another suggested a revamped field training program for new officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">In contrast to the positive assessment of Williams\u2019s honesty in not giving a response that they \u201cwanted to hear\u201d concerning an atypical answer to another question, none of the interviewers made any comment on candor or forthrightness in Malloch\u2019s response. Indeed, one of the panel members commented that Williams\u2019s answer on the efficiency question was \u201cmore adequate,\u201d because he \u201ctalked a lot about officers being on time, being accountable, being held accountable, things like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">Before the panel delivered its report, Nihan advised Sweeney verbally of the panel\u2019s rankings, which he described as \u201cclear cut.\u201d Sweeney then summarized this discussion to the town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>manager, Troy Clarkson, before they conducted their interview of the candidates and before the panel\u2019s report had been received; he explained that the panel had considered Burke \u201cfar and above the other two people\u201d and as \u201can outstanding candidate of the three,\u201d that \u201c[Williams] had ranked number two,\u201d and that Malloch \u201chad ranked number three.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Sweeney testified to the commission that he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by the panel\u2019s ranking. He said Burke \u201cseems to be someone that gets out in front of things and people will tend to follow him,\u201d and that he had seen \u201cother officers around the station from time to time\u201d asking Williams questions and that he thought Williams had \u201cgiven good sound advice.\u201d As to Malloch, his general impression was \u201cthat she does a good job. She handles her calls in an efficient manner. I think she gives a very good effort every time that she comes to work, but she is not someone that I see as taking a leadership or taking the lead on things [,] more of a person that needs to be reassured sometimes that she\u2019s doing the right thing and exhibits a desire to get a collective opinion on things versus just leading the charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">The chief of police and the town manager then conducted a second round interview with each of the candidates. The interviews lasted from thirty to forty-five minutes. Clarkson asked each candidate two questions: (1) \u201cWhat is the last book you read?\u201d (Clarkson testified that he asked the candidate\u2019s \u201cfavorite book\u201d);<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and (2) \u201cExplain the difference between management and leadership?\u201d With regard to the first question, Clarkson was attempting to gauge how each candidate would respond to an \u201cout of the box\u201d question. In posing the second question, Clarkson wanted to know if the candidate understood the difference between the administrative and operational duties associated with being a manager as opposed to having the leadership skills to inspire, motivate, and lead others.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>Malloch did not offer a \u201ccomplete response\u201d to the second question, and did not return to the question later in the interview. By contrast, Burke\u2019s and Williams\u2019s answers convinced Clarkson that they understood the difference between management and leadership. Clarkson decided that Burke and Wiliams were the top two candidates, and Malloch was not ready to serve in a leadership position; Sweeney agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">ii. <em>Bypass promotion and commission\u2019s review. </em>After reviewing the written summary from the interview panel, his own recollection of the candidates\u2019 second interviews, and the police chief\u2019s recommendation, Clarkson opted to bypass Malloch and to appoint Burke and Wiliams. Clarkson noted, \u201cOfficer Burke and Officer Wiliams were far better suited to hold a position of rank and authority in a police department in a paramilitary organization.\u201d Clarkson wrote Malloch a bypass letter containing his reasons for the bypass, with instructions on how she could pursue an appeal to the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">While expressing some concern about the categories used for ranking the candidates, the \u201crehearsed and exaggerated\u201d nature of some of the testimony, such as \u201ccomments about the nervousness of [Malloch] ... as compared to the nervousness of one of the male candidates,\u201d and the \u201csomewhat uniform nature of the testimony from the [t]own\u2019s sequestered witnesses,\u201d the commission found that the town had reasonable justification, by a preponderance of the evidence, to bypass Malloch.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">iii. <em>Reasons for remand. </em>During argument before us, as she did before the commission and in the Superior Court, Malloch argued that her bypass was based, at least in part, on her gender. \u201cThe fundamental purpose of the civil service system is to guard against political considerations, favoritism, and bias in governmental hiring and promotion.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Minority Law Enforcement Officers </em>v. <em>Abban, </em>434 Mass. 256, 260 (2001), citing <em>Cambridge </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 300, 304 (1997). The commission may, and indeed should, closely scrutinize appointments and promotions \u201c[w]hen there are, in connection with personnel decisions, overtones of political control or objectives unrelated to merit standards or neutrally applied public policy.\u201d <em>Cambridge </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Significantly, although it ultimately affirmed Malloch\u2019s bypass, the commission noted that there were a number of factors in this case supporting a concern that gender bias might have played a role in the bypass determination, which would be a violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>basic merit principles.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We share the commission\u2019s stated concerns. Where there are overtones of gender bias, any proffered justification for a bypass must be weighed carefully to ensure decision-making in accordance with basic merit principles. See <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Minority Law Enforcement Officers </em>v. <em>Abban, supra </em>at 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Because the Superior Court judge, having concluded that delegation was impermissible, had ordered the matter remanded to HRD for a \u201csubstantive review,\u201d he did not conduct a substantive review, pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, of the commission\u2019s decision, and had no opportunity to consider whether the commission\u2019s determination that Malloch\u2019s gender was not a factor in her bypass was supported by substantial evidence and not an abuse of discretion or an error of law. Moreover, while the parties contest whether the bypass decision was based on impermissible reasons, the focus of their arguments before us was whether the administrator erred in delegating its duty under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27, and should have conducted its own substantive review of the town\u2019s asserted reasons for the bypass, precisely to consider whether the bypass was based on merit principles and was made \u201cupon adequate reasons sufficiently supported by credible evidence, when weighed by an unprejudiced mind, guided by common sense and by correct rules of law.\u201d See <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Minority Law Enforcement Officers </em>v. <em>Abban, supra </em>at 260, quoting <em>Selectmen of Wakefield </em>v. <em>Judge of First Dist. Court of E. Middlesex, </em>262 Mass. 477, 482 (1928). Thus, the parties\u2019 briefs do not address in detail the substance of the asserted errors by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>Accordingly, we vacate the judge\u2019s order entering judgment on the pleadings and remanding the case to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>administrator.
