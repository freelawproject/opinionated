R. Crim. P. 34, as amended, 442 Mass. 1501 (2004),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> concerning G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 56A (\u00a7 56A), a statute enacted in 2014 as one component of a comprehensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>package of legislation entitled \u201cAn Act relative to domestic violence.\u201d See St. 2014, c. 260, \u00a7 30. Section \u00a7 56A requires that in every case in which a person is arrested and charged with a crime against the person or property, if the Commonwealth alleges that domestic abuse occurred \u201cimmediately prior to or in conjunction with\u201d the charged crime, the Commonwealth is to file a written statement that it does so allege, the judge is to make a written ruling that the Commonwealth does so allege, and the Commonwealth\u2019s written statement is then to be entered into the Statewide domestic violence record keeping system (DVRS). For the reasons we discuss hereafter, we interpret \u00a7 56A to mean that before a judge makes a \u201cwritten ruling that abuse is alleged in connection with the charged offense,\u201d the judge must inquire into and be satisfied that there is an adequate factual basis for the allegations of abuse made by the Commonwealth. In light of our construction of the statute\u2019s terms, we do not reach the constitutional claims raised by the judge\u2019s report and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\"><em>Background. </em>Framingham police officers arrested the defendant, Douglas Dossantos, on August 24, 2014. According to the police report, the defendant, who was trying to retrieve personal belongings from his wife\u2019s house, attempted to enter the house by pushing an air conditioning unit in through a window. When the defendant\u2019s wife saw the defendant at the window, she let him inside the house; as the defendant entered, he pushed her aside, causing her to lose her balance but causing no physical injury. A criminal complaint issued from the Framingham Division of the District Court Department charging the defendant with one count of assault and battery on a family or household member in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13M (a).* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Upon arraignment, a District Court judge released the defendant on conditions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to the defendant\u2019s release, the Commonwealth submitted a preliminary written statement pursuant to \u00a7 5 6A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>alleging that domestic abuse occurred immediately prior to or in conjunction with the defendant\u2019s charged offense. The judge declined to make a \u201cwritten ruling that [domestic] abuse is alleged in connection with the charged offense,\u201d see \u00a7 56A, but instead reported the case to the Appeals Court pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. R 34. In his report, the judge opined that \u00a7 56A in part violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional guarantee of due process, and suggested that the statute may violate the separation of powers guarantee of art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights by interfering with the judicial function. The case was entered in the Appeals Court, and we granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Section 56A, the text of which is quoted in the margin,* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides that before a judge releases, discharges, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>admits to bail a person charged with any crime \u201cagainst the person or property of another,\u201d the judge must ask the prosecutor whether the Commonwealth alleges that domestic abuse \u201coccurred immediately prior to or in conjunction with the crime for which the person was arrested and charged.\u201d If the Commonwealth alleges that domestic abuse occurred, the prosecutor must file a \u201cpreliminary written statement,\u201d and the judge must then \u201cmake a written ruling that abuse is alleged in connection with the charged offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This preliminary written statement is to be maintained in the DVRS, but it is not considered a public record or criminal offender record information, and is not available for public inspection. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Section 56A also provides that if the crime that triggered the Commonwealth\u2019s preliminary written statement of abuse is ultimately disposed of by (1) a finding of not guilty, (2) a \u201cno bill\u201d returned by the grand jury, or (3) a finding of no probable cause by the court, the preliminary written statement is to be removed from the DVRS. In the event of a dismissal of the charge, however, the statement of abuse is not \u201celigible for removal\u201d from the DVRS. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The DVRS is a registry of sorts, established by the commissioner of probation pursuant to a statutory directive originally enacted in 1992, and includes, among others, records of the issuance of and any violations of criminal or civil restraining or protective orders. St. 1992, c. 188, \u00a7 7.* *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Vaccaro </em>v. <em>Vaccaro, </em>425 Mass. 153, 155 (1997). Records in the DVRS are available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>only to law enforcement and \u201cjudges considering petitions or complaints\u201d for restraining and protective orders. See St. 1992, c. 188, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Consistent with the reporting judge\u2019s view, the defendant contends that \u00a7 56A requires a judge automatically to affirm the Commonwealth\u2019s allegation of domestic abuse and cause the allegation to be recorded in the DVRS, and that this requirement for judicial rubber stamping of the prosecutor\u2019s abuse allegation violates his right to due process. Also consistent with the reporting judge, the defendant further asserts that this mandate of \u00a7 56A contravenes art. 30 by dictating that the executive branch usurp the fact-finding authority of the judiciary. We consider the defendant\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">1. <em>Due process. </em>The defendant, citing <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976), contends that \u00a7 56A offends due process because, as he construes the statute, a judge must sirpply affirm the Commonwealth\u2019s allegation of domestic abuse in writing without making any independent determination whether the allegation has any validity, and must then cause the allegation of abuse to be entered into the DVRS \u2014 with the consequence, he argues, that thereafter the defendant is labeled as an \u201cabuser\u201d in the \u201ceyes of the State,\u201d and his \u201crights in a host of arenas in which the [DVRS] plays a role\u201d are compromised. In the defendant\u2019s view, due process requirements demand that the judge play a meaningful role in assessing the substance of the Commonwealth\u2019s allegation of domestic abuse. The thrust of the Commonwealth\u2019s response is that a judge, in making a \u201cruling\u201d under \u00a7 56A that the Commonwealth alleges that domestic abuse occurred in connection with the charged offense, is performing purely a record-keeping function that does not implicate a liberty interest or indeed any protectable interest of a defendant, and therefore does not raise any due process concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">We disagree with the Commonwealth that \u00a7 56A is simply a record-keeping mechanism that has no consequences for the defendant. As the defendant notes, there are various legal proceedings in which a judge may rely on the Commonwealth\u2019s written statement of abuse allegation, entered into the DVRS pursuant to \u00a7 56A. See, e.g., G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34D (judge considering request for restraining order or order for spouse to vacate marital home must search DVRS to determine whether defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>has history of domestic abuse).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, we need not reach the claim that \u00a7 56A violates constitutional due process guarantees because we interpret the statute\u2019s language to require, in a case in which \u00a7 56A comes into play, that before making the statutorily-mandated \u201cruling,\u201d the judge must conduct a preliminary inquiry to determine that the Commonwealth\u2019s allegation of domestic abuse has sufficient factual support to warrant its entry into the DVRS for reference and use in later proceedings. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Disler, </em>451 Mass. 216, 228 (2008), quoting <em>Staman </em>v. <em>Assessors of Chatham, </em>351 Mass. 479, 487 (1966) (\u201cDoubts as to a statute\u2019s constitutionality \u2018should be avoided if reasonable principles of interpretation permit doing so\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The judge\u2019s report focuses on the first four sentences of \u00a7 56A:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">\u201c[1] Before a judge ... releases, discharges or admits to bail any person arrested and charged with a crime against the person or property of another, the judicial officer shall inquire of the commonwealth as to whether abuse ... is alleged to have occurred immediately prior to or in conjunction with the crime for which the person was arrested and charged. [2] The commonwealth shall file a preliminary written statement if it is alleged that abuse has so occurred. [3] The judicial officer shall make a written ruling that abuse is alleged in connection with the charged offense. [4] Such preliminary written statement shall be maintained within the [DVRS].\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">In seeking to interpret these sentences, we follow the familiar rule that a statute is to be construed \u201cso that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous\u201d (quotations and citation omitted). <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em>440 Mass. 699, 704 (2004). If the third sentence of the statute means only that, where the Commonwealth answers \u201cyes\u201d to the judge\u2019s question whether abuse is alleged to have occurred in connection with the charged offense and the Commonwealth files a written statement so stating, the judge is then required by the statute to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>\u201crule\u201d that abuse is alleged to have occurred, the third sentence, in terms of substance, would indeed be superfluous. That is, the second sentence directs the Commonwealth, where it alleges that abuse occurred in connection with the charged crime, to file a \u201cpreliminary written statement\u201d so stating, and the fourth sentence directs that the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cpreliminary written statement\u201d be maintained within the DVRS. A written \u201cruling\u201d by the judge acknowledging that, just as its preliminary written statement states, the Commonwealth alleges abuse has occurred is essentially a formal gesture that adds nothing material to the equation.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Moreover, interpreting \u00a7 56A as giving the judge simply the ministerial role of confirming that the Commonwealth states it has alleged abuse would strip the word or term \u201cruling\u201d of its typical significance. \u201cRuling,\u201d when used in connection with a court or judge, generally connotes an act involving judgment, and signifies more than the act of signing a preliminary written statement prepared by a prosecutor. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1533 (10th ed. 2014), quoting R.E. Keeton, Judging 67-68 (1990) (defining \u201cruling\u201d as \u201coutcome of a court\u2019s decision either on some point of law or on the case as a whole,\u201d and noting that \u201cin common usage \u2018legal ruling\u2019 [or simply \u2018ruling\u2019] is a term ordinarily used to signify the outcome of applying a legal test when that outcome is one of relatively narrow impact\u201d). Cf., e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spagnolo, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 516, 517 (1984) (discussing standard of review of ruling on motion to suppress, and implying judge\u2019s \u201cruling\u201d involves exercise of judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">To give meaning to the reference to the judge\u2019s \u201cruling\u201d \u2014 and more particularly the statute\u2019s phrase, \u201ca written ruling that abuse is alleged in connection with the charged offense,\u201d in the third sentence of \u00a7 56A \u2014 it is appropriate to interpret the sentence to incorporate a requirement that the judge be satisfied that there is an adequate factual basis underlying the Commonwealth\u2019s allegation of abuse before making the ruling. Determining whether there is an adequate factual basis does not mean that the judge must determine that there is probable cause to believe that abuse occurred in connection with the charged offense. As is made plain by the second paragraph of \u00a7 56A, which requires the removal of an abuse allegation that is being maintained on the DVRS if \u201ca finding of no probable cause has been made by the court,\u201d the Legislature clearly knew how to reference a probable cause standard, and chose not to do so in defining the judge\u2019s role in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>connection with the initial placement of an abuse allegation statement in the DVRS. See, e.g., <em>Nguyen </em>v. <em>William Joiner Ctr. for the Study of War &amp; Social </em>Consequences, 450 Mass. 291, 301 (2007) (\u201cBecause the Legislature knew how to reference employees specifically when it wanted to, its use of the words \u2018any person\u2019 in [the provision of the statute at issue] cannot reasonably be construed to include prospective employees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Rather, the judge must undertake an inquiry sufficient to determine that the alleged facts supporting the Commonwealth\u2019s proffered allegation of abuse, if deemed credible by a fact finder, would be sufficient to warrant or justify a finding of \u201cabuse,\u201d as the term is defined in G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1. More specifically, the judge must review information concerning the abuse allegation proffered by the Commonwealth \u2014 which is likely to consist of a police report, but might include other material \u2014 and then decide whether this information, assuming its credibility, would support a finding of \u201cabuse.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To accomplish this task, the judge is not required to take evidence or hold a separate hearing; presumably, the inquiry we describe here will be undertaken at the time of arraignment in conjunction with the judge\u2019s bail determination, as \u00a7 56A clearly appears to contemplate. See \u00a7 56A, first par. In addition, although \u00a7 56A requires the judge\u2019s \u201cruling that abuse is alleged in connection with the charged offense\u201d to be in writing, the judge\u2019s determination of an adequate factual basis for the Commonwealth\u2019s allegation of abuse need not take the form of separate written findings. It must be clear from the record, however, that the judge did determine that a sufficient factual basis supporting the Commonwealth\u2019s allegation of abuse exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">2. <em>Separation of powers. </em>Our conclusion that \u00a7 56A requires a judge to make an independent determination that the case record provides an adequate factual basis to support an allegation of domestic abuse obviates the need to consider the argument \u2014 made explicitly by the defendant and implicitly in the judge\u2019s report \u2014 that \u00a7 56A violates art. 30 by permitting the executive branch to usurp and thereby interfere with the judiciary\u2019s \u201ccore\u201d function of fact finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We respond to the judge\u2019s report as follows: G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 56A, first par., requires that before making \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>written ruling that abuse is alleged in connection with the charged offense,\u201d a judge must first inquire into and be satisfied that there is an adequate factual basis for the Commonwealth\u2019s allegation of abuse. In view of this response, we decline to consider the constitutional questions contained in the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-16\">Rule 34 of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, as amended, 442 Mass. 1501 (2004), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-17\">\u201cIf, prior to trial, or, with the consent of the defendant, after conviction of the defendant, a question of law arises which the trial judge determines is so important or doubtful as to require the decision of the Appeals Court, the judge may report the case so far as necessary to present the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>of law arising therein.
