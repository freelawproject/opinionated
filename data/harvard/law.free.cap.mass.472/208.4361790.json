We conclude that a judge may exercise the court\u2019s inherent power to sanction an attorney with an assessment of attorney\u2019s fees only if the attorney has engaged in misconduct that threatens the fair administration of justice and the sanction is necessary to preserve the judge\u2019s authority to administer justice. Because we conclude that the judge abused his discretion in exercising the court\u2019s inherent powers to sanction the attorney under the circumstances in this case, and that the attorney\u2019s alleged misconduct was more appropriately addressed by a referral to the Board of Bar Overseers (board), we reverse the judge\u2019s order imposing sanctions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\"><em>Background. </em>Attorney Richard Goren was the attorney for Cheng Lee Co., Inc. (Cheng Lee), one of the plaintiffs in a complex litigation in the Superior Court arising out of the attempted sale of three supermarkets in the Boston area (the Super 88 stores). Eight cases, later consolidated, were brought by three groups of plaintiffs: the \u201ctrade creditors\u201d (vendors of the Super 88 stores, including Cheng Lee, the \u201cHop Lee\u201d plaintiffs, and the \u201cTin World\u201d plaintiffs); the \u201cworkers\u201d (former employees of the Super 88 stores asserting class action wage claims); and the \u201casset purchasers\u201d (aggrieved attempted purchasers of the Super 88 stores). The cases were brought against three groups of defendants: the \u201cSuper 88 defendants\u201d (corporate entities and principals of the Super 88 stores); the \u201cHong Kong Supermarket defendants\u201d (the prospective purchasers of the Super 88 stores); and the \u201clenders\u201d (financial institutions that lent money to the Super 88 defendants).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">On December 10, 2010, counsel for all parties in the litigation appeared in court for a conference pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>as amended, 466 Mass. 1401 (2013), and for an omnibus motions hearing. With the judge\u2019s permission, counsel used the occasion instead to engage in substantive settlement discussions. They reported to the court that a potential settlement framework had been reached, and they requested that the conference be continued so that they could further develop the framework. The judge allowed the continuance and encouraged counsel\u2019s efforts. The conference was continued a second time on the representation by counsel that substantial progress was being made towards settlement. The judge scheduled March 18, 2011, as the date on which counsel would report the terms of a final settlement to the court or proceed with the conference and hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Prior to March 18, the parties had reached a final settlement agreement, which they had intended to sign and file with the court. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the lenders agreed to release their claims to a security interest in the Super 88 store located in the Dorchester section of Boston in exchange for a release of the claims of all plaintiffs in the consolidated cases. From the proceeds of the sale of the Dorchester store to one of the asset purchasers in settlement of its claims, Cheng Lee was to receive $650,000; the Hop Lee plaintiffs were to receive $264,000; the Tin World plaintiffs were to receive $313,395; and the workers were to receive $950,000, but $500,000 would not be paid for six months. This would leave a balance of approximately $7 million for the lenders from the sale of the other two Super 88 stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">On March 18, however, counsel appeared in court and announced that there had been a \u201cbreakdown in the settlement discussions\u201d because, days earlier, they had learned of a solicitation letter that Goren had sent out the week before to 106 unsecured creditors of the Super 88 defendants that had been identified on a 2009 bankruptcy schedule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Most of the recipients were nonparty creditors, but four of the Hop Lee plaintiffs also received the letter, as did one nonparty creditor who was represented by the attorney for Tin World.* *<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the letter, which was printed on the stationery of Goren\u2019s law firm at the time, Bodoff &amp; Associates, P.C. (Bodoff), Goren explained that he \u201crepresented] an unsecured trade creditor of Super 88 and [was] about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>to conclude an agreement whereby [his] client will recover 100 cents on the dollar in a settlement with various parties.\u201d The letter went on to request that the recipient complete an enclosed form if the recipient were \u201cinterested in seeking to recover [its] unpaid Super 88 invoices on a contingent fee basis.\u201d The letter further explained, \u201cIf there is sufficient interest generated by unpaid creditors, we will bring a lawsuit against certain parties on the creditors\u2019 collective behalf . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The letter both began and concluded with a request that the recipient treat the inquiry as confidential.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The Tin World and Hop Lee plaintiffs and the Super 88 defendants moved for sanctions against Goren on the grounds that he had violated the rules of professional conduct<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and had interfered with the \u201ceffective administration of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At the sanctions hearing on April 8, the various counsel explained why Goren\u2019s solicitation letter had derailed the settlement process. They noted that the total amount of the claims exceeded the aggregate sale prices of the three supermarkets, and that everyone understood that it was in the interest of their clients that \u201coutsiders to the consolidated actions not be invited in on what was a finite pot of money.\u201d As a number of the parties had agreed to compromise their claims in various ways for the sake of reaching a settlement, the prospect of additional claims caused them to renege, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>they had only agreed to compromise their claims on the assumption that they \u201cwere wrapping up all of the litigation,\u201d and because \u201ca potential involuntary bankruptcy\u201d could have been triggered if other \u201cpotential creditors [were] alerted to the false assumption that there\u2019s a pot of money out there that\u2019s just waiting to be tapped.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The parties had never entered into a confidentiality agreement, and there was no confidentiality provision in the proposed settlement agreement, but counsel explained that \u201cthere was no real need for a [confidentiality [agreement because it was in all of [their] own clients\u2019 interest to keep this as quiet as possible.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Goren replied that sanctions were unwarranted because he had not violated any ethical rule or court order or committed a breach of any agreement with the other parties, and because jurisdiction for sanctioning attorneys for ethical violations lies with the board. He also denied that he had had any intention to \u201ctorpedo\u201d the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The judge ordered Goren to \u201creimburse all parties in the consolidated cases their necessary and reasonable attorney[\u2019]s fees and expenses incurred from December 10, 2010 through April 8, 2011 in connection with the effort to settle the litigation and respond to the solicitation by Attorney Goren.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The judge quoted the following passage from <em>Beit </em>v. <em>Probate &amp; Family Court Dep\u2019t, </em>385 Mass. 854, 859-860 (1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">\u201cJudges have the inherent power to do whatever may be done under the general principles of jurisprudence to insure [the integrity of the judicial process]. . . . Simply stated, implicit in the constitutional grant of judicial power is authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>necessary to the exercise of . . . [that] power. . . . [E]very judge must exercise his inherent powers as necessary to secure the full and effective administration of justice. . . . Exercising this power, a judge may impose reasonable court costs on an attorney who . . . delays the adjudication of legitimate claims and defenses, unnecessarily increases clients\u2019 litigation expenses, and squanders limited judicial resources. A judge cannot condone behavior that causes precious time to be wasted away while the court, parties, court personnel, and witnesses [otherwise diligently conduct themselves]\u201d (quotations, citations, and footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The judge noted that, \u201c[i]n a technical sense,\u201d he did not have jurisdiction to rule on compliance with the rules of professional conduct, but he concluded that the content of the rules \u201cmay inform the [cjourt\u2019s assessment of whether Goren acted unreasonably such as to have impeded \u2018the full and effective administration of justice\u2019 and \u2018delay[ed] the adjudication of legitimate claims and defenses . . . and squandered] limited judicial resources.\u2019 \u201d The judge found that \u201c[unquestionably, Goren did so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The judge stated that he had \u201cplaced on hold [his] earlier effort to move the consolidated cases to prompt trial on counsel\u2019s representation in December, joined by Goren, that they had agreed on a settlement framework but that time was needed to finalize it.\u201d He did so in reliance \u201con the good faith of all counsel, as officers of the [c]ourt, in representing to the [c]ourt that they were engaged diligently in the global settlement effort.\u201d He found that \u201cbut for one participant,\u201d impliedly Goren, \u201cthey were in fact so engaged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">He found that the settlement negotiations had been \u201cconducted in confidence because of the parties\u2019 awareness that if additional claimants appeared, the finite settlement fund would be further diluted and (if a critical mass of new claims were filed) a bankruptcy petition could be triggered that would have left all the plaintiffs without a practical remedy.\u201d He also found that, in these circumstances, \u201cthe very act of solicitation and its communication of the prospect of a recovery by third parties breached the assumption of confidentiality, which was central to the prospect of achieving settlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The judge found that Goren \u201cappeared to have . . . violated]\u201d Mass. R. Prof. C. 4.2, as amended, 437 Mass. 1303 (2002), by soliciting five creditors that Goren knew or should have known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>were already represented by counsel for the trade creditors.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> He further found that Goren \u201cwas subject to\u201d paragraph 2 of the preamble to the rules of professional conduct and that his \u201cconduct was fundamentally dishonest toward his co-counsel and a breach of the core professional duty of good faith and fair dealing with other counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The judge also found that Goren\u2019s conduct \u201cwas a fundamental breach of his duty of candor to the [cjourt,\u201d in violation of Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.3, 426 Mass. 1383 (1998), but he did not specify how Goren had committed a breach of this duty, or which subsection of rule 3.3 (a) Goren had violated.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The judge further concluded that \u201c[tjhe [cjourt has been materially prejudiced\u201d by Goren\u2019s conduct, writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">\u201cThe impact of Goren\u2019s conduct on the administration of justice, the [cjourt\u2019s most immediate concern, has been stark. The progression of the consolidated cases to a fair and prompt disposition has been obstructed. Three months of diligent and expensive lawyers\u2019 time has been wasted. And the assumption on which the [cjourt relied in staying the cases has been shown to have been based on a false premise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">In addition to allowing in part the motions for sanctions and ordering sanctions against Goren, the judge referred a copy of his order to the board for its review.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Pursuant to the judge\u2019s order, counsel involved in the settlement negotiations filed affidavits detailing their attorney\u2019s fees. After a nonevidentiary hearing addressing those filings, the judge ordered Goren to pay sanctions totaling $239,928.40 to counsel for the parties engaged in settlement negotiations (other than Cheng Lee). The judge observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">\u201cThe magnitude of the total award gives the [cjourt temporary pause. However, on reflection, it is a fair, reasonable and just sanction under the unusual, if not unique, circumstances of this case. Attorney Goren\u2019s callous indifference to the consequences of his unethical solicitation directly caused the predictable financial injury which the sanctions are designed to compensate. Further, not reflected in the sanctions is the impact on the [cjourt (the resources of which are currently strained to the limit). If such impact were in fact monetized, the total sanctions would be substantially enlarged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Goren appealed, and we granted direct appellate review.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>Massachusetts generally follows the \u201cAmerican rule\u201d and denies recovery of attorney\u2019s fees unless such fee-shifting is authorized by contract, statute, or court rule. See <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Gows, </em>429 Mass. 14, 17 (1999) <em>(Gows); Preferred Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gamache, </em>426 Mass. 93, 95 (1997). In some circumstances, a judge in a civil case is expressly authorized by statute or rule to sanction an attorney for misconduct by requiring the attorney to pay opposing counsel\u2019s fees. A judge may award an adverse party reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and other costs upon a finding that \u201call or substantially all of the claims, defenses, setoffs or counterclaims . . . made by any party who was represented by counsel... were wholly insubstantial, frivolous and not advanced in good faith.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 11 (a), as amended, 456 Mass. 1401 (2010) (attorney may be subjected to \u201cappropriate disciplinary action\u201d for wilful violation of rule requiring that attorney not sign pleading unless \u201cto the best of his knowledge, information, and belief there is a good ground to support it; and that it is not interposed for delay\u201d). A judge is also granted abundant authority pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>P. 37 to impose sanctions, including attorney\u2019s fees, where an attorney violates a rule of discovery or an order regarding discovery. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 37 (b), as amended, 423 Mass. 1406 (1996). Furthermore, even though not expressly authorized by the rules governing contempt, we have recognized \u2014 notwithstanding the American rule \u2014 that \u201c[w]here a party\u2019s conduct in a litigation constitutes contempt of court,... a court has discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees against the contumacious party.\u201d <em>Gows, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In this case, the judge assessed attorney\u2019s fees against Goren without the authority of any statute or rule, without finding Goren in contempt of court, and in the absence of any contractual arrangement among the parties authorizing the assessment of attorney\u2019s fees. The judge in his decision imposing sanctions on Goren quoted the legal standard we declared in <em>Beit, </em>noting that a judge, through the exercise of the court\u2019s inherent powers, may sanction an attorney by the award of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cas necessary to secure the full and effective administration of justice.\u201d <em>Beit, </em>385 Mass. at 859, quoting <em>O\u2019Coins, Inc. </em>v. <em>Treasurer of the County of Worcester, </em>362 Mass. 507, 514 (1972). But the legal issue in <em>Beit </em>was simply whether a judge, through the exercise of inherent powers, could sanction an attorney for failing to appear at trial. That was effectively a violation of a court order, because when a judge sets a date for trial, and no continuance is sought or allowed, the judge is implicitly ordering counsel in the case to appear on that date for trial, and the counsel\u2019s failure to appear, without excuse, is plainly grounds for sanction. See <em>Beit, supra </em>at 859-860 (\u201cauthority to make the court\u2019s lawful orders effective\u201d includes authority to sanction attorney for failure to appear). Goren did not violate any court order; nor did he engage in any misconduct in the court room. Therefore, this case tests the limits of a judge\u2019s inherent powers to sanction in a way that <em>Beit </em>did not, and requires us to revisit the scope of the court\u2019s inherent powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">We have held that a judge has the inherent power to assess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees against a party or attorney for out-of-court misconduct that was not in violation of any court order, but only in \u201crare and egregious cases.\u201d <em>Gows, </em>429 Mass. at 17, 19 (judge awarded attorney\u2019s fees against party who delayed compliance with lawful court order and forced prevailing party to resort to litigation to obtain compliance). The crux of the issue here is whether this is such a \u201crare and egregious\u201d case.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Under Federal law, a judge may exercise the inherent powers of the court to assess attorney\u2019s fees against an attorney as a sanction for misconduct where the attorney has \u201cwillful[ly] disobe[yed]\u201d a court order <em>or </em>where the attorney has \u201cacted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.\u201d <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>NASCO, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 32, 45-46 (1991), quoting <em>Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilderness Soc\u2019y, </em>421 U.S. 240, 258-259 (1975). See <em>Gows, </em>429 Mass. at 18, quoting <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Piggie Park Enters., Inc., </em>390 U.S. 400, 402 n.4 (1968) (noting that under Federal law, \u201c[cjonduct has been held to justify an award of attorney\u2019s fees where a party has acted \u2018in bad faith\u2019 \u201d). In <em>Chambers, </em>the bad faith conduct that warranted the assessment of attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 which included but went beyond violations of court orders and other misconduct that could be sanctioned under Federal statutes and rules \u2014 was egregious. See <em>Chambers, supra </em>at 35-42, 58 (affirming award of almost $1 million in attorney\u2019s fees against litigant who tried \u201cfirst, to deprive [the Federal District Court] of jurisdiction [by acts of fraud on the court] and, second, to devise a plan of obstruction, delay, harassment, and expense sufficient to reduce [opposing party] to a condition of exhausted compliance\u201d). However, there appears to be no Federal rule defining what constitutes \u201cbad faith\u201d for the purpose of justifying a court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees based on the court\u2019s inherent powers. See <em>id. </em>at 63 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (only limitation on court\u2019s exercise of inherent power to impose sanctions \u201cappears to be a finding at some point of \u2018bad faith,\u2019 a standard the Court fails to define\u201d). We recognize that \u201cbad faith\u201d alone is too vague a standard to establish the scope of a judge\u2019s inherent power to assess attorney\u2019s fees against an attorney who is not in violation of a court order, statute, or rule of procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">A judge\u2019s inherent powers \u2014 including the inherent power to assess attorney\u2019s fees for misconduct \u2014 must be broad enough to enable a judge to ensure the fair administration of justice. See <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>414 Mass. 450, 457 (1993), quoting <em>New England Novelty Co. </em>v. <em>Sandberg, </em>315 Mass. 739, 746 (1944) (\u201c \u2018[C]ourt[s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>of superior jurisdiction [have] the inherent power ... to punish those who obstruct or degrade the administration of justice\u2019 . . . [and] have wide discretion to determine when a party or attorney before them has acted in a manner warranting the imposition of sanctions\u201d); <em>Beit, </em>385 Mass. at 859. But the exercise of these powers to assess attorney\u2019s fees must be limited to those cases where the imposition of such sanctions is <em>necessary </em>to preserve the court\u2019s authority to accomplish justice. See <em>Chambers, </em>501 U.S. at 64 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\u201cLike all applications of inherent power, the authority to sanction bad-faith litigation practices can be exercised only when necessary to preserve the authority of the court\u201d); <em>O\u2019Coins, Inc., </em>362 Mass. at 510, quoting <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>279 Mass. 607, 609 (1932) (\u201c[Ijmplicit in the constitutional grant of judicial power is \u2018authority <em>necessary </em>to the exercise of . . . [that] power [emphasis supplied]\u2019 \u201d). The inherent powers of the court are limited by this rule of necessity, consistent with the principle that \u201c[b]ecause inherent powers are shielded from direct democratic controls, they must be exercised with restraint and discretion.\u201d <em>Roadway Express, Inc. </em>v. <em>Piper, </em>447 U.S. 752, 764 (1980). See <em>Chambers, supra </em>at 44 (\u201cBecause of their very potency, inherent powers must be exercised with restraint and discretion\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In accord with this principle, a court should exercise restraint and discretion both in determining whether the rule of necessity permits the imposition of sanctions under a court\u2019s inherent powers and, where it does, in determining whether to impose a sanction in a particular case and the severity of the sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The inherent powers necessary to preserve the court\u2019s authority to accomplish justice include the power to sanction an attorney for failing to comply with an order of the court and for undue delay in compliance. See <em>Sommer </em>v. <em>Maharaj, </em>451 Mass. 615, 620-622 (2008), cert. denied, 556 U.S. 1235 (2009) (\u201cextreme delay in payment of the judgment\u201d warranted forfeiture of party\u2019s right to be heard); <em>Gows, </em>429 Mass. at 17-19; <em>Beit, </em>385 Mass. at 859-860; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 109, 112 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>(1999) (upholding nominal assessment of fees against attorney for violation of court order where violation was not disruptive enough to warrant summary contempt punishment). See also <em>Chambers, </em>501 U.S. at 45-46, quoting <em>Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co., </em>421 U.S. at 258, and <em>Hutto </em>v. <em>Finney, </em>437 U.S. 678, 689 n.14 (1978) (fee shifting allowed for \u201cwillful disobedience of a court order\u201d and where party \u201cshows bad faith by . . . hampering enforcement of a court order\u201d). The court\u2019s inherent powers also include the power to sanction an attorney for making knowingly false misrepresentations to the court, intentionally misleading the court, or knowingly concealing information that an attorney has a duty to provide to the court. See <em>Chambers, supra </em>at 46, quoting <em>Universal Oil Prods. Co. </em>v. <em>Root Refining Co., </em>328 U.S. 575, 580 (1946) (\u201c[I]f a court finds \u2018that fraud has been practiced upon it . . . ,\u2019 it may assess attorney\u2019s fees against the responsible party\u201d); <em>Munshani </em>v. <em>Signal Lake Venture Fund II, LP, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 714-715, 718-722 (2004) (dismissal of party\u2019s case pursuant to court\u2019s inherent powers was warranted after party committed fraud on court by \u201cmanufacturing evidence, swearing to its authenticity, and continuing to insist on its authenticity for more than seven months while an expert investigated the matter\u201d). They also include the power to sanction an attorney for engaging in conduct in the court room that interferes with a judge\u2019s ability to manage the court room fairly, efficiently, and respectfully. See <em>Chambers, supra, </em>quoting <em>Hutto, supra </em>(fee shifting allowed where party \u201cshows bad faith by delaying or disrupting the litigation\u201d); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 737, 743-744 (1999) (award of attorney sanctions was not improper where attorney engaged in \u201cbombastic\u201d behavior during trial, and walked out of court room during cross-examination of her client without permission after having been warned by court that such conduct could result in criminal contempt proceedings being instituted against her). They also include the power to sanction an attorney for other types of misconduct, but only where the exercise of that inherent power is necessary to punish, deter, or remedy misconduct that threatens a judge\u2019s ability to ensure the fair administration of justice. See <em>Avelino-Wright </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 3, 5-6 (2001) (upholding attorney\u2019s fee sanction for attorney who \u201cabused the court process\u201d by, inter alia, \u201cchallenging the integrity of the judges and appointed experts\u201d; \u201cbecoming so enmeshed with her client that she [had] lost her professionalism in advocating for a client\u201d; \u201cnot attempting to exercise proper control and guidance of her client\u201d; and \u201cviolat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>ing the court imposed restraining order against her\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The judge in this case essentially found that Goren, by sending the solicitation letter, committed a breach of the \u201cassumption of confidentiality\u201d that was \u201ccentral to the prospect of achieving settlement,\u201d and thereby thwarted a settlement that was on the verge of being executed, which wasted three months of attorneys\u2019 time that had been invested in negotiating the settlement, and \u201cmaterially prejudiced\u201d the court by delaying the judge\u2019s effort to move the consolidated cases towards trial. Further, although the judge recognized that he had no jurisdiction \u201c[i]n a technical sense\u201d to decide whether Goren had violated the rules of professional conduct, he nonetheless essentially found that Goren had violated these rules, and the judge relied on these violations to demonstrate that Goren had acted unreasonably to impede \u201cthe full and effective administration of justice.\u201d We review the judge\u2019s imposition of sanctions under the court\u2019s inherent powers for abuse of discretion. See <em>Chambers, </em>501 U.S. at 55. \u201c[A] judge\u2019s discretionary decision constitutes an abuse of discretion where we conclude the judge made \u2018a clear error of judgment in weighing\u2019 the factors relevant to the decision, . . . such that the decision falls outside the range of reasonable alternatives\u201d (citation omitted). <em>L.L. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>470 Mass. 169, 185 n.27 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">We know of no other case, nor has one been cited by the parties or amicus, where a judge sanctioned an attorney pursuant to the inherent powers of the court for conduct that resulted in a breakdown of settlement negotiations where there was no breach of a settlement agreement or confidentiality agreement, and no violation of an order of the court or rule of procedure.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The fair administration of justice does not require the settlement of a case; although the parties are free to settle their case, their entitlement under law is to a trial, not to a settlement in lieu of a trial. See <em>Bower v. Bournay-Bower, </em>469 Mass. 690, 701 (2014) (\u201cart. 11 [of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights] safeguards an individual\u2019s right to seek recourse under the law\u201d); <em>Graizzaro </em>v. <em>Graizzaro, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 911, 912 (1994) (\u201cA court may appropriately urge settlement on the parties but may not refuse them access to a judicial forum to resolve their justiciable disputes\u201d). See also <em>Goss Graphics Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>DEV Indus., Inc., </em>267 F.3d 624, 627-628 (7th Cir. 2001) (\u201cIf parties want to duke it out, that\u2019s their privilege\u201d). It might be regrettable that money and time were wasted in negotiations that ultimately failed to bear fruit, but that risk is inherent in every negotiation. Because of the risk that judges may misuse the inherent powers to pressure a party to settle a case by threatening the party with sanctions, and also because of the risk that judges will be drawn into collateral disputes regarding what occurred during settlement negotiations by parties seeking sanctions, we must scrutinize with special care any exercise of the inherent powers in the context of settlement negotiations. Cf. <em>Graizzaro, supra </em>(\u201c[A] judge must show restraint in urging settlement on the parties,\u201d and \u201c[w]hile a judge in a civil case doubtless may play a role in settlement discussions . . . , he must be conscious to avoid use of his power to coerce settlements from recalcitrant parties\u201d [citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">A settlement agreement, especially in a case as complex as this, no doubt would spare the court the time and resources that would otherwise be devoted to trying the case. But an attorney\u2019s conduct during settlement negotiations that results in the failure of those negotiations is not subject to sanctions under the judge\u2019s inherent powers where the judge is not participating in those negotiations, because the failure of settlement negotiations does not threaten a judge\u2019s ability to ensure the fair administration of justice.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Where a settlement agreement is entered into as a result of fraud or duress, the aggrieved party may challenge the lawfulness of the agreement and may potentially be awarded attorney\u2019s fees as an equitable remedy, along with the voiding of the agreement. Cf. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>Warner Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>406 Mass. 354, 360 n.7 (1990) (\u201csettlement agreement is a private contract. . . governed by general contract law\u201d). But where, as here, no agreement is reached, a judge\u2019s inherent powers do not authorize the judge to determine who was responsible for the breakdown of negotiations, and order the attorney responsible to pay the attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the other parties in the thwarted negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The judge here determined that Goren committed a breach of the \u201cassumption of confidentiality\u201d that was necessary to the entry of a settlement agreement, but where no confidentiality agreement was entered into and where confidentiality was not required by an order of the court, the inherent powers of the court are not properly exercised to sanction the breach of such an assumption.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The judge suggested that the breach of the \u201cassumption of confidentiality\u201d violated the obligation of an attorney to deal honestly with others, but the inherent powers of the court do not extend to claims that an attorney during settlement negotiations did not act honestly.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The judge also found that Goren violated Mass. R. Prof. C. 4.2 by sending his solicitation letter to a few prospective clients who were already represented by counsel in settlement negotiations. The judge recognized that \u201c[i]n a technical sense\u201d the adjudication of an alleged violation of an ethical rule rests solely with the board and this court, and that a judge does not have jurisdiction to rule on issues of compliance.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> But he nonetheless determined that a finding of an ethical violation may bear on the issue whether Goren impaired the administration of justice. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>circumstances of this case, we disagree. Sending a solicitation letter to a represented client in these circumstances \u2014 even assuming it was in violation of rule 4.2 \u2014 is not conduct that may be sanctioned through the inherent powers of the court; such sanctions were not necessary to ensure the fair administration of justice where the judge also referred the matter to the board for its consideration, and where disciplinary proceedings instituted by the board and reviewed by this court would be able to protect the interests embodied in rule 4.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The judge\u2019s finding that Goren committed \u201ca fundamental breach of his duty of candor to the [cjourt,\u201d in violation of rule 3.3, calls for separate analysis, because this rule prohibits an attorney from making a knowing false statement to a court, and it is plain that the inherent powers of the court include the authority to sanction an attorney for such misconduct, regardless of the adjudication of any complaint before the board for violation of this rule. See <em>Rockdale Mgt. Co. </em>v. <em>Shawmut Bank, N.A., </em>418 Mass. 596, 598 (1994) (\u201cWhen a fraud on the court is shown through clear and convincing evidence to have been committed in an ongoing case, the trial judge has the inherent power to take action in response to the fraudulent conduct,\u201d and \u201chas broad discretion to fashion a judicial response warranted by the fraudulent conduct\u201d); <em>Munshani, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. at 718-722. See also <em>Chambers, </em>510 U.S. at 46, quoting <em>Universal Oil Prods. Co., </em>328 U.S. at 580 (\u201cif a court finds \u2018that fraud has been practiced upon it, or that the very temple of justice has been defiled,\u2019 it may assess attorney\u2019s fees against the responsible party\u201d). The judge did not specify what he found to constitute this breach of Goren\u2019s duty of candor but we need not remand for such a finding, because the only finding that might support the exercise of the judge\u2019s inherent powers to sanction \u2014 a finding that, when the attorneys represented to the judge that they were exploring settlement of the case, Goren knowingly misled the judge because Goren knew at the time that he intended to sabotage any possible settlement by sending out the solicitation letter \u2014 is not supported by the information presented to the court. Although there was ample information to support a finding that Goren should have recognized that his sending of the solicitation letter put at risk the settlement agreement that he claimed in the letter he was \u201cabout to conclude\u201d for his client, there is no information to suggest that Goren sought settlement discussions to procure delay in the litigation, knowing that he would sabotage any possible settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>We understand the judge\u2019s frustration that a settlement of a complex case was thwarted by Goren\u2019s desire to solicit other clients at a time when he should have known that doing so risked the settlement that had so nearly been achieved. We understand as well the parties\u2019 frustration that so much of their attorneys\u2019 time (and therefore their money) was squandered by the ultimate failure of negotiations triggered by Goren\u2019s solicitation. But the inherent powers of a judge to sanction an attorney are not so broad as to right all wrongs. They are limited to what is necessary to \u201cvindicat[e] judicial authority.\u201d <em>Chambers, </em>501 U.S. at 46, quoting <em>Hutto, </em>437 U.S. at 689 n.14.
