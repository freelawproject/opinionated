On November 21, 2011, the Legislature approved \u201cAn Act relative to the commercial exploitation of people,\u201d which criminalized sexual servitude, forced labor, and organ trafficking as of its effective date of February 19, 2012. St. 2011, c. 178, \u00a7\u00a7 1-31. The portions of the enactment at issue here, pertaining to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>trafficking of persons for sexual servitude, were codified at G. L. c. 265, \u00a7\u00a7 49, 50. See St. 2011, c. 178, \u00a7 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 50 <em>(a), </em>states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\">\u201cWhoever knowingly: (i) subjects, or attempts to subject, or recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides or obtains by any means . . . another person to engage in commercial sexual activity ... or causes a person to engage in commercial sexual activity ... or (ii) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value, as a result of a violation of clause (i), shall be guilty of the crime of trafficking of persons for sexual servitude and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not less than [five] years but not more than [twenty] years and by a fine of not more than $25,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The phrase \u201c[c]ommercial sexual activity\u201d is defined as \u201cany sexual act on account of which anything of value is given, promised to or received by any person.\u201d G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">On December 19, 2012, a Suffolk County grand jury indicted each defendant, Tyshaun McGhee and Sidney McGee, on nine counts of aggravated rape, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22 (a), three counts of trafficking persons for sexual servitude, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50, and two counts of deriving support from the earnings of a prostitute, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7. The charges arose from allegations by three women (C.C., S.E., and B.G.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) that the defendants approached them, took their photographs to post as advertisements on a Web site called Backpage.com, drove them to various locations to have sex with men who responded to the advertisements, and then retained some or all of the money that the women received as payment from these men. The defendants filed a joint pretrial motion to dismiss the sex trafficking charges on the grounds that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50, is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, both on its face and as applied to them. A judge of the Superior Court denied the motion. Following a jury trial, Tyshaun was convicted on all three indictments charging him with trafficking persons for sexual servitude (C.C., S.E., and B.G.),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and both indictments charging him with deriving support from the earnings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>of a prostitute (C.C. and S.E.). He was found not guilty on the indictments charging him with aggravated rape. Sidney was convicted on all three indictments charging him with trafficking persons for sexual servitude (C.C., S.E., and B.G.),* *<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *and he was found not guilty on the remaining indictments. Each defendant filed a timely notice of appeal, and we granted their subsequent applications for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The defendants contend on appeal that (1) G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50, is unconstitutionally vague as applied to them and, therefore, violated their rights to due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; (2) G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50, is unconstitutionally overbroad on its face in violation of their right to freedom of association under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; (3) the phrase \u201ccommercial sexual activity\u201d is unconstitutionally overbroad; (4) the judge erred in allowing the substantive admission of grand jury testimony from one of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses; and (5) the judge violated their right to confrontation by hindering their cross-examination of C.C. with respect to several pending criminal charges against her and her purported history of prostitution. In addition, Tyshaun contends that the sentences imposed for his convictions of deriving support from the earnings of a prostitute were illegal. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50, is constitutional, that the sentences challenged by Tyshaun were illegal, and that the defendants\u2019 remaining claims of error have no merit. Accordingly, the judgments are affirmed. As to the indictments charging Tyshaun with deriving support from the earnings of a prostitute, those cases are remanded for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">1. <em>Factual background. </em>We summarize the facts the jury could have found, reserving certain details for our discussion of the issues raised. As mentioned, the charges against the defendants arose from their interactions with three women in the fall of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>2012.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> C.C., then approximately twenty-four years old, had a history of drug and alcohol use, and she had spent time in several treatment facilities. On September 7,2012, as she left Boston Medical Center after having been treated for two drug overdoses within one twenty-four hour period, she encountered the defendants, who were standing outside the hospital. The defendants asked C.C. what she was doing, and she told them that she was interested in \u201cparty[ing].\u201d After offering to give her a ride, the defendants walked C.C. to an apartment on Eustis Street in Boston, where C.C. observed an older man standing outside. Tyshaun gave the man some money, and then Tyshaun proceeded inside with C.C. and Sidney. They went upstairs to a bedroom where all three drank from a bottle of alcohol, C.C. smoked some \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine that had been given to her by Tyshaun, and the defendants purportedly raped C.C. as she cried.* *<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Afterward, C.C. got dressed, all three individuals walked to an apartment on Dudley Street where Tyshaun\u2019s mother lived, and C.C. fell asleep on a couch. She did not attempt to run away because she was afraid of what might happen to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The next morning, the defendants and C.C. walked to a fast food restaurant where Tyshaun purchased some heroin from a friend and gave it to C.C., who proceeded to inject it into her foot. As they walked away from the restaurant, the defendants started talking with C.C. about a business arrangement whereby she could \u201cmake a lot of money,\u201d \u201chave a nice car,\u201d and \u201chave a nice apartment.\u201d It was C.C.\u2019s understanding that the defendants were talking about prostitution. They continued this conversation until they reached the Dudley Street apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">At the apartment, the defendants prepared to take photographs of C.C., which they planned to post as advertisements on the Web site Backpage.com. Tyshaun told C.C. that there would be a \u201crate,\u201d which she understood as meaning that she would be having sex with people in exchange for money. Although \u201cdefinitely hesitant,\u201d C.C. agreed to proceed because she was \u201cbroke and homeless, and having a nice apartment and car and money seemed like the best option.\u201d Tyshaun gave C.C. lingerie to wear, and he took photographs of her with a digital camera in the bathroom of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>apartment. C.C. started feeling \u201cuncomfortable\u201d and did not want to be in the situation in which she found herself. Nonetheless, the defendants transferred the photographs to Sidney\u2019s laptop computer and then posted them on Backpage.com. Tyshaun included his cellular telephone number with the photographs, and the name indicated on them was \u201cJamie Lynn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">After about thirty minutes, Tyshaun\u2019s telephone started to ring. He answered it and handed the telephone to C.C., having told her what to say to the callers. C.C. would ask them \u201cif they were a cop of any sort,\u201d what they wanted, and whether they could meet at a particular location that had been chosen by Tyshaun and Sidney. Tyshaun established prices of one hundred dollars for thirty minutes of sex, and $150 for one hour of sex. When C.C. arranged to meet a man at the Eustis Street apartment for thirty minutes of sex, the defendants walked with her to that location, and Tyshaun again gave some money to the same older man who had been standing outside that location the previous day. C.C. was directed to a room, she had sex with the man she had arranged to meet, she was paid one hundred dollars, and she handed the money over to Tyshaun, keeping none of it for herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Over the course of the next three to four days, C.C. had sex with five or six other men in various locations. The defendants always accompanied C.C. to the designated meeting place and would wait for her until she had finished. She gave all of the money that she was paid to Tyshaun, who arranged the accommodations. At some point, Tyshaun stopped providing drugs and alcohol to C.C., telling her that she was not making enough money to support her habits.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">On September 12, 2012, roughly five days after having met the defendants, C.C. woke up alone in a hotel room. Although neither defendant was there, Tyshaun\u2019s cellular telephone was in the room. C.C. telephoned her father. He told her to leave the hotel room, and she jogged to a nearby pharmacy, where she telephoned her father again to pick her up. On the drive to her parents\u2019 home, C.C. told her father in response to his questioning that she had been raped. After she arrived home, C.C.\u2019s mother took her to Brockton Hospital where she was interviewed by a sexual assault nurse examiner and diagnosed with pneumonia and cellulitis. During her examination, C.C. told the nurse that over the past several days she had engaged in sex with multiple men. At some point shortly thereafter, C.C. told Boston police officers that she had been sexually assaulted, but she did not disclose her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>involvement in prostitution. On October 2, 2012, C.C. was shown a photographic array, and she identified the photograph of Sidney. Approximately one month later, C.C. told the police about her involvement with prostitution. On December 12, 2012, C.C. went to Boston police headquarters to view a live lineup, and she identified Tyshaun.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In the fall of 2012, S.E., then approximately twenty-six years old, was homeless, and had a history of drug use. S.E. met Sidney around September 18, when she was standing in line outside a homeless shelter near the Boston Medical Center. After asking S.E. several questions, Sidney told her that he could help her, and that she could earn enough money working as an \u201cescort\u201d to live a better life. S.E. accompanied Sidney to meet Tyshaun, and then the three of them went to the apartment on Dudley Street where Tyshaun\u2019s mother lived. Once there, the defendants told S.E. that they were going to take photographs of her and post them on the Web site Backpage.com. S.E. agreed, but \u201cwasn\u2019t comfortable\u201d with the arrangement. Tyshaun took the photographs using his cellular telephone, Sidney showed her how to pose, and the defendants posted the photographs online. Tyshaun included his cellular telephone number with the photographs, and the name indicated on them was \u201cNatalia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">After a short period of time, calls and text messages started arriving on Tyshaun\u2019s telephone. S.E. realized that Tyshaun was conversing about sex, not merely escorting, only when she questioned him about the prices for her \u201cservices.\u201d Tyshaun told the callers that it would be $150 for \u201cfull service,\u201d which meant oral and vaginal sex, and fifty dollars for just oral sex. Shortly thereafter, a man arrived at the Dudley Street apartment, he and S.E. \u201cengaged in sexual behavior,\u201d the man paid her some cash, and she gave it to Tyshaun so he could \u201cput gas in the car,\u201d \u201crent a hotel room,\u201d and \u201ckeep posting the ad.\u201d S.E. subsequently met another individual at a different location that was a few blocks away from the Dudley Street apartment. She was unable to remember what happened at this second location. S.E. returned to the Dudley Street apartment with the defendants at around 3 a.m., she performed oral sex on each defendant at their behest because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to get hurt,\u201d she had sexual intercourse with Tyshaun, and then the defendants fell asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The next morning, after the defendants took S.E. to a methadone clinic, they proceeded to check Tyshaun\u2019s telephone for responses to the photographs they had posted on Backpage.com. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Over the next twenty-four hours, the defendants drove S.E. to different locations where she engaged in various sexual acts with several different men. The defendants always remained nearby in their parked motor vehicle and, once S.E. had finished, Tyshaun demanded all of the cash that she had received.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">On her third day with the defendants, Tyshaun again took S.E. to a methadone clinic where she chatted with B.G., a woman she had met during prior visits to the clinic. After their conversation, B.G. went outside and spoke with the defendants, whom she already had met. Eventually, all four of them returned to the Dudley Street apartment, where B.G. used a computer to repost photographs of herself that had been submitted to Backpage.com on an earlier occasion. The defendants also took new photographs of B.G. and posted them on the Web site. Later that same day, the defendants drove S.E. and B.G. some distance to a hotel where each woman had sex with two men for money. The defendants waited outside in their car. S.E. and B.G. received $250, which was split evenly, and S.E. gave her share to Tyshaun when he asked for it. B.G. kept some, if not all, of the money she had received. Eventually, the group drove back to Boston. Tyshaun and B.G. had an argument about sex and money; Tyshaun pulled the vehicle over to the side of the road, and the women got out. B.G. removed some personal belongings from the trunk, and the two women walked away. The defendants drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">S.E. and B.G. went to Boston Medical Center, and the police were called to the scene. In the waiting room, the women met with Officer Edward Fleming and told him that they had been forced into prostitution. Boston police officers subsequently interviewed S.E. and B.G. regarding the events that had transpired with the defendants. On September 26, 2012, S.E. went to a police station to view a photographic array. She identified Tyshaun, and he was arrested the next day. On September 28, 2012, S.E. returned to the police station to view another photographic array. She identified Sidney, and he was arrested that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">2. <em>Constitutionality of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50. </em>We begin with a discussion of the defendants\u2019 facial and as-applied challenges to the constitutionality of the sex trafficking statute, which challenges present questions of law that we review de novo. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>470 Mass. 300, 307 (2014), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>467 Mass. 291, 301 (2014). In accordance with canons of statutory construction, a statute is presumed to be constitutional. See <em>St. Germaine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>416 Mass. 698, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>703 (1993). \u201cDoubts as to a statute\u2019s constitutionality \u2018should be avoided if reasonable principles of interpretation permit doing so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Disler, </em>451 Mass. 216, 228 (2008), quoting <em>Staman </em>v. <em>Assessors of Chatham, </em>351 Mass. 479, 487 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The defendants first contend that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 <em>(a), </em>is unconstitutionally vague as applied to them and, therefore, violated their rights to due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and art. 12. They point out that \u00a7 50 <em>(a) </em>lacks the element of force or coercion as required by the analogous Federal sex trafficking statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591(a) (2012).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As such, the defendants argue that \u00a7 50 <em>(a) </em>fails to give them fair warning of prohibited conduct, noting that by merely assisting a consenting adult prostitute, they will be deemed to have engaged in the trafficking of persons for sexual servitude. Moreover, the defendants continue, without the element of force or coercion, there is a real risk of arbitrary enforcement of the statute, which also offends standards of due process.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We disagree with the defendants\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The principles governing a vagueness challenge to a statute are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>well established. \u201cA basic tenet of due process requires that a criminal statute be sufficiently clear to give notice of the prohibited conduct.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reyes, </em>464 Mass. 245, 248 (2013). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohmer, </em>374 Mass. 368, 371 (1978). \u201cA statute violates due process and is void for vagueness when individuals of normal intelligence must guess at the statute\u2019s meaning and may differ as to its application, thus denying them fair notice of the proscribed conduct.\u201d <em>Disler, </em>451 Mass. at 223. See <em>Connally </em>v. <em>General Constr. Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926). \u201cPenal statutes must \u2018define the criminal offense with sufficient definitiveness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zubiel, </em>456 Mass. 27, 30 (2010), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Twitchell, </em>416 Mass. 114, 123 (1993). See <em>Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983). A vague statute also offends due process because of \u201cits lack of reasonably clear guidelines for law enforcement and its consequent encouragement of arbitrary and erratic arrests and prosecutions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, </em>382 Mass. 108, 140 (1980). See <em>Reyes, supra </em>at 249. See also <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108-109 (1972). Any ambiguity in a criminal statute \u201cmust be strictly construed against the government.\u201d <em>Zubiel, supra </em>at 33. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>449 Mass. 840, 850 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\u201cProscribed conduct, however, is not always capable of precise legal definition.\u201d <em>Reyes, </em>464 Mass. at 249. See <em>Jaquith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>331 Mass. 439, 442 (1954). \u201cAccordingly, legislative language need not be afforded \u2018mathematical precision\u2019 in order to pass constitutional muster.\u201d <em>Reyes, supra, </em>quoting <em>Bohmer, </em>374 Mass. at 372. See <em>Grayned, </em>408 U.S. at 110. A statute is not vague \u201cif it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>371 Mass. 732, 734 (1977). Its language will be constitutionally adequate if it \u201cconveys [a] sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>389 Mass. 265, 270 (1983), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>359 Mass. 491, 496-497 (1971). \u201cUncertainty as to whether marginal offenses are included within the coverage of a statute does not render it unconstitutional if its scope is substantially clear.\u201d <em>Reyes, supra. </em>See <em>United States Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>National Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO, </em>413 U.S. 548, 579 (1973); <em>Jarrett, supra. </em>Moreover, \u201ceven a vague statute may be made constitutionally definite by giving it a reasonable construction.\u201d <em>Sefranka, </em>382 Mass. at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Here, we conclude that because G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 (a), is sufficiently clear and definite, it did not violate the defendants\u2019 rights to due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and art. 12. The words of the statute have commonly accepted and readily understood meanings in the English language, and the phrase \u201ccommercial sexual activity\u201d is amply defined in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 49.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The statutory language provided fair notice to the defendants that the very conduct in which they engaged was the kind of conduct that the Legislature intended to prohibit and punish.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The fact that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 (a), does not include the element of force or coercion does not render the statute unconstitutionally vague or subject to arbitrary enforcement. The clear and deliberate focus of the statute is the intent of the perpetrator, not the means used by the perpetrator to accomplish his or her intent. Section 50 <em>(a) </em>states that an individual shall be guilty of the crime of trafficking of persons for sexual servitude where such individual <em>\u201cknowingly ... </em>subjects, or attempts to subject, or recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides or obtains <em>by any means . .. </em>another person to engage in commercial sexual activity\u201d (emphasis added). As is its purview, the Legislature has determined that whether a person being trafficked for sexual servitude has been forced or coerced into engaging in such activities is immaterial for purposes of ascertaining whether a criminal act has been committed. The only relevant consideration is whether the perpetrator has engaged in the enumerated proscribed conduct with the requisite mens rea.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">When used in a criminal statute, the word \u201cknowingly\u201d typically \u201cimports a perception of the facts requisite to make up the crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Altenhaus, </em>317 Mass. 270, 273 (1944), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horsfall, </em>213 Mass. 232, 237 (1913). A requirement of scienter \u201chas a tendency to narrow (and thus to clarify) the scope of a criminal enactment.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Love, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 541, 546 n.11 (1988). The Supreme Court has long recognized that the constitutionality of a purportedly vague statute \u201cis closely related to whether that [statute] incorporates a requirement of mens rea.\u201d <em>Colautti </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>439 U.S. 379, 395 (1979). See <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>530 U.S. 703, 732 (2000) (rejecting vagueness challenge premised on failure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>statute to provide people of ordinary intelligence with reasonable opportunity to understand prohibited conduct where statute contained requirement of scienter); <em>Screws </em>v. <em>United States, </em>325 U.S. 91, 102 (1945) (plurality opinion) (\u201cwhere the punishment imposed is only for an act knowingly done with the purpose of doing that which the statute prohibits, the accused cannot be said to suffer from lack of warning or knowledge that the act which he does is a violation of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The language of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 (a), requiring the knowing commission of specified acts for the purpose of enabling or causing another person to engage in commercial sexual activity defines with sufficient clarity the prohibited conduct. As a consequence, the statute provides comprehensible standards for law enforcement that discourage arbitrary arrests and prosecutions. What the defendants characterize as \u201cmerely assisting\u201d an adult consenting prostitute will still constitute the crime of sex trafficking in those circumstances where <em>all </em>of the statutory elements have been satisfied. The absence of any element, notably mens rea, will negate criminality. In this case, the defendants\u2019 actions fell squarely within the conduct unambiguously proscribed by G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 <em>(a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Contrary to the defendants\u2019 contentions, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 <em>(a), </em>does not simply criminalize and punish more harshly the same conduct already prohibited by G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7. The substantive differences between the two statutes are evident and meaningful. Therefore, the defendants\u2019 arguments that they could not have known that their so-called \u201cpimping\u201d activities would constitute sex trafficking are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 7, provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[w]ho-ever, knowing a person to be a prostitute, shall live or derive support or maintenance, in whole or in part, from the earnings or proceeds of his prostitution . . . shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for a period of five years and by a fine of [$5,000].\u201d We have explained that \u201c[a] conviction of deriving support from the earnings of a prostitute requires the jury to find that a particular individual was a prostitute, that the defendant knew that the individual was a prostitute, and that the defendant shared in some way in the earnings or proceeds of this person\u2019s prostitution.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Purdy, </em>459 Mass. 442, 454 n.10 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The differences in the conduct prohibited by G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, and by G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 (a), are primarily twofold. First, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>language of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, plainly states that the conduct prohibited by that statute is the sharing of proceeds earned by a known prostitute. In contrast, under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 <em>(a), </em>an individual who knowingly enables or causes another person to engage in commercial sexual activity need not benefit, either financially or by receiving something of value, from such conduct in order to be convicted of sex trafficking. Indeed, as Sidney points out, he was found not guilty of violating G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, presumably because the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he shared in the money earned by C.C., S.E., and B.G. However, his commission of acts proscribed by G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 (a), resulted in his convictions of sex trafficking. Second, the knowledge element of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, is retrospective. That is to say, an individual shares earnings or proceeds knowing that they came from an act of prostitution that already has occurred. In contrast, the knowledge element of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 <em>(a), </em>is prospective. An individual engages in statutorily enumerated acts knowing that those acts will result in another person\u2019s anticipated engagement in commercial sexual activity. Although it may appear to the defendants that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, and G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 <em>(a), </em>criminalize essentially the same misconduct, they plainly do not. Therefore, the defendants had fair warning that their so-called \u201cpimping\u201d activities could subject them to prosecution for deriving support from the earnings of a prostitute, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, as well as for trafficking of persons for sexual servitude, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The defendants next contend that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 <em>(a), </em>is unconstitutionally overbroad on its face because it significantly infringes on the right to freedom of association as guaranteed by the First Amendment. In their view, because \u00a7 50 (a) lacks the element of force or coercion, it renders unlawful virtually any interaction between family members, friends, or organizations and a known prostitute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u201cA clear and precise enactment may ... be \u2018overbroad\u2019 if in its reach it prohibits constitutionally protected conduct.\u201d <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Operation Rescue, </em>406 Mass. 701, 715 (1990), quoting <em>Grayned, </em>408 U.S. at 114.

See <em>Mendoza </em>v. <em>Licensing Bd. of Fall River, </em>444 Mass. 188, 200 (2005). Given that facial challenges to the constitutionality of a law greatly increase the number of persons who have standing to bring a claim, the Supreme Court has cautioned that the overbreadth doctrine is to be employed \u201csparingly and only as a last resort.\u201d <em>Broadrick, supra </em>at 613. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Provost, </em>418 Mass. 416, 422-423 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Abramms, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 576, 580 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 50 <em>(a), </em>does not prohibit all interactions or associations between a prostitute and family members, friends, or social service organizations. Rather, it forbids such individuals or entities from knowingly undertaking specified activities that will enable or cause another person to engage in commercial sexual activity. Conduct of this nature is afforded no constitutional protection. See generally <em>Arcara </em>v. <em>Cloud Books &amp; News Store, Inc., </em>478 U.S. 697, 698-699, 705, 707 (1986) (prostitution and lewdness on premises of \u201cadult\u201d bookstore not protected under First Amendment); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>388 Mass. 460, 464 (1983) (constitutional right to privacy not extended to one engaged in prostitution); <em>State </em>v. <em>Theriault, </em>157 N.H. 215, 219 (2008), quoting <em>Webb </em>v. <em>State, </em>575 N.E.2d 1066, 1070 (Ind. Ct. App. 1991) (\u201cCertainly prostitution is not a constitutionally protected activity\u201d). Accordingly, the defendants\u2019 claims that the statute is overbroad must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Finally, the defendants contend that the phrase \u201ccommercial sexual activity\u201d as used in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 (a), and as defined by G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 49, and by the judge in her jury instructions, is overbroad. In their view, this phrase can encompass many noncriminal sexually oriented activities where money exchanges hands, including \u201ctelephone sex\u201d services, nude dancing, online <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>\u201cchat\u201d sessions, and adult pay-per-view television shows. That being the case, the defendants continue, the overly broad definition of \u201ccommercial sexual activity\u201d should render G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 (a), unconstitutional. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 49, defines \u201c[c]ommercial sexual activity\u201d as \u201cany sexual act on account of which anything of value is given, promised to or received by any person.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The phrase \u201csexual act\u201d is not further defined in the statute. Under well-established principles of statutory construction, \u201ca statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>464 Mass. 365, 368 (2013), quoting <em>Harvard Crimson, Inc. </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>445 Mass. 745, 749 (2006). The purpose and intent of the Legislature in enacting G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 <em>(a), </em>was to prohibit the trafficking of persons for sexual servitude, not to prohibit all range of sexually oriented activities and expressions. Mindful of this distinction, we construe the term \u201ccommercial sexual activity\u201d as referring to any sexual act for value that involves physical contact. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 49. See also <em>Suliveres </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>449 Mass. 112, 118 (2007) (\u201csex act\u201d includes sexual intercourse); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>388 Mass. 460, 463-464 (1983) (\u201csexual activity\u201d encompasses coitus, oral-genital contact, and digital manipulation of another person\u2019s genitals for fee). See generally <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>640 F.3d 255, 258 (7th Cir. 2011) (\u201csexual act\u201d involves physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>contact). This interpretation is consistent with the plain language of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 <em>(a), </em>gives force to the Legislature\u2019s intent to protect victims of sex trafficking, and avoids any potential constitutional problems. As so construed, we believe the statute \u201cavoids any overbreadth problems, and \u2018whatever overbreadth may exist should be cured through case-by-case analysis of the fact situations to which its sanctions, assertedly, may not be applied.\u2019 \u201d <em>Provost, </em>418 Mass. at 423, quoting <em>Broadrick, </em>413 U.S. at 615-616. See <em>Disler, </em>451 Mass. at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">3. <em>Substantive admission of grand jury testimony. </em>We begin with some pertinent background. At trial, S.E. testified that, prior to meeting the defendants, she made the acquaintance of a man named Ray and his cousin, Ethel Watler.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On the day they met, S.E. accompanied Ray to his apartment, where they \u201chung out.\u201d Later in the evening, S.E. and Watler went to another man\u2019s house where each woman had sex with the man for money. When the women returned to Ray\u2019s apartment, Watler and Ray took the money that S.E. had earned, allowing her to keep only twenty dollars for medication. The next morning, S.E. went to a methadone clinic, she did not return to Ray\u2019s apartment, and she never saw Watler and Ray again.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Watler testified at trial pursuant to a grant of immunity. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20E. She described her work as a dancer and an escort. Watler said that she met Tyshaun probably one month after her encounter with S.E., and stated that she would see Tyshaun two or three times a week. She acknowledged that they had engaged in a sexual relationship. Watler testified about the evening she had spent in the company of S.E., and she said that she had told Tyshaun about that evening and had shown him photographs of S.E. When the prosecutor asked Watler whether Tyshaun had taken photographs of Watler to be posted on Backpage.com, Watler stated that she did not remember because she had been doing drugs at the time. Watler responded in a similar fashion when the prosecutor asked her about any conversations she may have had with Tyshaun regarding S.E. and the other women.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The prosecutor attempted, unsuccessfully, to refresh Watler\u2019s recollection by having her read to herself portions of her grand jury testimony. Consequently, the prosecutor asked the judge to allow the Commonwealth to use Watler\u2019s grand jury testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>substantively. The judge instructed the prosecutor to lay more of a foundation regarding Watler\u2019s inability to remember facts to which she had testified before the grand jury, namely the defendants\u2019 activities and admissions. After Watler continued to profess her inability to remember such facts, the prosecutor again asked for the admission of Watler\u2019s grand jury testimony. The judge allowed portions of such testimony to be admitted substantively over the defendants\u2019 objections after finding that Watler was feigning a lack of memory, and that her grand jury testimony did not appear to have been coerced.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As to the latter finding, the judge stated that Watler frequently volunteered additional information in response to the questions she was asked. The judge also pointed out that because Watler was present in court, defense counsel would have the opportunity to cross-examine her.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The prosecutor proceeded to question Watler, who then read portions of her grand jury testimony in evidence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Watler stated that Tyshaun told her that S.E. \u201cwas making money,\u201d and that he and Sidney had engaged in a \u201cthreesome\u201d with S.E. at the house on Dudley Street. Watler identified the Eustis Street apartment as a place where Tyshaun told her he had rented rooms, and where he said Watler could bring \u201ccustomers.\u201d Watler testified that Tyshaun had taken photographs of her in the bathroom of the Dudley Street apartment, and that he had paid for her online advertisements with a credit card. Watler further testified that Tyshaun had told her that \u201che had two white girls [who] had left him\u201d and that he wished he had S.E. because \u201cshe made a lot of money.\u201d On cross-examination, Watler stated that prior to giving her grand jury testimony, she had asked to consult with an attorney but was told by someone in the district attorney\u2019s office that she did not need an attorney because she \u201cwasn\u2019t in any trouble.\u201d She agreed with defense counsel that her grand jury testimony was what she thought the Commonwealth wanted to hear because \u201cthey had a whole bunch of stuff on [her].\u201d Watler testified that S.E. had been a prostitute before the two women had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>met, and that S.E. wanted to make money in exchange for sex and had been \u201ca willing participant.\u201d She also testified that her conversations about S.E. had been with Tyshaun, not Sidney.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">On appeal, the defendants contend that the substantive admission of Watler\u2019s grand jury testimony was improper. They argue that they could not cross-examine Watler effectively at trial because of her lack of memory, and the evidence failed to support the judge\u2019s finding that Watler was feigning memory loss. The defendants further assert that Watler\u2019s grand jury testimony was not free from coercion. They point out that she was aware of potential criminal charges against her if she did not cooperate with the Commonwealth, and was not granted immunity until she testified at trial. Finally, the defendants argue that the substantive admission of Watler\u2019s grand jury testimony was gravely prejudicial, as evidenced by the jury\u2019s request for a transcript of this testimony during their deliberations.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We are not persuaded by the defendants\u2019 arguments and conclude that the judge did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Generally speaking, Massachusetts has adhered to the traditional rule that prior inconsistent statements of a witness may be introduced at trial only for the purpose of impeachment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bookman, </em>386 Mass. 657, 665 (1982). See also Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 801(d)(1)(A) (2015). However, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. 55, 71-75 (1984), as modified by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Duc Le, </em>444 Mass. 431, 432 n.3 (2005), this court deviated from the traditional rule, holding that prior inconsistent statements by a witness before a grand jury can be admitted as substantive evidence if certain conditions are met. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>454 Mass. 527, 533 (2009); Mass. G. Evid., <em>supra. </em>First, there has to be an opportunity for effective cross-examination of the witness at trial. See <em>Daye, supra </em>at 73. \u201cWhen the witness at trial has no recollection of the events to which the statement relates, this requirement of an opportunity for meaningful cross-examination is not met.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, the statement has to be \u201cthat of the witness, rather than the interrogator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74. That is to say, it must be clear that \u201cthe statement was not coerced and was more than a mere confirmation or denial of an allegation by the interrogator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75. In addition, \u201capart from these requirements for admissibility of the prior grand jury testimony as substantive evidence, when that testimony concerns an essential element of the crime, the Commonwealth must offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>at least some corroborative evidence if there is to be sufficient evidence to warrant a conviction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clements, </em>436 Mass. 190, 192-193 (2002). See <em>Daye, supra </em>at 74-75. This corroboration requirement concerns the sufficiency of the evidence, not its admissibility. See <em>Clements, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sineiro, </em>432 Mass. 735, 745 &amp; n.12 (2000), we extended the holding of <em>Daye </em>to include grand jury testimony of a witness who a trial judge determines is \u201cfalsifying a lack of memory.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>466 Mass. 742, 755-756, cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 2312 (2014). \u201cAs one commentator has aptly stated: \u2018[T]he tendency of unwilling or untruthful witnesses to seek refuge in a claim of forgetfulness is well recognized. Hence the judge may be warranted in concluding under the circumstances the claimed lack of memory of the event is untrue and in effect an implied denial of the prior statement, thus qualifying it as inconsistent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sineiro, supra </em>at 742, quoting 2 McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 251, at 117 (5th ed. 1999). \u201cBefore a witness\u2019s grand jury testimony may be admitted under the <em>Daye-Sineiro </em>rule, the judge must make a preliminary finding that the witness\u2019s claimed lack of memory has been fabricated. If that finding is made and is supported by the evidence, it is conclusive.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>439 Mass. 184, 190, cert. denied, 540 U.S. 923 (2003). See <em>Sineiro, supra </em>at 742-743 &amp; n.6. Once the judge makes a finding of feigned memory, the witness\u2019s prior grand jury testimony may be admitted in evidence for substantive consideration provided that the testimony was not coerced and the witness is present at trial for cross-examination. See <em>id. </em>at 745 &amp; n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Here, the judge acted well within her discretion in finding that Watler was feigning memory loss with respect to the defendants\u2019 activities and admissions concerning S.E. The judge was able to observe Watler\u2019s demeanor on the witness stand and to assess her ability to remember many of her interactions and conversations with Tyshaun, but not those that had a bearing on the specific facts of this case. As the judge properly found, Watler was available for cross-examination at trial, and defense counsel took advantage of that opportunity by eliciting testimony that provided context to Watler\u2019s grand jury testimony and enabled the jury to evaluate its accuracy. We discern no error in the judge\u2019s determination that Watler\u2019s testimony before the grand jury was not coerced. Moreover, defense counsel raised and explored the possibility of coercion during cross-examination. The judge properly allowed the substantive admission of limited portions of Watler\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>grand jury testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">4. <em>Cross-examination regarding pending criminal charges. </em>The defendants contend that the judge violated their right to confrontation by hindering cross-examination of C.C. regarding criminal charges pending against her. They assert that because a defendant is entitled to reasonable cross-examination of a prosecution witness for the purpose of showing bias, the judge abused her discretion by precluding defense counsel from impeaching C.C. with evidence that she had been charged with several drug-related offenses. In the defendants\u2019 view, where C.C. testified that she had been told that the district attorney was not interested in prosecuting her, the defendants should have been allowed to explore the possibility that she might have been biased in favor of the Commonwealth. Alternatively, the defendants argue that their trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to seek the introduction of the pending charges against C.C., which could have demonstrated her bias and negated her credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Following an incident that occurred approximately three months after C.C. testified before the grand jury in the present case, C.C. was charged in the Taunton Division of the District Court Department with possession of a class A controlled substance, operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of drugs, and being present where heroin was kept. The Commonwealth filed a motion in limine to preclude any reference to these charges at trial. After a hearing, the motion was allowed. At trial, before the commencement of empanelment, counsel for Tyshaun informed the judge that he did not intend to introduce any evidence of such charges, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t really see how a pending charge is going to come in.\u201d Similarly, although not entirely clear from the trial transcript, it appears that counsel for Sidney did not object to the exclusion of testimony concerning the pending criminal charges against C.C. To the extent that he did argue for the admissibility of such evidence, the basis for his argument was that evidence of C.C.\u2019s drug use was relevant to her ability to remember what had happened to her, which pertained to her credibility. Neither defense attorney mentioned the issue of bias. In response to a question from the judge, the prosecutor represented that the Commonwealth had not made or offered any promises, rewards, or inducements relating to the pending criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">As a general matter, \u201c[ajrrest or indictment alone is insufficient for general impeachment purposes.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>377 Mass. 755, 759 (1979). See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bregoli, </em>431 Mass. 265, 275 (2000) (witness cannot be impeached by use of specific act of misconduct not resulting in conviction). However, \u201cit is well established that a criminal defendant is \u2018entitled, as of right, to reasonable cross-examination of a witness for the purpose of showing bias, particularly where that witness may have a motivation to seek favor with the government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haywood, supra </em>at 760, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dougan, </em>377 Mass. 303, 310 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henson, </em>394 Mass. 584, 586-587 (1985). \u201cA defendant has the <em>right </em>to bring to the jury\u2019s attention any \u2018circumstance which may materially affect\u2019 the testimony of an adverse witness which might lead the jury to find that the witness is under an \u2018influence to prevaricate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haywood, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marcellino, 271 </em>Mass. 325, 327 (1930). It follows that a defendant may question a witness about pending criminal charges in order to show that the witness has a motive to cooperate with the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meas, </em>467 Mass. 434, 449-450, cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 150 (2014), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carmona, </em>428 Mass. 268, 270 (1998). See also <em>Henson, supra. </em>However, we have recognized that evidence of an adverse witness\u2019s prior arrest is not admissible \u201cin all circumstances.\u201d <em>Haywood, supra </em>at 761. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>376 Mass. 920, 924-926 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 373, 378 (1990). See also <em>Dougan, supra </em>(judge has broad discretion in circumscribing proper scope of cross-examination). \u201c[A] defendant is required to furnish some persuasive explanation why the arrest might indicate bias or a motive to lie.\u201d <em>Allen, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Two Juveniles, </em>397 Mass. 261, 267 (1986). The explanation is necessary in order for the judge to \u201cmake an appraisal of the materiality of the testimony sought in light of [the defendant\u2019s] right \u2018to show specific bias or motive to prevaricate on the part of the government witness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haywood, supra, </em>quoting <em>Santos, supra </em>at 924. See <em>Allen, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In this case, defense counsel made no mention to the trial judge of wanting to use the pending criminal charges against C.C. to show that, in their view, she was biased in favor of the Commonwealth. There also was no evidence to suggest that after C.C. was charged with the three drug-related offenses, she changed her version of the events that had transpired with the defendants. We conclude that the judge did not abuse her discretion in precluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>any reference to these charges at trial. In addition, contrary to the defendants\u2019 assertions, there was no ineffective assistance of counsel. During cross-examination of C.C., although counsel for Tyshaun did not raise the three drug-related offenses pending against her, he did pursue a line of inquiry about whether the Commonwealth had agreed not to prosecute C.C. for any crimes that she may have committed while she was with the defendants in exchange for her cooperation and testimony against them. C.C. acknowledged that she had not been prosecuted for any such crimes, and that someone from the district attorney\u2019s office had told her that the Commonwealth had no interest in prosecuting her. This line of questioning served to alert the jury to the issue of possible bias, and the jury could consider the matter during their deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">5. <em>Cross-examination regarding history of prostitution. </em>The defendants contend that the judge also violated their right to confrontation by hindering cross-examination of C.C. regarding her history of prostitution.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In their view, the judge erroneously relied on the rape shield statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, to prevent such a line of inquiry. The defendants argue that they were not attempting to elicit evidence of C.C.\u2019s promiscuity as part of a general credibility attack. Rather, the defendants continue, they sought to show the jury that, contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that they forced C.C. into prostitution, C.C. was a willing participant who had a history of engaging in such activities. We conclude that the judge did not err in excluding evidence of C.C.\u2019s purported history of prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">A trial judge has broad discretion to determine the proper scope of cross-examination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mountry, </em>463 Mass. 80, 86 (2012); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>431 Mass. 535, 538 (2000). \u201cIf a defendant believes that the judge improperly restrained his cross-examination of a witness, the defendant must demonstrate that the judge abused [her] discretion and that he was prejudiced by such restraint.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sealy, </em>467 Mass. 617, 624 (2014), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>399 Mass. 385, 393 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 21B, provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[e]vidence of the reputation of a victim\u2019s sexual conduct shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>not be admissible in an investigation or proceeding before a grand jury or a court of the commonwealth for a violation of [G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50].\u201d The primary purpose of the rape shield statute is \u201cto prevent a general credibility attack of a victim with evidence of his or her promiscuity.\u201d <em>Mountry, </em>463 Mass. at 86. Among the reasons for barring the admission of such evidence is that it has little probative value on the issue of consent because the \u201cvictim\u2019s consent to intercourse with one man does not imply her consent in the case of another.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>443 Mass. 714, 722-723 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McKay, </em>363 Mass. 220, 227 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Irrespective of how the defendants have couched their arguments, they seem to be asserting that because C.C. purportedly engaged in prostitution in the past, she effectively consented to the defendants\u2019 malfeasance, and the jury should have had the opportunity to consider this evidence. We disagree. As the judge properly determined, the introduction of evidence pertaining to C.C.\u2019s past sexual conduct with others was plainly barred by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B. Moreover, as we have discussed, coercion is not an element of the crime of sex trafficking. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 <em>(a). </em>That being the case, it was irrelevant whether C.C. was a willing participant in the defendants\u2019 activities. The exclusion of evidence pertaining to C.C.\u2019s alleged history of prostitution had no bearing on whether the defendants violated G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 (a), and such exclusion did not prejudice the defendants\u2019 cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">6. <em>Illegal sentences. </em>Tyshaun contends that his sentences for two counts of deriving support from the earnings of a prostitute were illegal. He points out that although the applicable statute, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, mandates a minimum sentence of two years and a maximum sentence of five years, he was sentenced to the State prison for a term of from five years to five years and one day. Therefore, he continues, the judge exceeded the maximum sentence allowed under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7. We agree.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u201cAn illegal sentence is one that is not permitted by law for the offense committed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGuinness, </em>421 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>472, 475 (1995). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Layne, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 17, 19 (1985) (\u201cAn \u2018illegal sentence\u2019 is one that is in excess of the punishment prescribed by the relevant statutory provision or in some way contrary to the applicable statute\u201d). General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 7, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">\u201cWhoever, knowing a person to be a prostitute, shall live or derive support or maintenance, in whole or in part, from the earnings or proceeds of his prostitution . . . shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for a period of five years and by a fine of [$5,000].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">\u201cThe sentence of imprisonment imposed under this section shall not be reduced to less than two years, nor suspended, nor shall any person convicted under this section be eligible for probation, parole, or furlough or receive any deduction from his sentence for good conduct or otherwise until he shall have served two years of such sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">We have construed this statute as imposing a maximum term of five years and a minimum term of two years. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lightfoot, </em>391 Mass. 718, 721 (1984). The punishment imposed on Tyshaun was in excess of the statute given that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, does not permit a maximum sentence of five years and one day. Accordingly, Tyshaun\u2019s sentences for his convictions of deriving support from the earnings of a prostitute must be revised to reflect maximum sentences of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">7. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the judgments of conviction on the indictments charging Tyshaun with trafficking persons for sexual servitude and deriving support from the earnings of a prostitute are affirmed. His sentences following the judgments of conviction on the indictments charging him with deriving support from the earnings of a prostitute are vacated, and those cases are remanded to the Superior Court for resentencing consistent with this opinion. The judgments of conviction on the indictments charging Sidney with trafficking persons for sexual servitude are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b425-9\">The full names of C.C., S.E., and B.G. have been omitted in accordance with G.

L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 <em>(a), </em>that is included in the previously enacted analogous Federal statute \u201creflects] a conscious decision by the Legislature to deviate from the standard embodied in the Federal statute.\u201d <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>388 Mass. 427, 433 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b431-12\">By way of example, the defendants suggest that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 (a), as written, permits the Commonwealth to decline to prosecute a taxicab driver who transports a known prostitute to an appointment to engage in commercial sexual activity, but to prosecute the defendants who provide the same service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Our conclusion that the definition of \u201ccommercial sexual activity\u201d is not unconstitutionally overbroad will be discussed in a subsequent portion of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b435-7\">By way of example, the defendants suggest that a mother who feeds, shelters, or transports her daughter, a known adult prostitute, will run afoul of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50 <em>(a). </em>Similarly, they continue, a homeless shelter could be deemed to be harboring known prostitutes, thereby engaging in sex trafficking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b437-6\">This definition is nearly identical to the definition of \u201ccommercial sex act\u201d used in the analogous Federal sex trafficking statute. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591(e)(3) (\u201cThe term \u2018commercial sex act\u2019 means any sex act, on account of which anything of value is given to or received by any person\u201d). See note 8, <em>supra. </em>The defendants have not cited, and we have not found, any case in which a court has concluded that the Federal sex trafficking statute is unconstitutionally over-broad. The defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Backpage.com, LLC </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>939 F. Supp. 2d 805, 832 (M.D. Tenn. 2013), is unpersuasive. In that case, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee considered whether to enjoin a State statute that criminalized the sale of certain sexually oriented advertisements. See <em>id. </em>at 813. In granting the injunction, the court concluded, among other things, that the definition of \u201ccommercial sex act\u201d was likely overbroad because it would include substantial activity unrelated to sex trafficking and would chill the free speech rights of publishers. See <em>id. </em>at 832. Such concerns are' not at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b438-8\">S.E. referred to Ethel Watler by her nickname, \u201cEIlie.:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The judge required the prosecutor to designate specifically the portions of Watler\u2019s grand jury testimony that the Commonwealth sought to have admitted in evidence.
