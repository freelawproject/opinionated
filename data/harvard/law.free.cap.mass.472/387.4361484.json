L. c. 56, \u00a7 42 (\u00a7 42), which criminalizes certain false statements about political candidates or questions submitted to voters.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Melissa Lucas was charged with violating the statute after her political action committee published brochures criticizing a candidate for public office. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that \u00a7 42, on its face, is inconsistent with the fundamental right of free speech guaranteed by art. 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Accordingly, the statute is invalid and the criminal complaint charging Lucas with violating it must be dismissed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>In October, 2014, Jobs First Independent Expenditure Political Action Committee (PAC) published and distributed brochures urging voters to vote against Brian Mannal, the incumbent candidate for State Representative for the Second Barnstable District. In the brochures, the PAC made several statements about Mannal, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">\u201cBrian Mannal chose convicted felons over the safety of our families. Is this the kind of person we want representing us?\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">\u201cHelping Himself: Lawyer Brian Mannal has earned nearly $140,000 of our tax dollars to represent criminals. Now he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>wants to use our tax dollars to pay defense lawyers like himself to help convicted sex offenders\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">\u201cBrian Mannal is putting criminals and his own interest above our families.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">On October 21, 2014, approximately two weeks prior to the general election, Mannal responded by filing an application for a criminal complaint in the Barnstable Division of the District Court Department against Lucas, the PAC\u2019s chairwoman and treasurer. In the application, Mannal alleged that Lucas published knowingly false statements designed to defeat Mannal\u2019s candidacy in violation of \u00a7 42. Mannal held a press conference announcing the filing and published a media advisory further detailing the reasons for the criminal complaint against Lucas and suggesting that the brochures \u201ccould put her behind bars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">On October 27, 2014, Lucas filed a motion to dismiss the application on the ground that \u00a7 42 is an unconstitutional restraint on free speech. A probable cause hearing was scheduled for November 20, 2014 \u2014 approximately two weeks after the general election. Mannal won reelection by a margin of 205 votes. After the election, Lucas and the PAC filed an emergency motion for a preliminary injunction in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking to have the probable cause hearing stayed and \u00a7 42 declared unconstitutional. At the preliminary injunction hearing, the PAC presented evidence that it had refrained from airing a radio advertisement as a result of Mannal\u2019s application and that it would continue to refrain from certain political advocacy until the constitutionality and scope of \u00a7 42 were clarified.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A judge in the Federal court denied relief pursuant to the doctrine of abstention. See <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 41 (1971) (\u201cnational policy forbid[s] federal courts to stay or enjoin pending state court proceedings except under special circumstances\u201d). The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">After a transfer of venue in the State criminal proceedings, a probable cause hearing was held in the Falmouth Division of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>District Court Department on December 18, 2014 \u2014 more than one month after the election. Following the hearing, a clerk-magistrate issued a criminal complaint formally charging Lucas with two counts of violating \u00a7 42. Lucas has not yet been arraigned, and there has not been a ruling on her motion to dismiss. In February, 2015, Lucas filed a petition in the county court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, seeking relief from the criminal complaint on the ground that \u00a7 42 is unconstitutional. The single justice stayed the underlying criminal proceedings and reserved and reported the matter to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Threshold questions. </em>The Commonwealth argues that we should decline to address the constitutionality of \u00a7 42 in this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commonwealth\u2019s first argument is that the extraordinary relief afforded by G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is unavailable because Lucas has an alternative remedy in the form of a motion to dismiss the criminal complaint. See, e.g., <em>Maza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>423 Mass. 1006, 1006 (1996) (\u201crequest for relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is properly denied where the petitioning party has or had adequate and effective avenues other than G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, by which to seek and obtain the requested relief\u2019). This argument is unpersuasive because, \u201cwhere, as here, a single justice of this court reserves and reports an interlocutory m\u00e1tter to this court, we grant the litigant full appellate review.\u201d <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>373 Mass. 157, 159 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Alternatively, the Commonwealth argues that we should dismiss the complaint against Lucas on statutory, rather than constitutional, grounds because the statements at issue were opinions outside the scope of \u00a7 42. See <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., </em>386 Mass. 303, 312, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1037 (1982) (opinions could not be proved false and therefore were not actionable as libel); <em>Aldrich </em>v. <em>Boyle, </em>328 Mass. 30, 32 (1951) (political advertisement was \u201ccustomary type of hortatory appeal commonly made to voters at election time\u201d and not actionable). The Commonwealth recites the familiar rule that we decline to consider the constitutionality of a statute that does not criminalize a defendant\u2019s conduct. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>467 Mass. 371, 381 (2014). Yet, <em>in </em>some contexts, resolving a case on narrower grounds may serve to perpetuate the chilling of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>speech protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 16, as amended by art. 77 of the Amendments. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohmer, </em>374 Mass. 368, 373 (1978). As the United States Supreme Court has observed, this concern may be particularly acute in the context of an election:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">\u201cIt is well known that the public begins to concentrate on elections only in the weeks immediately before they are held. There are short timeframes in which speech can have influence. The need or relevance of the speech will often first be apparent at this stage in the campaign. The decision to speak is made in the heat of political campaigns, when speakers react to messages conveyed by others. A speaker\u2019s ability to engage in political speech that could have a chance of persuading voters is stifled if the speaker must first commence a protracted lawsuit. By the time the lawsuit concludes, the election will be over and the litigants in most cases will have neither the incentive nor, perhaps, the resources to carry on, even if they could establish that the case is not moot because the issue is \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\"><em>Citizens United </em>v. <em>Federal Election Comm\u2019n, </em>558 U.S. 310, 334 (2010), quoting <em>Federal Election Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Right To Life, Inc., </em>551 U.S. 449, 462 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">These observations have substantial force here. Assuming, arguendo, that \u00a7 42 proscribes only statements of fact as opposed to opinion and the statements at issue constituted opinion, a political candidate was nonetheless able to use those statements as the basis for an application for a criminal complaint (and ultimately for its issuance). The candidate then used the application as a political tool not only to discredit the statements but also to persuade the PAC to refrain from airing a political advertisement shortly before the election. Although Lucas filed a motion to dismiss the application, Mannal already had won the election by a narrow margin by the time of the probable cause hearing. Thus, even if the application had been dismissed, the damage was already done. See <em>281 Care Comm. </em>v. <em>Arneson, </em>766 F.3d 774, 790 &amp; n.12 (8th Cir. 2014), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 1550 (2015) (\u201cState has constructed a process that allows its enforcement mechanisms to be used to extract a cost from those seeking to speak out on elections, right at the most crucial time for that particular type <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>of speech. And if the allegations turn out to be unfounded, there is no possibility of timely remedy\u201d [citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Importantly, this precise scenario is capable of repetition yet constantly evading review on the Commonwealth\u2019s theory that \u00a7 42 does not apply to the particular facts of a given case. This is so because anyone may initiate a complaint under \u00a7 42 and, in so doing, create lingering uncertainties of a criminal investigation and chill political speech by virtue of the process itself. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>132 S. Ct. 2537, 2553 (2012) (Breyer, J., concurring) (\u201cthreat of criminal prosecution for making a false statement can inhibit the speaker from making true statements, thereby \u2018chilling\u2019 a kind of speech that lies at the First Amendment\u2019s heart\u201d). See also <em>Susan B. Anthony List </em>v. <em>Driehaus, </em>134 S. Ct. 2334, 2347 (2014) (political organization had standing to challenge constitutionality of statute criminalizing false campaign speech). Because \u201ca statute which chills speech can and must be invalidated where its facial invalidity has been demonstrated,\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>558 U.S. at 336, we decline to dismiss this case on statutory grounds without first considering whether the statute is, in fact, constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">b. <em>Constitutionality of \u00a7 42. </em>i. <em>Protection of political speech. </em>Our constitutional system \u201cpresupposes that right conclusions are more likely to be gathered out of a multitude of tongues, than through any kind of authoritative selection. To many this is, and always will be, folly; but we have staked upon it our all.\u201d <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 270 (1964), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Associated Press, </em>52 F. Supp. 362, 372 (S.D.N.Y. 1943).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a general proposition, therefore, any attempt by the government to restrict speech \u201cbecause of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content\u201d is presumptively invalid and the burden is on the government to establish its constitutionality. <em>Alvarez, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2543-2544, quoting <em>Ashcroft </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, </em>535 U.S. 564, 573 (2002). See <em>Mendoza </em>v. <em>Licensing Bd. of Fall River, </em>444 Mass. 188, 197 n.12 (2005). These principles have their \u201c \u2018fullest and most urgent application\u2019 to speech uttered during a campaign for political office.\u201d <em>Arizona Free Enter. Club\u2019s Freedom Club PAC </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>131 S. Ct. 2806, 2817 (2011), quoting <em>Eu </em>v. <em>San Francisco County Demo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number><em>cratic Cent. Comm., </em>489 U.S. 214, 223 (1989). See generally <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>387 Mass. 1201, 1202 (1982), quoting <em>Colo </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>378 Mass. 550, 558 (1979) (\u201ccriteria which have been established by the United States Supreme Court for judging claims arising under the First Amendment ... are equally appropriate to claims brought under cognate provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Yet, the fact that \u201cspeech is used as a tool for political ends does not automatically bring it under the protective mantle of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Garrison </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 64, 75 (1964). Statements made during the fervor of a political campaign may fall within those \u201cwell-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 571-572 (1942). See <em>New York Times Co., </em>376 U.S. at 268-269. The Commonwealth contends that the campaign speech proscribed by \u00a7 42 falls within two of these classes: fraud, see <em>Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy </em>v. <em>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., </em>425 U.S. 748, 771 (1976), and defamation, see <em>New York Times Co., supra </em>at 283; and is, thus, not entitled to constitutional protection. We disagree. The fact \u201cthat these areas of speech can, consistently with the First Amendment, be regulated because of their constitutionally proscribable content. . . [does] not [mean] that they are categories of speech entirely invisible to the Constitution, so that they may be made the vehicles for content discrimination unrelated to their distinctively proscribable content\u201d (emphasis omitted). <em>R.A.V. </em>v. <em>St. Paul, </em>505 U.S. 377, 383-384 (1992). In others words, statutes that proscribe both protected and unprotected speech are not categorically removed from constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s interest in preventing and punishing election fraud remains relevant to the inquiry into the statute\u2019s constitutionality. See <em>Schaumburg </em>v. <em>Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>444 U.S. 620, 637 (1980). But any legitimate interest in preventing electoral fraud must be done by narrowly drawn laws de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>signed to serve those interests without unnecessarily interfering with First Amendment freedoms. <em>Id. </em>The elements of fraud are \u201c[1] a false representation of material fact, [2] with knowledge of its falsity, [3] for the purpose of inducing the plaintiffs to act on this representation, [4] that the plaintiffs reasonably relied on the representation as true, and [5] that they acted upon it to their damage.\u201d <em>Cumis Ins. Soc\u2019y, Inc. </em>v. <em>BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club, Inc., </em>455 Mass. 458, 471 (2009).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 42 plainly does not require a showing of reliance or damage. See <em>Alvarez, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2554 (Breyer, J., concurring) (\u201cFraud statutes, for example, typically require proof of a misrepresentation that is material, upon which the victim relied, and which caused actual injury\u201d). Contrast <em>Illinois ex rel. Madigan </em>v. <em>Telemarketing Assocs., Inc., </em>538 U.S. 600, 620 (2003) (law targeting fraudulent charitable solicitations fell within fraud exception where it required \u201cdemonstrat[ion] that the defendant made the representation with the intent to mislead the listener, and succeeded in doing so\u201d). Thus, the fact that \u00a7 42 may reach fraudulent speech is not dispositive, because it also reaches speech that is not fraudulent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>553 U.S. 285, 316 n.2 (2008) (Souter, J., dissenting) (\u201cfact that fraud is a separate category of speech which independently lacks First Amendment protection changes the analysis with regard to such proposals, although it does not necessarily dictate the conclusion. The Court has placed limits on the policing of fraud when it cuts too far into other protected speech\u201d). Consequently, \u00a7 42 does not fit within the categorical exception for the regulation of fraudulent speech. See generally <em>R.A.V., </em>505 U.S. at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s attempt to shoehorn \u00a7 42 into the exception for defamatory speech is similarly flawed. \u201cTo prevail on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>claim of defamation, a plaintiff must establish that [1] the defendant was at fault for the publication of a false statement regarding the plaintiff, [2] capable of damaging the plaintiff\u2019s reputation in the community, [3] which either caused economic loss or is actionable without proof of economic loss.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., </em>442 Mass. 64, 66 (2004). Additionally, a defamatory statement against a candidate for public office is actionable only if is made with \u201cactual malice.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Lane </em>v. <em>MPG Newspapers, </em>438 Mass. 476, 479 (2003). See <em>New York Times Co., </em>376 U.S. at 283 (civil); <em>Garrison, </em>379 U.S. at 74 (criminal). Although \u00a7 42 is capable of reaching such defamatory statements, it is also capable of reaching statements regarding ballot questions and statements by a candidate about himself designed to enhance his own candidacy, i.e., statements that clearly are not defamatory. See <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Ohio Elections Comm\u2019n, </em>514 U.S. 334, 352 n.16 (1995), quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>White, </em>116 Ill. 2d 171, 180 (1987) (\u201cA public question clearly cannot be the victim of character assassination\u201d). As a result, \u00a7 42 does not fit within the categorical exception for the regulation of defamatory speech. See generally <em>R.A.V., </em>505 U.S. at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Finding no historical exception into which \u00a7 42 may comfortably fit, we next consider whether the statute imposes a restraint on the content of protected speech. \u201cA statute is content neutral only if \u2018it is justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.\u2019 \u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>436 Mass. 1201, 1206 (2002), quoting <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Rock Against Racism, </em>491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989). Section 42 proscribes false statements whose content is designed to affect candidates and ballot issues. Because the \u201capplicability of the [statute\u2019s] requirements can only be determined by reviewing the contents of the proposed expression, the [statute] is a content-based regulation of speech.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>436 Mass. at 1206. Accordingly, \u00a7 42 is presumptively invalid and the Commonwealth bears the heavy burden of establishing its constitutionality. See <em>Mendoza, </em>444 Mass. at 197 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">ii. <em>Level of scrutiny. </em>The parties dispute the level of constitutional scrutiny that we should apply to \u00a7 42. Lucas argues that strict scrutiny is appropriate because the statute regulates the content of protected speech. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., </em>529 U.S. 803, 814 (2000) (\u201cAs we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>consider a content-based regulation, the answer should be clear: The standard is strict scrutiny\u201d). The Commonwealth advocates for an intermediate level of scrutiny; that is, whether the statute \u201cadvances important governmental interests unrelated to the suppression of free speech and does not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further those interests.\u201d <em>Turner Broadcasting Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Communications Comm\u2019n, </em>520 U.S. 180, 189 (1997). The United States Supreme Court has applied intermediate scrutiny in a variety of contexts, including content-neutral regulations, <em>United States </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 376-377 (1968); prohibitions on commercial speech, <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Western States Med. Ctr., </em>535 U.S. 357, 367 (2002); and \u201creasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions\u201d on voting, <em>Burdick </em>v. <em>Takushi, </em>504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992), quoting <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Celebrezze, </em>460 U.S. 780, 788 (1983). The Commonwealth\u2019s position is that intermediate scrutiny is required here as well, in light of Justice Breyer\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Alvarez, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2551-2552, which it casts as the narrowest and therefore controlling opinion in that case. See <em>Marks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977), quoting <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 169 n.15 (1976) (\u201cWhen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, \u2018the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds ...\u2019\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">In <em>Alvarez, </em>six justices of the Supreme Court agreed that the Stolen Valor Act, which made it a crime to claim falsely receipt of the Congressional Medal of Honor, violated the First Amendment. <em>Alvarez, supra </em>at 2543, 2551. The justices did not agree, however, as to the appropriate level of constitutional scrutiny. A plurality of four justices concluded that because the statute regulated the content of protected speech, it was subject to the \u201cmost exacting scrutiny.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2548, quoting <em>Turner Broadcasting Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Communications Comm\u2019n, </em>512 U.S. 622, 642 (1994). In contrast, the two concurring justices concluded that the more flexible intermediate level of scrutiny was appropriate because the statute did not encroach on a subject matter that traditionally has called for strict scrutiny. <em>Alvarez, supra </em>at 2552. In light of this reasoning, we find it doubtful that the concurring opinion of two justices in <em>Alvarez </em>abrogated the well-established line of First Amendment precedent holding that content-based restrictions of political speech must withstand strict scrutiny. Accord <em>281 Care </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number><em>Comm., </em>766 F.3d at 782 (concluding that <em>Alvarez </em>did not alter level of scrutiny applied to regulation of political speech). See, e.g., <em>Arizona Free Enter. Club\u2019s Freedom Club PAC, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2817, quoting <em>Citizens United, </em>558 U.S. at 340 (\u201c \u2018Laws that burden political speech are\u2019 accordingly \u2018subject to strict scrutiny\u2019 \u201d); <em>Boos </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>485 U.S. 312, 321 (1988) (\u201ca content-based restriction on political speech in a public forum . . . must be subjected to the most exacting scrutiny\u201d [emphasis omitted]).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">In any event, we need not enter that fray because, under our Declaration of Rights, the applicable standard for content-based restrictions on political speech is clearly strict scrutiny. See <em>Bachrach </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>382 Mass. 268, 276 (1981) (\u201cAs a substantial restriction of political expression and association ... the legislation at bar should attract \u2018strict scrutiny\u2019 \u201d).

As a general matter, we agree. See art. 9 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights (\u201cAll elections ought to be free\u201d); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>385 Mass. 1201, 1206 (1982) (\u201cCommonwealth unquestionably has a compelling interest in the overall regularity of the election process\u201d); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>376 Mass. 178, 193, appeal dismissed, 439 U.S. 951 (1978) (\u201cCommonwealth has a substantial, compelling interest in assuring the fairness of elections and the appearance of fairness in the electoral process\u201d). See also <em>Eu, </em>489 U.S. at 231 (\u201cA State indisputably has a compelling interest in preserving the integrity of its election process\u201d). We also agree that this interest includes efforts by the government to thwart political corruption, voter intimidation, and election fraud. See <em>Cepulonis </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>389 Mass. 930, 935-936 (1983). See also <em>Burson </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>504 U.S. 191, 208 (1992) (opinion of Blackmun, J.). However, the Commonwealth \u201cdoes not have carte blanche to regulate the dissemination of false statements during political campaigns,\u201d <em>281 Care Comm., </em>766 F.3d at 787, and its \u201cclaim that it is enhancing the ability of its citizenry to make wise decisions by restricting the flow of information to them must be viewed with some skepticism.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Eu, supra </em>at 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In this case, such skepticism is well founded, as the Commonwealth has not established that \u00a7 42 actually is necessary to serve the compelling interest of fair and free elections. Suppose, for example, that a candidate makes the following false statement at a preelection debate: \u201cI received the Congressional Medal of Honor.\u201d This constitutes (1) a false statement, (2) made about a candidate, (3) designed to aid that candidate win an election, and therefore a crime pursuant to \u00a7 42. Such a result raises serious doubts about the constitutionality of \u00a7 42 in light of <em>Alvarez, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2551 (striking down on First Amendment grounds Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>statute criminalizing false Medal of Honor claims). <em>Alvarez </em>teaches that the criminalization of such falsehoods is unnecessary because a remedy already exists: \u201cthe simple truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2550.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Courts in other jurisdictions have applied this same principle to conclude that statutes broadly suppressing false statements about candidates or ballot questions cannot withstand strict scrutiny for the simple reason that \u201c[o]ur constitutional election system already contains the solution to the problem that [such statutes are] meant to address.\u201d <em>Rickert </em>v. <em>Public Disclosure Comm\u2019n, </em>161 Wash. 2d 843, 855 (2007) (en banc). That solution is counter-speech. See <em>id. </em>(\u201c In a political campaign, a candidate\u2019s factual blunder is unlikely to escape the notice of, and correction by, the erring candidate\u2019s political opponent\u201d [quotations and citations omitted]); <em>281 Care Comm., </em>766 F.3d at 793 (\u201cEspecially as to political speech, counterspeech is the tried and true buffer and elixir\u201d). Governmental efforts to supplant political counterspeech with the specter of incarceration date back to the earliest years of our constitutional democracy. The Sedition Act of 1798, c. 74, 1 Stat. 596, enacted by Congress just seven years after the ratification of the First Amendment, made it a crime to \u201cknowingly and willingly assist or aid in writing, printing, uttering or publishing any false, scandalous and malicious writing or writings against the government of the United States . . . with intent to defame the said government... or to bring [it] . .. into contempt or disrepute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2. In 1799, the Legislature issued a declaration of support for the Sedition Act. Jenkins, The Sedition Act of 1798 and the Incorporation of Seditious Libel into First Amendment Jurisprudence, 45 Am. J. Legal Hist. 154, 172 (2001). In the election of 1800, however, the unconstitutionality of the Sedition Act was a prominent theme in Thomas Jefferson\u2019s successful campaign for the presidency. See Amar, The Bill of Rights as a Constitution, 100 Yale L.J. 1131, 1149-1150 (1991). As the Supreme Court has observed, history has proven Jefferson right. See <em>New York Times Co., </em>376 U.S. at 274-276. The fabric of jurisprudence woven across the years following the passage of the Sedition Act and, indeed, \u00a7 42 has illustrated vividly that the importance of preserving \u201cthe freedom to think for ourselves,\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>558 U.S. at 356, must be elevated over even those well-intentioned laws that have the effect of \u201ccensoring pure speech or speakers in order to \u2018improve the quality\u2019 or \u2018increase the fairness\u2019 of public debate.\u201d <em>Bachrach, </em>382 Mass. at 281, quoting Cox, The Supreme Court 1979 Term Forward: Free<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>dom of Expression in the Burger Court, 94 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 67 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The Commonwealth attempts to distinguish these principles with the rather remarkable argument that the election context gives the government broader authority to restrict speech. The opposite is true. See, e.g., <em>Weld for Governor </em>v. <em>Director of the Office of Campaign &amp; Political Fin., </em>407 Mass. 761, 769 (1990), quoting <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 15 (1976) (\u201cFirst Amendment rights of speech and association have their \u2018fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office\u2019 \u201d); <em>Anderson, </em>376 Mass. at 191 n.14 (\u201copen discussion of political candidates and elections is basic First Amendment material. Government domination of the expression of ideas is repugnant to our system of constitutional government\u201d). See also <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>486 U.S. 414, 425 (1988) (\u201cthe speech at issue is \u2018at the core of our electoral process and of the First Amendment freedoms,\u2019 ... an area of public policy where protection of robust discussion is at its zenith\u201d [citation omitted]). Thus, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>368 Mass. 92, 92 (1975), we struck down a similar statute, G. L. c. 56, \u00a7 41, which made it a crime to distribute anonymous pamphlets \u201cdesigned to aid or to defeat any candidate for nomination or election to any public office or any question submitted to the voters.\u201d We observed that there was \u201csignificant authority that a disclosure requirement relating to election pamphlets cannot survive a First Amendment challenge,\u201d <em>Dennis, supra </em>at 98, notwithstanding the government\u2019s constitutional interest in ensuring fair and free elections. See art. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Equally remarkable is the Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on the <em>Citizens United </em>case to defend greater restrictions on election speech. In that case, the Supreme Court departed from precedent to strike down on First Amendment grounds a Federal statute restricting the ability of corporations to make political expenditures from general treasury funds. <em>Citizens United, </em>558 U.S. at 318-319, 372. The Commonwealth contends that, as a result of this decision, heavily funded groups are now able to skew political discourse so as to render counterspeech an ineffective remedy for falsehood.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Regardless of the essential impact of <em>Citizens United </em>on the democratic process, that decision does not provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>any support for reducing the constitutional protection afforded core political speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Latching on to language from <em>McIntyre, </em>514 U.S. at 349, that \u201c[t]he state interest in preventing fraud and libel . . . carries special weight during election campaigns,\u201d the Commonwealth points out that \u00a7 42 reaches falsehoods far more insidious and difficult to discredit on the eve of an election than, for example, the lie uttered in <em>Alvarez. </em>Accordingly, the argument goes, \u00a7 42 is necessary because, in contrast to <em>Alvarez, </em>the shortened time frame of an election may render the truth an ineffective remedy. This point is well taken, but nonetheless fails because, like the statute at issue in <em>McIntyre, </em>\u00a7 42 is not narrowly tailored. <em>McIntyre, supra </em>at 357 (striking down on First Amendment grounds State statute prohibiting anonymous political leafletting).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Section 42 applies not only to elections of public officers, but also to ballot issues. See <em>McIntyre, supra </em>at 351-352. It may be invoked as soon as one announces his or her candidacy \u2014 not merely on the eve of the election. Cf. <em>id. </em>at 352 (\u201cIt applies not only to leaflets distributed on the eve of an election, when the opportunity for reply is limited, but also to those distributed months in advance\u201d). It reaches not only those statements that are widely disseminated through commercial advertisement, but also those exchanged between two friends engaged in a spirited political discussion in a local pub. Cf. <em>id. </em>at 351 (\u201cIt applies not only to the activities of candidates and their organized supporters, but also to individuals acting independently and using only their own modest resources\u201d); <em>Alvarez, supra </em>at 2555 (Breyer, J., concurring) (\u201cthe prohibition may be applied where it should not be applied, for example, to bar stool braggadocio or, in the political arena, subtly but selectively to speakers that the Government does not like\u201d). Moreover, as reflected in the Medal of Honor hypothetical, it applies to a broad range of content that does not pose a realistic threat to the maintenance of fair and free elections. Cf. <em>McIntyre, supra </em>at 351 (\u201cAlthough these ancillary benefits are assuredly legitimate, we are not persuaded that they justify [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>statute\u2019s] extremely broad prohibition\u201d). Thus, the more apt observation from <em>McIntyre </em>is this: \u201cThe State may, and does, punish fraud directly. But it cannot seek to punish fraud indirectly by indiscriminately outlawing a category of speech, based on its content, with no necessary relationship to the danger sought to be prevented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357. See <em>State ex rel. Public Disclosure Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>119 Vote No! Comm., </em>135 Wash. 2d 618, 630 (1998) (en banc) (\u201cthe State asserts <em>McIntyre </em>impliedly suggested laws prohibiting false political statements are constitutional. However the inference to be drawn from <em>McIntyre </em>is just the opposite\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">As the facts of this case demonstrate, the danger of such breadth is that the statute may be manipulated easily into a tool for subverting its own justification, i.e., the fairness and freedom of the electoral process, through the chilling of core political speech. See <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>362 Mass. 570, 587-588 (1972), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Congress of Indus. Orgs., </em>335 U.S. 106, 155 (1948) (Rutledge, J., concurring) (\u201cA statute which, in the claimed interest of free and honest elections, curtails the very freedoms that make possible exercise of the franchise by an informed and thinking electorate, and does this by . . . serving as a prior restraint upon expression not in fact forbidden as well as upon what is, cannot be squared with the First Amendment\u201d). See also <em>Alvarez, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2550 (\u201csuppression of speech by the government can make exposure of falsity more difficult, not less so\u201d); <em>281 Care Comm., </em>766 F.3d at 796 (\u201cstatute itself actually opens a Pandora\u2019s box to disingenuous politicking\u201d); <em>119 Vote No! Comm., </em>135 Wash. 2d at 626, 627, quoting <em>McIntyre, </em>514 U.S. at 352 n.16 (\u201ca well-publicized, yet bogus, complaint to the [commission] on election eve raises the same concern [as \u2018an eleventh-hour anonymous smear campaign\u2019]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The Commonwealth suggests that we could curb this danger by narrowly construing \u00a7 42 to regulate only fraudulent and defamatory speech. Although the statute could be narrowly construed in some respects, it is not amenable to the construction proposed by the Commonwealth, see <em>Blixt </em>v. <em>Blixt, </em>437 Mass. 649, 674 (2002), quoting <em>School Comm. of Greenfield </em>v. <em>Greenfield Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>385 Mass. 70, 79 (1982) (\u201cIt is our duty to construe statutes so as to avoid such constitutional difficulties, <em>if reasonable principles of interpretation permit it\u201d);</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and even if we were to read the statute narrowly to encompass only knowingly false statements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>fact, the distinction between fact and opinion is not always obvious and, evidently, was not obvious to the clerk-magistrate who issued the criminal complaint in this case. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>400 Mass. 705, 709 (1987) (\u201cit is much easier to recognize the significance of the distinction between statements of opinion and statements of fact than it is to make the distinction in a particular case\u201d). \u201c[S]uch a determination itself may be viewed [by the electorate] as a sanction by the State\u201d [quotation and citation omitted]. <em>Susan B. Anthony List, </em>134 S. Ct. at 2346.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Moreover, even in cases involving seemingly obvious statements of political fact, distinguishing between truth and falsity may prove exceedingly difficult. Assertions regarding a candidate\u2019s voting record on a particular issue may very well require an in-depth analysis of legislative history that will often be ill-suited to the compressed time frame of an election. Thus, in the election context, as elsewhere, it is apparent \u201cthat the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas \u2014 that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which [the people\u2019s] wishes safely can be carried out. That at any rate is the theory of our Constitution.\u201d <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>415 Mass. 258, 268 (1993), quoting <em>Abrams </em>v. <em>United States, </em>250 U.S. 616, 630 (1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting). See <em>281 Care Comm., </em>766 F.3d at 796 (\u201ccitizenry, not the government, should be the monitor of falseness in the political arena\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The foregoing problems make it all the more concerning that anyone may file an application for a criminal complaint under \u00a7 42. See <em>281 Care Comm., </em>766 F.3d at 790. The risk inherent in such an environment is that an individual, unconstrained by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>ethical obligations imposed on government officials, will file an unmeritorious application \u201cat a tactically calculated time so as to divert the attention of an entire campaign from the meritorious task at hand of supporting or defeating a ballot question [or candidate].\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Susan B. Anthony </em>List, 134 S. Ct. at 2345 (\u201cBecause the universe of potential complainants is not restricted to state officials who are constrained by explicit guidelines or ethical obligations, there is a real risk of complaints from, for example, political opponents\u201d). See generally Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.8 comment 1, 426 Mass. 1397 (1998) (\u201cprosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of justice\u201d). As was the case here, by the time of the probable cause hearing the election may well be over and the damage will be done. See <em>281 Care Comm., </em>766 F.3d at 792. Thus, even under a narrow construction, there is a genuine risk that the operation of \u00a7 42 will cast an unacceptable chill on core political speech. The statute cannot withstand strict scrutiny.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We conclude that \u00a7 42 cannot be limited to the criminalization of fraudulent or defamatory speech, is neither necessary nor narrowly tailored to advancing the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in fair and free elections, and chills the very exchange of ideas that gives meaning to our electoral system. For all of these reasons, we hold that \u00a7 42 is antagonistic to the fundamental right of free speech enshrined in art. 16 of our Declaration of Rights and, therefore, is invalid. Accordingly, the criminal complaint charging Lucas with violating \u00a7 42 must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-9\">General Laws c. 56, \u00a7 42 (\u00a7 42), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">\u201cNo person shall make or publish, or cause to be made or published, any false statement in relation to any candidate for nomination or election to public office, which is designed or tends to aid or to injure or defeat such candidate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">\u201cNo person shall publish or cause to be published in any letter, circular, advertisement, poster or in any other writing any false statement in relation to any question submitted to the voters, which statement is designed to affect the vote on said question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\">\u201cWhoever knowingly violates any provision of this section shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than six months.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-13\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts; the Cato Institute; the New England Legal Foundation; the New England First Amendment Coalition, Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC, Massachusetts Newspaper Publishers Association, Hearst Television, Inc., New England Newspaper and Press Association, Inc., and New England Society of Newspaper Editors; and Russell C.

See <em>Blixt </em>v. <em>Blixt, </em>437 Mass. 649, 674 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1189 (2013), quoting <em>Mile Rd. Corp. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>345 Mass. 379, 383, appeal dismissed, 373 U.S. 541 (1963) (\u201cA statute, of course, must be construed, if possible, to avoid serious constitutional doubts. This principle, however, does not authorize the judiciary to supply qualifying words not fairly to be imported from the actual language of the statute\u201d). As explained above, the plain language of \u00a7 42 criminalizes an array of false statements that extend well beyond fraud and defamation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b422-7\">To the extent that a contrary conclusion could be drawn from our passing reference to \u00a7 42 in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>363 Mass. 909, 916 (1973), that conclusion is overruled.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
