He argues that the trial judge erred by declining to instruct the jury on manslaughter on a provocation theory; denying his motion for a new trial on the ground that a manslaughter instruction on this theory clearly was required; in connection with the murder charge, failing to instruct the jury that before they could infer malice from the intentional use of a dangerous weapon on the part of the defendant as a joint venturer with Van Gustave (see note 1, <em>supra), </em>the jury must find that the defendant knew Gustave was armed with a knife; allowing the jury to consider hearsay evidence to establish the defendant\u2019s knowledge that his alleged joint venturer Gustave possessed a knife; and denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty on the two charges relating to the victim Stevens. He also claims that he is entitled to relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. We affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions and decline to grant relief pursuant to c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\"><em>Background. </em>1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the facts the jury could have found, reserving certain details for later discussion in connection with the issues raised. On the night of July 1, 2004, the city of Somerville put on a fireworks display in Tram Field. The defendant, Gustave, and their respective girl friends, Claudine Dyer and Danielle Leblanc, met before the fireworks and went together to the event. All four were drinking before and during the fireworks display; Gustave and Leblanc also had taken a number of Klonopin pills. As they were walking together toward the fireworks, Leblanc asked Gustave if she could hold his knife in case they ran into \u201canybody that I had problems with.\u201d Gustave answered, \u201cNo.\u201d Dyer similarly asked the defendant whether he had a knife and whether she could hold it; the defendant also answered, \u201cNo.\u201d The defendant heard the interchange between Gustave and Leblanc.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The foursome watched the fireworks from a garage roof on Albion Street, where they drank beer and smoked marijuana; the defendant and Dyer each drank approximately six beers. After the fireworks were over, the four began to walk on Cedar Street. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>William Tighe came running down the street from the bicycle path near them, and Leblanc confronted him with a statement or question about her brother and drugs. A heated dispute between Leblanc and Tighe ensued, in the course of which Tighe came up very close to Leblanc, shouting and threatening her. Dyer then approached Tighe and punched him in the face, and Tighe responded by pushing Dyer down against a fence. As this confrontation was taking place, Sullivan and Stevens came walking down the street and were standing behind Tighe, whom they knew through Tighe\u2019s younger brother. Neither Sullivan nor Stevens carried a weapon, and neither said anything or joined the dispute. After Tighe pushed Dyer, the defendant and Gustave began to approach him, and they both took out their knives; Tighe did not have a weapon. Tighe began to run down Warwick Street and told Stevens and Sullivan to run; Gustave and the defendant ran after Tighe in pursuit. Tighe stumbled as he ran; the defendant caught up to him and stabbed him with a knife in the back, inflicting a superficial wound. Tighe got up and continued to run. The defendant and Gustave ran toward Stevens and Sullivan. Gustave grabbed Stevens by the waist and stabbed him in the side; Stevens fell to the ground. The defendant did not attack Stevens but connected with Sullivan. At this point, the entire group was on Warwick Street. The defendant stood and then crouched over Sullivan, with his arm repeatedly stabbing him in the stomach area. Gustave then joined the defendant in stabbing Sullivan; Sullivan appeared to be fighting against them. Leblanc kicked Sullivan a few times in the head as he lay on the ground, and Dyer also may have kicked him.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">As these events were unfolding on Warwick Street, Michael McCormack, Tighe\u2019s stepfather, who was in the backyard of his house on Warwick Street, heard a young male voice say, \u201cGet off me. Leave me alone,\u201d and came running out of his driveway. He saw the defendant and Gustave bending over Sullivan and Stevens, who were both lying on the ground. McCormack ran toward the defendant and Gustave, swearing at them, and \u201cbowled them over.\u201d The defendant and Gustave ran away, as did Dyer and Leblanc.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">As they ran, Dyer stopped and asked Gustave and the defendant why \u201cthat kid\u201d was bleeding, and Gustave responded, \u201cBecause we just stabbed them. We just stabbed them.\u201d The defendant said, three times, \u201cI\u2019m on probation.\u201d He also said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201d Dyer was running a little behind the defendant, and as they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>ran, a resident who was out on a porch heard the defendant say, \u201cHurry the fuck up. I just stabbed three people, three guys, and I\u2019m going to jail for three years.\u201d The defendant, Gustave, Dyer, and Leblanc ultimately ended up at Leblanc\u2019s house in Somerville.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">In the meantime, McCormack and his wife, Elizabeth McCor-mack, who is Tighe\u2019s mother, tried to tend to the two prone victims; each recognized both Sullivan and Stevens. A telephone call was made to 911. Sullivan and Stevens were taken to the hospital. Sullivan died within one hour, having received at least seven stab wounds; he was sixteen years of age. Stevens lost his kidney and spent thirty days in the hospital; he was seventeen years of age.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">2. <em>Procedural history. </em>On September 9, 2004, a Middlesex County grand jury returned indictments against the defendant and Gustave, charging each of them with murder in the first degree of Sullivan (count one); armed assault with intent to murder Stevens and Tighe (counts two and three); assault and battery of Stevens by means of a dangerous weapon, causing serious bodily injury (count four); and assault and battery of Tighe by means of a dangerous weapon (count five). The defendant\u2019s case was severed from Gustave\u2019s before trial. See note 5, <em>infra. </em>The jury found the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree of Sullivan on the theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty, as well as on counts four and five, charging assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon of Stevens and Tighe, respectively.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the charges of armed assault with intent to murder Stevens and Tighe, the jury convicted the defendant of the lesser included offense of assault by means of a dangerous weapon.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant filed a timely appeal in this court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">In November, 2007, the defendant filed, pro se, his posttrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>motion in the Superior Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thereafter, the defendant\u2019s appeal to this court was stayed while the defendant pursued his posttrial motion. The trial judge heard the motion, taking evidence on the defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. After that evidentiary hearing, the judge denied the defendant\u2019s posttrial motion. The defendant\u2019s appeal from the denial of that motion has been consolidated with his direct appeal of his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Manslaughter instruction. </em>The defendant argues that the judge committed reversible error in declining to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense of the murder charge. He claims that, as the judge \u201cfound\u201d in ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, there was evidence that Sullivan had jumped on the defendant\u2019s back and the defendant pushed him off.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He then asserts that this evidence would permit the jury to find that the defendant, in stabbing Sullivan thereafter, was acting in a heat of passion on reasonable provocation or induced by sudden combat. We disagree.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">The defendant is correct that if any view of the evidence would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>permit a finding of voluntary manslaughter, an instruction on this lesser offense must be given. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garabedian, </em>399 Mass. 304, 313 (1987). It is also the case that such an instruction cannot be refused even if the evidence on which the claim for a manslaughter instruction is based is not \u201cof a character to inspire belief\u2019 (citation omitted). See <em>id. </em>But an instruction on voluntary manslaughter is only warranted \u201cif there is evidence of provocation deemed adequate in law to cause the accused to lose his self-control in the heat of passion, and if the killing followed the provocation before sufficient time had elapsed for the accused\u2019s temper to cool.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>446 Mass. 435, 443 (2006), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrade, </em>422 Mass. 236, 237 (1996). The jury also must be able to infer from the evidence \u201cthat a reasonable person would have become sufficiently provoked and that, in fact, the defendant was provoked,\u201d and that \u201cthere is a causal connection between the provocation, the heat of passion, and the killing\u201d (quotations and citations omitted). <em>Garabedian, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The defendant does not contend that Leblanc identified the person she saw jump on the defendant\u2019s back, but argues that by process of elimination, the unidentified person had to have been Sullivan, because Leblanc identified the person as a male and stated that the male was not McCormack; the person was not Tighe, because Tighe ran back to his home after being stabbed by the defendant; and the person was not Stevens because, the jury could find, Gustave previously had \u201cstabbed and disabled\u201d Stevens. To this, the defendant adds that he already was upset by Tighe\u2019s attack on his girl friend that had taken place only seconds before, and that if the jury were to find that the defendant had attacked Sullivan,* ****<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Sullivan\u2019s physical assault of the defendant independently provoked his emotions so that when the defendant attacked Sullivan, he was acting in the heat of passion due to provocation or sudden combat. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hinds, </em>457 Mass. 83, 90-91 (2010), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>442 Mass. 826, 838-839 (2004) (\u201cprovocation must come from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>victim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">The defendant\u2019s argument is defeated by an absence of evi-dentiary support. The evidence from which the jury could find that the defendant stabbed Sullivan came from three witnesses: Dyer, McCormack, and Stevens. Each of the three testified to seeing the defendant standing or crouching next to or over Sullivan\u2019s body, inferably engaged in stabbing him.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But none of them testified to seeing anyone jump on the defendant\u2019s back or indeed interact physically with the defendant before each saw the defendant standing over and stabbing Sullivan. Leblanc was the sole source of evidence concerning someone jumping on the defendant\u2019s back. She testified that she saw the person jump on the defendant\u2019s back and saw the defendant push the person off. At no point did she testify to seeing any further interactions between the defendant and the person he had pushed off his back. Rather, all she stated was that she had observed the person jump on the defendant\u2019s back either while or soon after she kicked the body of a male<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> lying on the ground on Warwick Street, and that this incident had happened around the time that she began to run down Warwick Street away from the body on the ground and she saw McCormack running on Warwick Street toward her.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">The jury, of course, were free to believe or disbelieve, in whole or in part, the testimony of each witness. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawkesworth, </em>405 Mass. 664, 675 (1989). Accordingly, the jury in theory could have credited Leblanc\u2019s testimony that she saw the body of only one person lying on the ground, and that the body she was kicking was that of Stevens, not Sullivan, and could have inferred that the person who jumped on the defendant\u2019s back was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>Sullivan.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But the jury were not entitled to attribute to any witness, including Leblanc, a statement or statements that the witness did not make. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. McInerney, 373 Mass. 136, 144 (1977). Given the state of the evidentiary record, with no evidence of contact between the defendant and Sullivan following the alleged jump on the defendant\u2019s back, there simply was no factual basis on which it could be found that the defendant stabbed Sullivan in an emotionally heated response to the physical interaction between the two. Put another way, the evidence necessary to support the essential causal link between any heat of passion on the defendant\u2019s part resulting from Sullivan\u2019s jumping on his back, and the defendant\u2019s stabbing of Sullivan, see <em>Garabedian, </em>399 Mass. at 313, was missing. The judge did not err in declining to include the charge on voluntary manslaughter in his instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">2. <em>Instruction on malice in connection with joint venture murder charge. </em>With respect to the charge of murder in the first degree, the Commonwealth\u2019s theory at trial was that the defendant and Gustave committed the crime as part of a joint venture. More particularly, the Commonwealth argued that the defendant acted as a principal by stabbing Sullivan repeatedly with his knife, or as a joint venturer with Gustave who himself stabbed Sullivan repeatedly, or both. The defendant\u2019s theory at trial, see note 9, <em>supra, </em>was that Gustave alone attacked Sullivan \u2014 i.e., Gustave was the principal in the crime \u2014 and that the defendant did not participate in that attack or share Gustave\u2019s intent, but actually tried to stop Gustave from continuing with that attack. The judge instructed the jury that the Commonwealth\u2019s theory was that the defendant committed the crime of murder as part of a joint venture, and explained what the Commonwealth had to prove in order to establish that the defendant was guilty under this theory. He also separately instructed on the elements of murder in the first degree. In his instruction on the concept of malice in relation to murder under the theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty, he told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-6\">\u201cMalice, for this theory of murder, also includes an intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>to do an act, that in the circumstances known to the defendant, a reasonable person would have known created a plain and strong likelihood that death would follow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-5\">\u201cUnder this third meaning of malice, you must determine whether based on what the defendant actually knew at the time that he acted, a reasonable person would have recognized that such conduct created a plain and strong likelihood that death would result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-6\">\u201cIn determining whether the Commonwealth has proven this third meaning of malice, you must consider the defendant\u2019s actual knowledge of the circumstances at the time that he acted. <em>Where there is evidence that a person brought a dangerous weapon to a scene and used the dangerous weapon on another, you may consider that evidence as relevant in proving malice\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument on appeal is not entirely clear, but appears to be that it was error for the judge to include this instruction concerning use of a dangerous weapon because, insofar as the Commonwealth was proceeding on a joint venture theory, the jury could infer the malice necessary for murder on the defendant\u2019s part from Gustave\u2019s use of a dangerous weapon, without any proof that the defendant knew Gustave was armed. Put another way, the defendant appears to claim that in the joint venture context presented by the Commonwealth, it was necessary to instruct the jury that the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant knew Gustave had a knife before they might infer malice on the defendant\u2019s part from Gustave\u2019s intentional use of that knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">The argument fails. First, the instruction that the judge gave is most reasonably understood as referring to defining malice directly only in connection with the defendant. Thus, the reference in the quoted instruction to a \u201cperson\u201d who brings and uses a dangerous weapon follows directly after the direction that the jury must consider the defendant\u2019s \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the circumstances, suggesting that the \u201cperson\u201d being referred to is the defendant. It seems highly unlikely the jury would interpret this instruction as indicating that if they found that Gustave had brought and used a dangerous weapon, they might infer from that finding the existence of malice on the defendant\u2019s part. Second, even if one were to conclude that the jury might understand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>dangerous weapon reference in this instruction as meaning they could somehow consider Gustave\u2019s use of a dangerous weapon in considering the element of malice on the defendant\u2019s part, the judge\u2019s joint venture instructions \u2014 given both as part of the judge\u2019s final charge and again in response to a jury question \u2014 specifically told the jury that if the other person in the joint venture actually committed the substantive crime, the jury must find that the defendant himself had or shared the intent necessary for that crime, thus indicating that the jury must consider the defendant\u2019s intent on its own, not as an automatic transfer of the intent of the coventurer. These instructions were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">The defendant contends that to prove joint venture first-degree murder under a theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty where a dangerous weapon is involved, the Commonwealth should be required to prove that the joint venturer both knew the principal had a dangerous weapon and shared the principal\u2019s intent to commit the murder in an atrocious or cruel way. That is not the law. Where use of a weapon is not an element of the crime \u2014 and it is not an element of murder in the first degree \u2014 there is no requirement for the Commonwealth to prove knowledge on the part of a joint venturer that the principal was armed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>468 Mass. 231, 245 (2014), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britt, </em>465 Mass. 87, 100 (2013). In addition, in a case of joint venture first-degree murder committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty, malice alone defines the intent that the Commonwealth must prove. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v <em>Chaleumphong, </em>434 Mass. 70, 79-80 (2001) (intent necessary for murder in first degree under theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty is malice alone; \u201c[i]f the Commonwealth has no burden to prove that a defendant who acted alone knew that his acts were extremely atrocious or cruel, then it has no such burden where the defendant acts in a joint venture\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunneen, </em>389 Mass. 216, 227 (1983) (same); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monsen, </em>377 Mass. 245, 254-255 (1979) (same). Although in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>466 Mass. 763, 777-778 (2014) (Gants, J., concurring), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>467 Mass. 799, 828 (2014) (Duffly, J., concurring), the concurring opinions suggested that it may be time to revisit the intent element of murder in the first degree committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty, this is not the case in which to do so. There was significant evidence indicating that the defendant himself was engaged in repeatedly stabbing the victim Sullivan, that Sullivan struggled to avoid the harm being inflicted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>and that the stabbing wounds he received would have been painful. The judge properly instructed the jury under the principles of law that governed at the time; we leave to another day the question whether to change or modify those governing legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">3. <em>Evidence of defendant\u2019s knowledge that his joint venturer was armed with knife. </em>Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the judge permitted Leblanc to testify that while she was walking with Dyer, Gustave, and the defendant to the fireworks, she asked Gustave for \u201cthe knife\u201d in case she ran into anyone she \u201chad problems with,\u201d and he said, \u201cNo.\u201d She also testified that she did not ask whether Gustave had a knife at that time, but assumed that he did. At the conclusion of Leblanc\u2019s testimony, the judge gave a limiting instruction to the jury to the effect that if they found that Gustave had stated that he possessed a knife and that the defendant had heard him make the statement, the jury could consider that evidence as relevant only to the issue whether the defendant knew that Gustave was armed with a knife.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant argues that despite the limiting instruction, Leblanc\u2019s testimony about her exchange with Gustave was admitted for its truth, and constituted improper hearsay evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">There was no error. The issue whether the defendant knew Gustave was carrying a knife was clearly relevant in this case, if for no other reason than that the Commonwealth\u2019s theory was that the two men were acting together as part of a joint venture, and that the crimes charged relating to Stevens and Tighe included as an element the possession or use of a dangerous weapon. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>460 Mass. 64, 69-70 (2011), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Claudio, </em>418 Mass. 103, 111 (1994), overruled on another ground by <em>Britt, </em>465 Mass. at 99 (to convict defendant as joint venturer rather than principal of crime involving use or possession of dangerous weapon, Commonwealth must prove defendant knew his coventurer was armed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>with dangerous weapon). Contrary to the defendant\u2019s suggestion, however, the evidence was not admitted to prove that in fact Gustave had a knife. Contrast, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>391 Mass. 97, 104-105, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 840 (1984) (victim\u2019s statements to others about facts of past events inadmissible under state of mind exception to hearsay rule). Rather, the judge\u2019s limiting instruction specifically restricted the relevance and the jury\u2019s use of the statement to the defendant\u2019s state of knowledge, and as such, it was not hearsay. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>464 Mass. 648, 652 n.5 (2013). See also Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 801(c) note (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">4. <em>Sufficiency of evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt on charges relating to Stevens. </em>The defendant was found guilty of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon causing serious bodily injury to the victim Stevens. The verdict was necessarily premised on a determination by the jury that the defendant was acting solely as a joint venturer with Gustave, because the undisputed evidence was that Stevens was stabbed only by Gustave.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">As he did at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case when he moved for a required finding of not guilty, the defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence that he was guilty of this crime as a joint venturer. We review the evidence to determine whether a rational juror could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly participated in the crime at issue with the requisite intent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrero, </em>459 Mass. 235, 247 (2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zanetti, </em>454 Mass. 449, 468 (2009). See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">The evidence permitted a reasonable juror to find that the defendant and Gustave were close friends; that the two had come to the scene together with their respective girl friends; that the two took out and displayed their knives at the same time to confront the victim Tighe; and that the two chased the three victims \u2014 Tighe, Stevens, and Sullivan \u2014 and they both joined in physically attacking Sullivan. The attacks on all the victims took place in a very short period of time, and at least the attacks on Sullivan and Stevens took place in a circumscribed physical area: when the police arrived, Stevens and the victim Sullivan were lying on the ground within a few feet of each other.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Considered as a whole, the evidence was sufficient to warrant the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>jury\u2019s guilty verdict on this charge. See <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. at 677-678. The defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty was properly denied.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">5. <em>Relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>The defendant argues that relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, is warranted here because of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument \u25a0\u2014 the defendant claims improper appeals to emotion and that the prosecutor argued facts not in evidence, errors in the judge\u2019s instructions, and mitigating factors. We have thoroughly reviewed the entire record of this case. We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s closing was not improper and find no reason that would warrant relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-7\">The defendant\u2019s codefendant, Van Gustave, was not tried together with the defendant.

R. Crim. P.] 25 (b) (2)[, 378 Mass. 896 (1979),] and reversal of the imposition of sentence of first degree life pursuant to [Mass. R. Crim. P.] 28[, 378 Mass. 898 (1979)]\u201d (post-trial motion). The trial judge treated the defendant\u2019s posttrial motion as a combined motion for a required finding of not guilty under Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 (b), and a motion for a new trial under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30, as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001). We consider the substance of the posttrial motion in the same manner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b894-8\">The defendant contends that the judge found as a fact that Danielle Leblanc saw Ryan Sullivan jump on the defendant\u2019s back. The judge made no such finding. In his posttrial ruling, the judge summarized and discussed Leblanc\u2019s trial testimony, and described Leblanc as having testified that she saw \u201ca third man\u201d jump on Spinucci\u2019s back. The judge referred to Leblanc\u2019s \u201ctestimony that she saw <em>Sullivan </em>jump on Spinucci\u2019s back before Spinucci thr[e]w him off\u2019 (emphasis added). However, in her testimony, Leblanc never identified the man. Nor could the judge have made a finding that Leblanc saw Sullivan jump on the defendant\u2019s back, given that at the evidentiary hearing held on the defendant\u2019s posttrial motion, the only person who was sworn and testified as a witness was the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, whose testimony did not refer at any point to Leblanc\u2019s alleged observation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b894-9\">During the charge conference at trial, the judge rejected the defendant\u2019s request for a manslaughter instruction, stating that he did not think the evidence supported such an instruction. In making the request for the instruction, however, the defendant\u2019s counsel did not mention Leblanc\u2019s testimony about seeing a person jump on the defendant\u2019s back; counsel focused only on the defendant\u2019s alleged heat of passion caused by William Tighe\u2019s attack on the defendant\u2019s girl friend, Claudine Dyer. In his ruling on the defendant\u2019s posttrial motion, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>judge concluded that no manslaughter instruction was called for because the physical contact between the defendant and Sullivan as described by Leblanc was not sufficient to warrant an instruction, even if the contact had been initiated by Sullivan. We conclude that an instruction on voluntary manslaughter was not warranted but for different reasons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b895-11\">At trial, the defendant\u2019s theory of the case was that the defendant stabbed Tighe, but played no role in Gustave\u2019s attack on Stevens or Sullivan \u2014 that Gustave was acting entirely on his own.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Claudine Dyer testified that she saw the defendant and Gustave standing next to a person lying on the ground and repeatedly moving their hands downward toward the body \u2014 testimony that permits the inference that the defendant and Gustave were engaged in stabbing the person \u2014 but she did not identify the person as Sullivan. McCormack and Stevens both identified the defendant as the person they saw standing over and, inferably, stabbing Sullivan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Leblanc did not identify the male whom she saw lying on the street.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b896-9\">Leblanc\u2019s testimony on direct examination suggested that she saw someone jump on the defendant\u2019s back right before Gustave ran by her and urged her to run and she saw Michael McCormack running towards her. On cross-examination and redirect, Leblanc suggested that she witnessed the jumping incident after Gustave ran by and she saw McCormack. In any event, the reasonable inference is that Leblanc saw the person jump on the defendant\u2019s back right around the time that she began to run and saw McCormack on Warwick Street.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b897-7\">If the jury were to make such findings, they would be required to reject the testimony of Dyer and McCormack that there were two bodies lying on Warwick Street at the time McCormack ran onto the scene, and the testimony of McCormack and Stevens that one of those prone bodies belonged to Sullivan \u2014 because obviously, if Sullivan were then on the ground, he could not have been the person who jumped on the defendant\u2019s back.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b900-7\">The limiting instruction was actually more favorable to the defendant than the evidence dictated, in that there was no evidence before the jury that Gustave said he had a knife: Leblanc testified that she did not ask Gustave (and inferentially he did not state) whether he had a knife, but rather that she assumed he did. Accordingly, the jury, if they were following the judge\u2019s limiting instruction literally, could not have inferred from Leblanc\u2019s testimony that Gustave <em>stated </em>he had a knife, and therefore could not have inferred that the defendant had knowledge that Gustave was carrying a knife. We will assume, however, that the jury may have understood Leblanc as indicating that Gustave (inferentially) stated he had a knife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b901-8\">McCormack also testified that Sullivan and Stevens were lying on the ground one or two feet apart when McCormack first saw them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b902-7\">In connection with this charge relating to Stevens, the judge did not instruct the jury that the Commonwealth must prove the defendant knew that Gustave was armed with a knife. The instruction should have been given. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>460 Mass. 64, 69-70 (2011). There was no objection raised at trial, however, and the question therefore is whether the failure of the judge to give such an instruction created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bolling, </em>462 Mass. 440, 452 (2012). We agree with the Commonwealth that there was no such likelihood. There was strong circumstantial evidence that the defendant knew Gustave was armed with a knife at the time he stabbed Stevens, including the conversation between Leblanc and Gustave relating to Gustave\u2019s knife that the defendant could have overheard while they were all walking toward the fireworks; and evidence permitting the inference that the defendant saw Gustave holding a knife when they both confronted Tighe preceding Gustave\u2019s attack on Stevens. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kilburn, </em>426 Mass. 31, 35 &amp; n.7 (1997), <em>S.C., </em>438 Mass. 356 (2003) (knowledge that accomplice had weapon may be shown from circumstantial evidence).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
