Did the circuit court err in holding that the Board of Appeals improperly relied on \u201cunpublished\u201d criteria when reversing the decision of the Department of Permits and Development Management to issue the appellee a towing license?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">2. Even if the circuit court properly reversed the decision of the Board of Appeals, did the circuit court err in ordering that the appellee\u2019s towing license be reinstated instead of remanding the action to the Board of Appeals for further proceedings?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">As we reframe the critical issue before us, our focus will be on whether the County Board of Appeals had substantial evidence before it to support its ultimate conclusion that no adequate need had been shown for the towing license in issue. Although the Board\u2019s Opinion of December 31, 1998, at times reads like an appellate review of the earlier decision of the Department of Permits and Development Management to issue the license, the bottom line is that on November 5, 1998, the Board conducted an extensive <em>de novo </em>hearing \u201cregarding the approval of a towing license permit.\u201d As counsel for the appellants framed the issue before the Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">As aggrieved parties, <em>[we] would like to produce evidence and testimony to establish that the need criteria </em>which is probably the second most important issue in this case, <em>has not been met, and that on that basis the license should not be issued.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Five witnesses testified before the Board on the subject of need. Eugene Freeman, the Director of the Department, testified as to what the Department had relied upon to issue the license. The net effect of the language in the Board\u2019s Opinion criticizing the actions of the Department as \u201carbitrary\u201d was to establish the complete insubstantiality of any evidence of need:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>The basic problem area present in this case is not the reliance of the permits department in granting the license based on need expressed by the Maryland State Police, but that <em>the \u201cneed\u201d requirement has not substantive backup. </em>Had the Maryland State Police provided information documenting the need, the permits department was free to grant such a regular license with limitations, provided that criteria is known to the public and other towers relative to such specific criteria.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The Opinion of the Board then went on to recite the testimony of four other witnesses, each of whom testified that there was no need. Our inquiry will focus on whether the evidence before the Board gave it a substantial basis for concluding that there had not been an adequate showing of a need for the towing license.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Title 24, Article VI of the Baltimore County Code</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Title 24, Article VI of the Baltimore County Code generally explains the rights and sets forth the procedural requirements of businesses engaged in the practice of towing vehicles on Baltimore County roadways. Section 24-226(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-9\">It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in towing disabled vehicles from the scene of a motor vehicle accident occurring within the county without first having obtained a license from the department of permits and licenses to do so____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">The Department of Permits and Development Management (\u201cthe Department\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is vested with the authority either to approve or to deny applications for such towing licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">The Department\u2019s determination of whether to approve an application for a towing license is governed by section 24-229 of the County Code, which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>new licensed towers shall be approved </em>by the Department of Permits and Licenses <em>based upon the need for additional service. </em>If the need does not exist, the application will not be approved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">(Emphasis supplied). Once a license is obtained, a towing business is assigned a specific geographical area within the County in which it can operate and it is notified by the police whenever a disabled vehicle needs to be removed from an accident scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The Appellee\u2019s First Application for a Towing License</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">In February of 1994 the appellee, a private towing business located in Baltimore City and operating in the City and surrounding areas, applied for a license to tow disabled vehicles from accident scenes in the southwest portion of Baltimore County. On July 7, 1994, the Department denied the appellee\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The appellee appealed the denial of the towing permit to the Baltimore County Board of Appeals (\u201cthe Board\u201d). The sole issue before the Board was whether a new towing license should be issued to the appellee based on the need for such services under \u00a7 24-229 of the County Code. A hearing was held on the matter, and on December 14, 1995, the Board issued an Opinion in which it affirmed the decision of the Department to deny the appellee\u2019s request for a towing license, holding that \u201cthere is no demonstrated need for an additional licensed tower in the area.\u201d No further action was taken by the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">The Appellee\u2019s Second Application for a Towing License</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">On November 6, 1997, the appellee again sought a towing license by filing an application with the Department. In preparing its request, the appellee communicated directly with the Maryland State Police to determine whether a need existed for additional towing companies to operate in the Baltimore County area. On May 13, 1997, Lieutenant Commander Michael J. Fisher of the Golden Ring Barrack informed the appellee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>[T]his letter will serve as an official request for you to become a licensed tow service provider in Baltimore County, <em>Maryland.... I am requesting that the Baltimore County Department of Licenses and Permits issue you said permit as a need exists for your services by the Maryland State Police, </em>Golden Ring Barrack.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">The Office of the Attorney General has expressed in writing that the State Police need does not supercede the County\u2019s requirements to issue the aforementioned permit. This letter should serve as additional documentation for you to present to the Baltimore County Executive Office in your attempt to secure said license.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Some time after that letter was received by the appellee, Lieutenant Commander Fisher was replaced at the Golden Ring Barrack by Lieutenant Commander Michael E. Davey. Although initially disagreeing with Fisher\u2019s determination that a need existed for additional towing services, Davey ultimately changed his position and notified the appellee by a letter dated October 29, 1997, that a need, indeed, existed for his towing services. The letter was identical to the one sent to the appellee by Lieutenant Commander Fisher on May 13, 1997, with the sole exception of the signature of the commanding officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">On October 29, 1997, the appellee faxed a copy of Lieutenant Commander Davey\u2019s letter to Arnold Jablon, the Director of the Department, along with a request to \u201cplease call me and let me know what I need to do next.\u201d On November 3, 1997, the appellee received the following letter from Eugene Freeman, Chief of the Permits and Licenses Division of the Department:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\">The purpose of this letter is to inform you that Baltimore County will issue you a towing license. The license will be issued based upon a written expression of need by the Maryland State Police in a later dated October 29, 1997, from Lieutenant Michael E. Davey. The State Police request for your services within Baltimore County is deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>sufficient justification to satisfy the \u201cneed\u201d criteria established by ... Section 24-229 of the Baltimore County Code. However, please be advised that this license is being issued only to enable you to receive calls from the Maryland State Police relative to the Interstate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\">To initiate the issuance process, complete the enclosed towing license application and return it with the appropriate fee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In accordance with that letter, the appellee submitted his application for a towing license along with the required fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">In the meantime, the Baltimore County Police Department Towing Unit had conducted its own investigation into whether there was a \u201cneed\u201d for the appellee to be a licensed tow operator. The involvement of the County Police Department was appropriate because of the ongoing coordination between the County and State Police with respect to how the two departments were to handle enforcement of the laws on interstate highways in Baltimore County. Before a towing license may be issued, the County Police must conduct an inspection to determine whether there is an adequate \u201cstorage location\u201d and adequate \u201ctowing vehicles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">In a Memo to the Department dated February 12, 1998, the County Police Department set forth eight criteria which it used to determine whether a \u201cneed\u201d for the appellees services existed. Those criteria were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">1. The geographical location of the tower with respect to heavily traveled roadways;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">2. The number of accidents with disabled vehicles on these heavily traveled roadways in the applicant\u2019s area;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-10\">8. The proximity of other licensed towers, both in terms of miles and minutes between the applicant\u2019s location and the licensed towers\u2019 locations that are currently servicing the area;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>4. A history of the previous year; late response times, no response times, number of trucks and complaints of the current licensed towers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-4\">5. The growth potential for the particular geographical area in which the applicant is located;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">6. The average daily traffic count for the heavily traveled roadways in the applicant\u2019s area;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">7. Whether or not the application is for a location where a tow license had previously existed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">8. The quality of the operation of the applicant, including the number of trucks, the number of years experience in towing, and whether or not the tower is in a position to furnish specialized services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">The County Police Department in its Memo discussed in detail each of those eight factors, but it made no formal recommendation as to whether, in its opinion, a towing license should be issued to the appellee. On March 4, 1998, the Department approved the appellee\u2019s application, and it issued the appellee a towing license for State Police towing only.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">On April 1, 1998, the appellants, all of which operated towing businesses in the geographical area for which the appellee had been approved to operate his towing business for the State Police, appealed the Department\u2019s decision to issue the appellee a permit. On November 5, 1998, a hearing was held before the Board of Appeals. On December 31, 1998, a fifteen-page Opinion was issued by the Board in which it explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">The issue involved concerns the issuance of a towing permit to the Applicant, which the Appellants contend is in violation of statute since the Applicant did not satisfy the \u201cneed\u201d requirement of the law; and, in the alleged \u201cillegal\u201d issuance, the Appellants have been \u201caggrieved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">The Board, in its assessment of this case, clearly believes the permit department acted in an arbitrary manner in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>permitting the Maryland State Police to finally determine if a \u201cneed\u201d existed. This functions as a delegation of authority and confers upon a State agency an improper responsibility because the agency expresses a \u201cneed\u201d without any statistical data, background or substantive basis for ascertaining such \u201cneed.\u201d Such actions do substantial injustice to other towers who are required to justify such licenses in compliance with the previously required eight criteria; and creates doubt and suspicion as to other separate and distinct factors that may have been present in such consideration ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">At the conclusion of the Opinion, the Board then</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">ORDERED that the decision of the Department of Permits &amp; Licenses granting the Applicant\u2019s (Berman\u2019s Towing) request for a towing license be and the same is hereby REVERSED; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">ORDERED that the Applicant\u2019s (Berman\u2019s Towing) request for a towing license be and is hereby DENIED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The appellee thereafter sought judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Although the case was originally scheduled for a hearing, the parties later agreed to submit the case to the court without a hearing based on substantive memoranda filed by each party. On March 1, 2000, the circuit court issued the following Memorandum Opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">On judicial review this Court has reviewed the memoranda, exhibits and testimony and finds that the Department of Permits and Development Management properly issued a permit to the Petitioner to conduct the towing operations pursuant to the request of the Maryland State Police, and that <em>the decision of the County Board of Appeals of Baltimore County reversing the decision of the Department of Permits and Development Management and revoking the permit to the Petitioner was based on unpublished criteria.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">This Court finds that the County Board of Appeals relied upon matters and cases previously brought before it, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>considered these matters to be the equivalent of published criteria on which it could rely in arriving at its decision....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\"><em>ORDERED, that </em>the Order of December 31, 1998, of the County Board of Appeals is hereby reversed, and <em>this matter is remanded to the County Board of Appeals to reinstate the Petitioner\u2019s license </em>as established and granted by the Department of Permits and Development Management to tow disabled vehicles \u201cfor the State Police only.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">(Emphasis supplied). From that decision the appellants appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">When asked to consider the validity of the ruling of an administrative agency,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">a reviewing court, be it a circuit court or an appellate court, shall apply the substantial evidence test to the final decisions of an administrative agency, but it must not itself substitute its judgment for that of the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-10\"><em>Baltimore Lutheran High School v. Employment Security Admin., </em>302 Md. 649, 662, 490 A.2d 701 (1985). We are bound by the agency\u2019s findings of fact and may not substitute our judgment for that of the agency unless no \u201creasoning mind reasonably could have reach the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apartments, </em>283 Md. 505, 512, 390 A.2d 1119 (1978). We further view the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to the agency, \u201csince the decisions of administrative agencies are <em>prima facie </em>correct, and carry with them the presumption of validity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513, 390 A.2d 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">In <em>Eger v. Stone, </em>253 Md. 533, 542, 253 A.2d 372 (1969), the Court of Appeals further elaborated on the deference given to the decision of an administrative agency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-12\">We have made it quite clear that <em>if the issue before the administrative body is \u201cfairly debatable,\u201d that is, that its determination involved testimony from which a reasonable man could come to different conclusions, the courts will not </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>substitute their judgment for that of the administrative body </em>[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\">This rule will be adhered to even if we were of the opinion that the administrative body came to a conclusion we probably would not have reached on the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">(Internal citations omitted; emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">At the outset, let it be clear whose decision is being reviewed and by whom. The review on the ultimate merits is now being conducted by this Court. We are not reviewing the procedural correctness of the earlier review by the circuit court. We are undertaking our own <em>de novo </em>review of the decision of the administrative agency. As Judge Motz explained in <em>Department of Health and Mental Hygiene v. Shrieves, </em>100 Md.App. 283, 303-04, 641 A.2d 899 (1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiE\">Moreover, it is well recognized in Maryland that, <em>when reviewing administrative decisions, the role of an appellate court is precisely the same as that of the circuit court. See e.g., Baltimore Lutheran High Sch. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Employment Security Admin., </em>302 Md. 649, 662, 490 A.2d 701 (1985) (\u201ca reviewing court, be it a circuit court or an appellate court, shall apply the substantial evidence test\u201d). For those reasons, rather than remanding to the circuit court for it to determine, under the correct legal standards, whether the SOPD\u2019s decision is based on substantial evidence, we shall address the question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>Stover v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>132 Md.App. 373, 380-81, 752 A.2d 686 (2000). The decision of the circuit court, therefore, is before us only in a <em>pro forma </em>capacity, as the necessary procedural conduit by which the decision of the administrative agency gets to us for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">At the other end of the reviewing microscope, it is clear that the decision we are reviewing is not the November 3, 1997, decision of the Chief of the Permits and Licenses Division of the Department nor the March 4, 1998, decision of the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>ment. It is exclusively the December 31, 1998, decision of the Board. We are not reviewing the procedural propriety of how the Board handled an earlier determination further down the administrative chain. We are reviewing only its <em>de novo </em>decision on the ultimate merits of whether the towing license in issue should have been granted. Sect. 603 of the Baltimore County Charter provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\">All hearings held by the board shall be held <em>de novo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8\"><em>Boehm v. Anne Arundel County, </em>54 Md.App. 497, 511, 459 A.2d 590 (1983), elaborated on a <em>de novo </em>hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">A trial or hearing <em>\u2018de novo\u2019 </em>means trying the matter anew as if it had not been heard before and as if no decision had been previously rendered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">As such, unless otherwise limited by statute or court rule, a <em>de novo </em>hearing is an entirely new hearing at which time all aspects of the case should be heard anew as if no decision had bene previously rendered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">In <em>Lohrmann v. Arundel Corp., </em>65 Md.App. 309, 319, 500 A.2d 344 (1985), we further observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">In effect, then, in this case the Board was exercising what amount to original jurisdiction. It was as though the zoning officer had made no decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">See also <em>Hill v. Baltimore County, </em>86 Md.App. 642, 587 A.2d 1155 (1991) (the <em>\u201cde novo </em>hearing is for all intents and purposes the first hearing of the case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">As we, therefore, undertake our review of the decision of the Board, our focus is on whether there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s ultimate decision, not on whether the Board correctly reversed the earlier decision of the Department. In an analogous case where an administrative agency reversed an earlier decision by an Administrative Law Judge, the opinion of this Court in <em>Department of Health and Mental Hygiene v. Shrieves, </em>100 Md.App. 283, 301-02, 641 A.2d 899 (1994), was very clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>When reviewing an agency\u2019s decision overruling an ALJ\u2019s recommendation, <em>the question is not \u201cwhether the agency erred\u201d in overruling the ALJ but whether there is substantial evidence for the agency\u2019s decision. </em>... It is the agency\u2019s responsibility to make the final decision; in doing so, it certainly may \u201csubstitute\u201d its judgment for that of the ALJ. Moreover, the agency\u2019s substituted judgment must be affirmed by a <em>court\u2014if it </em>is based on substantial evidence.... [I]f there is \u201cevidence to support each of two conflicting views,\u201d <em>e.g., </em>the ALJ\u2019s <em>and </em>the agency\u2019s, the finding of the agency \u201cmust be allowed to stand despite the fact that [a court] might have reached the opposite conclusion on [its] own.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">To summarize, <em>when an administrative agency overrules the recommendation of an ALJ, a reviewing court\u2019s task is to determine if the agency\u2019s final order is based on substantial evidence in the record.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">(Citations omitted; emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">With respect to the substantial evidence test, <em>Stover v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>132 Md.App. 373, 381, 752 A.2d 686 (2000), explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">[T]o the extent the issues on appeal turn on the correctness of an agency\u2019s findings of fact, such findings must be reviewed under the \u201csubstantial evidence test.\u201d The reviewing court\u2019s task is to determine \u201cwhether there was substantial evidence before the administrative agency on the record as a whole to support its conclusions.\u201d The court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the agency, but instead must exercise a \u201crestrained and disciplined judicial judgment so as not to interfere with the agency\u2019s factual conclusions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">(Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">In this case, all that was required was that the Board be not persuaded that there was a need for additional towing services. To the extent its finding was weightier than that, the incremental weight was surplusage. Far less is required to support a merely negative instance of non-persuasion than is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>required to support an affirmative instance of actually being persuaded of something. In <em>Starke v. Starke, </em>134 Md.App. 663, 761 A.2d 355 (2000), we discussed that distinction between persuasion and non-persuasion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\"><em>[I]t is far easier to sustain as not clearly erroneous the decisional phenomenon of not being persuaded than it is to sustain the very different decisional phenomenon of being persuaded. </em>Actually, to be persuaded of something requires a requisite degree of certainty on the part of the fact finder (the use of a particular burden of persuasion) based on legally adequate evidentiary support (the satisfaction of a particular burden of production by the proponent). There are within reasonable frequency reversible errors in those regards. <em>Mere non-persuasions, on the other hand, requires nothing but a state of honest doubt. It is virtually, albeit perhaps not totally, impossible to find reversible error in that regard.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">In this case, the Board was not simply UNPERSUADED OF A NEED (a mere state of honest doubt is all that is required for non-persuasion). It was affirmatively PERSUADED OF NO NEED (more than it was required to find). There was, moreover, much evidentiary support for the Board\u2019s findings in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">At the November 5, 1998, hearing before the Board, there was significant testimony regarding the eight factors used by the County Police in addressing the \u201cneed\u201d criteria of County Code \u00a7 24-229. Eugene Freeman, Chief of the Permits and Licenses division of the Department, testified regarding the Memo prepared by the County Police with regard to the appellee\u2019s application for a towing license:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">Well, basically, what this report <em>states\u2014the police department normally covers eight general areas addressing the need criteria, </em>as they call it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">And if I may refer to some notes I made, those eight points are, number one, the Police Department normally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>comments on the geographical area, geographical location of the tower with respect to heavily traveled roadways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">The second point they normally cover is the number of accidents with disabled vehicles on heavily traveled roadways in the applicant\u2019s area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">Another point is the proximity of other licensed towers servicing the area adjacent to the applicant\u2019s location. They provide previous years\u2019 performance data from currently licensed towers in that geographical area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">There are comments regarding growth potential. They provide average daily traffic counts for heavily traveled roadways in the applicant\u2019s area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">There are comments as to whether or not the application is for a location where a towing license had previously existed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">And, finally, there are comments regarding the applicant\u2019s quality of operation, including the number of trucks, years of experience and capability to perform special licensed services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">\n<em>These are the eight points generally covered in the police report regarding all applicants for a tow license.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">Mr. Freeman also confirmed that, at the time the appellee applied for its first towing license in early 1994, those eight criteria were used:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-13\">The original application that was denied was for a regular Baltimore County towing license to satisfy the requirements of the Baltimore County Police to tow vehicles from accident scenes within Baltimore County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-14\"><em>At that time, we used </em>the data provided in the Baltimore County Police report, <em>the eight criteria that I mentioned earlier, addressing need.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-15\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-16\">Officer Frederick Daneker was assigned to the Traffic Management Unit of the Baltimore County Police Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>ment. At the hearing he testified as to the use of the eight criteria when determining need for additional towing services:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">Q: Do you have a procedure that you follow after you receive the application [for a towing license]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">A: I log it in a book I keep track of as they come in. From there, I set forth the criteria that ha[ve] been set prior to my being there, step by step.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">Q: I believe there\u2019s been testimony that there are eight particular criteria?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">A: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">Q: <em>Those eight entena have been in existence for quite some time?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">A: As <em>I understand it, yes sir.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-11\">Q: Dating back to as early as the seventies?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-12\">A: I don\u2019t know exactly how far back, but I know at least five years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-13\">Q: Based upon your being a member of the towing unit in Baltimore County, and you\u2019re testifying that there are eight criteria that apply, do you know how long th[ose] eight criteria ha[ve] been in existence? ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-14\">A: <em>My eleven years on the department, ... </em>since that time, six months for training, eleven years <em>the criteria ha[ve] been applied.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-15\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-16\">The testimony before the Board clearly established that the eight criteria had been consistently used for several years when determining whether, under County Code \u00a7 24-229, a need existed for towing services. Those criteria, although not formally published in any County manual or regulation, are common sense and logical factors to be considered when attempting to reach a conclusion as to whether a need for towing services exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>In addition to Officer Daneker, three other witnesses\u2014 licensed towers in the affected area of the County\u2014also testified as to the absence of any need for additional towers.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The Board of Appeals, in its December 31, 1998, Opinion considered the previous testimony when reaching its decision that the appellee had failed to show a \u201cneed\u201d for its towing services. In a thorough and articulate recitation of the factual evidence presented before it, the Board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">Mr. Freeman stated that the Police Department makes no recommendation as to \u201cneed,\u201d and recites only facts regarding their investigation of the applicant\u2019s operations. In assessing the need factor, Mr. Freeman referred to his notes. Factors that he considers in determining whether or not a license should be granted are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">\u2014 Geographic location of the tower, and the area of roadway system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">\u2014 Number of accidents on the roadway system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">\u2014 Proximity of other licensed towers in the area;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">\u2014 Previous year\u2019s statistical data form towers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">\u2014 Growth potential;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-11\">\u2014 Average daily traffic counts in the general area serviced by the tower;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-12\">\u2014 Location where licenses had previously existed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-13\">\u2014 The quality of the applicant\u2019s operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-14\">[Mr. Freeman] stated that prior requests for a towing license had been denied on a regular overview basis to Berman\u2019s, using the previously stated eight criteria.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-15\">[Officer Daneker] described his duties of securing a copy of the towing application filed by Berman\u2019s, following the eight criteria, and how his investigation is conducted. Es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>sentially, his findings reflected there was no need for a towing license at the time of his investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">In its analysis of whether there was adequate support for the Department\u2019s issuance of a towing license to the appellee, the Board explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">According to the testimony of Mr. Freeman, the report of the [County] Police authority was not considered in the decision making\u2014only and exclusively the \u201cneed\u201d expressed by the Maryland State Police was used in his \u201cneed\u201d evaluation and determination. This was a departure from the prior practice of the permits department in assessing \u201cneed.\u201d <em>Previously, eight criteria had been established in the determination by the department in establishing need. </em>[The Board then listed each of the eight criteria]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\"><em>This Board has, </em>on numerous occasions, <em>heard cases in which towing licenses had been denied based on the permits department consideration of the referenced criteria, </em>and failure of the respective tower\u2019s burden to satisfy the requirements as set forth above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">The permit department severely departed from prior practice relied upon by previous applicants in applying for a towing license. This Board on recent occasions (one of which involved Berman\u2019s towing) upheld the decision of the permits department in the denial of a new license due to the lack of \u201cneed\u201d based on the established criteria. <em>Based upon prior practices, these eight criteria have become established criteria in which the department has established the \u201cneed\u201d factor, and upon which the towing companies have relied in filing for a towing license.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">In the last analysis, all that was required of the Board was that it was not persuaded that a need existed for the additional towing license. That was the effect of its decision. We hold that the Board had a substantial basis for not issuing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>license. The circuit court, therefore, erroneously reversed the decision of the Board of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPETJ.EE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-12\">.
