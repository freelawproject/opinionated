After a hearing on appellant\u2019s request to modify the award, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission ruled that appellees were required to pay for her additional medical treatment but that her claim for disability was barred by limitations. This decision was affirmed by the Circuit Court for Howard County. We must decide in this appeal whether the circuit court erred in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">Appellant is employed by Giant Food as a cashier. On January 18, 1995, she filed an occupational disease claim with the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) after she developed carpal tunnel syndrome during the course of her employment. On May 22, 1996, the Commission issued an order, finding that appellant had sustained an occupational disease \u201carising out of and in the course of employment, and the first date of the disablement was July 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>1994.\u201d The Commission further found that appellant had \u201clost no compensable time\u201d and ordered appellees to \u201cpay medical bills of [appellant] in accordance with the Medical Fee Guide of this Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">When appellant\u2019s condition later worsened, she requested appellees to authorize carpal tunnel release surgery as recommended by her treating physician. After appellees denied this request, on January 21, 1999, appellant applied for a modification of the May 22,1996 compensability award by filing a form raising the issue of \u201cmedical treatment\u201d and stating her need for surgery. The request further noted that the five year statute of limitations was set to expire on June 30, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">A hearing was held on July 19, 1999. At the hearing, appellant requested authorization for surgery and, for the first time, temporary total disability benefits. By order dated August 4, 1999, the Commission ruled that limitations \u201cbarred [appellant\u2019s claim] as to compensation but not as to medical treatment\u201d and ordered appellees to authorize appellant\u2019s carpal tunnel surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Appellant filed a petition for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s determination that limitations barred her request for temporary total disability to the circuit court. After a hearing on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the court granted appellees\u2019 motion and affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">On appeal, appellant contends that the Commission and the circuit court erred in ruling that her claim for compensation was barred by limitations. She argues that the five year limitations period imposed by Md.Code (1991, 1999 RepLVoL), \u00a7 9-736(b)(3) of the Labor and Employment Article (\u201cLE\u201d) should not apply because \u201cno prior award of compensation has been paid\u201d to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">When interpreting a statute, our goal is to ascertain and carry out the true intention of the legislature. <em>See Hyle </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>348 Md. 143, 148, 702 A.2d 760 (1997). In determining legislative intention, we look to the general purpose, aim, or policy behind the statute. <em>See Condon v. Univ. of Maryland, </em>332 Md. 481, 491, 632 A.2d 753 (1993). The primary source from which to determine this intent is the language of the statute itself. <em>See Gordon Family P\u2019ship v. Gar on Jer, </em>348 Md. 129, 137, 702 A.2d 753 (1997). On the other hand, \u201c[wjhile the language of the statute is the primary source for determining legislative intention, the plain meaning rule of construction is not absolute; rather the statute must be construed reasonably with reference to the purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body.\u201d <em>Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 387, 614 A.2d 590 (1992). \u201cFurthermore, when interpreting the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, if there is any ambiguity in the statute\u2019s language we generally construe the Act \u2018as liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vest v. Giant Food Stores, Inc., </em>329 Md. 461, 467, 620 A.2d 340 (1993) (quoting <em>Howard County Ass\u2019n for Retarded Citizens v. Walls, </em>288 Md. 526, 530, 418 A.2d 1210 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">LE section 9-736 governs readjustments and modifications of workers\u2019 compensation awards. Subsection (b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4Z\">(b) <em>Continuing powers and jurisdiction; </em>modification.\u2014(1) the Commission has continuing powers and jurisdiction over each claim under this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">(2) Subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, the Commission may modify any finding or order as the Commission considers justified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">(3) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the Commission may not modify an award unless the modification is applied for within 5 years after the last compensation payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act defines \u201ccompensation\u201d as \u201cthe money payable under this title to a covered employee or the dependants of a covered employee.\u201d LE \u00a7 9-101(e)(l). This definition is broad and encompasses many forms of payment, although it excludes the payment of medical ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>penses. <em>See Holy Cross Hosp. v. Nichols, </em>290 Md. 149, 161\u201463, 428 A.2d 447 (1981). In <em>Holy Cross Hosp., </em>the Court of Appeals traced the legislative history of the limitations period in the modification statute. In tracing the history of Md.Code (1957,1979 Repl.Vol., 1980 Cum.Supp.), Art. 101, section 40(c), the predecessor to LE section 9-736, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtkW\">The time within which an award could be reopened was unlimited under the original Act. Acts of 1914, Chapter 800, \u00a7\u00a7 39, 42 and 53; <em>Ireland v. Shipley, </em>165 Md. 90, 100-101, 166 A. 593 (1933). Chapter 342 of the Acts of 1931 established the first time limit on reopening. Md.Code (1924), Art. 101, \u00a7 54 was amended to provide that no modification <em>\u2018of </em>any final award of compensation\u2019 was to be made unless applied for within one year \u2018following the final award of compensation.\u2019 Chapter 236 of the Acts of 1935 increased the period to three years \u2018following the last final award of compensation\u2019 where the award had been designated as final, and further provided that, where the award was not so designated, \u2018no additional award ... of compensation\u2019 was to be made unless applied for within three years \u2018following the last payment of compensation under such award or awards not designated by the Commission as final.\u2019 This reopening section was restructured by Chapter 814 of the Acts of 1957 to its present form, as found in \u00a7 40(c), under which application for modification of \u2018any award of compensation\u2019 must be made within a period of time \u2018next following the last payment of compensation.\u2019 In the 1957 enactment the time period remained three years. It was increased to five years by Chapter 116 of the Acts of 1969.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 154, 428 A.2d 447. In 1991, Article 101, section 40(b) through (d) was recodified as LE section 9-736 \u201cwithout substantive change____\u201d <em>See </em>Md.Code (1991), \u00a7 9-736 of the Labor and Employment Article. The statutory language has not changed since the recodification. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 9-736.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The limitations period in LE section 9-736(b)(3) is clear and unambiguous\u2014a modification award must be made within five years of the last payment. We have previously recognized that this limitations provision must be strictly construed. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>Seal v. Giant Food, Inc., </em>116 Md.App. 87, 96, 695 A.2d 597 (1997). Indeed, both the Court of Appeals and this Court have refused to allow certain payments to be considered \u201ccompensation\u201d for the purpose of extending the limitations period. <em>See, e.g., Stevens v. Rite-Aid Corp., </em>340 Md. 555, 567, 667 A.2d 642 (1995) (holding that receipt of sanctions was not \u201ccompensation\u201d under LE section 9-736 that would extend the limitations period); <em>Holy Cross Hosp., </em>290 Md. at 163, 428 A.2d 447 (holding that injured worker\u2019s claim for modification was barred by limitations when the worker\u2019s petition was filed more than five years after the worker\u2019s last compensation payment was received but less than five years after the worker received payments for medical expenses); <em>Seal, </em>116 Md.App. at 94, 695 A.2d 597 (holding that limitations period begins to run on the date final payment of compensation is actually received rather than the date such payment is actually due).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">In the instant case, appellant has never received compensation payments. Under the original compensation award, appellant only received payment for medical bills. Therefore, under the plain language of LE section 9-736, the limitations has not expired because appellant has never received any compensation payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Despite the plain language of LE section 9-736 that limitations does not begin to run until a final payment of compensation is made, appellees contend that limitations should apply in this case. They argue that requiring payment of compensation to be made before limitations begin to run would frustrate the overall purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act because \u201can important purpose for a period of limitations is to insure that an employer and insurer are able to calculate future exposure and risk in a case.\u201d In their brief, appellees appear to suggest that in cases where no compensation is awarded, limitations should begin on either the alleged date of disablement or the date of the original award.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Admittedly, appellees\u2019 concerns are legitimate. As recognized by Professor Larson in his treatise on Workers\u2019 Compensation Law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Under the typical award in the form of periodic payments during a specified maximum period or during disability, the objectives of the legislation are best accomplished if the commission can increase, decrease, revive, or terminate payments to correspond to a claimant\u2019s changed condition. Theoretically, then, commissions ought to exercise perpetual and unlimited jurisdiction to reopen cases as often as necessary to make benefits meet current conditions. But the administrative and practical difficulties of such a course have led to severe limitations on the power to reopen and alter awards____[One difficulty] is that insurance carriers would never know what kind of future liabilities they might incur, and would have difficulty in computing appropriate reserves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">8 A. Larson &amp; L.K. Larson, <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 81.10, at 1045 (1999) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">States that have imposed limitations on the reopening or modification of workers\u2019 compensation claims have done so in a variety of ways. <em>See </em>Larson, \u00a7 81.21, at 1047-48. For example, California requires the modification request to be filed within five years of the date of injury. <em>See </em>Cal. Labor Code \u00a7 5410 (2001). On the other hand, Illinois requires filing within a certain time period after the award is made by the commission. <em>See </em>820 Ill.Comp.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 805/19 (2000). Connecticut provides yet another limitations period\u2014that \u201cthe compensation commissioner shall retain jurisdiction ... during the whole compensation period applicable to the injury in question.\u201d Conn.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 31-315 (1999). Other jurisdictions follow a similar rule to the Maryland Rule and require a modification to be filed within a certain time period after the last payment is received. <em>See </em>Ind.Code \u00a7 22-3-3-27 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The General Assembly could have chosen another means to calculate limitations. Indeed, if LE section 9-736 provided that limitations should run from the date of injury or the date of the original award, appellant\u2019s claim would be time barred. Nevertheless, as recognized in <em>Holy Cross Hosp., </em>the Work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>ers\u2019 Compensation Act provides that modification is permitted for a certain time period after the final award of compensation. This requirement has been present in the modification statute since 1931. In its current form, the statute does not provide for any exception if an injured worker does not receive \u201ccompensation\u201d as part of a workers\u2019 compensation claim. Although an exception under the circumstances presented in the instant case may provide predictability to appellees, it is not the role of a court to read exceptions into a statute where none exist. \u201cWe remain loyal to the well established principle \u2018that where the legislature has not expressly provided for an exception in a statute of limitations, the court will not allow any implied or equitable exception to be engrafted upon it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Garay v. Overholtzer, </em>332 Md. 339, 359, 631 A.2d 429 (1993) (quoting <em>Booth Glass Co. v. Huntingfield Corp., </em>304 Md. 615, 623, 500 A.2d 641 (1985)). For this reason, we hold that the limitations period provided for in LE section 9\u2014736(b)(3) does not bar appellant\u2019s claim for compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.
