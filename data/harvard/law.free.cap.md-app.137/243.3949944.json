It underscores the importance that a thorough, unbiased investigation can play in protecting both children and parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">The Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cMCHHS\u201d), appellant, asks us to overturn an order reversing its finding that P.F., appellee (\u201cMr.F.\u201d), sexually abused his child. The order also prevented MCHHS from entering Mr. F.\u2019s name into a central registry reporting child abuse cases in which MCHHS has made a finding that abuse was either \u201cindicated\u201d or \u201cunsubstantiated,\u201d and required MCHHS to expunge from its records any references to Mr. F. as a suspected abuser. An administrative law judge issued the order after finding that \u201cthere is no credible evidence that an incident of sexual abuse occurred.... \u201d The circuit court agreed, and affirmed the administrative order.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>In this appeal, MCHHS argues that the administrative law judge and the circuit court erred by failing to treat the expert testimony of its social worker and the out of court statements of the child as credible evidence that Mr. F. abused his daughter. We shall affirm the judgment, because (1) the social worker\u2019s opinion that the child had been molested merely vouched for the child\u2019s credibility, and (2) the administrative law judge\u2019s threshold determination that the child\u2019s hearsay statement was not reliable enough to constitute credible evidence of abuse was supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">On August 4, 1998, MCHHS received a confidential report concerning the possible sexual abuse of a three year old child whom we shall refer to as \u201cSusan.\u201d Susan\u2019s parents, Mr. F. and E.F. (\u201cMs.F.\u201d), are divorced. The reporter was Mr. F.\u2019s therapist. She alleged that after Mr. F. spent a recent day \u25a0with Susan, he became concerned that someone, such as a babysitter, may have molested her. According to notes in MCHHS\u2019s file, the therapist said that Mr. F. told her that his fears arose when he went to change Susan\u2019s diaper, and she asked him if he was going to \u201ctickle her pee-pee.\u201d He was worried why a young child would ask such a question. The therapist told Mr. F. that she felt legally obligated to report his concerns, and advised him to inform Ms. F. Mr. F. said that when he told his ex-wife that his therapist was making a report, she became angry and told him that he had just lost his visitation privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\n<em>Police And MCHHS Investigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">One of MCHHS\u2019s social workers, Ann Marie Gumula, began her investigation by telephoning both Mr. F. and Ms. F, and then meeting with both parents and the child. Gumula and a police detective, Ralph Penn, Jr., interviewed first Ms. F. and Susan, and later Mr. F. This turned out to be the investigators\u2019 only contact with Susan.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Penn and Gumula prepared separate case reports. Penn\u2019s report, dated August 21, 1998, both opened and closed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>police department\u2019s investigation. Penn first summarized the therapist\u2019s report, which was related to him by MCHHS. Mr. F. reported to his therapist that his ex-wife told him that Susan had said that Mr. F. had hurt her \u201cpee pee\u201d with his finger. According to the report, Mr. F. also told the therapist that \u201cwhile changing [Susan\u2019s] diaper she asked him if he was going to tickle her pee-pee. Mr. [F.] told his daughter that daddies don\u2019t tickle their daughter\u2019s pee-pee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Penn\u2019s report then summarized the interviews with Ms. F., Susan, and Mr. F. According to Penn, Ms. F. reported that she had heard Susan complain about her father hurting her on two occasions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">On 08-05-98, the writer along with Ann GUMULA met with [Ms. F.] and her daughter [Susan] ... Mrs. [F.] stated that Mr. [F.] had called her the day before to tell her that he had talked to his psychiatrist about their daughter\u2019s request that he tickle her pee-pee. Mrs. [F.] stated that she now remembers her daughter saying something to her the evening of her trip to the aquarium about her father hurting her. She said that she could not recall if her daughter said that he hurt her from wiping her or with his finger. She also said that her ex-husband has never been able to wipe [Susan] adequately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">Mrs. [F.] stated that the following Friday when her ex-husband came to visit, [Susan] told him either my pee-pee hurt or you hurt my pee-pee. Mrs. [F.] also said that she has never heard her daughter say to her father \u201care you going to tickle my pee-pee?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Penn then summarized the interview with three and a half year old Susan.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">[Susan] ... was able to identify a chart of animals, and was able to correct the writer when the animals were misidentified.... When asked to identify a body part\u2019s chart [Susan] was able to correctly identify. She referred to the vaginal area of her body as her \u201cpee-pee\u201d....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-9\">When asked if her mother has talked to her about people not touching her, [Susan] said \u201cyes\u201d. When asked if any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>body touched her that she didn\u2019t like, she said \u201cno\u201d. When asked if people wiped her in the bathroom, [Susan] said, \u201cNo I wear pants.\u201d And when asked if anyone had hurt her pee-pee, the girl answered Mom. When asked where, she said at home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\">[Susan] was asked if anyone had tickled her pee-pee, she answered \u201cno\u201d. And when asked if her Daddy tickled her pee-pee, the girl said, \u201cNo, he put his finger inside my pee-pee.\u201d The girl said that it happened at Uncle McDonald\u2019s, which is what she calls McDonald\u2019s restaurant. She stated that her father was carrying her in his arms, outside of the McDonald\u2019s going in. When asked if it hurt, the girl replied that it did. And when asked if her father had stuck his finger under her pants the girl again said, \u201cyes\u201d, and when asked if her father put his finger inside her pee-pee she again said, \u201cyes, inside\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">The girl was again asked by her interviewers to tell them one more time, \u201cWhat did daddy do?\u201d. She said, \u201cHe put his finger inside my pee-pee.\u201d When asked where, she said \u201cat Uncle McDonald\u2019s\u201d. When asked, in the bathroom? She said, \u201cNo, I told you he was carrying me\u2014outside\u201d. She was asked if she went to the bathroom at Uncle McDonald\u2019s, she said, \u2018Tes\u201d. And when asked if her daddy had wiped her, her response was \u201cyes\u201d. The girl was then asked if this was when he put his finger inside her pee-pee. Her answer was, \u201cNo. It was outside Uncle McDonald\u2019s\u2014I told you\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Penn also summarized the meeting he and Gumula had with Mr. F. three days later.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">Mr. [F.] adamantly denied ever touching his daughter other than to wipe her after she used the bathroom. He described to the writer what he had done with his daughter on the day he took her to the Baltimore Aquarium. Mr. [F.] stated that he picked his daughter up from her mother\u2019s home on Friday, June [sic] 24th and they drove to the McDonald\u2019s drive-thru.... From there they went to a park.... He said while at the park his daughter informed him that she had to \u201cpee\u201d, so he let her squat in the grass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Mr. [F.] stated that after doing so he wiped his daughter with napkins he had gotten from McDonalds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">After leaving the park, Mr. [F.] said that he and his daughter drove to the Baltimore Aquarium. He said at some point his daughter had to \u201cpee,\u201d and he took the girl to the men\u2019s room. He said that he asked his daughter if he [sic] wanted him to wipe her and she said, \u201cyes\u201d. Mr. [F.] stated that sometime that morning his daughter asked him, \u201cWill you tickle my pee-pee?\u201d Mr. [F.] said that he told his daughter that daddy\u2019s don\u2019t do that. Mr. [F.] stated that the following Monday he went to his therapist, because he sought guidance on how to deal with his daughter\u2019s statement. He said that he would not have talked to his therapist about this if he had known that she had an obligation to report it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">Mr. [F.] stated that he knows that he <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has anger issues, but he\u2019s not going to buy into being set up for hurting his daughter sexually. He said that he was not going to admit complicity or guilt in doing anything to his daughter....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4-\">Penn noted that on August 20, 1998, he \u201creviewed this case with the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, who elected not to proceed, thus closing the case by exception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Ms. Gumula made a series of notes and summary reports during the course of her investigation for MCHHS. She made both handwritten and typewritten notes dated 8/5/98 from her meeting with Susan. The complete text of her typewritten note is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">Went through charts of animals and she correctly identified them. Corrected me when I misidentified them. Would not change her identifications (which were right.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">Wanted her mother\u2014told her mother in bathroom\u2014said she\u2019d be in when she came back. She didn\u2019t want to do the charts any more but did a second. Fish\u2014said saw in Aquarium. Who took her? Dad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Went into body parts chart. Identified correctly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\">Her front part is peepee and back is bottom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">Asked if mother talked about people not touching. Yes. Has anybody touched you that you didn\u2019t like? No. People wipe you in bathroom? No, I wear pants. Has anyone hurt peepee? Mom. Where? at home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">Has anybody tickled peepee? No. Did daddy tickle your peepee? No, he put his finger inside my pee pee. Where? At Uncle McDonald\u2019s. Inside Uncle McD\u2019s? No. He was carrying me in his arms\u2014outside Uncle McDonald\u2019s going in. Did it hurt? Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">Was finger under your pants? Yes. Did he put his finger inside your peepee? Yes\u2014Inside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">Tell us one more time. What did daddy do? He put his finger inside my pee pee. Where? At uncle McD\u2019. In the bathroom? No, I told you he was carrying me\u2014outside. Did you go the bathroom at U.M? Yes. Did daddy wipe you? Yes. Is this when he put his finger inside your pee pee? No. It was outside Uncle McD\u2019s\u2014I told you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">In a separate summary of her investigation, Gumula elaborated on why she found Susan\u2019s statements to be credible.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">[Susan] was asked various open-ended questions in an attempt to find out if she had been touched where she should not have been touched.... Sometimes very young children do not understand questions in the way they are intended. Their thinking can be very concrete and they do not have all of the definitions and connotations of words that adults have. It can be very hard to hit on the exact phrasing that children so young can understand. Sometimes very young children have to be asked a direct question when open-ended questions do not elicit information. This was the case with [Susan]. She denied that anyone ever hurt her pee pee except her mother, at home. She denied that anyone had ever tickled her pee pee. When asked directly if daddy had ever tickled her pee pee she replied \u201cNo, he put his finger inside my pee pee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>This statement was a complete surprise. Children do not know about vaginal penetration with fingers or other objects unless they have had some exposure to this occurrence---[Susan] was definite that her father did this to her, and she said it happened when he was carrying her into MacDonalds [sic] the day they went to the Aquarium. She denied that it happened in the bathroom when this suggestion was made, and she maintained that he put his finger inside her vagina when asked several different ways. She became impatient with investigators\u2019 efforts to define the action in a different way and as taking place at a different time. She was consistent in her disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Gumula\u2019s handwritten notes from the investigation reflect that she had several conversations with both Ms. F. and Mr. F. Gumula noted that in her first conversation with Ms. F., the mother alleged that Mr. F. was an alcoholic, a drug addict, and a pornography addict, and that he was \u201cnot employable.\u201d The notes do not reflect that Gumula reported these allegations to Mr. F. during her conversations with him, and they do not reflect any specific responses to these charges by Mr. F.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Ultimately, Gumula did record her credibility assessments of both Mr. F. and Ms. F. She concluded that Ms. F. was credible and that Mr. F. lied. She based her conclusions on statements made by both Ms. F. and Mr. F. But she ignored discrepancies in Ms. F.\u2019s statements about matters she considered critical to her credibility determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The most significant discrepancy related to whether, just before Penn and Gumula interviewed the child, Ms. F. informed them that Susan had said something about her father hurting her pee pee with his finger. Penn\u2019s report says that \u201c[Ms. F.] stated that she now remembers her daughter saying something to her the evening of her trip to the aquarium about her father hurting her,\u201d either \u201cfrom wiping her or with his finger.\u201d It also states that \u201cMrs. [F] stated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>following Friday when her ex-husband came to visit, [Susan] told him either my pee-pee hurt, or you hurt my pee-pee.\u201d Gumula\u2019s handwritten notes from the same interview state that Ms. F. told them Susan had mentioned something about her father hurting her: \u201cCan\u2019t rememb[er] her exact words\u2014 [said] dadd[y] hurt her\u2014can\u2019t rememb[er]\u2014nothing in it to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">In contrast, Gumula\u2019s typed reports of her investigation do not mention these statements by Ms. F. To the contrary, Gumula reported that Ms. F. denied that Susan ever said anything about her father hurting her: \u201cMrs. [F.] said [Susan] never mentioned anything about anyone tickling her vagina and never said anything about her father hurting her with his finger. She said if [Susan] had said anything like that, she would have made a report herself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Ultimately, Gumula ignored this discrepancy in reaching her conclusion that Ms. F.\u2019s denial was credible.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although Penn\u2019s report and Gumula\u2019s handwritten notes both reflected that Ms. F. said she heard Susan say something about Mr. F. hurting her pee pee, and acknowledged that both investigators knew about this allegation before they interviewed Susan, Gumula did not mention this evidence in her reports. Instead, the social worker reported only Ms. F.\u2019s denial that Susan had ever said anything about her father hurting her. Gumula then concluded that Ms. F.\u2019s denial was credible, and that Mr. F. lied when he alleged that his ex-wife responded to his concerns about why Susan was talking about \u201ctickling her pee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>pee\u201d with an allegation that Susan had told her that he hurt her pee pee with his finger.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">[Mr. F.] said ... Mrs. [F.] had told him [Susan] said that he hurt her pee pee with his finger. (This is something Mrs. [F.] adamantly denied.) He said Mrs. [F.\u2019s] statement worried him and he called her again to talk more about it with her. <em>(This is a further elaboration on what appears to be a lie. </em>Mrs. [F.\u2019s] distrust of him because of his past behavior was evident, and her statement that she would have made a report if [Susan] had ever said anything like this to her was credible.) [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Gumula\u2019s two reports reflect that she based her finding that the abuse was \u201cindicated\u201d on her credibility assessments of the child, the mother, and the father. Despite Ms. F.\u2019s inconsistent statements, Gumula chose to believe her rather than Mr. F.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">[Mr. F.] lied when he said Mrs. [F.] told him [Susan] said he had hurt her pee pee with his finger, and that they had discussed the issue before this report was made. Mr. [F.] began to blame Mrs. [F.] for making allegations and for setting him up, even though this was clearly not so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">It is this worker\u2019s opinion that Mr. [F.] did insert his finger into [Susan\u2019s] vagina. It is this worker\u2019s opinion that Mr. [F.] was bothered by this, either because he did it or because he thought he was going to get caught, and he brought it up to [his therapist] to establish that perhaps someone else was abusing [Susan], saying she asked him if he were going to tickle her pee pee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">In her final \u201cSummary for Risk Assessment,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Gumula confirmed that her finding of indicated abuse was based on her credibility conclusions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Mrs. [F.] said [Susan] never told her that her father hurt her pee pee with his finger because she would have reported that herself. So this statement was ... not true. She has not trusted Mr. [F.] for a long time. Mr. [F.] is the only-one saying anything about hurting [Susan\u2019s] pee pee with his finger, that is until [Susan] told investigators that he stuck his finger into her pee pee and it hurt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">It is the opinion of this investigator that Mr. [F.] did indeed stick his finger into [Susan\u2019s]\u2019s vagina as she told investigators in no uncertain terms several times. It is the opinion of this investigator that Mr. [F.] was anxious about what he had done and was afraid of being caught so he brought up the issue of sexual abuse of [Susan] in a way that suggested that perhaps someone else had done something to her but that he had not. He even told this investigator that Mrs. [FJ had told him [Susan] told her that he had hurt her pee pee with his finger (which is what happened) when Mrs. [F.] had never heard that from [Susan]. <em>Mrs. [F.J never heard that until investigators told her after the interview with [Susan] what she had said. </em>In trying to cover up what he had done and in trying to establish the possibility of someone else\u2019s having abused [Susan], Mr. [F.] gave himself away. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">On August 20,1998, MCHHS advised Ms. F. in writing that \u201c[t]he information obtained during the investigation supports the conclusion that [Susan] was sexually abused by her father. The finding will go on file as \u2018indicated\u2019.\u201d Because MCHHS believed that Ms. F. was \u201cin a position to protect [Susan] from further abuse,\u201d and had taken legal steps to do so, the agency closed its case. On September 3, 1998, MCHHS notified Mr. F. that it intended to include his name in its central registry listing cases of indicated or unsubstantiated charges of child abuse or neglect. Denying the charge, Mr. F. requested a contested hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Administrative Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Mr. F. represented himself at the contested case hearing before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). The only two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>witnesses were Mr. F. and MCHHS\u2019s social worker, Ms. Gumula. Neither Susan, the therapist, Ms. F., nor Det. Penn testified. Penn\u2019s report and all notes, reports, summaries, and correspondence in MCHHS\u2019s case file were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The ALJ accepted Gumula as an expert witness in the area of child abuse and neglect investigation. Gumula testified that when she and Penn interviewed Ms. F., \u201cshe told us that when ... her ex-husband called her [to advise her that about the investigation], she understood him to say that he had touched [Susan] on her pee-pee and hurt her.\u201d Gumula also testified that Ms. F. \u201csaid that [Susan] never said anything to her about anybody tickling her vagina and .... about her father hurting her vagina ... with his finger.\u201d According to Gumula, Ms. F. \u201cflat out denied that\u201d Susan had said any such thing, or that she had discussed the matter with Mr. F.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">MCHHS\u2019s counsel then asked Gumula for her opinion, \u201c[b]ased upon your experience and your expertise in the area of child sex abuse investigation,\u201d and on her investigation of the case. Gumula testified that \u201c[m]y opinion was that [Susan] was credible when she said that her father stuck his finger in her pee-pee.\u201d She testified that she based her opinion on the fact that \u201c[t]his was a very unusual statement for a three year old child to offer,\u201d and that [Susan] was mature enough to resist efforts to have her say that the event happened in the bathroom. MCHHS\u2019s counsel then asked Gumula to reiterate and summarize her conclusions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">[MCHHS counsel]: [J]ust to reiterate, you found the evidence credible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">A: Yes....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">Q: [W]hat factors did you consider in making the finding of indicated child sexual abuse by Mr. [F.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">A: Well, number one that [Susan] is a child and that Mr. [F.] is her father. That sticking up there is no reason, unless you\u2019re a doctor doing an internal examination to stick your finger in a child\u2019s vagina. Other people do that for\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>for sexual gratification. And I think Mr. [F.\u2019s] own behavior was a strong impetus to make that finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">Q: Was it an impetus in your investigation as well as the finding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">A: ... [0]nce [Susan] told us that he stuck his finger in her vagina and once Mr. [F.] started to give us\u2014to turn a completely different slant on the whole investigation then we had originally gotten it, then we really began to suspect that Mr. [F.] had done that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\"><em>The facts that Mr. [F.] had talked about as being factual were not. I mean they were contrary to what we had been told </em>and to what we had said we had been told and Mr. [F.] insisted that this was his ex-wife setting him up, that he was set up to be blamed for this and no matter what we said we couldn\u2019t tell him differently and he\u2019s focused on that. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">On cross-examination by Mr. F., Gumula admitted that the investigators did not visit the McDonald\u2019s where the incident was alleged to have occurred. She also confirmed that the physical examination of Susan revealed \u201cno physical findings of anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">Mr. F. also questioned Gumula about why she found Ms. F. to be credible without inquiring into her personal history (which Mr. F. suggested included two prior, physically abusive ex-husbands, long term mental illness requiring hospitalization and treatment for depression, and a suicide attempt). He also asked why she recorded Ms. F.\u2019s accusations that Mr. F. was an alcoholic, drug addict, pornography addict, and unemployable, but did not advise Mr. F. about these accusations when she interviewed him. Gumula denied that Ms. F.\u2019s statements or accusations about Mr. F. had any bearing on her investigation or on her conclusion that the abuse occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">Mr. F. then addressed Gumula\u2019s reliance on Ms. F.\u2019s denial that she had ever raised the possibility that Mr. F. hurt Susan at any time before the August 5th interview with Penn and Gumula.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>[Mr. F.]:....

Several times that Monday I called [Ms. F.]. My calls were not returned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\">When I finally got a hold of her on the Tuesday her response had nothing to do with [Susan\u2019s] well being.

I picked her up to cross the street. I took her in and we played. I believe very strongly that [Ms. F.\u2019s] control issues which express themselves through continued interference with my relationship with my daughter are sufficiently intense as to give her the ability to plant the idea in the child\u2019s mind that whatever discomfort that was, was a result of my having touched her inappropriately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">I did not touch her inappropriately.... I have maintained and will forever maintain that I believe very strongly that the result of this investigation is a product of Mrs. [F.\u2019s] manipulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">In closing, MCHHS argued briefly that its \u201cindicated\u201d finding was appropriate because \u201c[t]here is credible account by a child ... that she was violated by her father that sexual abuse did occur that he poked his finger up her vaginal area.\u201d Mr. F. argued that Gumula\u2019s investigation was incomplete and compromised by her inappropriate reliance on Mrs. F.\u2019s inconsistent statements, that Gumula had undermined her credibility by denying that Mrs. F. had influenced her conclusions, and that the case boiled down to whether Susan\u2019s reported statement was a sufficient basis for a finding that the abuse occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">The ALJ issued a written memorandum and order on November 5, 1999. She concluded that MCHHS\u2019s finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>indicated child sexual abuse was not supported by any credible evidence. Disregarding Gumula\u2019s opinion that the abuse occurred, the ALJ found that \u201c[t]he sole basis for [MCHHS\u2019s finding of indicated abuse] was an account given by the Child, which [MCHHS] found to be credible\u201d because \u201cit was \u2018clear and consistently maintained.\u2019 \u201d She disagreed with MCHHS\u2019s assessment of the child\u2019s account, finding that the following factors \u201crender it unreliable\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\">\u2022 <em>\u201cContradictory </em>Statements\u201d\u2014The ALJ noted that the child gave contradictory statements when she was asked if \u201cpeople\u201d wiped her in the bathroom (\u201cNo, I wear pants\u201d) and later, when she was asked if her father wiped her in the bathroom at McDonald\u2019s. (\u201cYes.\u201d) Because \u201c[t]he interviewers did not ask any further questions to resolve these contradictory statements, .... the only explanation for the contradiction is that one of the Child\u2019s two statements on this point was not true.\u201d The ALJ concluded that because \u201c[t]he Child did not tell the truth during the interview[,][h]er account of [Mr. F.\u2019s] actions is thus rendered unreliable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">\u2022 <em>\u201cImplausibility Of The Child\u2019s </em>Account\u201d\u2014The ALJ cited three reasons that the child\u2019s statement that Mr. F. put his finger inside her vagina while he was carrying her into McDonald\u2019s was \u201cimplausible\u201d:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">First, the location lacks privacy. [They] were likely to be surrounded by other people at the time the abuse was said to have occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">Second, the Child was three years old. To carry a three year old while walking, an adult must usually use both arms to support the weight of the child. It is questionable whether any adult would have the physical ability to place his or her finger in a child\u2019s vagina while carrying her and walking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">Third ... the Child\u2019s clothing would likely have blocked [Mr. F.\u2019s] finger. If the Child had been wearing long pants or even shorts, these articles of clothing would have prevented [Mr. F.] from reaching his finger into the Child\u2019s vagina in the short period of time described. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The ALJ pointed out that Penn and Gumula also \u201chad questions about the plausibility of the Child\u2019s account,\u201d as evidenced by their follow up questions regarding whether the incident occurred in the bathroom. She criticized them for failing to ask follow-up questions designed to assist in evaluating the plausibility of Susan\u2019s statement. [They] failed to ask the Child to explain how [Mr. F.] had carried her, or to demonstrate the location of [Mr. F.\u2019s] hands. The interviewers also failed to ask the Child what she was wearing, whether it was a dress, or shorts, or long pants. Since these questions were not asked and answered, the Child\u2019s account must be evaluated on its own. The Child\u2019s account is essentially implausible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-4\">\u2022 <em>\u201cInconsistency in Credibility </em>Determination\u201d\u2014The ALJ noted that MCHHS had ignored Susan\u2019s statement that her mother had hurt her, then explained it away at the hearing as an injury that occurred when her mother was washing her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">Since [MCHHS] did not address the possibility of sexual abuse of the Child by her mother, I must conclude that [MCHHS] did not consider the statement about the Child\u2019s mother to be credible. Yet there was no explanation of why this statement by the Child was not believed when the Child\u2019s statements about her father\u2019s actions were believed and accepted as fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">Without any alternative explanation of the discrepancy in credibility findings, I can only conclude that [MCHHS] itself found the Child to be an unreliable informant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADK\">For these three reasons, the ALJ found that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aun\">The Child\u2019s statements do not constitute credible evidence that sexual abuse did occur. Nor is there any other credible evidence in the record that sexual abuse occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">Since there is no credible evidence that an incident of sexual abuse occurred, [MCHHS\u2019s] finding of indicated sexual abuse cannot be upheld. Nor would a finding of unsubstantiated sexual abuse be appropriate. COMAR Q7.02.07.12A(2). The proper finding is ruled-out sexual abuse. COMAR 07.02.07.120(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Circuit Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">MCHHS attempted to reverse the ALJ\u2019s finding in circuit court. It argued that the AL J erred by focusing on the child\u2019s credibility rather than by relying on Gumula\u2019s expert testimony. The circuit court rejected MCHHS\u2019s \u201cexpert opinion\u201d argument as simply amounting to a demand that the social worker\u2019s opinion be treated as conclusive on both the credibility and the ultimate fact finding issues that are properly reserved for the fact finder. The court also questioned why MCHHS had not investigated any further.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">Well, what disturbs the Court about the account is ... I don\u2019t even know what the child was wearing.... Was the child wearing slacks, or was the child wearing shorts, or was this child wearing a dress, and why didn\u2019t your experts give us evidence of that?.... [H]ow could this insertion have been made while he is carrying the child assumedly fully clothed?.... Wouldn\u2019t that be the sort of circumstantial evidence that an expert should delve into, rather than simply take a child\u2019s statement, and go no further, and say because I am an expert, and that child wouldn\u2019t lie, that this man has abused his daughter?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The circuit court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s \u201cruled out\u201d determination on the grounds that MCHHS had not met its burden of proof. Deferring to the ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations, the circuit court concluded that there was sufficient evidence\u2014or lack thereof\u2014to support the ALJ\u2019s reasons for finding that the child\u2019s statement was not reliable. MCHHS noted this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Standards Of Review For Child Sexual Abuse Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">\n<em>Administrative Classi\u00f1cation And Reporting Standards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">MCHHS must select one of three statutorily defined dispositions for all reports of child sexual abuse: \u201cindicated,\u201d \u201cruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>out,\u201d or \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d An \u201cindicated\u201d case of child sexual abuse is premised on a \u201cfinding that there is credible evidence, which has not been satisfactorily refuted, that abuse, neglect, or sexual abuse did occur.\u201d Md.Code (1954, 1999 RepLVol., 2000 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 5-701(k) of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d); COMAR 07.02.07.12A(2). Cases in which child sexual abuse is \u201cindicated\u201d may be included in a central registry of child abuse and neglect cases that is maintained by a local department of social services (a \u201clocal department\u201d). <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 5-714. MCHHS\u2019s registry is part of a network of similar registries maintained by other county social services departments throughout Maryland. <em>See id. </em>In many cases, the identity of a person whom a local department has determined was responsible for child sexual abuse may be discerned from these networked central registries.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>If there is a \u201cfinding that abuse, neglect, or sexual abuse did not occur,\u201d then the proper finding is \u201cruled out.\u201d FL \u00a7 5-701(t).

Prince George\u2019s County Dept. of Soc. Svcs., </em>343 Md. 14, 33, 680 A.2d 470 (1996). She must \u201csift between potentially conflicting information provided by [the local department] and the alleged abuser to determine whether there are sufficient facts to meet the definitions of\u2019 indicated or unsubstantiated abuse. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The ALJ\u2019s determination can be challenged in circuit court. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 5-706.1. Appeals from the ALJ to the circuit court, and from the circuit court to the appellate courts, are governed by the same standards of review. <em>See Mayberry v. Anne Arundel County Bd. of Educ., </em>131 Md.App. 686, 700-01, 750 A.2d 677 (2000). \u201cThe test for determining whether the ... findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>whether reasoning minds could reach the same conclusion from the facts relied upon by the [agency]....

We perceive its contentions to constitute two related, but distinctly different arguments. First, MCHHS complains that the ALJ erred by improperly disregarding Gumula\u2019s expert opinion that the abuse occurred. Second, it argues that the reasons cited by the ALJ as grounds for her factual finding that the child\u2019s account was not sufficiently reliable to constitute credible evidence of abuse were not supported by the record. We disagree with both arguments, and address them separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The ALJ Did Not Err By Disregarding The Social Worker\u2019s Vouching Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">MCHHS contends that \u201cthe ALJ\u2019s decision should be reversed because it failed to articulate an adequate basis for casting aside the expert testimony.... \u201d It argues that \u201cthe ALJ err[ed] in finding that [it] produced \u2018no credible evidence\u2019 that [Mr. F.] had sexually abused his three-year-old daughter, [because] an expert in child abuse investigations testified that in her opinion the child had been abused based on the consistent and adamant account that the child had given her....\u201d MCHHS\u2019s argument is essentially that the ALJ had to consider its expert\u2019s opinion as \u201ccredible evidence\u201d of child abuse even when it is clear that the opinion was predicated upon what the ALJ determined was an unreliable out of court statement by a three year old. According to MCHHS, as long as it presents its expert to testify that she believed the child\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>statement, then the ALJ could not make a finding of \u201cruled out.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">We disagree, and question why MCHHS relies on a legal argument that has been rejected by Court of Appeals precedent governing expert testimony in sexual abuse cases. The notion that the ALJ was obligated to credit the expert opinion of MCHHS\u2019s social worker that the child was credible, rather than independently assessing the credibility of the child\u2019s reported statement, is clearly contrary to a basic evidentiary rule that MCHHS should know and honor, even in administrative proceedings. \u201c[Wjhile administrative agencies are not bound to observe the \u2018technical common law rules of evidence,\u2019 they are not prevented from doing so as long as the evidentiary rules are not applied in an arbitrary or oppressive manner that deprives a party of his right to a fair hearing.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number><em>Comm\u2019n on Medical Discipline v. Stillman, </em>291 Md. 390, 422, 435 A.2d 747 (1981); <em>cf. Dept. of Public Safety v. Scruggs, </em>79 Md.App. 312, 322-25, 556 A.2d 736 (1989) (\u201cwhether in judicial or administrative proceedings, the evidence presented must be considered <em>\u2018competent </em>\u2019 \u201d; admission of incompetent polygraph evidence in administrative proceeding was prejudicial error). In this case, we think the ALJ correctly recognized that the important reasons that the Court of Appeals has articulated for limiting expert \u201ccredibility opinions\u201d in judicial proceedings were equally applicable in this administrative proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">These reasons are set forth in the Court of Appeals\u2019 decisions in <em>Bohnert v. State, </em>312 Md. 266, 539 A.2d 657 (1988), and <em>Bentley v. Carroll, </em>355 Md. 312, 734 A.2d 697 (1999). In both decisions, the Court made it clear that child sexual abuse cannot be proved by an expert\u2019s testimony that, in her opinion, the abuse occurred because the alleged child victim was credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In <em>Bohnert, </em>the Court reversed a child sexual abuse conviction because the social worker\u2019s expert testimony that the child had been sexually abused was predicated on the child\u2019s uncorroborated statements. The <em>Bohnert </em>Court articulated two reasons that such expert testimony constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">First, the court held that when the expert\u2019s opinion that the alleged abuse occurred was based primarily on the child\u2019s statements, there is an inadequate factual foundation for that opinion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">The record leads to no other conclusion than that [the social worker\u2019s] opinion was founded only upon what [the child] said had occurred. As far as can be gleaned from the record, the source of all the evidence concerning the incidents was the child\u2014what she told [the social worker], what the mother said the child told her, what the mother\u2019s friend said the child told her. [The social worker] proffered no evidence as to objective tests or medically recognized syndromes with respect to the child.... There was no physical evidence on which to base the opinion. There were no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>eyewitnesses. The opinion was reached on the child\u2019s unsubstantiated averments and \u201ca certain sense about children\u201d which [the social worker] believed she possessed. [The social worker\u2019s] intuitive reaction to the child\u2019s story did not suffice to provide a foundation for the opinion that the child was, in fact, sexually abused. The opinion of [the social worker] was not based on facts sufficient to form a basis for her opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 276, 539 A.2d 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The second reason assigned by the <em>Bohnert </em>Court was that a social worker\u2019s opinion regarding the credibility of the child invades the fact finder\u2019s role in assessing credibility and resolving disputed facts. Citing well-established limitations on the role of witnesses, the <em>Bohnert </em>Court held that the social worker\u2019s opinion constituted an improper \u201cvouching\u201d for the credibility of the alleged victim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">In a criminal case tried before a jury, a fundamental principle is that the credibility of a witness and the weight to be accorded the witness\u2019 testimony are solely within the province of the jury.... It is also error [in civil cases] for the court to permit to go to the jury a statement, belief, or opinion of another person to the effect that a witness is telling the truth or lying....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">Whether a witness on the stand personally believes or disbelieves testimony of a previous witness is irrelevant, and questions to that effect are improper, either on direct or cross-examination....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">We have never indicated that a person can qualify as an \u201cexpert in credibility,\u201d no matter what his experience or expertise____[T]he credibility to be given a witness and the weight to be given his testimony [is] confined to the resolution of [the fact finder]. <em>It is the settled law of this State that a witness, expert or otherwise, may not give an opinion on whether he believes a witness is telling the truth. </em>Testimony from a witness relating to the credibility of another witness is to be rejected as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Furthermore, we observe that it is not the function of an expert to resolve conflicting evidence. The rationale for excluding conclusions based on the resolution of contested facts is that the conclusion requires a judgment which invades the province of the ... finder of facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">\n<em>The opinion of [the social worker] that [the child] in fact was sexually abused was tantamount to a declaration by her that the child was telling the truth and that [the accused] was lying. In the circumstances here, the opinion could only be reached if the child\u2019s testimony were believed and [the accused\u2019s] testimony disbelieved. The import of the opinion was clear\u2014[the child] was credible and [the accused] was not. Also, the opinion could only be reached by the resolution of contested facts\u2014[the child\u2019s] allegations and [the accused\u2019s] denials. Thus, the opinion was inadmissible as matter of law because it invaded the province of the jury in two ways. It encroached on the [fact finder\u2019s] function to judge the credibility of the witnesses and weigh their testimony and on the jury\u2019s function to resolve contested facts.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 277-79, 539 A.2d 657 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The Court of Appeals recently affirmed these principles.

As Ms. Guxnula\u2019s notes, report, and testimony make clear, her opinion that the abuse occurred was based on her decision to believe the damning aspects of the child\u2019s statement. As in <em>Bohnert, </em>\u201cthe opinion could only be reached if the child\u2019s testimony were believed and [the accused\u2019s] testimony disbelieved.

MCHHS is correct that although the ALJ\u2019s decision reflects that she considered Gumula\u2019s testimony regarding the course of the investigation, there is no indication that she considered the social worker\u2019s expert opinion that the abuse occurred. If, as MCHHS complains, \u201cthe ALJ just swept aside Ms. Gumula\u2019s expert opinion that [Susan] was truthful in stating that her father \u2018put his finger inside her pee-pee,\u2019 \u201d she was following well-reasoned authority in doing so. <em>See Comm\u2019n on Medical Discipline, </em>291 Md. at 422, 435 A.2d 747. Because Gumula\u2019s vouching opinion lacked an independent factual foundation and invaded the ALJ\u2019s fact finding role, the ALJ was legally correct in disregarding it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>We now proceed to review the ALJ\u2019s findings that because the child\u2019s statement was unreliable, it did not constitute credible evidence that the abuse occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The ALJ\u2019s Assessment Of The Child\u2019s Out Of Court Statement Was Supported By The Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">MCHHS\u2019s alternative argument is the familiar \u201cinsufficiency of evidence\u201d argument. It asserts that the record does not support the ALJ\u2019s conclusions that Susan\u2019s statement was contradictory and implausible, and that, based on MCHHS\u2019s own inconsistent treatment of some portions of the child\u2019s statement as credible and others as not credible, MCHHS itself found the child\u2019s statement to be unreliable. We disagree, and explain our reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The ALJ Applied Proper Standards To Make A Threshold Determination Of Whether The Child\u2019s Statement Was Reliable</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">Preliminarily, we shall affirm the method used by the ALJ for determining the appropriate evidentiary value of the child\u2019s statement. Susan\u2019s out of court statement is classic \u201chearsay\u201d that inherently raises concerns about trustworthiness and reliability.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although hearsay evidence may be admissible in an administrative proceeding, <em>see </em>Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol), \u00a7 10-213(c) of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d), we think it was appropriate for the ALJ to question whether the hearsay statement by this three year old <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>was sufficiently reliable to be considered credible evidence of child sexual abuse. We hold that the ALJ properly addressed whether the hearsay statement met the critical trustworthiness threshold, and that she did so in a manner consistent with the Legislature\u2019s approved method for evaluating the evidentiary value of a young child\u2019s out of court statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">This legislatively approved method is set forth in Md.Code (1957, 1996 RepLVoL, 2000 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 775 (\u201c\u00a7 775\u201d), which governs the admissibility of hearsay statements by a child abuse victim under 12 in juvenile and criminal court proceedings. This statute addresses the inherent questions of trustworthiness raised by such a young child\u2019s out of court statement and balances the need to protect child victims from the trauma of court proceedings with the fundamental right of the accused to test the reliability of evidence proffered against him or her. The Legislature has provided that a trial judge must make a preliminary determination of whether the young child\u2019s statement is sufficiently reliable to be admitted into evidence. The statute directs that such hearsay \u201cmay be admissible ... only if the statement possesses particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d \u00a7 775(b)(3). It also enumerates several factors by which the trustworthiness of the child\u2019s statement must be measured.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">In order to determine if a child\u2019s statement possesses particularized guarantees of trustworthiness under this section, the court shall consider, but is not limited to, the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">(1) The child\u2019s personal knowledge of the event;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">(2) The certainty that the statement was made;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">(3) Any apparent motive to fabricate or exhibit partiality by the child, including interest, bias, corruption, or coercion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\">(4) Whether the statement was spontaneous or directly responsive to questions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-11\">(5) The timing of the statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-12\">(6) Whether the child\u2019s young age makes it unlikely that the child fabricated the statement that represents a graphic, detailed account beyond the child\u2019s knowledge and experi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>ence and the appropriateness of the terminology to the child\u2019s age;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\">(7) The nature and duration of the abuse;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">(8) The inner consistency and coherence of the statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">(9) Whether the child was suffering pain or distress when making the statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">(10) Whether extrinsic evidence exists to show the defendant\u2019s opportunity to commit the act complained of in the child\u2019s statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">(11) Whether the statement is suggestive due to the use of leading questions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-9\">(12) The credibility of the person testifying about the statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-10\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 775(d). If the child is available, the court must also \u201cconduct an in camera examination of a child prior to determining the admissibility of the statement....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 775(f)(1). Moreover, \u201c[i]f the child does not testify, the child\u2019s out of court statement will be admissible only if there is corroborative evidence that .... [t]he alleged offender ... had the opportunity to commit the alleged abuse....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 775(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">In this case, the evidentiary and procedural limitations in section 775 were not mandatory because the proceedings did not involve a proceeding in court. Susan\u2019s out of court statement was admitted into evidence in an administrative hearing, pursuant to SG section 10-213(c). But the admission of this child\u2019s statement into the administrative record does not mean that the ALJ was required to give it the same weight that MCHHS attached to it. Here, the ALJ appropriately made an independent evaluation of this hearsay statement in light of the factors set forth in section 775. Applying relevant factors by analogy, she identified a number of reasons that the statement was not sufficiently reliable to constitute credible evidence that the reported incident actually occurred. We find that the ALJ was legally correct to make a threshold determination of trustworthiness by considering the factors identified in section 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>2.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The Evidence Supported The ALJ\u2019s Finding That The Child\u2019s Statement Was Not Reliable</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">We now reach the last issue raised by MCHHS\u2014 whether there was sufficient evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s three reasons for her finding that the child\u2019s out of court statement was not reliable. Our review of the record reveals that the evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s factual conclusions that the child\u2019s statement was inconsistent and implausible, and that MCHHS itself treated portions of the statement as not credible. We review each of these reasons, and the supporting evidence, and hold that any one of them was sufficient grounds for the ALJ\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">First, the ALJ found that the child\u2019s statement was not reliable because she gave inconsistent answers regarding whether any person had wiped her in the bathroom. The ALJ concluded that because MCHHS made no attempt to have the child reconcile her two apparently contradictory answers, the answers remained contradictory, and therefore one or the other was untrue. MCHHS complains that the child\u2019s responses were not necessarily inconsistent or contradictory if they are viewed through the prism that MCHHS suggests they should be interpreted. It contends that the child\u2019s answers differed because the first question (Do \u201cpeople\u201d wipe you in the bathroom? \u201cNo, I wear pants\u201d) was not as \u201cconcrete\u201d as the latter question (Did daddy wipe you in the bathroom? \u201cYes\u201d). In support of this interpretation, Gumula offered her expert opinion that children as young as Susan frequently do not respond reliably to questions that are not sufficiently narrow and direct. She opined that the \u201canybody\u201d question was too generalized for Susan to understand, but that the \u201cdaddy\u201d question was sufficiently specific for Susan to give an accurate response.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The answer to this argument is that the ALJ was not obligated to credit Gumula\u2019s explanation, or to adopt MCHHS\u2019s model for reconciling the child\u2019s answers. Her rejection of Gumula\u2019s opinion was bolstered by her observation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>that Gumula selectively applied such \u201creconciliation reasoning\u201d to justify continuing her investigation against Mr. F., while failing to explain why the child\u2019s specific statement against her mother did not merit any investigation of the mother. As the fact finder, the ALJ was charged with drawing her own inferences and conclusions from the child\u2019s reported statement. We believe the cited evidence was sufficient to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that young Susan\u2019s statement was internally inconsistent. <em>Cf. </em>\u00a7 775(d)(8) (evaluation should consider \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness,\u201d including \u201cinner consistency and coherence of the statement\u201d). Given the importance that MCHHS itself attributed to consistent responses, we find that this inconsistency was sufficiently material to undermine the reliability of the child\u2019s subsequent statement that her father put his finger inside her.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The second reason that the ALJ found Susan\u2019s statement was unreliable was that the child\u2019s account of the incident was implausible. MCHHS\u2019s contention that the child\u2019s account was no more implausible than the fact that child sexual abuse exists oversimplifies and misses the point made by the ALJ\u2014 that MCHHS made no effort to pursue or present any corroborating details that might have explained how this act could have been accomplished in the time, place, and manner described in the child\u2019s statement. The ALJ noted that MCHHS did not seek additional information regarding what the child was wearing, how she was being carried when the alleged digital penetration occurred, or the particular setting where the incident allegedly occurred. Such additional evidence might have added important detail that was corroborating or exculpatory. Instead, MCHHS based its entire investi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>gation and findings on this three year old\u2019s brief statement, without sufficiently investigating \u201c[wjhether extrinsic evidence exist[ed] to show the defendant\u2019s opportunity to commit the act complained of in the child\u2019s statement.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 775(d)(10); FL \u00a7 5-706 (local department must \u201cmake a thorough investigation\u201d). Given the plausibility questions raised by the child\u2019s account, the ALJ was justified in making a factual finding based on the lack of any \u201ccorroborative evidence that ... the alleged offender ... had the opportunity to commit the alleged abuse.... \u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 775(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The final reason that the ALJ found the child\u2019s statement unreliable was that MCHHS itself had not found the statement sufficiently credible or reliable to justify an investigation of the child\u2019s statement that her mother hurt her. In its brief, MCHHS states that \u201c[t]he ALJ noted ... that Ms. Gumula did not follow up on [Susan\u2019s] statements about her mother hurting her because [Susan] told her that this happened when her mother washed her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Our review of the ALJ\u2019s decision and Gumula\u2019s testimony reveals that MCHHS has mischaracterized both. The ALJ stated that \u201cincluded in Ms. Gumula\u2019s testimony was an added statement, that the Child\u2019s mother hurt her vagina while washing her.\u201d Gumula testified that \u201cwhen we asked her did anybody ever hurt her pee-pee, she said yes, her mother did at home, but she really couldn\u2019t tell, you know when she was washing her....\u201d Neither of these statements says that the source of Gumula\u2019s \u201cwashing\u201d explanation was the child herself. Moreover, as the ALJ correctly observed, none of the notes or reports that Gumula made contemporaneously with the interview and investigation mentioned this \u201cwashing\u201d explanation. In these circumstances, the evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Gumula and MCHHS \u201cdid not consider the statement about the Child\u2019s mother to be credible,\u201d but did not explain \u201cwhy this statement by the Child was not believed when the Child\u2019s statements about her father\u2019s actions were believed and accepted as fact.\u201d In turn, this conclusion supported the ALJ\u2019s finding that even MCHHS found the child\u2019s statement to be inconsistent and unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>We find no error by either the ALJ or the circuit court. MCHHS must comply with the order to reclassify the case as \u201cruled out,\u201d and expunge its records and registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

Mr. F. apparently denied these allegations when he learned about them, and contended that they revealed his ex-wife's desire to undermine his relationship with his daughter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b276-6\">. Another difference between the police and MCHHS reports involved whether Mr. F. ever \"confessed\u201d to his ex-wife that he had hurt Susan. Gumula's handwritten notes from the August 5th interview with Ms. F. stated that Ms. F. reported that Mr. F. \"[c]alled her today &amp; [said] confessed to he touched her on pee pee....\u201d Gumula's typewritten summary also states that \"Mrs. [F.] told investigators that when Mr. [F.] called her [about the impending report to social services] she understood him to say that he had touched [Susan] on her pee pee and hurt her.\u201d But Penn\u2019s report of the August 5th interview does not mention that Ms. F. said anything about an alleged admission by Mr. F.

Gumula also concluded that Mr. F. presented a high or significant risk of future harm to Susan based on her evaluation of his perception of the child; his behaviors, feelings, and level of adaptation; his child rearing practices; and his own personal history of \u2018\u2018problem-filled life experience.\u201d She gave Ms. F. the highest evaluation for each of these same factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b287-5\">. The Court of Appeals has recognized that the identity of a suspected abuser may be discerned even if the report does not denote the suspected individual. In <em>Montgomery County Dept. Of Social Svcs. v. L.D., </em>349 Md. 239, 707 A.2d 1331 (1998), the Court pointed out that identifying the suspected abuser is especially possible when the record lists only the names and ages of the parents.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">If ... an anonymous report of abuse involved a single parent and one child, someone reviewing records related to this incident on the [central registry used by the local department] could infer easily from that record who is the parent listed on the registry.

Accordingly, we believe that the [local departments\u2019] registries sufficiently identify individuals suspected by local departments of abuse or neglect within the meaning of section 5-715.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 266-67, 707 A.2d 1331. The Court noted that \u201cthe information stored on the databases is accessible statewide\u2019\u2019 by individuals involved in child abuse investigations, including staff of the state\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services, local Health and Human Services departments, and law enforcement officers. <em>Id. </em>at 265, 707 A.2d 1331. In fact, the Court noted, local departments throughout the state routinely check these databases as part of investigating every report of child abuse, in order to determine whether any services have been provided to the child, caretaker, household, or family member. <em>See id. </em>at 266-67, 707 A.2d 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">In this case, the inference that Mr. F. is the accused abuser would be rather easy to draw, because the only adult names on the record in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Susan\u2019s case would be the two parents. Because the record would show that the child remains in the care and custody of her mother, persons reviewing the record could infer that MCHHS determined that Mr. F. abused his daughter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b290-5\">. In the circuit court, MCHHS contended that the proper disposition of this case was \"unsubstantiated,\u201d rather than \"ruled out,\u201d because (1) the child's statement and the MCHHS expert's opinion prevented Mr. F. from proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the abuse did not occur; and (2) the ALJ found that \"there [was] no credible account by the suspected victim.\u201d <em>Compare </em>FL \u00a7 5-701(v) (\" \u2018Ruled out\u2019 means a finding that ... sexual abuse did not occur\"), <em>with </em>COMAR 07.02.07.12C (ruled out \"disposition shall be used when a preponderance of the evidence shows that abuse did not occur,\u201d because <em>inter alia </em>\"[tjhere is no credible evidence of ... an incident involving sexual molestation or exploitation having occurred\u201d); <em>compare also </em>FL \u00a7 5-701(v) (\u201c \u2018Unsubstantiated\u2019 means a finding that there is an insufficient amount of evidence to support a finding of indicated or ruled out\"), <em>with </em>COMAR 07.02.07.12B (\"unsubstantiated\" finding means \"there is insufficient evidence to support a finding of indicated or ruled out,\" because \u2018\u2018[t]here is no credible account by the suspected victim\u201d). MCHHS has abandoned these contentions in this appeal. Accordingly, we leave for another day the questions of whether these regulations impose an impermissible burden on persons accused of child sexual abuse to prove their innocence, and whether they impermissibly authorize MCHHS to classify and centrally register suspected abusers in an \"unsubstantiated\u201d case on the grounds that \"there is no credible account by the suspected victim.\u201d <em>See id; cf. C.S., supra, </em>343 Md. at 30, 680 A.2d 470 (history of statutes governing investigation and determination of child abuse allegations \"demonstrates the legislature's concern that before information relating to alleged child abuse can be disseminated state-wide, that information must have been demonstrated to be accurate either through adjudication or an administrative hearing\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b294-6\">. We also note that MCHHS apparently fails to appreciate that the ALJ was entitled to disregard any \u201cnon-vouching\" opinion offered by Gumula. It is elementary that the ALJ did not have to agree with Gumula\u2019s expert opinion that the abuse occurred, nor did she have to find Gumula or her investigation credible. Indeed, the record shows that Mr. F. directly attacked Gumula\u2019s competence and credibility as a central part of his defense. The ALJ and circuit court indicated that they also questioned Gumula\u2019s investigation, noting her failure to pursue \"fairly objective\u201d matters that would have been helpful in evaluating the child\u2019s statement, such as what the child was wearing or how she was carried. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 5-706 (\"the local department ... shall make a thorough investigation of a report of suspected abuse\u201d); <em>C.S., supra, </em>343 Md. at 30, 680 A.2d 470 (noting legislature\u2019s \"deep concern\u201d that authority of social services departments \"must be tempered to ensure that individuals are not labeled as child abusers on the basis of inaccurate or incomplete information\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b295-11\">. <em>See generally </em>J.
