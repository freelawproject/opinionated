The appeal arises from a suit filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County by Mukhtar Taha, appellee, against his former employer, Southern Management Corporation (\u201cSouthern\u201d), appellant, and two former co-employees, Deborah Wylie-Forth and Michael McGovern,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Taha\u2019s discharge from his position at Southern. Taha claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that Southern and the two individual employees committed the tort of malicious prosecution by filing unfounded burglary charges against him. The jury found in favor of the individual employees but against Southern. After the court denied appellant\u2019s Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict (\u201cJNOV\u201d), this appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Southern presents four questions for our consideration, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">I. Because the jury found that Southern\u2019s agents were not liable for the tort of malicious prosecution, did the circuit court err in denying Southern\u2019s Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict as to the claim for malicious prosecution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">II. Did the circuit court err in refusing to instruct the jury that it must find actual malice in order to award punitive damages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">III. Did the circuit court err in denying Southern\u2019s motion to strike punitive damages because there was no evidence of actual malice in the record to support the award?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-9\">IV. Did the circuit court err in denying Southern\u2019s motion for remittitur as to the jury\u2019s award of $25,000 for economic damages, because appellee sustained only $500 in such damages?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">For the reasons that follow, we answer question I in the affirmative. Therefore, we shall reverse the judgment. Accordingly, we need not answer the remaining questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">Taha is a black male who emigrated to the United States in 1981 from Africa. On May 15, 1994, Southern hired Taha to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>work as a Maintenance Technician at Silver Spring Towers (\u201cSST\u201d), an apartment complex managed by Southern. Taha\u2019s duties included attending to service calls and undertaking repairs and renovations.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">After five months of employment, Southern terminated Taha on October 19, 1994. Six days later, on October 25, 1994, Taha was arrested at his apartment in the presence of his family. Taha\u2019s daughter was \u201cdevastated\u201d and \u201cfell on the floor crying.\u201d Taha\u2019s wife was also crying. The charging documents alleged a second degree attempted burglary of Southern\u2019s maintenance shop on October 4, 1994, and a fourth degree burglary of a Southern storehouse on October 8, 1994. The dismissal of the charges against Taha gave rise to the civil suit filed by him on March 3, 1999, against Southern, McGovern, and Wylie-Forth, alleging wrongful discharge, malicious prosecution, conspiracy, false imprisonment, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Southern and the two individual defendants were all represented by the same legal counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Prior to trial, by order dated May 27,1999, the circuit court dismissed all but two of Taha\u2019s claims. At the close of Taha\u2019s case, the circuit court entered judgment in favor of the defense as to the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, leaving only the claim for malicious prosecution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> What follows is a summary of the evidence adduced at trial relevant to the malicious prosecution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">While at SST, Taha worked under the supervision of McGovern, who managed the maintenance employees at the complex. McGovern was the only white employee at SST among 30 or more employees. McGovern reported to Wylie-Forth, a black female who was the Property Manager of the apartment complex. McGovern and Wylie Forth had worked together for over 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Taha alleged that he was implicated in two burglaries at Southern because of his poor working relationship with McGovern and Wylie-Forth. He claimed that within several weeks after he began working at SST, McGovern and Wylie-Forth were unhappy with his job performance and indicated that he needed to be more of a \u201cteam player.\u201d Wylie-Forth also disliked Taha\u2019s abrasive conduct and advised Taha that he needed to cooperate with the other employees. Taha believed, however, that his job performance was adequate, and felt that he had been criticized unfairly because McGovern and Wylie-Forth did not like him.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">At trial, Taha recounted that McGovern complained to Wylie-Forth \u201c[ajlmost every day\u201d about Taha\u2019s performance. Taha also stated that McGovern singled him out and complained about \u201cthe smallest stuff,\u201d such as the length of his hair. Additionally, Taha testified that McGovern made derogatory remarks to him about Africans and African-Americans, describing them as \u201clazy\u201d and \u201cstupid.\u201d According to Taha, McGovern once \u201ctook off his shirt, rolled it off and throw [sic] it on my face. He said to me, \u2018Do you want to be a supervisor?\u2019 and he gave me\u2014he throw his shirt on my face like that.\u201d Further, Taha believed that McGovern and other employees, including Wilfredo Martinez, purposely attempted to injure him by letting go of a heavy barrel that they were attempting to move.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Taha testified that on three or four occasions he complained to Wylie-Forth about McGovern\u2019s racial comments. According to Taha, Wylie-Forth was unresponsive and told him that he complained \u201clike a child.\u201d When Taha told Wylie-Forth about the shirt incident, she remarked: \u201cMike have short temper [sic]. Just bear with him, and as soon as you finish your training period, you are going to be transferred and you are going to be okay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">On or about October 5, 1994, McGovern sent a memorandum to Wylie-Forth implicating Taha in an attempted burglary of one of Southern\u2019s maintenance shops. The memorandum said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>DEAR DEBRA [sic]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-4\">THIS LETTER IS WRITTEN TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION AN INCIDENT RELAYED TO ME BY ONE OF THE MAINTENANCE WORKERS, WILFREDO [MARTINEZ]. WILFREDO REPORTED TO ME THAT WHILE WALKING TO HIS CAR HE OBSERVED TAHA TRYING TO BREAK INTO THE MAINTENANCE SHOP ON OCTOBER 4, 1994 AT APPROXIMATELY 8:30 PM. WILFREDO OBSERVED TAHA SHAKING AND PULLING ON THE LOCK AFTER HIS KEY DID NOT OPEN THE DOOR. WHEN WILFREDO ASKED \u201cWHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?\u201d, TAHA REPLIED \u201cI DO NOT HAVE THE KEY TO THIS DOOR\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">WILFREDO SHARED THIS SCENARIO WITH ME BECAUSE OF HIS CONCERN THAT RECENTLY A MULTITUDE OF MATERIALS HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM THE MAINTENANCE SHOP AND COULD NOT BE ACCOUNTED FOR. THIS IS NOT ONLY A CONCERN OF WILFREDO\u2019S BUT HAS BEEN AN ONGOING CONCERN OF ALL MAINTENANCE WORKERS. WILFREDO COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY TAHA WOULD BE INTENT UPON ENTERING THE MAINTENANCE SHOP WHILE ON MEDICAL LEAVE. WILFREDO THEN LEFT THE SCENE AND REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO ME THE NEXT MORNING.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">A few days later, Wylie-Forth learned that property had been removed from a locked storage area containing Southern\u2019s maintenance supplies and tools. Consequently, she called the Montgomery County Police Department to report the missing property.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">At trial, Wylie-Forth testified as an adverse witness and also in the defense case. When asked if she had called the police to report the missing property, Wylie-Forth initially said: \u201cNo. Someone in my office called the police.\u201d When asked again, she replied: \u201cI can\u2019t remember.\u201d When asked a third time, Wylie-Forth admitted: \u201cYes, I called the police.\u201d Later, she said: \u201cI did not call the police on Mr. Taha.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>response to a question from her lawyer, Wylie-Forth explained: \u201c[I]n my business anytime you have any type of an incident where something is stolen ... or broken into, you are supposed to call ... the ... police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">On October 23, 1994, Robert Grims, a Montgomery County Police Officer, responded to the call about missing property. Although Wylie-Forth advised him that several expensive tools were missing, she did not identify any suspects. Nevertheless, in response to Grims\u2019s inquiry, Wylie-Forth identified Taha as an employee who had recently been terminated, and said that two of her maintenance workers reported that Taha had been seen at SST. She also informed Grims that she and Taha had argued after his termination. Additionally, Wylie-Forth gave permission to Grims to talk to any of Southern\u2019s employees about the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Grims spoke to McGovern, who informed Grims that his tools were missing from the storage room. Although McGovern did not identify Taha as a suspect, he told Grims that Taha and Wylie-Forth had argued following Taha\u2019s termination, and that McGovern believed that Taha still had keys to the storage area. During Grims\u2019s investigation, he also interviewed Wilfredo Martinez and Anna Udit, two other Southern employees. Neither Martinez nor Udit testified at trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Grims also interviewed Taha at his apartment, and Taha denied knowledge of the burglaries. Although Taha indicated that he still had keys to several rooms in the apartment complex, Taha claimed he did not have keys to the areas in question. Grims noticed several large tool boxes on the floor of Taha\u2019s apartment, but Taha indicated that those tools belonged to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Based on Grims\u2019s investigation, Grims completed an Application for Statement of Charges, charging Taha with second degree attempted burglary of the maintenance room at SST, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>and fourth-degree burglary of the main office at SST. Grims also obtained a warrant for Taha\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">According to the Application For Statement Of Charges, Martinez reported to Grims that he had observed Taha \u201cshaking and pulling on the lock\u201d in the maintenance shop of SST on Saturday evening, October 4, 1994, and Taha \u201cfled\u201d when confronted by Martinez. Wylie-Forth learned about the incident from Martinez, after various items had \u201cdisappeared\u201d from the maintenance shop. At the time, Taha was on disability leave and had no right of access to the SST property. In addition, according to the Application, Udit informed Grims that she had observed Taha in Wylie-Forth\u2019s office on October 8, 1994, while Taha was still on medical leave. Nevertheless, Grims said at trial that he was the one who decided to bring charges against Taha, notwithstanding that he had obtained information concerning Taha from Southern\u2019s employees. The following trial testimony is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Who made the decision to file the application for statement of charges against Mr. Taha?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">[GRIMS]: It was my decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: What if any role did Mr. McGovern, Michael McGovern, play in making that decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-8\">[GRIMS]: No role.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: What if any role did Ms. Debbie Wiley-Forth [sic] play in making your decision to file the application for statement of charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-10\">[GRIMS]: She was the original complainant for the police investigation, however, it was my decision to file the charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: At any point in time, what if anything did Ms. Debbie Wiley-Forth [sic] say to you to encourage you or pressure you into filing charges for Mr. Taha?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>[GRIMS]: None that I recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: What if anything did Mr. McGovern say to you to pressure you or get you to file an application of statement of charges against Mr. Taha?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aec\">[GRIMS]: Nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">On cross-examination, the following testimony was elicited:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajc\">[APPELLEE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Who was the complainant in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">[GRIMS]: Ms. Forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">[APPELLEE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Who does she work for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avv\">[GRIMS]: Southern Management.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-9\">[APPELLEE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Did she ever tell you that she wasn\u2019t authorized to about this to you [sic]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-10\">[GRIMS]: No. I can\u2019t recall that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-11\">[APPELLEE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Did anybody ever say from Southern Management Corporation that they weren\u2019t authorized to make any statements to you, that they needed to talk to corporate counsel before they could make a statement to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-12\">[GRIMS]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-13\">[APPELLEE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: So the investigation really originated with Southern Management employees. Isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-14\">[GRIMS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-15\">[APPELLEE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Ms. Debra Wiley-Forth [sic], is she the one who called you on the phone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-16\">[GRIMS]: She was the initial complainant to one of the burglaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-17\">[APPELLEE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: ... Did you speak to Michael McGovern, then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-18\">[GRIMS]: I can\u2019t recall. I believe I did, but I am not positive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>[GRIMS]: ... I know I spoke with Mr. Martinez. I can\u2019t recall speaking with Mr. McGovern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-4\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\">[GRIMS]: I probably was speaking to him. I just don\u2019t remember speaking to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">[GRIMS]: I interviewed Ms. Hudit [sic] and Mr. Martinez.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">* sis *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-9\">[APPELLEE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Apparently, you say all of the victims, and I assume Mr. McGovern is one of the victims since you list him as a victim, indicated that items began disappearing ever since Mr. Taha was working there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-10\">[GRIMS]: Yes. That is in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-11\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Would it be fair to say that the information that you got regarding the whereabouts or any behavior or observations of Mr. Taha came from Southern Management employees?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-12\">[GRIMS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-13\">After Taha\u2019s arrest on October 25, 1994, he was released on his own recognizance. Taha maintained that, on the dates of the two alleged burglaries, he was in New York, and thus could not have committed the crimes. He also produced documentary evidence to support his assertion that he was in New York on October 2, 1994, and October 8, 1994. Taha\u2019s account was corroborated by his wife and a customer service representative who worked at the Greyhound bus terminal in Silver Spring.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-14\">Taha recounted to the jury that the criminal charges were eventually dismissed. He recalled that the prosecutor stated in court: \u201cThis guy he have an air-tight alibi, and we cannot prosecute him.\u201d The record reflects that, on January 10, 1995, the criminal case against Taha was placed on the \u201cstet\u201d docket for one year. Thereafter, a nolle prosequi was entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>on January 11, 1996. According to Taha, he incurred $500 in legal fees in connection with the criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">At the end of Taha\u2019s case, the court ruled on the defense motions for judgment, and said: \u201cWith respect to individual liability, it is clear that a corporate entity acts through its agents, but that doesn\u2019t eliminate the possibility of agent/individual liability.\u201d As we noted, the court granted the motion as to the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">In its initial instructions to the jury, the court never addressed or explained the concept of respondeat superior liability. At the end of the instructions the court said: \u201cAnything further, Counsel?\u201d Appellee\u2019s counsel answered \u201cyes.\u201d Then, counsel approached the bench, but the trial transcript indicates that the bench conference was \u201cinaudible.\u201d In any event, after the bench conference the court gave several clarifying instructions. Of significance here, the court gave the following supplemental instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">In this matter, the defendants are sued as employer and employee, so the management may be employer and co-defendant, and the <em>employees, being Mr. McGovern and Ms. Wiley, </em>for them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\">If the employee or employees are responsible for the acts about which the complaint is made by the plaintiff, the employer is also responsible since they would have been acting in the course of their employee responsibilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADn\">(Emphasis added). No objection was lodged to that instruction, nor was any request made for further amplification of the doctrine of respondeat superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">After presenting closing arguments, the lawyers discussed the proposed verdict sheet. Southern\u2019s lawyer identified as a \u201cproblem\u201d that it included only one question that pertained to all three defendants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, he asked the court to submit a special verdict sheet containing a separate question \u201cwith respect to each individual defendant.\u201d No objection or excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>tion was interposed by counsel for appellee with regard to Southern\u2019s request. Accordingly, the special verdict sheet included separate questions as to liability for each defendant, phrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-4\">1. Was the Plaintiff, Mukhtar Taha, the victim of malicious prosecution by the Defendant Southern Management Corporation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">2. Was the Plaintiff, Mukhtar Taha, the victim of malicious prosecution by the Defendant, Deborah Wylie-Forth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">3. Was the Plaintiff, Mukhtar Taha, the victim of malicious prosecution by the Defendant, Michael McGovern?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\">If \u201cYes\u201d to any Defendant, answer Question 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\">4. What amount of damages do you award Plaintiff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-9\">A. Economic $_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-10\">B. Non-Economic $_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">Appellee did not object to the wording of the questions, nor did he ask the court to make clear in Question 1 that Southern\u2019s liability, if any, necessarily rested on the conduct of one or more of its employees acting within the scope of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-12\">As we noted, the jury found against Southern but exonerated the individual defendants. It awarded Taha $100,000 in compensatory damages, consisting of $25,000 for economic damages and $75,000 for non-economic damages. Thereafter, the court submitted the issue of punitive damages to the jury. With respect to punitive damages, the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-13\">Mr. Foreman, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, there is an additional consideration that you must make, but you are not required to. It is fundamental that you make a determination with respect to liability; that is compensatory damages, but you may make an award for punitive damages if you deem appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-14\">An award for punitive damages, if you decide to award punitive damages, must be established by clear and convine<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>ing evidence, and I am going to define what clear and convincing evidence is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-4\">To be clear and convincing, evidence should be clear in the sense that it is certain, plain to the understanding and unambiguous and convincing in the sense that it so reasonable [sic] and persuasive as to cause you to believe it. But you need not be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt; only to clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">An award of punitive damages, I indicated, must be established by clear and convincing evidence, and for an award of punitive damages to be made, you should consider the following thee factors: in an amount that will deter the defendant and others from similar conduct in the future; two, proportionate to the wrongfulness of the defendant\u2019s conduct and the defendant\u2019s ability to pay; and three, but not designed to bankrupt or financially destroy a defendant. As I indicated earlier, you may, if you deem it appropriate, award for punitive damages, but you are not required to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acfj\">Because Southern believed that the court did not adequately instruct the jury on the element of \u201cactual malice,\u201d Southern objected and asked the court to \u201cinstruct [the jury] that there needs to be actual malice.\u201d The court refused to modify its instruction, reasoning that the jury does</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">not even have to award punitive damages. I said they may, but they are not required to do so\u2014malice\u2014malicious prosecution, I do not think I have to\u2014they have determined that there is malice by their verdict already.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Thereafter, the jury awarded Taha $100,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Subsequently, Southern moved for JNOV, claiming that, as a matter of law, it could not be liable for malicious prosecution because the jury exonerated the two individual defendants who were employees of Southern and who committed the conduct at issue. Although the court acknowledged that the verdict appeared \u201con the surface to be factually inconsistent,\u201d it denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">I. STANDARD OP REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">\u201cIn a jury trial, a party may move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict only if that party made a motion for judgment at the close of all the evidence and only on the grounds advanced in support of the earlier motion.\u201d Md. Rule 2\u2014532(a); <em>see </em>Md. Rule 2-519. An appellate court considering the denial of a motion for JNOV must determine whether the record contains legally relevant and competent evidence, however slight, from which a jury rationally could have found in appellee\u2019s favor. <em>Jacobs v. Flynn, </em>131 Md.App. 342, 353, 749 A.2d 174 (2000); <em>Bartholomee v. Casey, </em>103 Md.App. 34, 51, 651 A.2d 908 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>338 Md. 557, 659 A.2d 1293 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">In our review of the trial court\u2019s decision, we consider the evidence, and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence, in the light most favorable to the party in whose favor the verdict was rendered. Md. Rule 2-519(b); <em>Houston v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>346 Md. 503, 521, 697 A.2d 851 (1997); <em>Caldor, Inc. v. Bowden, </em>330 Md. 632, 636, 625 A.2d 959 (1993); <em>Jacobs, </em>131 Md.App. at 353, 749 A.2d 174. Moreover, all evidentiary conflicts are resolved in favor of the party who prevailed below. <em>Caldor, </em>330 Md. at 636, 625 A.2d 959; <em>Miller Bldg. Supply, Inc. v. Rosen, </em>61 Md.App. 187, 193, 485 A.2d 1023 (1985), <em>aff'd, </em>305 Md. 341, 503 A.2d 1344 (1986). On the other hand, we will reverse a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for JNOV when the verdict is unsupported by the evidence or legally flawed. <em>See Lusby v. First Nat'l Bank, </em>263 Md. 492, 506, 283 A.2d 570 (1971); <em>Piquette v.

Because the jury exonerated Southern\u2019s two employees, who were the alleged tortfeasors, Southern contends that the corporation could not be liable as a matter of law. Appellee counters that Southern has waived its argument about an inconsistent verdict, because it failed to object to the verdict sheet. Taha also contends that the circuit court properly denied Southern\u2019s motion because other employees of Southern, in addition to the two who were sued, gave false information about Taha to the police, and their tortious conduct was attributable to Southern. Further, Taha asserts in his brief that \u201cnowhere in the Complaint is Mr. Taha arguing derivative liability under a theory of respondeat superior.\u201d Instead, he claims that Southern is directly and independently liable for its own tortious conduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">According to Taha, the verdict sheet was prepared pursuant to appellant\u2019s request, and the verdict sheet gave \u201cthe jury ... the impression that it could assign liability to the corporate entity and extend clemency to the individual defendants.\u201d In Taha\u2019s view, if there is any issue about an inconsistent verdict, it is due to the form of the verdict sheet, which Southern requested. Therefore, Taha argues that \u201cit would be improper to continence [sic] [appellant\u2019s] newly asserted arguments that the Jury\u2019s Verdict is somehow inconsistent.\u201d As we understand it, Taha essentially argues that it would be unfair to allow Southern to benefit from a problem that it created with respect to the verdict sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">In support of Taha\u2019s claim of waiver, he relies on <em>Wright v. Eagle-Picher Indus., Inc. </em>80 Md.App. 606, 565 A.2d 377 (1989). Taha\u2019s reliance on <em>Wright </em>is misplaced. There, pursuant to Md. Rule 2-522(c), the Court determined that the defendants waived their right to have the jury determine a particular issue, because they failed to object to the <em>omission </em>of the issue from the verdict sheet. Here, appellant is not complaining about the omission of an issue from the verdict sheet. Rather, Southern\u2019s argument is premised on its claim that the jury\u2019s exoneration of the individual tortfeasors compels a finding in its favor, as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">To be sure, Southern did not object to the form of the verdict sheet that was tailored to its request. To the contrary, it asked the court to pose separate questions pertinent to each defendant. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-522. But, Southern maintains that the issue is the verdict, not the verdict sheet, and claims that it challenged the verdict at the earliest opportunity through its motion for JNOV. Therefore, Southern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>contends that it has preserved this issue for appeal. We agree with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Following the bench conference, the jury was specifically instructed that, \u201c[i]f the employee or employees are responsible for the acts about which the complaint is made by the plaintiff, the employer is also responsible since they would have been acting in the course of the employee responsibilities.\u201d That supplemental instruction was accurate but arguably incomplete and, as a result, possibly misleading. Although the court specifically told the jury that Southern would be liable if the jury found McGovern and Wylie-Forth liable, the court never advised the jury of the converse-that Southern\u2019s liability, if any, is founded on the conduct of its employees, and if the jury exonerated the two named employees, Southern could not be liable. Even if liability could attach based on the conduct of other employees of Southern who were not sued, the jury was not instructed to consider the conduct of other employees. Significantly, Taha never asked the court to amplify its supplemental instruction, nor did he object or except to it as inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Moreover, we cannot find fault with the defense for requesting a separate verdict question for each defendant. Md. Rule 2-522(c) provides, in part, that \u201c[t]he court may require a jury to return a special verdict in the form of written findings upon specific issues.\u201d Moreover, the Court of Appeals has recognized that \u201cspecial verdicts are often useful in cases with multiple parties or issues.\u201d <em>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., </em>343 Md. at 525, 682 A.2d 1143. In the absence of an abuse of discretion, we will not reverse a trial court\u2019s \u201cuse of a particular form for special verdicts.\u201d <em>ACandS v. Abate, </em>121 Md.App. 590, 628, 710 A.2d 944, <em>cert. denied sub nom., John Crane, Inc. v.

Here, the individual defendants were certainly entitled to separate consideration by the jury with regard to their conduct and culpability. Although the issue that has now arisen could have been avoided by a carefully worded verdict ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>tion as to Southern, Taha did not object to the form of the question. Therefore, he is the one who waived a complaint about its sufficiency. Nor is there any basis to conclude that appellant\u2019s counsel deliberately sought to create confusion. But, when the issue arose after the jury rendered its verdict, Southern promptly raised the contention that the finding of liability against it could not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">We turn to consider whether the court erred by denying appellant\u2019s motion for JNOV.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Corporations act through their agents. <em>Athas v. Hill, </em>300 Md. 133, 149, 476 A.2d 710 (1984). Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, an employer is jointly and severally liable for the torts committed by an employee acting within the scope of employment. <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 30, 660 A.2d 423 (1995); <em>see DiPino v. Davis, </em>354 Md. 18, 47, 729 A.2d 354 (1999); <em>Tall v.

Thus, an employer can be liable for the tort of malicious prosecution committed by its employees, based on principles of respondeat superior or vicarious liability. As the Court said in <em>Ace Dev.

Talbott, </em>29 Md.App. 536, 349 A.2d 615 (1975), illustrates that a principal may be liable for the tort of malicious prosecution based on the conduct of an agent. There, a daughter handled the leasing arrangements for an office building owned by her mother. After the daughter leased the premises to a certain company, disputes arose between the daughter and that company, and the daughter eventually obtained arrest warrants for two company officials. One of the company officials was acquitted, and he subsequently sued the daughter and the mother, both of whom were found liable. On appeal, we determined that the evidence was sufficient to support the findings, based on the relationship of principal and agent between mother and daughter. We stated: \u201c \u2018If the prosecution was previously authorized or subsequently ratified, or if within the scope of the servant\u2019s or agent\u2019s employment, the employer or principal is liable; <em>otherwise he is not.\u2019 \u201d Picone, </em>29 Md.App. at 541, 349 A.2d 615 (quoting <em>Nance v.

In this case, however, we are confronted with the converse situation. The question here is whether the principal may be liable if the agent is found not liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Taha asserts that \u201cthe intentional tort of malicious prosecution may be brought against the employer directly so long as the [tortfeasor-Jemployee is acting within the scope of his employment.\u201d For its part, Southern concedes that, under certain circumstances, a corporate employer could be liable for the tort of malicious prosecution, based on the conduct of an employee, even if the tortfeasor-employee is not sued by the plaintiff. In the context of this case, however, in which two employees were sued, Southern maintains that the jury\u2019s favorable disposition as to those two employees required a finding in its favor. Appellant explains that, based on well-established principles of respondeat superior, Southern, as principal, cannot be liable here, because the two employee-defendants were found not culpable, <em>and </em>the evidence did not show that any other corporate employees committed the tort. Moreover, appellant maintains that the jury was never asked to consider, and did not decide, if Southern was liable based on the conduct of other employees who were not actually sued. In sum, because respondeat superior liability is derivative, Southern maintains that it cannot be liable for the actions of two named employees whose conduct was not found wrongful by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">We agree that, in order to prevail in a claim against Southern for malicious prosecution, Taha was not obligated to sue the individual employees who allegedly committed the tort. Instead, Taha could have sued Southern alone, and established liability based on the conduct of one or more of its employees who were acting in the scope of employment. Regardless of whether Taha elected to sue the individual tortfeasors, Taha still had to prove that his injury was caused by an agent or employee of Southern, acting in the scope of employment, in order to prevail against Southern. <em>See generally </em>Tall, 120 Md.App. at 251, 706 A.2d 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Here, appellee elected to sue both the corporation and two of its employees as wrongdoers. Consequently, we must determine whether Taha proceeded on the basis that the named individual employees were the ones who committed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number><em>tort and, if so, </em>whether the verdicts against Southern can stand, given that the jury found that the two employees were not hable.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Taha seems to suggest that the verdict was not flawed because the jury could have decided, in its discretion, only to hold the corporate defendant responsible for the conduct of Wylie-Forth and McGovern, rather than hold the two employees personally responsible for their tortious conduct. Taha has not referred us to any legal authority to support that proposition, however. Moreover, it flies in the face of settled law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">A general rule of substantive law is that a corporation, like an individual, is liable for its torts, unless otherwise exempt by law. <em>By itself, however, a corporation is a fictional person incapable of tortious conduct, </em>and, being a de jure person, cannot by itself have a mental state of any kind, and for this reason, <em>can only have, and be liable for, the mental states of its various employees, when they act within the authority given to them.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">19 C.J.S. <em>Corporations </em>\u00a7 699, at 352 (1990) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\"><em>DiPino, </em>354 Md. 18, 729 A.2d 354, is instructive. There, after the State dismissed criminal charges against Davis for hindering and obstruction, Davis brought a civil suit against the detective who filed the charges, claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>malicious prosecution. Davis also sued the officer\u2019s employer, the Mayor and City Council of Ocean City, based on vicarious liability. After the trial court ruled in favor of the defendants, Davis appealed. In the course of its opinion, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgF\">When acting in a private or proprietary context, the entity also has <em>respondeat superior </em>liability for the tortious conduct of its employees.

For example, in <em>Mann v. Wadsworth, </em>776 P.2d 926 (Utah App.1989), the appellant sued a law firm and its client for malicious prosecution in bringing a conspiracy suit against the appellant. The law firm was dismissed from the action and a judgment was rendered in favor of the client. On appeal, the appellant asserted error as to the dismissal of the law firm. The court said that the firm\u2019s \u201cliability under <em>respondeat superior </em>is vicarious, it does not exist apart from [the client\u2019s] liability. The jury held [the client] not liable, and the same result must, therefore, also obtain for [the law firm.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 928-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Similarly, in <em>Morton v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Co., </em>184 W.Va. 64, 399 S.E.2d 464 (1990), the court found that a corporation was not liable for malicious prosecution, because the plaintiffs case was based upon the wrongful acts of an agent who had been dismissed from the case on directed verdict. Relying on <em>Willigerod v. Sharafabadi, </em>151 W.Va. 995, 158 S.E.2d 175 (1967), the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">Where a master and a servant are sued jointly in an action for recovery of damages resulting from personal injuries, if the action is based solely on the alleged tortious conduct of the servant, and he is, by a final judgment, acquitted of guilt of the tortious conduct alleged as a basis for the action, there can be no recovery thereafter against the master on the basis of such alleged cause of action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aex\"><em>Morton, </em>399 S.E.2d at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">In the tort context generally, numerous other decisions are to the same effect. <em>See, e.g., Roughton Pontiac Corp. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number><em>Alston, </em>236 Va. 152, 372 S.E.2d 147, 149-50 (1988)(reversing judgment against employer for conversion, because jury exonerated employee); <em>Gangl v.

Southern contends that Taha did not assert or establish that any employees of Southern, besides McGovern and Wylie-Forth, committed the tort of malicious prosecution while acting in the scope of employment. Rather, appellant argues that Taha\u2019s position at trial was that McGovern and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Wylie-Forth were the only employees who engaged in the allegedly tortious conduct. Southern explains in its reply brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-4\">Since the jury found that Wylie-Forth [and McGovern] did not commit malicious prosecution, an appropriate question is whether there is evidence in the record that <em>other [Southern] employees, </em>namely Udit and Martinez, maliciously instigated a criminal proceeding against him without probable cause and within the scope of their employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">[T]he jury could not base [Southern\u2019s] liability on the conduct of Udit and Martinez. The record is barren of any actionable evidence relating to these two employees which could form the factual predicate for the tort of malicious prosecution and, significantly, there is absolutely no evidence that it was within the scope of employment of Martinez and Udit to institute a criminal proceeding against Taha.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Southern adds: \u201cThe jury could not properly make a determination on scope of employment of Udit or Martinez, as Taha did not introduce evidence relating to any of the requirements set out by the Maryland Court of Appeals.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Taha counters that Southern is liable based on conduct of Southern employees, other than McGovern and Wylie-Forth. Accordingly, we must resolve whether appellee sought to hold Southern liable based on the conduct of other employees of Southern, such as Udit and Martinez and, if so, whether the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find against Southern based on the conduct of other Southern employees who were not sued. This, in turn, requires us to examine appellee\u2019s theory of the case and the evidence adduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">As we noted, in order for Southern to be liable based on the conduct of other employees, apart from McGovern and Wylie-Forth, Taha had to produce some evidence from which a jury could find that the other employees committed the tort of malicious prosecution while acting within the scope of employment. <em>See Tall, </em>120 Md.App. at 251, 706 A.2d 659. We first conclude that the jury was asked to decide whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Taha was the victim of malicious prosecution based only on the conduct of McGovern and Wylie-Forth. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">We are satisfied, based on the record, that appellee proceeded at trial on the theory that Southern was liable based on the conduct of McGovern and Wylie-Forth. In his opening statement, appellee\u2019s attorney stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">This is a very difficult case to comprehend as to what happens to a person when other people tell false things about you. I am not talking about liable [sic] or slander.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">I am talking about something that results in police coming to your house at night knocking on the door and saying, \u201cHello, is Mr. Taha here? We have reason to believe that you stole tools from Southern Management Corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">\n<em>The police got involved because Deborah Wylie-Forth and Mr. McGovern, I believe, made up this story to hurt Mr. Taha in any way they could, and it hurt.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">The jury instructions and the verdict sheet also demonstrate that appellee\u2019s claim against Southern was founded only on the conduct of McGovern and Wylie-Forth. As we noted, the court gave a brief supplemental instruction at appellee\u2019s request as to the tort liability of a corporation based on the conduct of its employees. There, it specifically mentioned Wylie-Forth and McGovern, and appellee never excepted or objected to the court\u2019s failure to broaden the instruction to cover other employees. Nor did Taha ask the court to expand the language in the special verdict form as it pertained to Southern, to make it clear that Southern\u2019s liability could rest on wrongdoing by any employee acting in the scope of employment. Based on the verdict sheet, it is quite likely that the jury believed that the only employees whose conduct it was to consider was that of Wylie-Forth and McGovern.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">The closing argument of Taha\u2019s lawyer is also probative. There, his counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>The Judge told you what the elements are which you need to come to in order to come to a verdict regarding malicious prosecution, and I think it is kind of common sense, you know. Somebody says you did a crime, and the police come and arrest you, and then the [case] gets dismissed, and there was no probable cause for their ever doing that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\">In this situation, that occurred, and it is very difficult to understand their arguments for me because if they really wanted to say, \u201cLook, we had probable cause for doing this,\u201d don\u2019t you think\u2014I mean don\u2019t you think that you would have brought the two witnesses who they say spoke to the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">The whole time they have been here they keep telling you, \u201cWe didn\u2019t do it.\u201d I mean, I put Deborah Wylie-Forth on in my case, which, as every attorney knows, you do not do that. The first words out of her mouth were \u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d... It is like you have been around some of the most seamy maybe side of human nature; that they would actually lie about a person to have the police come to their house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">The result of doing this, of their words to a police officer engaged this police officer in this act that ended up with him being handcuffed in front of his house, in front of his neighbors, his good name, in front of his wife, in front of his daughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">If you have the two or three witnesses, for God\u2019s sake, bring them. I mean you are here spending your time. Why can\u2019t we bring the people who actually saw these events? Where did they suddenly disappear to? All these things you have been considering.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">And then the issue of Mr. McGovern. Mr. McGovern said he had somebody type out my words. I think it is obvious that those were not his words, and you can look at the memorandum and again the accusations that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>stating against Mr. Taha, the accusations that he has committed criminal acts against his employer ... I thought he was trying to protect Southern Management Corporation ... [S]o that was very clear that he was getting his information from that man and from that woman regarding criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-4\">In rebuttal, appellee\u2019s counsel argued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And again, I told you that [appellant\u2019s counsel] would be saying, \u201cIt is Martinez, and it is Oudit.\u201d [sic] They are both employed at\u2014Ms. Oudit [sic] still works for them. She probably lives\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Your Honor, there is no evidence whatsoever to that fact at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">THE COURT: Argue the facts in evidence, if you would, Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: No evidence at ah on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApP\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: No reason was given for their not being here if they wanted them to show this, none, and again, he is arguing the people that you should be mad at, that you should vent your juror discretion at are unknown assailants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">Based on all of the foregoing, we conclude that appellee proceeded against Southern for the tort of malicious prosecution based only on the conduct of McGovern or Wylie-Forth, not other Southern employees who were not sued. Therefore, the jury was not asked to consider Southern\u2019s liability based on the conduct of other employees. We have scoured the record and cannot find any instance when Taha told the jury that Southern should be found liable based on the statements to Grims made by employees of Southern who were not sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">Even if appellee proceeded on the theory that, besides Wylie-Forth and McGovern, other Southern employees committed the tort, Taha would fare no better. This is because the evidence was not sufficient to establish wrongdoing by other corporate employees acting in the scope of employment. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Apart from the two employees who were sued and exonerated, IJdit and Martinez were the only other Southern employees who were mentioned at trial in regard to the malicious prosecution claim. In order for a jury to have found Southern liable based on the conduct of Martinez or Udit, Taha had to prove tortious conduct by at least one of them <em>and </em>that the acts were undertaken within the scope of employment. <em>Tall, </em>120 Md.App. at 251, 706 A.2d 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The conduct of an employee is considered within the scope of employment if the conduct furthers the business of the employer and is authorized by the employer. <em>Sawyer v. Humphries, </em>322 Md. 247, 255, 587 A.2d 467 (1991); <em>Lovelace, </em>126 Md.App. at 682, 730 A.2d 774; <em>Tall, </em>120 Md.App. at 251-52, 706 A.2d 659. As to scope of employment, the Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">\u201cTo be within the scope of the employment the conduct must be of the kind the servant is employed to perform and must occur during a period not unreasonably disconnected from the authorized period of employment in a locality not unreasonably distant from the authorized area, and actuated at least in part by a purpose to serve the master.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\"><em>Sawyer, </em>322 Md. at 255, 587 A.2d 467 (quoting <em>East Coast Freight Lines, Inc. v. City of Baltimore, </em>190 Md. 256, 285, 58 A.2d 290 (1948)).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Moreover, an act incident to the performance of the duties entrusted to the employee by the employer qualifies as \u201cauthorized conduct.\u201d <em>Tall, </em>120 Md.App. at 253, 706 A.2d 659. This is because \u201c \u2018the master holds out his servant as competent and fit to be trusted ... he in effect warrants his servant\u2019s fidelity and good conduct in all matters within the scope of his employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oaks v. Connors, supra, </em>339 Md. at 30, 660 A.2d 423 (quoting <em>Globe Indemnity Co. v. Victill Corp., </em>208 Md. 573, 580, 119 A.2d 423 (1956)). In contrast, an employee\u2019s actions are considered outside the scope of employment when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">an employee\u2019s actions are <em>personal, </em>or where they represent a departure from the purpose of furthering the employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>business, or where the employee is acting to protect his own interest, even if during normal duty hours and at an authorized locality....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><em>Sawyer, 322 </em>Md. at 256-57, 587 A.2d 467 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Proof that Martinez and Udit were employed by Southern is not enough to establish that their statements to Grims were made within the scope of employment. <em>See East Coast Lines, </em>190 Md. at 285, 58 A.2d 290; <em>Rusnack v. Giant Food, Inc., </em>26 Md.App. 250, 261-62, 337 A.2d 445 (1975). Yet, our review of the record does not reveal any evidence relating to the job duties of either Udit or Martinez. Although there was some testimony that Martinez was a maintenance worker, there was no testimony about his actual responsibilities. Rather, the limited evidence in the record relating to Martinez established that he was a Southern employee who helped to move the heavy barrel that fell on Taha. <em>See Terra Nova Ins. Co. v. Chillum Corp., </em>71 Md.App. 552, 557, 526 A.2d 642, <em>cert. denied, </em>311 Md. 22, 532 A.2d 168 (1987) (finding that theft was not the kind of conduct for which a supervisor/cashier was employed). As to Udit, there was no evidence at trial of her position, title, or job responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">In the light most favorable to Taha, Martinez reportedly told McGovern and Grims that he saw Taha shaking the lock of the maintenance shop while he was on disability. Martinez also told Grims that Taha had said he used to carry a handgun and had stabbed a person in New York City a few months ago. In the same light, the record reflects that Udit told Grims that she saw Taha enter Wylie-Forth\u2019s office while he was on disability. Moreover, Wylie-Forth testified that she allowed Grims to interview Southern\u2019s employees about the matter, explaining that, \u201cat that time, everyone was a suspect.\u201d But, Wylie-Forth\u2019s statement was not an authorization to the employees to give false accounts to the police as to who may have committed the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Moreover, the jury was not aware of the motives of Martinez and Udit in providing statements to the police about Taha\u2019s suspicious activity, and they conceivably could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>been acting to protect themselves. <em>See Sawyer, </em>322 Md. at 256-57, 587 A.2d 467 (holding that an employee was acting outside the scope of his employment because his actions were purely for personal reasons and not incidental to any purpose of his employer). Additionally, the jury had no evidence from which it could determine if their statements were made during a period reasonably connected with their employment. While Grims testified that he spoke to both Martinez and Udit, he did not indicate when or where he talked to them. Nor did the evidence indicate that either employee was at work at the time that he or she spoke to Grims.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Again, we acknowledge the confusion that may have arisen from the inadequate supplemental jury instruction and the verdict sheet, which may have caused the jury to believe that it was entitled to find against Southern even if it found in favor of the individual defendants. Nevertheless, even if the confusion stemmed from the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury fully with respect to respondeat superior,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the jury was not clearly advised that Southern\u2019s liability was predicated and dependent upon a finding of wrongdoing by its employees, appellee did not quarrel with the adequacy of the supplemental instruction. Nor did appellee complain about the wording of the verdict sheet with respect to Southern; he did not ask the court to frame the question in such a way as to predicate Southern\u2019s liability on the basis of the conduct of <em>any </em>of its employees acting in the scope of employment. In the end, we cannot overlook appellee\u2019s failure to preserve for our review an issue concerning the adequacy of the jury instructions or the verdict sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">We are also of the view that, notwithstanding any deficiencies in the instructions or verdict sheet, a retrial is not appropriate as to Southern, because appellee could not proceed against Southern based on the conduct of Wylie-Forth and McGovern. As we noted, Wylie-Forth and McGovern are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>no longer parties, because the jury found in their favor, and Taha did not cross-appeal. Therefore, the issue of their personal wrongdoing has been finally litigated, and principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel bar a retrial as to them. Because appellee elected to proceed against Southern based only on the conduct of those two employees, there would be no basis for a respondeat superior claim against Southern.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-11\">. We note that, in its brief, Southern has occasionally spelled the name of its employee as \"Debra Wiley-Forth.\u201d We have utilized the spelling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>provided by Wylie-Forth in an affidavit submitted by her in pre-trial proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b727-14\">. Appellee did not file a cross-appeal in connection with the jury's verdict in favor of the individual defendants. Therefore, they are not parties to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b728-7\">. Taha has not filed a cross-appeal regarding the dismissal of the other claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b731-9\">. In his brief, Taha notes that Southern served a subpoena on Udit but did not call her as a witness. The record does not reflect the unavailability of either Udit or Martinez, nor are we aware of any effort by Taha to call Udit or Martinez as witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b735-10\">. We cannot find in the record the exact text of the original verdict question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\">. As we discuss, <em>infra, </em>appellee proceeded at trial on the theory that Southern was liable based on the conduct of the two employees who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>were sued. In our view, that is a derivative claim against Southern, founded on the doctrine of respondeat superior. Moreover, Taha has not pointed us to any authority in support of the assertion that Southern may be held independently liable for the tort of malicious prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b755-7\">.
