Appellant concedes that the State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to prove that he committed this offense upon the twelve-year-old daughter of his former girlfriend, but he argues that he is entitled to a new trial because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ADMITTING [DURING APPELLANT\u2019S CROSS EXAMINATION] A CHILD ABUSE CONVICTION FOR PURPOSES OF IMPEACHMENT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">II. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ADMITTING A PRIOR STATEMENT BY [APPELLANT\u2019S FORMER GIRLFRIEND].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the crime of child abuse is inadmissible for purposes of impeachment. We shall therefore vacate the judgment of conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">The State presented evidence that appellant assaulted the victim on March 18, 2000, and assaulted the victim\u2019s mother on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the following day.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant testified that he did not do so. His trial counsel requested a pretrial <em>in limine </em>ruling that would prohibit the prosecutor from questioning appellant about his December 23, 1988 conviction for (\u201cphysical\u201d) child abuse. That motion was denied. Before appellant testified at trial, his trial counsel requested to \u201crevisit\u201d this issue, but the trial judge declined to do so, explaining that, \u201c[t]he issue on appeal will rise or fall on [the motions hearing judge\u2019s] decision.\u201d The following transpired at the conclusion of appellant\u2019s cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: ... [S]ince you\u2019ve been over the age of 18 years of age or since you have been an adult within the last 15 years, and you were either represented by an attorney or chose to represent yourself, have you ever been found guilty of a crime that would reflect upon your honesty such as theft, unauthorized use, false statement, or any major felonies, such as robbery, rape, or murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHJ\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Isn\u2019t it true, sir, that in 1998, specifically September 23, 1998, you were found guilty of child abuse, is that correct, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Excuse me, 1988. I apologize for that. Your Honor, at this time the State would motion to [sic] move into evidence as State\u2019s Exhibit No. 3, a true test copy of the [appellant\u2019s] conviction of child abuse, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Because appellant\u2019s trial counsel did not object to those questions, the State argues that appellant\u2019s \u201cimproper impeachment\u201d argument has not been preserved for our review. We disagree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record clearly shows that the defense did not acquiesce in the <em>in limine </em>ruling and, having raised the issue once again at an appropriate point during the trial, appellant\u2019s counsel was not required to interpose an objection at the precise instant that the improper question was asked. <em>Watson v. State, </em>311 Md. 370, 372-73 n. 1, 535 A.2d 455 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">It is well settled that Maryland Rule 5-609 requires that the trial court apply a three-part test to determine whether a prior conviction is admissible for the limited purpose of impeachment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The first step in that process presents a question of law: whether the crime under consideration is either \u201can infamous crime or other crime relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d In making this determination, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>must limit its focus to \u201cthe name of the crime.\u201d <em>Ricketts v. State, </em>291 Md. 701, 713, 436 A.2d 906 (1981). \u201cA trial court should never conduct a mini-trial by examining the circumstances underlying the prior conviction.\u201d <em>State v. Giddens, </em>335 Md. 205, 222, 642 A.2d 870 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Convictions for certain non-infamous crimes are excluded because they simply \u201cdo not bear on the witness\u2019 credibility.\u201d <em>Morales v. State, </em>325 Md. 330, 339, 600 A.2d 851 (1992); see <em>also Fulp v. State, </em>130 Md.App. 157, 166-67, 745 A.2d 438 (2000). Convictions for non-infamous crimes that <em>might </em>be relevant to a witness\u2019s credibility must also be excluded if the particular crime is \u201cdefined in a way that would cause the factfinder to speculate as to what conduct is impacting on the [witness\u2019s] credibility.\u201d <em>Ricketts, supra, </em>291 Md. at 713, 436 A.2d 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In Maryland, child abuse is a statutory felony proscribed by Maryland Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 35C (2000 Cum.Supp.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The State argues that, although \u201c[p]hysical child abuse may sometimes result from an outburst of temper,\u201d and although \u201cthe offense of child abuse as defined by Section 35C and Maryland case law encompasses various forms of misconduct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>virtually all of the misconduct is of a type having a tendency to establish that the witness lacks veracity.\u201d For purposes of impeachment, however, \u201csince the issue is always the truth of the witness, where there is no way to determine whether a crime affects the defendant\u2019s testimony simply by the name of the crime that crime should be inadmissible for purposes of impeachment.\u201d <em>Ricketts, supra, </em>291 Md. at 713, 436 A.2d 906. <em>See also Bells v. State, </em>134 Md.App. 299, 759 A.2d 1149 (2000), in which this Court concluded that <em>Ricketts </em>prohibited impeachment by \u201csanitized\u201d prior convictions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">Admitting sanitized prior felony convictions into evidence would render meaningless Maryland\u2019s long line of cases emphasizing the importance of admitting only those prior convictions that assist the fact finder in measuring a witness\u2019s credibility and veracity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-5\"><em>Id. at </em>309, 759 A.2d 1149. Proof that a person has been convicted of child abuse does not assist the fact finder in weighing that person\u2019s veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Proof of appellant\u2019s child abuse conviction also created the kind of potential for unfair prejudice found in <em>State v. Watson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>321 Md. 47, 580 A.2d 1067 (1990). In that case, the Court of Appeals agreed with this Court that a murder defendant was entitled to a new trial because the trial court should not have permitted the prosecutor to ask the defendant\u2019s character witnesses whether they were aware that the defendant had been convicted of \u201csecond-degree rape.\u201d Although the defendant had been convicted of that offense, the conviction was based on consensual sexual intercourse between the defendant and a thirteen-year-old girl. The Court of Appeals held that, under these circumstances, appellant\u2019s second-degree rape conviction \u201cwas irrelevant to [the defendant\u2019s] character witnesses\u2019 opinions of his character for peacefulness and nonviolence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59, 580 A.2d 1067. As was the situation in <em>Watson, </em>appellant was unfairly prejudiced by evidence that he had committed a crime that was irrelevant to the issue for which it was introduced. We are persuaded that, because the trial judge erred in permitting the State to question appellant about his 1988 conviction for child abuse, appellant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Appellant also argues that he was unfairly prejudiced when, during the direct examination of his former girlfriend, the State introduced into evidence a prior (consistent) written statement that she had given to an investigating officer. As a general rule, \u201canticipatory rehabilitation\u201d evidence should not be introduced during the witness\u2019s direct examination. In this case, however, the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement included the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">Now this case isn\u2019t perfect and I\u2019m going to tell you why it\u2019s not perfect. Subsequently, a week or so later the [appellant] and [the victim\u2019s mother] visit [sic] a social worker, Ms. Edges; she\u2019s here to testify. And during this discussion with Ms. Edges the Defense is going to bring out that [the victim\u2019s mother] tells Ms. Edges, oh, no, I lied; none of this happened; I made it all up. But she tells Ms. Edges she\u2019s lying, why? The [appellant] is sitting right next to her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Appellant\u2019s trial counsel did not object to those comments, and delivered an opening statement in which he characterized Ms. Edges as \u201can independent witness ... who has no emotional connection to this case,\u201d and previewed her testimony as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">[Sjhe\u2019s going to take the stand and she\u2019s going to tell you that on March 28th, ... that [the victim\u2019s mother] and [appellant] were together and that they came to her office together; they came and they sat down, and they spoke with her, and yes, [appellant] did bring up the charges against him, and that [the victim\u2019s mother] did admit at that time that she had lied to the police; that she had made up these charges ... And you\u2019ll get a full sense of how that meeting occurred with Ms. Edges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Under these circumstances, the trial court neither erred nor abused its discretion in admitting the witness\u2019s prior consistent statement during her direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">During the retrial of this case, if the opening statement of appellant\u2019s trial counsel predicts that jurors will receive evidence that would-when presented\u2014\u201copen the door\u201d to the introduction of the witness\u2019s prior consistent statement, the trial judge would have discretion under Md. Rule 5-611(a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to admit that statement during the witness\u2019s direct examination, <em>provided that </em>the trial judge finds that the statement \u201cdetracts from the [witness\u2019s] impeachment\u201d and is therefore admissible under Md. Rule 5-616(c)(2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR A NEW TRIAL; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\">. Two assault charges were submitted to the jury: (1) the March 18, 2000 assault that is at issue in this appeal, and (2) a March 19, 2000 assault upon appellant\u2019s former girlfriend. The jurors were unable to reach a unanimous verdict on the issue of whether appellant assaulted his former girlfriend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b228-6\">. The failure to object would have operated as a waiver with respect to the issues of whether (1) the prosecutor\u2019s first impeachment by conviction question was improper as to form, and (2) State\u2019s exhibit 3 should have been received into evidence after appellant admitted that he had been convicted. We are persuaded, however, that appellant was not required to preserve either of these issues in order to argue for a new trial on the ground that he should not have been questioned about the fact that he was convicted of child abuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b228-7\">.
