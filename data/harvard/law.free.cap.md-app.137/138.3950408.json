As a result of the accident, Diane DeSua, appellant, ultimately filed a negligence action against Scott Yokim, appellee,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeking \u201cthe amount of One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>($150,000.00) in compensatory damages plus interest and costs.\u201d Appellee filed a pretrial motion \u201cfor partial summary judgment\u201d on the ground that \u201cthe [appellant] has failed to designate any expert witness [and] pursuant to her Answers to Interrogatories, the [appellant] has represented that she does not intend to call any expert witnesses at trial.\u201d Appellant filed an opposition to that motion in which she stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">To put this matter in perspective, this case involves a relatively simple, rear-end accident. It is of the sort that does not justify huge expenses, including multiple medical experts ... [Appellant] asserts that under <em>[Vroom v. Arundel Gas Co., </em>262 Md. 657, 278 A.2d 563 (1971), and <em>Simco Sales v. Schweigman, </em>237 Md. 180, 205 A.2d 245 (1964) ], she will be able to meet her burden both as to the cause of her illness as well as the reasonableness of the medical expenses, without expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">At the conclusion of a hearing on appellee\u2019s motion, the Honorable Martha G. Kavanaugh announced the following conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">... [U]nder the case law I believe that you need an expert in a soft tissue injury to establish causation, and reasonableness, and fairness in the medical bills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">... I believe you do need an expert in the soft tissue injury to establish causation because there are many reasons why someone might have a neck injury besides a car accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">... [F]irst you would have to show that the accident caused the injuries, and then from the injuries you go to the pain and suffering and lost wages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Judge Kavanaugh entered summary judgment in favor of appellee, and appellant now presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">1. DID THE COURT COMMIT REVERSIBLE ERROR IN CONCLUDING AS A MATTER OF LAW THAT EXPERT TESTIMONY WAS NEEDED TO ESTABLISH THE REASONABLENESS AND NECESSITY <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>OF MEDICAL EXPENSES IN SOFT TISSUE INJURY CASES?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">2. DID THE COURT COMMIT REVERSIBLE ERROR IN CONCLUDING AS A MATTER OF LAW THAT EXPERT TESTIMONY WAS NEEDED TO ESTABLISH A CAUSAL CONNECTION BETWEEN DEFENDANT\u2019S NEGLIGENCE AND PLAINTIFF\u2019S INJURIES?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">For the reasons that follow, we shall answer \u201cno\u201d?to question one and \u201cnot in this case\u201d to question two. We shall, therefore, affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">The accident occurred after appellant had stopped her vehicle at a yield sign, and was waiting to turn right onto Interstate 370 from Fields Road. According to appellant, her vehicle was struck in the rear by the vehicle that appellee was driving, and she was \u201cthrown forwards and then backwards and suffered immediate pain in her neck.\u201d Appellant contends that as a result of her injuries, she incurred medical costs,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> endured pain and suffering, and missed a total of 186 hours from her job.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">The circuit court entered a Scheduling Order that required appellant to designate her expert witnesses by January 19, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>1999.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant did not designate expert witnesses. On May 27.1999, appellee filed a motion for partial summary judgment on grounds that appellant had not identified any witnesses who would offer expert testimony as to the fairness, reasonableness, and necessity of her medical bills. On July 8, 1999, the Honorable Ann S. Harrington denied the motion without prejudice, and ruled that appellee could seek such relief from the trial judge. On July 9, 1999, appellant filed a pre-trial statement in which she disclosed her intention to introduce her medical bills through billing managers employed by her health care providers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Trial was to commence before Judge Kavanaugh on October 25.1999. On the morning of trial, by way of motion in limine, appellee again presented the arguments previously made in support of his motion for partial summary judgment. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>stated above, Judge Kavanaugh concluded that appellant needed expert testimony to introduce her medical bills into evidence and to generate a jury question on the issue of causation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The following transpired during the summary judgment hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">[THE COURT:] ... this is a neck injury, a soft tissue injury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">[THE COURT:] How in the world are we supposed to know that it exists unless we have expert testimony about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL:] ... I don\u2019t think without an expert you can establish the predicate that you have to get to a jury on these issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">We are persuaded that Judge Kavanaugh was \u201clegally correct\u201d in concluding that appellant needed to provide expert testimony to introduce her medical bills.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cIn order for the amount paid or incurred for medical care to be admissible as evidence of special damages, there ordinarily must be evidence that the amounts are fair and reasonable.\u201d <em>See Shpigel v. White, </em>357 Md. 117, 128, 741 A.2d 1205 (1999). \u201cEvidence of the amount or payment of medical bills does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>establish the reasonable value of the services for which the bills were rendered or justify recovery therefor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kujawa v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>224 Md. 195, 208, 167 A.2d 96 (1961)).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">In <em>Thomas v. Owens, </em>28 Md.App. 442, 445, 346 A.2d 662 (1975), this Court held that a physician was qualified to testify as to the reasonableness of the charge by the Public Health Service Hospital.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant relies on <em>Simco Sales v. Schweigman, </em>237 Md. 180, 205 A.2d 245 (1964) for the proposition that the billing manager is competent to satisfy the \u201cother evidence\u201d requirement. <em>Schweigman </em>did hold that the Director of Admissions and Accounts at the Baltimore City Hospitals was competent to establish \u201cthe fair and reasonable value of hospital and surgical services provided to the [appellee] by the Baltimore City Hospitals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188-189, 205 A.2d 245. Appellant, however, was also required to prove that her medical treatments were \u201cnecessary.\u201d <em>Metropolitan Auto Sales v. Koneski, </em>252 Md. 145, 154, 249 A.2d 141 (1969). While a billing manager is competent to establish that a particular bill is fair and reasonable by comparing what other hospitals charge for a particular procedure, a billing manager\u2019s familiarity with the customary charge for services afforded to a patient does not make such a witness competent to explain why the patient\u2019s physician chose a particular type of treatment. Thus, where the issue of <em>necessity </em>is raised, the plaintiff cannot introduce medical bills through a billing manager.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s use of the billing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>manager to establish the <em>necessity </em>for her medical bills does not satisfy that essential foundational requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Appellant also contends that Judge Kavanaugh erred in concluding that, as a matter law, expert testimony was needed to establish a causal connection between appellee\u2019s negligence and appellant\u2019s injuries. The following transpired at the summary judgment hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] ... This Court can find that because we will present that the injury occurred immediately, that prior to the accident she had no neck pain, she was free of injury; immediately at the time of the accident she started experiencing pain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">We are not proving it was ileitis or paralyzed finger, anything that would cause a doctor to come in and explain why these symptoms were occurring. It is a neck injury that many persons in their common experience can experience or have known others to experience by virtue of a rear-end car collision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">[THE COURT:] But you can have it from arthritis, you can have it from age\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] She will testify she does not have arthritis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">[THE COURT:] Well she\u2014how does she know because arthritis starts when you are young and it becomes worse as you grow older; you might not have any symptoms for a while.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] That could be argued by Mr. Sullivan in closing. That fact that he didn\u2019t get his own expert is his decision. Nothing stopped him from getting an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>expert to contest what we are going to say happened, and how she felt afterwards; that is clearly within her ability. The subjectiveness is something the jury is to decide at the time that they get this case, and that is why Judge Harrington denied it originally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">[THE COURT:] What about causation? How in the world would you establish causation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Causation is what we just argued under Wilhelm. We have the opportunity to prove: A) That the immediate\u2014should have the opportunity to prove\u2014that the injury was immediately. Also that it was within the common experience of the jurors to find that that sort of sprain can occur after an accident, and the subjectivity issue is one that goes to the jury as to whether they believe she has the pain or not; that is within their realm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsT\">[THE COURT:] All right. Well, I have a different take on the Wilhelm, the Craig, the Vroom, and the Craft cases, and for that reason, I believe you do need an expert in the soft tissue injury to establish causation because there are many reasons why someone might have a neck injury besides a car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">In <em>Wilhelm v. State Traffic Safety Comm., </em>230 Md. 91, 185 A.2d 715 (1962), the Court of Appeals stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVi\">[t]here are, unquestionably, many occasions where the causal connection between a defendant\u2019s negligence and a disability claimed by a plaintiff does not need to be established by expert testimony. Particularly is this true when the disability develops coincidentally with, or within a reasonable time after, the negligent act, or where the causal connection is clearly apparent from the illness itself and the circumstances surrounding it, or where the cause of the injury relates to matters of common experience, knowledge, or observation of laymen.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 99, 185 A.2d 715.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court held, however, that \u201cexpert testimony was required in order to establish a causal nexus between a motor vehicle collision\u201d and \u201cemotional disturbances in [the plaintiff] sufficient to evoke, subconsciously, grossly exaggerated symptoms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101, 185 A.2d 715. In <em>S.B. Thomas, Inc. v. Thompson, </em>114 Md.App. 357, 689 A.2d 1301 (1997), this Court noted that case law on this issue is very fact specific, and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\">[a] genuine jury issue as to the causal relationship between an earlier injury and a subsequent trauma may sometimes be generated, even in the absence of expert [medical] testimony, when some combination of the following circumstances is present: 1) a very close temporal relationship between the initial injury and the onset of the trauma; 2) the manifestation of the trauma in precisely the same part of the body that received the impact of the initial injury; 3) as in <em>Schweitzer v. Showed, </em>[19 Md.App. 537, 313 A.2d 97 (1974),] some medical testimony, albeit falling short of a certain diagnosis; and 4) an obvious cause-and-effect relationship that is within the common knowledge of laymen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 381-82, 689 A.2d 1301. <em>See also American Airlines v. Stokes, </em>120 Md.App. 350 at 355-357, 707 A.2d 412 (1998), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>Hunt v. Mercy Medical, </em>121 Md.App. 516 at 538-542, 710 A.2d 362 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">We agree with Judge Kavanaugh that the cause-and-effect relationship in this particular case is not obvious enough to be considered \u201cwithin the common knowledge of laymen.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Here, appellant claims that she was \u201cthrown forwards and backwards\u201d as a result of what she described as \u201ca relatively simple, rear-end accident\u201d that \u201cis of the sort that does not justify huge expenses.\u201d Yet, she is seeking \u201cOne Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000.00) in compensatory damages plus interest and costs.\u201d Because of (1) the disparity between the damage to appellant\u2019s vehicle and the amount of her personal injury claim,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and (2) the amount of time between her emergency room visit and her appointment with a treating physician,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the question of causal connection that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>presented by the facts of this case cannot be submitted to the jury in the absence of expert testimony.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We agree with appellee\u2019s contention that in the absence of expert testimony \u201ca jury is left to sheer speculation!]\u201d Given the circumstances in this case, expert testimony is required to show causation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, Judge Kavanaugh was legally correct in her conclusion that, without expert testimony,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> appellant could not generate a jury question on the issue of whether the pain and suffering damages being sought were caused by the September 9, 1993 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-15\">. Appellant\u2019s complaint was filed on September 9, 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b165-11\">. Shortly after the accident, appellant went to the Shady Grove Adventist Hospital. She was treated by Dr. Frank Seinsheimer of the Greater Washington Orthopaedic Center for a cervical strain. Appellee contends that although appellant initially sought treatment at the Shady Grove Hospital on the date of the occurrence, her next visit to a health care provider was not until eighteen (18) days later. It was at that time that appellant saw Dr. Frank Seinsheimer, M.D. with the Greater Washington Orthopaedic Group. Appellee indicates that appellant had approximately twenty (20) subsequent visits with Dr. Seinsheimer through February 24, 1994. Appellant\u2019s medical bills totaled $2,777.49, plus $47.19 in prescriptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b165-14\">.

Plaintiff has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that she sustained physical injury and that said injury was proximately caused by Defendant's negligence. (Instruction defining proximate cause.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">It is not necessary that the existence of physical injury and the source of its cause be proved by expert medical testimony. When the disability develops at the same time as, or within a reasonable time after, the negligent act, expert medical testimony is not needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-12\">In addition, where the connection between the negligent act and the injury is clearly apparent from the illness itself and the circumstances surrounding it, expert medical testimony is not needed. Further, where the cause of the injury relates to matters of common experience, knowledge, or observation of laymen, expert medical testimony is not needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-13\"><em>Vroom v.

Summary Judgment is appropriate when there is no dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2\u2014501(e). We review the issue of whether Judge Kavanaugh was \u201clegally correct.\u201d <em>Pittman v.

Owens, plaintiff-appellee, had consulted Dr. Stuart H. Brager for an examination and evaluation. At trial, Dr. Brager testified over objection that the bill from the Public Health Service Hospital was, according to Baltimore City medical standards, fair and reasonable for the hospital visits and treatments. The plaintiff-appellee then offered into evidence the bill because Dr. Brager's testimony furnished independent evidence that the charge set forth was reasonable. The trial court admitted the bill into evidence over defendant-appellant's hearsay objection, and this Court affirmed. <em>See Thomas, </em>28 Md.App. at 444-45, 346 A.2d 662.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b168-7\">.

Although the Court of Appeals concedes this point, it quickly supports its holding, stating \"where the cause of injury claimed to have resulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>from a negligent act is a complicated medical question involving fact finding which properly falls within the province of medical experts (especially when the symptoms of the injury are purely subjective in nature, or where disability does not develop until some time after the negligent act), proof of the cause must be made by such witnesses.\u201d <em>Wilhelm </em>at 100, 185 A.2d 715.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b171-7\">. <em>Cf.
