THIEME, Jr., Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ABx\">Ret\u2019d, Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">Appellant John M. Churchfield was convicted of child abuse, Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27 \u00a7 35C, by a jury in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County. The court imposed a fifteen-year sentence, suspending all but seven and one-half years. Churchfield noted a timely appeal and asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>1. Did the court below err when it restricted cross-examination by excluding certain information about the complainant\u2019s sexual activities?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">2. Did the court below err when it limited the defense\u2019s cross-examination of the social worker who interviewed appellant to exclude certain statements he made shortly before he was arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">3. Did the court below err when it admitted into evidence statements made by appellant in reaction to his arrest?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">We answer \u201cyes\u201d to the first question and \u201cno\u201d to the second and third questions and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Christina Churchfield, age fifteen at the time of the trial, started living with appellant, her father, in December 1996, when her mother, a drug addict who had custody of Christina in Florida, surrendered parental rights. At the time, she was ten years of age. Christina\u2019s two brothers, two sisters, and stepmother lived in the family home with Christina and appellant and, at times, other family members would stay there \u201clong term.\u201d During one of these times, Christina, who was twelve years of age, became pregnant with the child of her adult half-brother, William Churchfield. After appellant turned his son in, William pleaded guilty to second degree rape and incest, and he is now serving his sentence. Christina gave birth to a daughter on December 2, 1998. She testified that she continued to live with her father after the baby was bom, and her parents forced her to place the child for adoption with a relative in a distant state.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">Christina testified that appellant\u2019s behavior toward her became more and more sexual over time. Inappropriate contact between father and daughter began with wrestling, gradually became touching, and culminated, in January or February of 1999, with vaginal intercourse. The first incident of intercourse occurred while Christina and her father were watching television in the parents\u2019 upstairs bedroom while the other children were asleep and Mrs. Churchfield was working. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Christina testified that she and her father had intercourse on more than one occasion, but she could not say how many times it happened. She recalled that the last incident took place during the first week of January 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Christina ran away from home on February 4, 2000. A boy she was dating, Randy Van Hook, met Christina at a Food Lion near her home during the early morning hours and took her to his home. Once she arrived, Christina told Randy\u2019s mother that her father had been abusing her, and Mrs. Van Hook called the authorities. A detective and representative of the Department of Social Services interviewed Christina at the Van Hook home later that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Jody Holland of the Department of Social Services investigated the allegations against appellant, and she was present when he was arrested on February 7. Ms. Holland testified that, when appellant was handcuffed, he said, referring to Christina, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of that bitch when this is over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Ashley Churchfield, Christina\u2019s twelve-year-old half-sister, testified that she was not aware of any unusual activities between her sister and her father. Cora Webster, appellant\u2019s mother-in-law, testified that she had lived in the Churchfield home from February 1999 until October 1999 and, likewise, was unaware of any unusual relationship between or inappropriate activities involving father and daughter. She also confirmed that Christina never complained to her about any inappropriate contact or play.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Melissa Churchfield, Christina\u2019s stepmother, testified that she had been married to appellant for thirteen years. She also averred that she had not observed any inappropriate contact between her husband and stepdaughter. To the contrary, Mrs. Churchfield opined that Christina could be deceitful and manipulative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-8\">Sometimes she can tell you what she wants to tell you, you know, to get you to believe what she wants. Sometimes she\u2019s truthful, sometimes she is not, you just got to know how she is and her personality to work your way around her sometimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>On the evening before Christina left, Mrs. Churchfield testified, the girl asked her parents if she could spend the weekend with a friend named Nicky. The Churchfields refused to let her go, because they did not know Nicky or her parents. In fact, the Churchfields \u201chad never heard Nicky\u2019s name,\u201d and Christina refused to offer an address or a phone number. Mrs. Churchfield testified that Christina \u201cgot mad, slammed her bedroom door, and stayed in there the rest of the night.\u201d At 4:00 a.m., she checked Christina\u2019s room and found that the girl had left the house. She and appellant also found a note, stating, in part, \u201cYou won\u2019t let me grow up so I am going to do it myself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Appellant testified that he did not have sexual relations with his daughter. He denied ever touching her inappropriately. Appellant, moreover, testified to ongoing conflict with his daughter during the six months preceding the allegations, including clashes with Christina over boys and dating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">Q: Did you have any type of conflicts, ongoing conflicts with her over any reason?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">A: A lot. We had quite a few of them, I mean, the way she dresses and makeup. I didn\u2019t believe in wearing makeup or fingernail polish or things like that, and we had big clashes over things like that....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">Q: Did you have any other types of conflicts with Christina?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">A: With the two boys, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-9\">Q: Could you tell the jury, please, what the nature of that conflict was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-10\">A: Well, she was\u2014more or less both boys were more or less trying to see her and all. And we told her she could not see these boys anymore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-11\">Q: Why did you tell her that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-12\">A: Because we felt the boys were playing her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-13\">Q: What exactly do you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-14\">A: Both the boys we figured was after one thing from her. We were trying to protect her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Q: Did you have any reason for thinking that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">A: Well, she used to brag about having sexual intercourse\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">[THE COURT]: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">Q: Mr. Churchfield, what was Christina\u2019s reaction when you made it clear to her that you didn\u2019t want her to see these boys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-9\">A: She was upset about it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">Appellant also corroborated his wife\u2019s testimony about the night before Christina ran away. As for his remarks to Jody Holland as he was being arrested, appellant explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-11\">Q: There\u2019s been testimony that you when you were placed under arrest you said I\u2019ll fix that bitch when this is over with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-12\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-13\">Q: Did you say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-14\">A: Yes, sir, I was very upset for being arrested for something I hadn\u2019t done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-15\">Q: What did you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-16\">A: It was just a phrase. I mean, she had done so many things in the past, it was just one more thing she had done, you know. I was more majorly upset about it because I have never been arrested before.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-17\">Additional facts will be supplied, as needed, in the discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-18\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b700-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b700-20\">Evidence of the ongoing conflict between appellant and his daughter was pivotal to the defense strategy in the case <em>sub judiee. </em>Appellant contends that Christina falsely accused him of having sexual intercourse with her because, tired of his restrictions on her activities, she wanted him out of her way. She found him to be overly protective, particularly concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>her budding interest in young men and her desire to present herself as though she were an adult woman. Based upon her earlier experience with her half-brother, Christina knew that social workers and police officers take seriously accusations of sexual abuse. Thus, in order to rid herself of her meddling father\u2014the defense hoped jurors would infer\u2014Christina fabricated a story of abuse. Defense counsel managed to elicit at least some evidence to support his theory; however, when he sought to examine Christina and other witnesses regarding key areas of the family conflict, the State objected, and the court upheld those objections. In finding that the desired testimony, which related to the nature of Christina\u2019s relationships with her two boyfriends, was irrelevant and prejudicial, the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The conflict between father and daughter centered around whether Christina was sexually active with two male schoolmates, as her parents reasonably suspected. Before trial, the prosecution moved to limit Christina\u2019s testimony regarding her prior sexual relationships pursuant to the Rape Shield Statute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which applied for one of the original charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>three of four original charges were <em>nol prossed, </em>and the State decided to try appellant on the child abuse charge alone, the court determined the admissibility of such evidence, and the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-4\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Judge, it\u2019s my understanding from Mr. Churchfield that the argument about Christina\u2019s contact with these two boys had been ongoing for at least a week prior to her running away. The running away occurred the morning Friday, February 4, 2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">THE COURT: I\u2019m sorry, Friday\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Friday, February 4, 2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">The complaint, as reflected in the Social Services records, the first complaint of sexual abuse occurred sometime during the day of Thursday, February 3, 2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">But I would proffer that the argument about her conduct with these two boys having sexual contact with them at the same time occurred for about a week prior to that. It is also my understanding that on the 4th, the 3rd or the 4th she wanted to go spend the night at the friend\u2019s house, the parents, Mr. and Mrs. Churchfield, were not willing to let her. So for that reason that appeared to be the catalyst that caused her to run away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-9\">Judge, I make that proffer again with the understanding that I don\u2019t believe the Rape Shield Statute applies any longer. I just leave that with the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-10\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-11\">PROSECUTOR: Well, Your Honor, as I stated before, even though the Rape Shield Statute doesn\u2019t apply, the arguments of probative versus prejudicial always applies as does relevancy. And I think that saying they are arguing about her being sexually active with two boys, there\u2019s no way for a father to know if that is true or not. It is highly prejudicial, it\u2019s trying to make the victim look like some promiscuous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>tramp, in light of the fact that it\u2019s a sexual allegation that we have here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">And so I think that even if it were true, I think it would be highly prejudicial. But that\u2019s even saying it\u2019s true, which I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any basis for believing that it is. It\u2019s a very convenient argument and I think it\u2019s going to do nothing but sway the jury to look at the victim in a very unfavorable light.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">I don\u2019t see there\u2019s any reason why it couldn\u2019t be said that he was arguing with Christina, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s some way to qualify what they were arguing and I think she would admit that they had a very bad relationship from the beginning. But without bringing out the sexual aspects of it along those lines. I think that would be\u2014it really doesn\u2019t matter what they were arguing over, it\u2019s the fact that they were arguing is what their defense would be. She\u2019s mad because they are arguing and she\u2019s going to get him in trouble. So that would be my response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">THE COURT: All right. Why wouldn\u2019t limiting testimony simply to the fact that there was an ongoing argument between them about her relationships with others?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">DEFENDANT: But the boys\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Shh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-10\">Judge, I think the jury needs to see the whole picture. I mean, obviously [the prosecutor] makes the argument prejudicial versus probative. I think that is misplaced because typically the standard is whether it prejudices the defense. I guess [the prosecutor\u2019s] argument is that it somehow prejudices her victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-11\">The jury needs to see the whole picture of what\u2019s going on here. The girl is aware of what happens when she says rape by prior experience. She has an argument with her father about her conduct with boys, wants to spend the night out of the house, the father won\u2019t let her so she runs away and makes this allegation. I think the jury needs to see the whole picture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>THE COURT: Well, assuming all that is true, what\u2019s the father in a position to do rather than speculate as to the nature of her relationship with the boys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Judge, I think the parents knew there was sexual activity. I mean, I don\u2019t think there was any question about that. I don\u2019t believe there was speculation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">THE COURT: What\u2019s your proffer about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: That the parents were aware.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">Is that accurate? You were aware there was a sexual relationship going on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-9\">DEFENDANT: Yes, on the phone from the boys. DEFENSE COUNSEL: The parents have provided me with a letter from one of them in which the boy says that I know you\u2019re also having sex with the other boy. PROSECUTOR: What does that have to do with the price of tea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-10\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-11\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Well, it makes the parents aware of what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s obviously a struggle that\u2019s going on within the family at that point. The father says you can\u2019t go out, and this is our theory, this is how the child reacts by making this allegation against the father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-12\">There\u2019s also testimony which I intended to introduce today that the girl made the statement to her sister saying once daddy\u2019s arrested I\u2019m going to go live with Garrett\u2019s family, Garrett being one of the two boys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-13\">THE COURT: Well, it seems to me that you can get in everything that you want to get in in terms of the rocky nature of the relationship without, you know, the fact that maybe they got a copy of a letter from a boy to her. I don\u2019t know why that would be admissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-14\">If you want to show the nature of the relationship, the rocky nature of the relationship, and the fact that they are arguing about whether she can go stay at a boy\u2019s house, all of that seems to be appropriate, but you really haven\u2019t told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>me anything that would indicate that the father has any knowledge, other than based on inadmissible sources or speculation as to the true nature of her relationship with these other boys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-4\">And consequently it seems to me that that would not be admissible based on what you have told me in our proffer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab3\">All right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\">Okay. Are you ready for the jury?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">During Christina\u2019s cross-examination, the defense sought to elicit testimony relevant to the conflict between the girl and her father, but the court suppressed it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">Q: What was your relationship with Mr. Mancuso [one of Christina\u2019s two alleged boyfriends]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-9\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, Judge, I think the jury is entitled to know how close they were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-11\">THE COURT: I think she said he was a close friend. [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, may I, Your Honor, pursue this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-12\">THE COURT: No, I sustained the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you, in fact, have a romantic relationship with Mr. Mancuso?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-15\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-16\">As his cross-examination of Christina ended, defense counsel again proffered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-17\">And also I\u2019d like to ask her about the level of her involvement, her romantic involvement with Mr. Van Hook and Mr. Mancuso. And it\u2019s my understanding that you have ordered me not to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-18\">THE COURT: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-19\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-20\">By withholding from the jury Christina\u2019s own testimony on these matters, and presumably the testimony of the two boys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>as well, the court denied jurors the opportunity to judge for themselves Christina\u2019s credibility, especially about her sexual activities, and the extent to which she would go to evade parental restrictions in that area. Likewise, it denied jurors the chance to evaluate appellant\u2019s credibility regarding his claims about his daughter\u2019s motives.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, we recognize that the court has broad discretion in the conduct of trials, and we will not disturb that exercise of discretion unless the court has clearly abused it. <em>State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 277, 604 A.2d 489 (1992). \u201cGenerally speaking, the scope of examination of witnesses at trial is left largely to the discretion of the trial judge and no error will be recognized unless there is a clear abuse of such discretion.\u201d <em>Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 669, 612 A.2d 258 (1992); <em>see also White v. State, </em>324 Md. 626, 637, 598 A.2d 187 (1991) (determinations on relevance will not be reversed absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion). Yet, the discretion we afford the trial court is hardly unlimited, and the most powerful delimiters of \u201cthe trial court\u2019s discretion are the constitutional ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">In <em>Marshall v. State, </em>346 Md. 186, 192-99, 695 A.2d 184 (1997), the Court of Appeals examined at length the tension between the trial court\u2019s discretion to limit cross-examination and the constitutional strictures guaranteeing a fair trial. The right of the accused to impeach witnesses against him by cross-examination, the Court explained, has its roots in the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and likewise in Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 192, 695 A.2d 184. The right to be faced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>one\u2019s accusers exceeds the sparely worded guarantee expressed by the Confrontation Clause. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 315, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 1110, 39 L.Ed.2d 347, 353 (1974)). It encompasses, in addition, the right to attack that accuser\u2019s credibility in court \u201c \u2018by means of cross-examination directed toward revealing possible biases, prejudices, or ulterior motives of the witness as they may relate directly to issues or personalities in the case at hand.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Davis, </em>415 U.S. at 316, 94 S.Ct. at 1110, 39 L.Ed.2d at 354); <em>see also Ebb v. State, </em>341 Md. 578, 587, 671 A.2d 974 (1996). Indeed, as the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Davis </em>and our colleagues reiterated in <em>Marshall, </em>\u201c \u2018the exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of cross-examination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marshall, </em>346 Md. at 192-93, 695 A.2d 184 (quoting <em>Davis, </em>415 U.S. at 316-17, 94 S.Ct. at 1110, 39 L.Ed.2d at 354); <em>see also Smallwood v. State, </em>320 Md. 300, 306, 577 A.2d 356 (1990). In his treatise on Maryland\u2019s law of evidence, the Chief Judge of this Court observed that such cross-examination of witnesses is \u201cthe most important impeachment technique because \u2018even an untruthful man will not usually lie without a motive.\u2019 \u201d Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook </em>\u00a7 1302(E) (2d ed.1993) (quoting <em>Gates v. Kelley, </em>15 N.D. 639, 110 N.W. 770, 773 (1907)), <em>quoted in Marshall, </em>346 Md. at 193, 695 A.2d 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">To be sure, the right of cross-examination may be limited by the trial court. <em>Marshall, </em>346 at 193, 695 A.2d 184 (citing <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1435, 89 L.Ed.2d 674, 683 (1986); <em>Smallwood, </em>320 Md. at 307, 577 A.2d 356). The trial court, for example, may \u201cimpose reasonable limits on cross-examination to protect witness safety or to prevent harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, or inquiry that is repetitive or marginally relevant,\u201d <em>id., </em>especially as collateral matters are concerned. <em>Smallwood, </em>320 Md. at 308, 577 A.2d 356. Such limits, however, may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>trample the constitutional rights of the accused, and the trial court\u2019s discretion begins only after \u201c \u2018constitutionally required threshold level of inquiry has been afforded the defendant\u2019 to satisfy the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Marshall, </em>346 Md. at 193, 695 A.2d 184 (citing cases including <em>Smallwood, </em>320 Md. at 307, 577 A.2d 356; <em>Brown v. State, </em>74 Md.App. 414, 419, 538 A.2d 317 (1988)). The Sixth Amendment requires that the defense be \u201c \u2018permitted to expose the jury to the facts from which jurors, as the sole triers of fact and of credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Davis, </em>415 U.S. at 318, 94 S.Ct. at 1111, 39 L.Ed.2d at 355; <em>United States v. Restivo, 8 </em>F.3d 274, 278 (5th Cir.1993)). To determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in limiting the cross-examination of the State\u2019s witnesses, \u201c \u2018the test is whether the jury was already in possession of sufficient information to make a discriminating appraisal of the particular witness\u2019s possible motives for testifying falsely in favor of the government.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Christian, </em>786 F.2d 203, 213 (6th Cir.1986)); <em>see also Smallwood, </em>320 Md. at 307, 577 A.2d 356 (\u201cone should be allowed to cross-examine in order to determine the reasons for acts or statements referred to on direct examination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Expounding upon the latter point, appellant points to <em>Small-wood, </em>in which the trial court refused to allow cross-examination of a -witness, defendant Smallwood\u2019s former girlfriend, Lomax, as to the outcome of two separate assault charges that she had filed against him. Smallwood was convicted of robbery after Lomax testified that she had regularly loaned him her car, which was used during the crime, and that Smallwood had given her some of the stolen merchandise. <em>Smallwood, </em>320 Md. at 302, 577 A.2d 356. The trial court allowed questioning of Lomax regarding the assault charges, but prohibited testimony regarding Smallwood\u2019s acquittal for those charges. The court reasoned that the <em>disposition </em>of charges was irrelevant to his guilt or innocence of the robbery charges and only the <em>filing </em>of charges went to the witness\u2019s prejudice. The Court of Appeals reversed, reasoning that Smallwood had successfully demonstrated that Lomax could have been \u201cusing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>this opportunity to finally punish him for what she felt were unpunished wrongs committed against her in the past.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309, 577 A.2d 356. Quoting from our opinion in <em>Brown, </em>74 Md.App. at 420-21, 538 A.2d 317, Judge Cole wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\">For purposes of cross-examination of a prosecution witness <em>in order to show bias or motive,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">[T]he crux of the inquiry insofar as its relevance is concerned, is the witness\u2019s state of mind. What is essential to the preservation of the right to cross-examine is that the interrogator be permitted to probe into whether the witness is acting under a hope or belief of leniency or reward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">To the last sentence in the quote we would add \u201cor out of spite or vindictiveness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">In addition, the form and nature of the questions asked by Petitioner were entirely proper. In <em>[State v.] Cox[, </em>298 Md. 173, [184,] 468 A.2d 319 (1983) ], we concluded</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8N\">that the inquiry had substantial probative force and there was no indication that defense counsel was harassing the witness by asking an unfounded question or seeking primarily to embarrass the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">\n<em>The same holds true for the questions in the instant case which went to the \u201cvery heart\u201d of Ms. Lomax\u2019s bias.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQh\"><em>Smallwood, </em>320 Md. at 309-10, 577 A.2d 356 (citations omitted) (second emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">Here, the State would support the trial court\u2019s view that sufficient information establishing a struggle between Christina and her father is already present in the record and that appellant\u2019s efforts to elicit testimony regarding Christina\u2019s sexual activities \u201cstray into collateral matters.\u201d <em>Smallwood, </em>320 Md. at 308, 577 A.2d 356. The <em>fact </em>of antagonism between father and daughter, the State argues, was relevant and probative of Christina\u2019s motive; the <em>source </em>of antagonism, it avers, was not. The State dismisses the concerns raised by the <em>Smallwood </em>Court\u2014that the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>should be made aware when the testifying witness might be acting \u201cout of spite or vindictiveness\u201d\u2014by claiming that Churchfield <em>had </em>been given</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-4\">ample opportunity to develop whether the victim had an ulterior motive in accusing him of abusing her.... Defense counsel elicited from the victim that she was angry at her father for making her give away her baby, and that she had been upset the night before she made her accusation against him over his decision not to allow her to spend the night at a friend\u2019s house. Defense counsel also extensively questioned the victim\u2019s stepmother and Churchfield himself about various conflicts between Churchfield and the victim. Notably, Churchfield testified that the victim was angry at him because he had forbidden her to date two boys whom he believed were \u201cafter one thing from her.\u201d Thus, the defense accomplished its objective of establishing an \u201congoing argument\u201d between Churchfield and his daughter regarding her involvement -with two boys, without the gratuitous reference to sexual activity, (citations omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Likewise, in <em>Smallwood, </em>the trial court allowed testimony that Lomax had filed assault charges against the defendant but refused to allow testimony about his acquittal. If the testimony Lomax should have been allowed to give, regarding alleged crimes that were unrelated to the issues before the court, \u201cwent to the \u2018very heart\u2019 of [her] bias,\u201d the suppressed testimony in the instant case strikes at the heart of Christina\u2019s bias as well. It is more likely than the testimony suppressed in <em>Smallwood </em>to show her motive or bias. At its very roots, the case <em>sub judice </em>is <em>about </em>sexual activity, as was the conflict between father and daughter. The evidence, in its most condensed form, comprises Christina\u2019s allegations, including what she told boyfriends, another parent, and investigators, against the word of her father. If the defense had been allowed to explore the full panoply of issues related to Christina\u2019s relationships with the two boyfriends and her running disagreement with her father, the jury may have been able to assess more readily whether she had a propensity to lie about sex. For this reason, the suppressed line of ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>tioning was relevant under the standard of Md. Rule 5-401,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the trial court erred in finding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The State also argues that, even if the evidence were relevant, its probative value would be outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice, and, thus, it would be inadmissible under Md. Rule 5-403.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As with the determination for relevance, the trial court enjoys broad discretion over the admission or exclusion of evidence and the scope of cross-examination when it determines that the proffered testimony presents \u201cthe possibility of embarrassment to or harassment of the witness and the possibility of undue delay or confusion of the issues,\u201d <em>Ebb v. State, </em>341 Md. 578, 588, 671 A.2d 974 (1996), especially if that testimony is only marginally relevant. <em>Id. </em>at 590, 671 A.2d 974; <em>see also Marshall, </em>346 Md. at 193, 695 A.2d 184 (\u201cThe trial judge retains discretion to impose reasonable limits on cross-examination to protect witness safety or to prevent harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, or inquiry that is repetitive or marginally relevant.\u201d) (citing <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 679, 106 S.Ct. at 1435, 89 L.Ed.2d at 683; <em>Smallwood, </em>320 Md. at 307, 577 A.2d 356). The State contends that \u201c[t]he only apparent purpose for offering the evidence was to create in the jury\u2019s minds a distasteful impression of a fifteen-year-old victim by portraying her as sexually precocious,\u201d and the inflammatory nature of the testimony would have outweighed its probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">We disagree, and we hold that the trial court clearly abused its discretion. For the reasons set forth <em>supra, </em>the suppressed testimony was more than marginally relevant and</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>goes to the heart of the accusations against appellant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We acknowledge that Christina and perhaps other witnesses, such as any former boyfriends called to testify, will likely find this line of questioning embarrassing. We also acknowledge that Christina has already suffered greatly in her fifteen years, especially at the hands of adults who should have protected her. Nevertheless, appellant has proffered more than a scintilla of proof that his daughter\u2019s charges are motivated not by actual events but instead by her desire to evade parental supervision. His reputation and, indeed, his liberty, and not that of his daughter, hang in the balance, and he should be allowed to impeach fully her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Having concluded that the court below erred when it restricted questioning as to Christina\u2019s sexual behavior, we now determine whether such error was harmful beyond a reasonable doubt, \u201c \u2018assuming that the damaging potential of the cross-examination [was] fully realized.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smallwood, </em>320 Md. at 308, 577 A.2d 356 (quoting <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 682, 106 S.Ct. at 1437, 89 L.Ed.2d at 685). We consider an error to be harmless if we are \u201c \u2018satisfied that there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of\u2014whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smallwood, </em>320 Md. at 308, 577 A.2d 356 (quoting <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Here, we cannot be sure that the jury would have reached the same verdict had the defense been allowed to tell the entire story regarding the conflict between Christina and her father. Although the court below allowed questioning about family discord that skirted the edge of prohibited subject matter, the proffered cross-examination addressed subject matter at the heart of the accusations. In this case, moreover, the State presented no physical or collateral evidence that abuse had occurred. The case against appellant boiled down to the word of the accuser against that of the accused. Appellant has offered significant evidence that his accuser had motive to lie, and exclusion of that evidence could reasonably have contributed to the guilty verdict. We thus reverse that verdict and remand to the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Appellant also contends that the court erred by prohibiting the defense from introducing more of the comments he made to a social worker, Jody Holland, who was present at the time he was arrested. Holland testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">Q: Ms. Holland, did you have occasion to interview this Defendant, John Churchfield? ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-9\">A: He was interviewed on February the 7th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-10\">Q: And where did that interview take place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-11\">A: At the Department of Social Services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-12\">Q: Who was present for the interview?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-13\">A: Mr. Churchfield, myself and Detective Barnes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-14\">Q: At some point in time that same day was Mr. Church-field arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-15\">A: He was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-16\">Q: Did that occur in your presence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number><em>A: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">Q: And was that also at DSS?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">Q: What, if anything, did you hear Mr. Churchfield say? DEFENSE COUNSEL: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">Q: What, if anything, did you hear Mr. Churchfield say as he was being arrested and placed in handcuffs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-10\">A: I heard him say I\u2019ll take care of that bitch when this is over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-11\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Object and move to strike, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-12\">THE COURT: Denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">On cross-examination, the defense sought unsuccessfully to elicit an expansion of appellant\u2019s conversation with Holland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai2\">Q: At the interview when the Defendant made this statement, he denied any sort of sexual contact with Christina, did he not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-14\">PROSECUTOR: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-15\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-16\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: May we approach, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQU\">THE COURT: Yes. (Whereupon, counsel and the Defendant approached the bench and the following occurred out of the hearing of the jury panel:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-17\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Judge, if part of the statement comes in, doesn\u2019t it all come in? I mean, it just seems to me that the State\u2019s only able to use the inculpatory portion of it, not the exculpatory portion, that seems very unfair to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlI\">PROSECUTOR: Well, it might seem unfair but that\u2019s the law, you know it\u2019s admissions against party opponents. The statement\u2019s only admissible if one party is introducing against the others; therefore, you can\u2019t introduce your own statement especially if they are self-serving.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-18\">THE COURT: I\u2019ll sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Citing several Maryland cases, appellant argues that because the State was allowed to introduce part of a confession or admission into evidence he should have, in turn, been allowed to introduce the remainder of that statement, in which he denied having sexual relations with Christina. <em>See, e.g., Hadder v. State, </em>238 Md. 341, 354, 209 A.2d 70 (1965) (\u201cif a confession be admissible, the accused may insist upon it being offered in its entirety, and not simply selected portions thereof\u2019); <em>Bell v. State, </em>234 Md. 254, 258, 198 A.2d 895 (1964) (\u201cIn the case of confessions it is the general rule that the whole of a confession must be admitted. Neither side can select the incriminatory or exculpatory portions.\u201d); <em>Williams v. State, </em>205 Md. 470, 473, 109 A.2d 89 (1954) (\u201call of a statement, a part of which constitutes a confession or an admission, is admissible in evidence, the exculpatory as well as the inculpatory\u201d); <em>Walters v. State, </em>156 Md. 240, 243, 144 A. 252 (1929) (\u201c \u2018The offer in testimony of a part of a statement or conversation upon a well-established rule of evidence, always gives to the opposite party the right to have the whole.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Smith v. Wood, </em>31 Md. 293, 296-97 (1869)). To the State\u2019s contention that appellant\u2019s full statement would be self-serving, appellant explains that the State cannot introduce a portion of his statement and thereafter prohibit the defense from introducing \u201cthe entire conversation in which an admission introduced in evidence against him was made, notwithstanding the fact that a part of the conversation is self-serving.\u201d <em>Braxton v. State, </em>57 Md.App. 539, 546, 470 A.2d 1327 (1984) (citing <em>Williams, </em>205 Md. at 473, 109 A.2d 89).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">Aside from arguing that the court misapplied the party opponent hearsay exception<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to unfairly prejudice him by allowing the jury to misread his anger and shock as an admission of guilt, appellant also avers that the remainder of his statement was admissible under the common law doctrine of verbal completeness. That doctrine \u201callows a party to respond to the admission, by an opponent, of part of a writing or conversation, by admitting the remainder of that writing or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>conversation.\u201d <em>Conyers v. State, </em>345 Md. 525, 541, 693 A.2d 781 (1997) (citing <em>Richardson v. State, </em>324 Md. 611, 598 A.2d 180 (1991)). In general, the right of the party responding to the admission is governed by three general conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\">i. The utterance to be admitted may not be irrelevant to the issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">ii. No more of the remainder of the utterance than concerns the same subject, and explains the part of the utterance already in evidence, may be admitted; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">iii. The remainder is received as an aid in construction of the utterance as a whole and is not in itself considered to be testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-7\"><em>Conyers, </em>345 Md. at 541-42, 693 A.2d 781 (citing <em>Feigley v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>211 Md. 1, 10, 124 A.2d 822 (1956)); <em>see also Newman v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 85, 96, 499 A.2d 492 (1985) (\u201cto be admissible, the remainder must not only relate to the subject matter, but must also tend \u2018to explain and shed light on the meaning of the part already received\u2019 or \u2018to correct a prejudicially misleading impression left by the introduction of misleading evidence.\u2019 \u201d) (citing <em>Bowers v. State, </em>298 Md. 115, 468 A.2d 101 (1983), McCormick, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 56 (3d ed.1984); <em>White v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 265, 273, 467 A.2d 771 (1983)). Of course, the remainder is also subject to the strictures of Md. Rule 5-403, and its prejudicial nature, if any, may not outweigh its explanatory value. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Finally, appellant contends that the remainder of his conversation with Holland is admissible under Maryland Rule 5-106, which provides that \u201c[w]hen part or all of a writing or recorded statement is introduced by a party, an adverse party may require the introduction at that time of any other part of any other writing or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.\u201d Citing <em>Conyers, </em>appellant explains that Rule 5-106 allows the admission of evidence that might otherwise be considered hearsay, if it is offered as an explanation of other admitted evidence rather than as substantive proof. <em>See Conyers, </em>345 Md. at 541, 693 A.2d 781 (\u201cMaryland Rule 5-106 does not change the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>requirements for admissibility under the common law doctrine or allow the admission of otherwise inadmissible evidence, \u2018except to the extent that it is necessary, in fairness, to explain what the opposing party has elicited.\u2019 In such a circumstance, the evidence is offered merely as an explanation of previously-admitted evidence and not as substantive proof.\u201d) (quoting Md. Rule 5-106, comm. note). Rule 5-106, appellant contends, would trump any objections that the State might present regarding the self-serving nature of his statement denying sexual relations with his daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Appellant\u2019s arguments fail, however, for the same reasons the appellant\u2019s argument failed in Conyers\u2014the two parts of the \u201csame\u201d statement to which appellant refers were actually two <em>separate </em>conversations. If <em>Conyers </em>and Rule 5-106 stand for the proposition that the verbal completeness doctrine is alive and well in Maryland, <em>Conyers </em>also makes clear that, except in rare circumstances,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the admissible remainder must be \u201cthe remaining part of a <em>single </em>writing or conversation\u201d for the doctrine to apply. <em>Conyers, </em>345 Md. at 542, 693 A.2d 781 (emphasis added). Here, appellant\u2019s vow to \u201ctake care of that bitch\u201d was an outburst he made when he was arrested; it was not part of the substance of his investigative interview with Holland earlier, during which he denied his daughter\u2019s allegations of abuse. The trial court thus did not err when it determined that appellant\u2019s expression of shock and anger (for whatever reason it occurred) was not part of the statement he gave in Holland\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">We also believe that, even if the trial court had erred by excluding appellant\u2019s earlier denials, such error was cured by his own testimony about the statement in question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Q: There\u2019s been testimony that you when you were placed under arrest you said I\u2019ll fix that bitch when this is over with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-4\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-5\">Q: Did you say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">A: Yes, sir, I was very upset for being arrested for something I hadn\u2019t done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">Q: What did you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">A: It was just a phrase. I mean, she had done so many things in the past, it was just one more thing she had done, you know. I was more majorly upset about it because I had never been arrested before.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">This testimony gave appellant adequate opportunity to place the remark in its larger context and, arguably, should be no less convincing to a jury than rote denials made in an investigatory interview. Thus, any possible error would have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Smallwood, </em>320 Md. at 308, 577 A.2d 356; <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">Finally, appellant contends that the court below erred when it overruled his motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the statement described in section II <em>supra </em>as irrelevant, prejudicial and potentially confusing to the jury. In so ruling, the court opined that \u201can arrestee\u2019s reaction to arrest can have probative value and ... while everything you say may be appropriate argument to a jury, it seems to me that the prejudicial affect <em>[sic </em>] of the statement is not so great as to outweigh the possible probative value.\u201d On appeal, appellant attacks the court\u2019s reasoning under Maryland Rule 5^101. If relevant evidence, he argues, tends \u201cto make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence,\u201d the statement in question was irrelevant. In his estimation, it \u201cwas as consistent with outrage over being falsely accused as with consciousness [of] guilt,\u201d and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>cannot enlighten the jury as to whether he had sexually abused his daughter. <em>See State v. Joynes, </em>314 Md. 113, 119-20, 549 A.2d 380 (1988). Appellant also contends that, even had the statement borne some probative value, such was outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-403. The fact that appellant referred to his own daughter using an unflattering and offensive epithet, he argues, may have repelled members of the jury and blinded them to his legitimate defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">It was, however, for the jury to determine how to interpret the true meaning of appellant\u2019s outburst upon arrest. Were we to adopt his relevance analysis, we would strip the jury of its role as arbiter of the weight and credibility of evidence. Moreover, given the broad discretion we afford the trial court in evidentiary rulings, and the degree of damage to appellant\u2019s case that we must find to reverse a conviction based on prejudice,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we cannot reverse under Rule 5\u2014403. Even if we could find abuse of discretion, as we explained <em>swpra, </em>appellant had ample opportunity during his testimony to offset any damaging statement and explain why he made it.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">We recognize that our holding today might concern strong advocates for the rights of victims of child abuse and other crimes of a sexual nature. To those persons, we emphasize that our opinion should not, in any way, be construed to support blaming the victims of sexual abuse or diminish this State\u2019s efforts to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of the same. Nor do we intend to weaken Maryland\u2019s Rape Shield Statute, which was not, we note, at issue here. Complaining witnesses sometimes have motives to lie, even to invent out of whole cloth the occurrence of crimes. When such motives go to the very heart of the accusations against defendants\u2014as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>they did here, where Christina accused her father of the very activity from which he sought to protect her\u2014the value of testimony regarding a complainant\u2019s motives outweighs any prejudicial effects. This holds true even when the nature of the proffered testimony would greatly embarrass the witness. We reverse appellant\u2019s conviction and remand this matter to the court below for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY WICOMICO COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\">.

The Rape Shield Statute makes inadmissible \"[ejvidence relating to a victim\u2019s reputation for chastity and opinion evidence relating to a victim\u2019s chastity ... in any prosecution for commission of a rape, sexual offense in the first or second degree, or attempted rape or attempted sexual offense in the first or second degree,\u201d unless such evidence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">is relevant and is material to a fact in issue in the case and that its inflammatory or prejudicial nature does not outweigh its probative value, and if the evidence is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-9\">(1) Evidence of (he victim's past sexual conduct with the defendant; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-10\">(2) Evidence of specific instances of sexual activity showing the source or origin of semen, pregnancy, disease, or trauma; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-11\">(3) Evidence which supports a claim that the victim has an ulterior motive in accusing the defendant of the crime; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-12\">(4) Evidence offered for the purpose of impeachment when the prosecutor puts the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct in issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">\u00a7 461A(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b701-14\">. The original charges were second degree rape, incest, and second degree assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b706-8\">. The Sixth Amendment states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">U.S. Const, amend vi.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b706-11\">. Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2f\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>[Iln all criminal prosecutions, every man hath a right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Md. Const. Decl. of Rights art. 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\">. Md. Rule 5-401 defines relevant evidence as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b711-8\">. Md. Rule 5-403 states that relevant evidence \"may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b712-7\">. For this reason, we can distinguish the instant case from <em>Ebb, 341 </em>Md. at 578, 671 A.2d 974. In <em>Ebb, </em>the appellant argued that defense counsel should have been allowed to question the witnesses who testified against him regarding the criminal charges they faced, which, we note, were unrelated to the case before the court. On voir dire, however, those witnesses \"testified that the State had not offered and that they did not expect leniency in exchange for their testimony.\" <em>Id. </em>at 590, 671 A.2d 974. In the absence of any proffered evidence of <em>quid pro quo </em>that would tend to show bias or motive, the trial court prohibited that line of questioning, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. To rely upon <em>Ebb, </em>in our view, would miss the point upon which we hammered <em>supra. </em>When it ruled, the trial court in <em>Ebb </em>specifically considered whether the proffered testimony would present any admissible evidence of bias or motive. Finding none, it excluded the testimony. Here, the trial court specifically acknowledged that evidence of bias and motive did exist, but nonetheless excluded the testimony. Furthermore, unlike in <em>Ebb, </em>where the proffered testimony bore no relationship to the charges before the court, the proffered testimony here was directly relevant to the charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b715-5\">. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-803(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\">. As an example of such rare circumstances, the Court of Appeals cited the New Mexico case <em>State v. Baca, </em>120 N.M. 383, 902 P.2d 65 (1995), in which the New Mexico Supreme Court allowed introduction of a second statement that corrected what might have been considered syntactical confusion in the first statement. <em>See Conyers, </em>345 Md. at 542-43, 693 A.2d 781.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b719-6\">. \"Prejudice, in the evidentiary sense, that can outweigh probative value involves more than mere damage to the opponent's case.\u201d <em>Cook v.
