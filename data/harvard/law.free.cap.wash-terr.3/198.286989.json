S. 235, that unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>tinder the contract set forth in the complaint an absolute sale and transfer of the property was made and intended by both contracting parties, courts must gather the intention of contracting parties, not alone from the words of the contract itself, but as it was made by the parties, and in the light of all surrounding circumstances. <em>(Nash </em>v. <em>Towne, 5 </em>Wall. 689; <em>Canal Co. </em>v. <em>Hill, 15 </em>Wall. 94; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>95 U. S. 23.) The contract pleaded in the complaint is a promissory note and mortgage, and plaintiff, at its option, may recover a money judgment or foreclose in equity. <em>(Frank </em>v. <em>Pickle, </em>2 Wash. 55.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-3\"><em>Mr. C.

Rep. 760; <em>Sage </em>v. <em>Sleutz, </em>23 Ohio St. 8.) A conditional contract does not lose its executory character by a mere delivery of the property. <em>(Sage </em>v. <em>Sleutz, </em>23 Ohio St. 8.) The obligations of defendant to pay, and that of plaintiff to transfer title, are mutual and dependent obligations, and before recovery of purchase price plaintiff must allege and prove performance or tender of performance on his part. <em>(Hawley, Dodd, &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Kenoyer, </em>1 Wash. 699; <em>Baker v.
