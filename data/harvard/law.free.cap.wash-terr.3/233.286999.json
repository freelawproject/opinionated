Third District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-12\">John O. Hildreth was appointed guardian of the person and estate of the appellant by a court of competent juristion of the State of Indiana, both guardian and ward then being residents of that state. Afterwards Hildreth, the guardian, before his discharge and before he accounted to his ward, removed to this territory, where he died; and the appellee, who was also his partner, was duly appointed as executor of his last will by the Probate Court of Pierce County. Appellant then sued the executor of Hildreth to compel an accounting of his trust as guardian, and also for an accounting of the partnership affairs between the deceased and his executor. The executor appeared and demurred upon the following grounds: 1. Because the courts of Indiana had exclusive jurisdiction; 2. Because the complaint failed to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>the presentation of the claim to the executor before suit; 3. Because the complaint failed to show that the executor qualified or accepted his trust under the will; 4. Because it appeared upon the face of the complaint thatthe action was barred by the statute of limitations. The second, third, and fourth grounds are mentioned in the opinion of the court as the objections urged against the sufficiency of the complaint. Demurrer was sustained, and judgment for costs rendered against the plaintiff, from which he-appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-5\"><em>Mr. G. W.

McNaught, </em>Ferry, McNaught, <em>&amp; Mitchell, </em>for the Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-8\">An action cannot be instituted against a guardian in his fiduciary capacity except in the state where he was appointed. The courts of Indiana have exclusive jurisdiction of this cause. (Borer on Interstate Law, pp. 27, 109, 252; <em>Vaughn </em>v. <em>Northrup, </em>15 Pet. 1; <em>Kerr </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>9 Wheat. 565; <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>3 Cranch, 319; <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>9 Wall. 394; <em>Brent </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>30 Mo. 253.) The complaint does not state that the claims upon which the action is based were presented to the executor as required by statute. (Code, secs. 1467, 1468.) The complaint fails to allege that the executor qualified or accepted his trust. It appears upon the complaint that the statute of limitations bars the suit. <em>(Yesler </em>v. <em>Oglesby, </em>1 Wash. 604.)</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Note. \u2014 The publication of this case was inadvertently omitted from the 2d volume of Washington Reports. \u2014Rep.</headnotes>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b241-4\">Mr. Justice Wingard</author>\n<p id=\"AUd\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">In this ease we are of the opinion that the guardian of the plaintiff being dead, he would be without any adequate remedy unless he can maintain his suit against the executor. <em>(Pedeman, Adm\u2019r of Robb, </em>8 Ohio, 227.) The judgment of the District Court in sustaining the demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s complaint is therefore reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings. We do not consider the complaint exposed to the second, third, and fourth objections urged by the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Greene, C.
