Baker and Lizzie Baker, and thereupon a summons was issued wherein the cause and general nature of the action was stated as follows: \u201cThis action is brought to recover the sum of $1,500 in gold coin, and interest thereon from the 27th day of September, 1883, and for his costs and disbursements.\u201d The sheriff served defendant Lizzie Baker personally on March 26, 1887, in the county where action was pending. Defendant Baker never was served. Defendant Lizzie Baker failed to appear, and on April 16,1887, plaintiff filed motion for default and judgment, and on April 19, 1887, judgment was rendered at chambers in favor of plaintiff for the amount demanded, and it was ordered that execution issue against the joint property of both defendants and against the separate property of defendant Lizzie Baker. Both defendants appealed from the judgment'to the Supreme Court. A motion was then made by defendant in error (plaintiff below) to dismiss the appeal, for the reason, among others, that an appeal from a- judgment at law could not be taken under the appeal act of 1883, and that no judgment by default, or for want of an answer, could be appealed from, and that the appeal act of 1883 was void for want of a sufficient title stating the object of the act.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b483-8\"><em>Mr. J. H. Lasater, </em>and <em>Mr. A. E. Isham, </em>for the Defendant in Error, and favoring the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-9\">1. The judgment in the court below is a judgment at law, and appeals do not lie from judgments at law. (Code, secs. 445, 458-459; Rev. Stats. U. S., sec. 1869; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Wall et al., </em>2 Wash. 376; <em>Tierney </em>v. <em>Tierney, </em>1 Wash. 568; <em>Parker &amp; Boyer </em>v. <em>Denney, </em>2 Wash. 176.) Rule 5 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Supreme Court makes a distinction between writs of error and appeals, and this case comes up on notice of appeal only. Neither appeals nor writs of error lie from judgments for want of an answer. (Freeman on Judgments, sec. 538; <em>Colden </em>v. <em>Knickerbacker, </em>2 Cowen, 31; <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Whittick, </em>8 Wend. 219.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-5\">2. The errors assigned by appellant consist of alleged irregularities in the summons. Such irregularities must be taken advantage of by motion, in due time, in the court below, or the irregularities are waived, and this court will not reverse the judgment. (Code, sec. 436, subdivision 3; <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Bostwick, </em>22 N. Y. 425; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Carnley, </em>10 N. Y. 570, 61 Am. Dec. 762.) Other irregularities in obtaining judgment must be taken advantage of by motion in the court below. (Code, secs. 436, 438.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-6\">3. The act of the legislative assembly, entitled \u201cAn act in relation to the removal of causes to the Supreme Court,\u201d approved November 23, 1883, under which this appeal is attempted to be taken, is in conflict with and repugnant to the organic act of Washington Territory and the decisions of this court, and is void. The words \u201ccause\u201d and \u201ccauses,\u201d used in said act, have been judicially construed and defined to mean \u201csuit in court,\u201d \u201caction in court,\u201d etc., but never judgment or decree. <em>(U. S. </em>v. <em>Ortega, </em>11 Wheat. 467; <em>Blyew </em>v. <em>U. </em>S., 13 Wall. 594-5.) The act and its title read with the words \u201csuit or suits in court,\u201d or \u201caction or actions in court,\u201d in place of \u201ccause or causes,\u201d reveal the fact that the object of the act was to remove suits in the District Court, or actions in the District Court, and not judgments or decrees to the Supreme Court. That power the legislature did not possess \u2014 hence could not give it. <em>(McCormick </em>v. <em>Walla Walla &amp; Columbia River R. R. Co., </em>1 Wash. 512; <em>Northern Pacific R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Wells, Fargo &amp; Co., </em>2 Wash. 303; U. S. Rev. Stats. 1869.) The object of section 5 of said act is not embraced in its title, and the objects of the act are double.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b484-7\"><em>Mr. J. B. Allen, </em>and <em>Mr. ~D. J. Orotdley,. </em>for the Plaintiff in Error, and against the motion.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AN6\">1. It has been repeatedly decided by this court that actions at law may be brought here for review under the act of 1883, and we are satisfied with those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">2. The act of 1883 is not invalid for want of a proper title. The language of the title, \u201cAn act in relation to the removal of causes to the Supreme Court,\u201d while not technically accurate, yet describes to the common apprehension that which the act accomplishes. This is all that is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">3. Under our statutes an appeal lies to this court from a default judgment. The motion to dismiss this appeal is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
