The defendant objected that the evidence of the witness did not support the allegation in the indictment. But Briggs, J. overruled the objection.

And being a material averment, it must be strictly proved. The averment in this indictment is, that the sale was \u201c to a certain person whose name <em>is </em>Mary Garland,\u201d that is, at the time when the indictment was found; but the proof was, that the name of such person, at that time, was Mary Morrison.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-9\"><em>J.
