After this examination by the plaintiff, the defendants proposed to cross-examine the witness upon the new matters upon which he had been examined by the plaintiff. To this the plaintiff objected, and the court ruled, as a matter of law, that the defendants had no right so to cross-examine.\u201d The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendants excepted to this ruling.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-5\"><em>J. G. Abbott, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK2\">Although the rule has been adopted in this commonwealth, contrary to the rule of the supreme court of the United States, that a witness, called only to prove the execution of an instrument, may be cross-examined by the other party, it does not follow that the party calling him has not a right to cross-examine him as to new and independent matter introduced by the other party. In such cases, the party who has been obliged by law to call the witness, may contradict him. 1 Greenl. Ev. <em>&amp; </em>443. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Bellows, </em>4 Pick. 194. <em>Whitaker </em>v. <em>Salisbury, </em>15 Pick. 544, 545. There is a still stronger reason for allowing the party to cross-examine the witness. This is not an attempt to impeach the witness, but only to show him to be mistaken. The ruling of the court, \u201c as a matter of law, that the defendants had no right to cross-examine \u201d the witness, was certainly wrong, because it precluded the exercise of any discretion on the part of the judge. It is always in the discretion of the judge to permit a party to cross-examine his own witness. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 435. <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Rowell, </em>17 Pick. 498. <em>Philadelphia &amp; Trenton Railroad </em>v. <em>Stimpson, </em>14 Pet. 461.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-6\"><em>B. F. Butler, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aml\">A witness is to be treated, throughout the trial, as the witness of the party calling him. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 447. <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Rowell, </em>17 Pick. 498. When a party calls a subscribing witness to prove an instrument, the opposite party may then cross-examine him as to any matter. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>Webster </em>v. Lee, 5 Mass. 334 <em>Merrill </em>v. Berkshire, 11 Pick. 273, 274. <em>Burke </em>v. Miller, 7 Cush. 550. <em>Fulton Bank </em>v. Stafford, 2 Wend. 485. The reexamination by. the party calling must be confined to a direct examination, unless the witness shows a bias. <em>Varick </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>2 Wend. 201. If the witness is unwilling, then it is in the discretion of the judge to allow a cross-examination. <em>The People </em>v. <em>Mather, </em>4 Wend. 248. 2 Phil. Ev. 403.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b272-5\">Bigelow, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Arf\">We see no valid reason for changing the rule, as it has long been settled and practised upon in this commonwealth, that a party calling a witness, even for formal proof of a written instrument, or of other preliminary matter, thereby makes him his witness. In such case, he cannot be permitted to impeach his general character for truth. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Bellows, </em>4 Pick. 194. <em>Whitaker </em>v. <em>Salisbury, </em>15 Pick. 544. Nor can he put leading questions to him, unless permitted so to do by the court in the exercise of a sound discretion. <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Rowell, </em>17 Pick. 498, 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">It follows that the adverse party has the right to cross-examine the witness upon all matters material to the issue. Experience has shown that this rule is convenient and easy of application in practice, and works no disadvantage to the party who produces a witness. On the other hand, a different rule, by making it necessary for the court, during the examination of a witness, constantly to determine what is or is not new matter upon which the opposite party has the right to put leading questions, leads to confusion and delay in the progress of trials. The ruling of the court below in the present case was in conformity with our well established practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The argument, by which the counsel for the plaintiff sought to sustain the exceptions, that the judge declined to exercise his discretion concerning the right of the plaintiff to put leading questions to the witness, seems to us to be untenable. The ruling was not that the court might not, in its discretion, permit the witness to be so examined by the party producing him; but that it could not be claimed as a matter of legal right.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
