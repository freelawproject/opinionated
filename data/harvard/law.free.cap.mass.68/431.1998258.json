J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqR\">This action is brought to recover of the clerk of the court of common pleas the sum of twenty dollars paid into his hands by the plaintiff, as a fine under a conviction upon an indictment on <em>St. </em>1852, c. 322, \u00a7 7, for selling spirituous liquor without license. The judgment is still unreversed. The plaintiff insists that the fine, upon a conviction on a second count in an indictment, after a conviction on a first count, and a fine of $10 thereon, should have been $10 only, and that the judgment imposing a fine of $20 on a conviction on such second count was erroneous. Perhaps it was ; but nothing is clearer than that no action will lie against the clerk or anybody else, to recover the money thus paid, whilst the judgment imposing it remains in force. <em>Judgment for the defendant.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
