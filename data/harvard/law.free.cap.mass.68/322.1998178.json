And the plaintiff claimed the whole fund of $15,000, and all the income thereof which had accrued since the death of his mother; and alleged a demand on the trustee, and his refusal to pay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-10\">The defendants demurred, on the ground that the declaration did not <em>\u201c </em>state a legal cause of action, substantially in accordance with the rules in the practice acts of this commonwealth contained,\u201d in the following particulars:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-11\">1st. That, by the will of John Heard, it appears to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>been his intention, that the $15,000, or whatever should remain thereof, should be added to the general residue of his estate, or otherwise kept as a trust fund, so that his wife should receive the net income during her life; and it appears by the pleadings that she is living.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-5\">2d. That by the will it does not appear to have been the intention of the testator, that the children, or any child, of Ann Gris-wold should receive said sum of $15,000, or any part thereof, or the income, or any part thereof, during the life of the testator\u2019s wife; but that the enjoyment thereof should be postponed to a period subsequent to her decease.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-6\"><em>G. G. Loring 8f F. O. Watts, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-7\"><em>E. Si Rand, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYU\">The testator, after providing, by the first clause of his will, for the payment of $1,000 to his grandson, and, by the second clause, for investing in the hands of a trustee $15,000, the income of which was to be paid to his daughter Mrs. Griswold during life, gives to his widow the use and income of all his other property for life; and then directs that, upon her decease, his estate shall be divided into three parts, for the benefit of his three daughters. It thus clearly appears to Have been his intention that his widow should have the use of all his estate, except the legacy of $1,000 to his grandson, and the income of the $15,000 which Mrs. Griswold was to enjoy during her life. It is true that he used the word \u201c legacies \u201d in speaking of both these sums; but he evidently attached very different meanings to it as applied to the two, regarding it in the one case as a definite sum of money, in the other as an amount to accrue yearly from a sum of money which he directs to be raised and invested for the purpose of yielding such yearly amount. The word \u201c legacy \u201d may mean, and has often been held to mean, an annuity or yearly payment. That the testator used the word in this sense is evident from the sixth clause of the will, in which he treats the principal sum as a part of the residue of his estate, and as going to make up the one third part of such residue which was to belong to the children of Mrs. Griswold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-8\">But if the testator, by the word \u201c legacy,\u201d intended the print ipal sum of $15,000, and Mrs. Heard was therefore not entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>to the income of that sum after the decease of Mrs. Griswold, still, the plaintiff is not entitled to the sum until Mrs. Heard\u2019s decease. For, by the sixth clause, the testator expressly directs that the residue of his estate shall be divided into three parts, after the decease of his widow, and that this sum of $15,000 shall be estimated as a portion of the third part given to the children of Mrs. Griswold.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b333-5\">Thomas, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9n\">The question raised by the declaration and demurrer is, whether the plaintiff was entitled to receive the sum of fifteen thousand dollars at the decease of his mother, Mrs. Griswold, or at the decease of the testator\u2019s widow, Mrs. Heard. The answer to the question is to be found in the will itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">It is plain, we think, from an analysis of the provisions of the will, that the word \u201c legacy,\u201d as used by the testator, applies to the principal sum of fifteen thousand dollars, and not to the income and profits of that sum. The direction that the \u201c two preceding legacies,\u201d that is, the legacy of one thousand dollars given to his grandson, and that given in trust for his daughter Ann, shall be \u201c raised by his executors as soon after the settlement of his estate as they shall think expedient,\u201d refers obviously to the principal sum of fifteen thousand dollars, and would be insensible if applied to the income and profits of that sum, payable quarter-yearly during the life of his daughter, the <em>cestui que trust. </em>This is made certain by the considerations that the trustee and executors are different persons; that the direction is to the executors to raise a sum to be paid to the trustee; and that the mode of its investment is left to the discretion of the trustee, and not of the executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">In the final distribution of his estate, the testator treats the principal sum as the legacy, speaking of the fifteen thousand dollars as given in trust for his daughter, and directing that it shall be taken as a portion of the third part given to her children, adding that \u201c it,\u201d that is, the sum of fifteen thousand dollars, \u201c is not to be paid over to her children till the capital shall fall in at her death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">If this be the use of the word legacy by the testator, it folows that Mrs. Heard has no title to the income and profits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>this sum of fifteen thousand dollars. The language of the will is explicit. \u201c I give to my wife, during life, the income and profits of all my real and personal estate, except the legacies above mentioned,\u201d that is, except the legacy of one thousand dollars given to my grandson, the legacy of fifteen thousand dollars given in trust for my daughter, and the specific legacy given to my wife for her own absolute use.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The only question remaining is whether the payment of the fifteen thousand dollars is to be postponed till the decease of Mrs. Heard. Having ascertained that Mrs. Heard has no interest in the income of that sum, there would seem to be no good reason for such postponement. On the other hand, the will clearly indicates the intention of the testator to make immediate provision for Mrs. Griswold. The reason which induced the testator to make such provision for the mother would seem to apply with equal force to her children. But we are not left to conjecture, however reasonable, as to the time when this legacy of fifteen thousand dollars is to be paid to the children or child of Mrs. Griswold. When the testator says, \u201c it \u201d (the fifteen thousand dollars) \u201c is not to be paid to her children till the capital shall fall in at her death,\u201d he fixes the time of payment. The necessary implication, in the absence of other provisions, is that at her death it is to be paid over. <em>Demurrer overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
