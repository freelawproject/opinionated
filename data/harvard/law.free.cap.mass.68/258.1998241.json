Intoxicating liquors were delivered by them to the defendant, upon the credit of the plaintiff, to the amount sued for, mostly in quantities of less than twenty eight gallons; and the greater part thereof were charged to the plaintiff, and the remainder to the defendant. Said firm, after repeated demands on the defendant for payment, which he neglected to comply with, and before the commencement of this action, demanded payment of the plaintiff for the liquors so sold and delivered, and the plaintiff gave them his negotiable promissory note, payable on demand, with interest; and they received the note in payment for the liquors. The note had never been paid, nor the account receipted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>Wells, </em>C.

The note, therefore, in their hands, is wholly void, and the plaintiff may successfully resist payment of it to them. <em>Featherston </em>v. Hutchinson, Cro. Eliz. 199. <em>Waite </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>1 Scott, 735, and 1 Bing. N. C. 662. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Gillmore, </em>3 Taunt. 226. <em>Gaitskill </em>v. <em>Greathead, </em>1 Dowl. &amp; Ryl. 359. <em>Deering </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>22 Maine, 488. <em>Carlton </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>7 Foster, 230. 1 Leigh\u2019s Nisi Prius, 41. The mere giving of such a note by the plaintiff, in discharge of a claim on the defendant, is not a payment of the claim, that will enable the plaintiff to recover of the defendant the amount of the note, in an action for money paid. If the plaintiff could recover in this action, and should refuse to pay the note, he would obtain of the defendant, for nothing, the price of all the goods, lawfully and unlawfully sold, and leave him still liable to the sellers, as far as he ever was liable, in an action for goods sold and delivered. For when a security, taken in payment of a demand, is void and is avoided, the creditor may bring an action, and recover, on the original cause of action. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>11 Mass. 359. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Trustees of Society in Taunton, </em>2 Cush. 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">If the note shall be collected of the plaintiff by a <em>bona fide </em>indorsee, or if he shall pay it, or any part of it, to the promisees, his claim on the defendant may be presented on different grounds. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
