The motion was accompanied by an offer to file a report of the evidence given at the trial. The demandant moved that judgment be entered on the verdict, because the tenant\u2019s motion was not made and filed until more than three days after the verdict was returned, the 26th rule of this court providing that \u201c no motion shall be sustained for a new trial in any civil action after verdict of the jury, either on account of any opinions or decisions of the judge given in the course of the trial, or because the verdict is alleged to be against evidence or the weight of evidence, unless, within three days after the verdict is returned, the counsel of the party complaining of the proceedings, or of the verdict, shall file a motion for a new trial, specifying- the grounds of his complaint, and causing a copy of the said motion to be delivered to the adverse counsel, on the day the same shall be filed.\u201d 24 Pick. 392, 393. For the cause alleged by the demand-ant, Merrick, J. as he stated in his report to the full court, \u201c declined .to report the evidence on said motion, and ordered judgment on the verdict. If that was not sufficient cause, the motion is to be heard upon the evidence to be reported; otherwise, the judgment rendered is to stand.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-5\"><em>N.
