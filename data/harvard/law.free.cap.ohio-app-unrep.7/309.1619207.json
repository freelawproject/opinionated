We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-26\">In <em>Jones v. Pierson </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App. 3d 447, the court set forth a two-step analysis for determining whether an expense is a taxable litigating expense or personal expense. Personal expenses are those expenses expended by a party in preparing a case for trial; necessary expenses are funds expended by a party as are necessary and vital to the litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 449. Next, the court should decide whether a litigating expense should be taxed as a cost in the particular case at bar. While the court retains discretion in this regard, that discretion should be exercised to overrule a motion to tax litigating expenses only where the expense is unusual in type or amount which because of the prevailing party's conduct it is inequitable to access against the non-prevailing party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-27\">Expert witness' fees have been specifically <em>disallowed </em>as a taxable cost against the non-prevailing party. See <em>Moore v. General Motors Corp. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St. 3d 259, 260-261; <em>Gold v. Orr Felt Co. </em>(1985), 21 Ohio App. 3d 214; <em>Glover v. Massey </em>(January 11, 1990), Cuyahoga App. No. 56351, 56802, unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-28\">The appellant's assignment is well taken for the reason that expert witness fees are not properly taxable as costs. Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b473-29\">DYKE, P.J., VICTOR, J., and CASTLE, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b473-30\">Sitting By Assignment: Judge William H.
