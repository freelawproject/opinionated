The motion attacked only that portion of the interlocutory judgment of dissolution which related to the award or distribution of community property. The motion was addressed to the court, \u201cacting as a Court of equity\u201d to \u201callow the Respondent to have her day in court.\u201d It was supported by the declaration of respondent which set forth the basis of her claim that it \u201cis grossly unfair that the Respondent should at the termination of a marriage exceeding 21 years and 9 months walk away from that relationship with only a 1969 Mustang automobile and to lose all rights or benefits that she has to the equity in the real property which at the time of the separation Respondent estimates to be approximately $10,000.00 and to also lose all of the accrued rights that she had in and to the pension or profit sharing benefits that have accrued to the account of the petitioner during the 16 years that he was a member of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Teamsters\u2019 Union.\u201d Respondent\u2019s declaration stated: \u201cThat Petitioner didn\u2019t even mention to the Respondent that there was any such asset in existence and that such benefits could be extremely valuable\u201d (referring to the pension benefits). Respondent\u2019s declarations also set forth the facts concerning the community interest in the family residence which was acquired at a cost of $41,000. She stated in this connection that an $8,000 down payment came from the sale of a former family residence and was community property, that payments of $250 to $275 per month had been made monthly from March 1973, and that all of said payments up to the date of separation were community property.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">With respect to the property settlement agreement, respondent declared that she had no legal advice concerning it; that it had been prepared by petitioner\u2019s attorney, forwarded to him, and presented to respondent for signature; that whenever it was discussed, \u201cthe parties would get into an argument and out of desperation and just to end the arguments the Respondent finally signed the agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Respondent\u2019s declaration further alleged that she had sought legal advice for the first time on March 26, 1975, but deferred taking action with respect to her rights until May in view of the impending marriage of the oldest child of the parties; that negotiations for a modification of the decree were initiated in May 1975 until they terminated by petitioner\u2019s counsel formally refusing on May 22, 1975, to enter into any modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In opposition to respondent\u2019s motion, petitioner filed his declaration. In petitioner\u2019s declaration he declared that at the time of the separation, and prior to the signing of the property settlement agreement, \u201crespondent had knowledge\u201d of the property described in her declaration, including the \u201cretirement and pension fund available to me as a member of the Teamsters Union.\u201d The declaration referred in this connection to paragraph (f) of the financial declaration quoted above. It also stated that upon inquiry subsequent to the filing of his financial declaration, petitioner ascertained that as of June 30, 1974, he had vested retirement benefits which entitled him to at least \u201ca cash termination benefit of approximately $1,435.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Petitioner\u2019s declaration further alleged that \u201cit was respondent\u2019s idea to set up a trust fund for our children, the corpus of which would be the family residence <em>one-half of the net proceeds of the sale </em>of the family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>residence as of the date of the separation . . Petitioner also denied suggesting that respondent not seek legal advice or that he prevented her from doing so. He further stated that he did not force or coerce respondent into signing the settlement agreement, that after she initially refused to sign it, it was placed on a desk in his home where he found it to have been signed after a visit by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">At the hearing of the motion, the court ascertained from counsel who had signed the property settlement agreement as attorney for petitioner that he had not advised respondent to get independent legal advice, it appearing that he \u201cnever talked to the lady at any time.\u201d When petitioner\u2019s counsel stated his view that it was respondent\u2019s choice whether she got legal advice, the court commented as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">\u201cNo, Counsel, I don\u2019t agree. I am going to grant the motion. I am going to set aside the final, the interlocutory. You people get together. There are rights involved here, substantial rights. It offends my sense of justice in equity, period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The court further stated: \u201c. . . I don\u2019t think the woman has been adequately protected. And I am going to grant the motion and you people get together and give her an opportunity to know what the situation is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">At petitioner\u2019s request, formal findings of fact and conclusions of law were prepared and signed by the court. In the findings, the court found in accordance with respondent\u2019s declaration that the $8,000 down payment and all payments on the encumbrance upon the family residence to the date of separation were community funds, and that petitioner\u2019s retirement pension benefits with the teamsters\u2019 union which had accumulated for a period of approximately 16 years were community property. The court further found in this respect that \u201cthe Marital Settlement Agreement executed by the parties herein was executed by the Respondent without knowledge concerning the assets of the community and without knowledge that pension or profit sharing benefits had accrued to the Petitioner . . .\u201d Further, with respect to the marital settlement agreement, the court found \u201c[t]hat said agreement was signed by the Respondent in part by reason of the coercion of the Petitioner and in an effort to avoid arguments and accusations by the Petitioner.\u201d The court concluded \u201c[t]hat the default of the Respondent was entered by reason of the Respondent\u2019s ignorance and mistake and without an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>opportunity for a fair adversaiy hearing.\u201d The court concluded that the execution of the marital settlement agreement did not \u201cin fact constitute a meeting of the minds of the parties,\u201d that the consent of respondent in the signing of the marital settlement agreement \u201cwas induced by coercive conduct of the Petitioner,\u201d that respondent\u2019s default was entered \u201cby reason of [her] ignorance and mistake and without an opportunity for a fair adversary hearing,\u201d and that the portion of the interlocutory judgment of dissolution which related to the award of distribution of community property should be vacated and set aside, and respondent\u2019s response be deemed filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\n<em>Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Appellant contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">1. Relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 was not available inasmuch as the interlocutory judgment of dissolution was entered more than six months before the date respondent\u2019s motion was made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">2. That no showing was made by respondent justifying relief in equity for extrinsic fraud or mistake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">3. That equitable relief was precluded by respondent\u2019s laches.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Respondent does not deny the inapplicability of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, but contends that an adequate showing of extrinsic fraud or mistake was made justifying relief in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">As this court said in <em>Outdoor Imports, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stanoff, </em>7 Cal.App.3d 518, 522 [86 Cal.Rptr. 593]: \u201cIt is well settled that appellate courts have always been and are favorably disposed toward orders excusing defaults and permitting controversies to be adjudicated upon their merits. Such orders are rarely reversed and never unless it clearly appears that there has been a plain abuse of discretion. <em>(Lynch </em>v. <em>Spilman, 61 </em>Cal.2d 251, 257-258 [62 Cal.Rptr. 12, 431 P.2d 636]; <em>Weitz </em>v. <em>Yankosky, </em>63 Cal.2d 849, 854-855 [48 Cal.Rptr. 620, 409 P.2d 700]; <em>Benjamin </em>v. <em>Dalmo Mfg. Co., </em>31 Cal.2d 523, 525 [190 P.2d 593].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">Where the six-month period during which motions under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 can be made has passed, relief may still be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>granted under the court\u2019s equity powers. Although the grounds upon which such relief may be granted are somewhat narrower, the procedure is essentially the same. In <em>Munoz </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>275 Cal.App.2d 178 [79 Cal.Rptr. 563], the court described the motion based upon equitable grounds as follows (275 Cal.App.2d at p. 181):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\">\u201cA trial court has an inherent equity power under which, apart from statutory authority, it may grant relief from a default judgment obtained through extrinsic fraud or mistake. <em>(Weitz </em>v. <em>Yankosky, </em>63 Cal.2d 849 [48 Cal.Rptr. 620, 409 P.2d 700]; <em>Olivera </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>19 Cal.2d 570 [122 P.2d 564, 140 A.L.R. 1328]; <em>Sanchez </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>273 Cal.App.2d 159 [77 Cal.Rptr. 884].) That equitable power may be invoked by the party seeking to set aside the default judgment either by the filing of a separate suit for the purpose or by a motion made in the action in which the default was taken. <em>(Olivera </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>supra; <em>Dei Tos </em>v. <em>Dei Tos, </em>105 Cal.App.2d 81 [232 P.2d 873]; <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Traina, </em>200 Cal.App.2d 655 [19 Cal.Rptr. 521]; <em>McCreadie </em>v. <em>Arques, </em>248 Cal.App.2d 39 [56 Cal.Rptr. 188].) The time limit for the filing of such a motion or separate suit is a reasonable time from discovery of the default judgment irrespective of when it may actually have been entered. <em>(Weitz </em>v. <em>Yankosky, </em>supra; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hibernia Bank, </em>47 Cal.2d 540 [305 P.2d 20]; <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Risk, </em>255 Cal.App.2d 613 [64 Cal.Rptr. 36]; <em>Fidelity Bank </em>v. <em>Kettler, </em>264 Cal.App.2d 481 [70 Cal.Rptr. 500].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">\u201cWhile the grounds for an equitable action to set\" aside a default judgment are commonly stated as being those of extrinsic fraud or mistake, the terms are given a very broad meaning which tends to encompass all circumstances that deprive an adversary of fair notice of hearing whether or not those circumstances would qualify as fraudulent or mistaken in the strict sense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The trial court\u2019s resolution of disputed fact issues on the basis of the affidavits of the parties has the same standing on appeal as findings based upon oral testimony. In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, 4 </em>Cal.App.3d 446, 451-452 [84 Cal.Rptr. 241], the function of the appellate court under these circumstances is set forth as follows: \u201cIn considering an appeal from an order which is based on affidavits and which involves the determination of a question of fact, an appellate court is bound by the same rule that controls where oral testimony is presented for review, namely: If there is any conflict in the affidavits those favoring the prevailing party are accepted as true; and since all intendments are in favor of the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>taken by the lower court the affidavits in behalf of the successful party are deemed not only to establish the facts directly stated therein but all facts reasonably to be inferred from those stated. <em>(DeWit </em>v. <em>Glazier, </em>149 Cal.App.2d 75, 81-82 [307 P.2d 1031].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Applying the above stated standard, respondent\u2019s declaration supported the court\u2019s finding that she was \u201cwithout knowledge that pension or profit sharing benefits had accrued to the Petitioner.\u201d She stated that \u201cPetitioner didn\u2019t even mention to the Respondent that there was any such asset in existence and that such benefits could be extremely valuable.\u201d The marital settlement agreement made no mention whatever of any such asset. Inasmuch as it was intended to be \u201ca final and complete settlement of our respective rights in relation to each other,\u201d it is reasonable to assume that mention would have been made of the pension rights had their existence been disclosed. Petitioner\u2019s declaration includes the statement that \u201crespondent had knowledge\u201d of \u201ca retirement and pension fund available to nie as a member of the Teamsters Union.\u201d No mention, however, is made of the manner in which respondent obtained such knowledge except a reference to the financial declaration filed as a part of the dissolution proceeding. Though the file discloses that petitioner\u2019s financial declaration was served by mail upon respondent, such financial declaration did not disclose the existence of any pension rights. By filling in the blank where the value of such rights was supposed to be stated with the entry \u201cunknown,\u201d and stating \u201ctotal property\u201d of $41,125, which was the sum of the valued items listed, petitioner represented either that he did not know that he had pension rights or that they had no value. In any event, such financial declaration did not impart to respondent knowledge that there were valuable pension rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The nondisclosure of community property has long been recognized as a basis for setting aside. both property settlement agreements and property dispositions based thereon. <em>Jorgensen </em>v. <em>Jorgensen, </em>32 Cal.2d 13 [193 P.2d 728], set forth the basis for such relief, saying in this respect (32 Cal.2d at p. 21): \u201cAs the manager of the community property the husband occupies a position of trust (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 172-173, 158), which is not terminated as to assets remaining in his hands when the spouses separate. It is part of his fiduciary duties to account to the wife for the community property when the spouses are negotiating a property settlement agreement. The concealment of community property assets by the husband from the wife in connection with such an agreement is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>therefore a breach of a fiduciary duty of the husband that deprives the wife of an opportunity to protect her rights in the concealed assets and thus warrants equitable relief from a judgment approving such agreement. When community property is entrusted to the wife, she likewise occupies a position of trust. It has therefore been held that a husband may obtain equitable relief from a divorce decree incorporating a property settlement agreement obtained by the fraud of the wife in concealing community assets entrusted to her control. <em>(Boullester </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>137 Cal.App. 193, 195 [30 P.2d 59].) It is immaterial whether the husband or the wife has submitted the property settlement to the court for approval; the fraud of one spouse in concealing the assets, if not discovered by the other, precludes the latter from protecting his or her rights as to the concealed assets in the divorce proceeding.\u201d In that case, the court concluded that there was no extrinsic fraud where the husband had disclosed the existence of the community property but had claimed it was his separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">In <em>Orlando </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>243 Cal.App.2d 248 [52 Cal.Rptr. 142], the court applied the rule stated in <em>Jorgensen </em>to invalidate an interlocutory decree. The court said (243 Cal.App.2d at p. 253): \u201cWe therefore hold that where a husband conceals from his wife the existence of community assets whether in the course of negotiations for a property settlement agreement or in the course of litigating their claims to community property, such conduct is violative of his fiduciary duty to account to her for the community property, deprives her of an opportunity to fully present her case, constitutes extrinsic fraud and warrants equitable relief from a judgment. <em>(Lopez </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 735, 738 [48 Cal.Rptr. 136, 408 P.2d 744]; <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Arroyo, supra, </em>56 Cal.2d 492, 494-495; <em>Jorgensen </em>v. <em>Jorgensen, supra, </em>32 Cal.2d 13, 21-22; <em>Willson </em>v. <em>Burner, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.2d 947, 950; <em>Hopper </em>v. <em>Hopper, supra, </em>224 Cal.App.2d 446, 448; <em>Protopappas </em>v. <em>Protopappas, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.2d 659, 663; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.2d 373, 376-382; <em>Gedstad </em>v. <em>Ellichman, supra, </em>124 Cal.App.2d 831, 832-834; <em>Dandini </em>v. <em>Dandini, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.2d 211, 216; 3 Freeman on Judgments (5th ed.), \u00a7 1235, p. 2576; 29 Cal.Jur.2d, Judgments, \u00a7 160, p. 111; 30A Am.Jur., Judgments, \u00a7 805, p. 738; 49 C.J.S., Judgments, \u00a7 372, p. 744.) [Fn. omitted.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">In <em>Vai </em>v. <em>Bank of America, 56 </em>Cal.2d 329 [15 Cal.Rptr. 71, 364 P.2d 247], our Supreme Court extended the fiduciary duty of the spouse to the disclosure of community assets and declared the failure to do so constituted constructive fraud. In so doing, the court said (56 Cal.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>p. 342): \u201cThe failure of the husband in the instant case to disclose fully and fairly material facts relating to the value of community assets from which John gained an advantage constitutes a concealment of material facts and a breach of this fiduciary duty. This is constructive fraud, whether or not such failure to disclose was accompanied by an actual intent to defraud. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2235, 1573, subds. 1 and 2.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Most recently, in <em>Boeseke </em>v. <em>Boeseke, </em>10 Cal.3d 844, 849-850 [112 Cal.Rptr. 401, 519 P.2d 161], our Supreme Court stated the rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">\u201cBy reason of his management and control, one spouse normally has a fiduciary duty to account to the other while negotiating a property settlement agreement. The duty is terminated neither by commencement of an action for dissolution nor by retention of an attorney. <em>(Vai </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 329, 337 [15 Cal.Rptr. 71, 364 P.2d 247].) <em>It includes disclosure of the existence of community assets </em>and material facts affecting their value. (56 Cal.2d at pp. 342-343.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">\u201cWe cannot agree with the trial court that the nondisclosure here by the husband constituted either a breach of his fiduciary duty or fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">\u201cThe managing spouse must be permitted to protect his own interests and to assume a position adverse to the other, particularly when the latter is represented by counsel. For example, in <em>Jorgensen </em>v. <em>Jorgensen </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 13 [193 P.2d 728], we held it was not necessarily fraudulent for a husband to assert community property to be his separate property. We stated that, when the husband takes the position certain property is separate, the wife must then investigate the facts. If she and her counsel choose to accept his assertion, she may not collaterally attack the subsequent judgment approving the settlement. (32 Cal.2d at p. 22; see <em>In re Marriage of Carter </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 479, 489-492 [97 Cal.Rptr. 274].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">\u201cFurther, when a spouse, represented by independent counsel, determines to forego a suggested investigation and to accept a proposed settlement, that spouse may not later avoid the agreement unless there has been a misrepresentation or concealment of material facts. Under such circumstances, the spouse proposing the agreement is under no duty to compel the other to investigate, and the accepting spouse\u2019s decision, though ill advised, is binding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>\u201cFinally, during negotiation to settle marital property rights, fairness dictates the managing spouse be under no duty to <em>evaluate </em>the marital assets. And if the managing spouse does assert an opinion of value, he or she must be able to do so without warranty. Valuation, like designation of property as being either community or separate, is an issue on which reasonable views often differ, <em>and in the absence of concealment of </em>assets\u2014or facts materially affecting their value\u2014a property settlement agreement may not later be set aside solely on the basis of the managing spouse\u2019s inaccurate opinion of value or on his or her refusal to have rendered such opinion. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The strength of the policy of our law requiring full disclosure of all community assets so that the court may properly make an equal division thereof is further manifested by the rule stated in <em>In re Marriage of Elkins, </em>28 Cal.App.3d 899 [105 Cal.Rptr. 59], which also impinges upon the validity of the property settlement in this case as a disposition of respondent\u2019s rights to the pension benefits. In <em>Elkins, </em>the property settlement agreement, which did not disclose the existence of pension rights on the basis of \u201c[a]n undisclosed oral \u2018side agreement\u2019 \u201d (28 Cal.App.3d at p. 903), was held to constitute \u201ca deception upon the court\u201d <em>(id.), </em>and the denial of a motion to vacate the judgment \u201cinsofar as the division of community property is concerned\u201d (28 Cal..App.3d at p. 904), was reversed. The court said (28 Cal.App.3d at p. 903): \u201cWe deem such an undisclosed agreement to be against public policy because of the inherent deception and because of the positive terms of the statute, and to create no rights for either party to the unmentioned community property. Indeed, it has long been the rule that property which is not mentioned in the pleadings as community property is left unadjudicated by decree of divorce, and is subject to future litigation, the parties being tenants in common meanwhile. <em>(Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>202 Cal. 312 [260 P. 545]; <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>66 Cal.App.2d 549 [152 P.2d 530]; <em>Estate of Williams, </em>36 Cal.2d 289 [223 P.2d 248, 22 A.L.R.2d 716]; <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>12 Cal.App.3d 1164, 1168 [91 Cal.Rptr. 372]; <em>In re Marriage of Karlin, </em>24 Cal.App.3d 25, 34 [101 Cal.Rptr. 240].) But under the Family Law Act there is no other disposition possible, once the community character of the property has been established, as it has been in the case before us, and no written contract having been made, than to make the division required by Civil Code section 4800, subdivision (a). If it were not so, the parties themselves could virtually write an exception to section 4800, in addition to those which the Legislature has made (written agreement or oral stipulation in open court), namely, an oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>agreement made privately and not in open court. A fair reading of the section shows that it was at least one intention of the Legislature that oral agreements, such as the one asserted by respondent herein, should not be effectual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The rule stated in <em>Elkins </em>is approved by our Supreme Court in the opinion in <em>In re Marriage of Brown, </em>15 Cal.3d 838, 851 [126 Cal.Rptr. 633, 544 P.2d 561].</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Petitioner seeks to avoid the effect of the rule requiring full disclosure of all community assets on the basis of the amendments to the California Civil Code, effective January 1, 1975, whereby both spouses were given management and control of the community property in lieu of the husband\u2019s exclusive management and control which existed at the time the above cases were decided. Petitioner asserts in this connection that these modifications were \u201cspecifically made retroactive to indicate that the husband no longer has management and control of the community property and it follows therefore that he is not in a fiduciary relationship with the wife, but rather that they operate at arms length and each stand in the same position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The Civil Code sections in question are sections 5125, relating to community personal property, and 5127, relating to community real property. The amendments to these sections, effective January 1, 1975, deleted the former provisions giving the husband management and control. Consistent therewith, section 5105 was simultaneously amended to delete the reference to \u201cthe management and control of the husband as is provided in sections 5125 and 5127.\u201d  Petitioner\u2019s assertion, however, that these amendments operate retroactively to validate the marital settlement agreement made in this case in 1974 is without foundation. Both sections 5125 and 5127 are specifically made applicable to property \u201cwhether acquired before or after January 1, 1975.\u201d (Stats. 1974, ch. 1206, \u00a7 1, p. 2609.) That is the extent of their retroactivity. Section 7 of Statutes 1974, chapter 1206, page 2609, which enacted the amendments to sections 5125 and 5127, specifically provides: \u201cThis act shall not apply to or affect any act or transaction which occcurred prior to January 1, 1975.\u201d Consideration must also be given in this respect to the provisions of section 3 of the Civil Code which states: \u201cNo part of it is retroactive, unless expressly so declared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">We, therefore, conclude that as of the time the marital settlement agreement was executed and as of the time petitioner procured the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>interlocutory decree herein, he was under a fiduciary duty to disclose the existence of all community assets, and his failure to disclose the existence of the retirement benefits constituted a constructive fraud upon respondent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Having concluded that the court properly found the existence of extrinsic fraud justifying the exercise of the court\u2019s equity power to vacate the judgment, it is unnecessary to discuss the other findings upon which the order was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The facts set forth in respondent\u2019s declaration do not establish laches as a matter of law. From respondent\u2019s statement that she first consulted an attorney in March 1975, after entering into the marital settlement agreement in 1974 without benefit of counsel, it may be inferred that she did not appreciate her rights until that time. Her delay thereafter to avoid interfering with the oldest child\u2019s marriage does not justify petitioner\u2019s characterization \u201cthat she had a lackadaisical attitude toward this whole matter.\u201d A delay from April to August in 1975 did not require the court to deny relief based upon laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Petitioner\u2019s claim of prejudice \u201cthat it will be time consuming and cause him great expense in relitigating the whole issue of dissolution of marriage and community property rights\u201d is not prejudice arising out of delay. Such prejudice would result whenever the decree was set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Cobey, Acting P. J., and Allport, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-10\">The entire superior court file has been transmitted to this court and made a part of the record of this appeal pursuant to rule 12(a), California Rules of Court, and pursuant to respondent\u2019s motion to augment the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b167-9\">We do not mean to suggest that these amendments, if applicable, would destroy the husband\u2019s fiduciary duty to the wife. Under the circumstances, it is unnecessary to decide that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
