Moulton, on July 24, 1923. After Eliot\u2019s death in 1973, the trustee petitioned the probate court for instructions concerning the distribution of the trust corpus. The court ordered the trust property distributed to Pamela Beddoe as the surviving \u201clawful issue\u201d of Eliot, who had adopted her as an adult in 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">The alternate remaindermen under the will, entitled to take the property in the event Eliot died leaving no widow and no surviving \u201clawful issue,\u201d are Beatrice B. Morse, Japsay Lockett Sears, Sally Cudlip, Marion Franzen, Howard Potter and Stephen Potter (respectively the daughter, the nephew, and the issue of stepsons of the testatrix). They contend Pamela was not \u201clawful issue\u201d as that term was used in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">Few facts are in dispute. Mrs. Moulton\u2019s will was drawn by a competent, duly licensed, California attorney. When the will was executed in 1923, there was no statutory procedure in California for the adoption of an adult. However, adult adoptions were allowed in at least 13 other states, including New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Texas. Not until the enactment of Civil Code section 227p in 1951 could the adoption of an adult be accomplished in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">The testatrix was married three times and had two children by her first marriage: Eliot Beddoe and Beatrice B. Morse. It appears that Eliot was inept at handling money and was considered by his mother to be a wastrel. The testatrix had acquired her wealth from her second husband, Potter, who himself had two children by a former marriage: Jack Potter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>and Rowland Potter. When she executed the will, she was married to Everett H. Moulton.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">Under the will Beatrice received a certain share of the residue outright when she attained the age of 40, but the share allocated to Eliot was placed in trust, giving him the income for life but no power to invade the corpus and no power of appointment. To provide for disposition of the corpus and accumulated income on Eliot\u2019s death Paragraph Third of the will set out four alternatives:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-5\">(1) If Eliot should leave no widow but leave lawful issue, the property was to be distributed to such issue, their heirs and assigns, share and share alike;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-6\">(2) If Eliot should leave both a widow and surviving lawful issue, the property Was to be distributed one-half to the widow, her heirs and assigns, and one-half to the lawful issue, share and share alike;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-7\">(3) If Eliot should leave a widow but no surviving lawful issue, the property was to be distributed to the widow, her heirs and assigns;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-8\">(4) If Eliot should die leaving no widow and no surviving \u201clawful issue,\" then the trust was to continue, giving Beatrice and Mr. Moulton each one-half of the income for life, and on their deaths, the principal was to be distributed to the two former stepsons and the brother of the testatrix.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">Paragraph Fourth of the will stated: \u201cAll distributions to the lawful issue of any said children shall be per stirpes and not per capita, and the children of any deceased child or grandchild shall take the share that their parent would have received if living.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">When the testatrix died in 1929, Eliot was unmarried and without children, and there was no person then in existence who qualified as his \u201clawful issue.\" He later married and divorced five wives but had no natural children. In 1939 he married the mother of respondent Pamela, then 10 years old. During the 16 years that marriage lasted, Eliot treated Pamela as his own daughter and often asked her if she would like him to adopt her, and other relatives accepted her as one of the family. Eliot adopted Pamela in 1969 in San Diego County (Sup. Ct. No. A-11811). By then he was 78 years old and living in a convalescent home, and she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>40. The following year he married his fifth wife but later obtained a divorce. He was unmarried when he died on December 5, 1973. There was evidence Eliot told his fifth wife he had adopted Pamela to keep his sister Beatrice from getting their mother\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">On this appeal from the order instructing the trustee to distribute the corpus of the trust to Pamela, the issue is the proper interpretation of the words \u201clawful issue\u201d as used by Madeleine Moulton in her will. Appellants contend she intended to exclude adult adoptees because adult adoptions were not possible in California during her lifetime. They maintain Eliot\u2019s adoption of Pamela after she became an adult was an attempt to rewrite the will and defeat the intent of the testatrix. They further contend the court\u2019s findings do not support its conclusions of law and its order, and therefore a reversal is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The paramount rule in the construction of wills, to which all other rules must yield, is that the intention of the testator as expressed in the will must be given <em>effect </em>as far as possible (Prob. Code, \u00a7 101; <em>Estate of Russell, 69 </em>Cal.2d 200, 205-206 [70 Cal.Rptr. 561, 444 P.2d 353]).  Where a will has been drafted by one skilled in the law, it may be assumed that technical legal terms have been used in their technical legal sense (Prob. Code, \u00a7 106, formerly Civ. Code, \u00a7 1327; <em>Estate of Bourn, </em>25 Cal.App.2d 590, 595 [78 P.2d 193]).  Unless the will expresses a contrary intent, the court must also assume the will was intended to be compatible with existing statutes, case law and public policy <em>(Estate of Heard, </em>49 Cal.2d 514, 521-522 [319 P.2d 637]).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">When the testatrix in this case executed the will her attorney prepared for her in 1923, Civil Code section 1334 stated: <em>\u201c[A] testamentary disposition </em>to \u2018heirs,\u2019 \u2018relations,\u2019 \u2018nearest relatives,\u2019 \u2018representatives,\u2019 \u2018legal representatives,\u2019 \u2018personal representatives,\u2019 or \u2018family,\u2019 <em>\u2018issue,\u2019 </em>\u2018descendants,\u2019 \u2018nearest\u2019 or \u2018next of kin\u2019 <em>of any person, </em>without other words of qualification, and when the terms are used as words of donation, and not of limitation, <em>vests the property in those who would be entitled to succeed to the property of such person, according to the provisions of the Title on Succession, in this Code.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, it had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>established by California case law that the word \u201cissue\u201d included both adopted and natural children for purposes of inheritance <em>(In re Newman </em>(1888) 75 Cal. 213, 219 [16 P. 887]).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Thus at the time the will was executed, a testamentary disposition to \u201clawful issue,\u201d by statutory definition of that term (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1334), vested the property in the person or persons entitled to succeed under the laws of intestacy, and California case law had established that adoptive, as well as natural claimants, were entitled to succeed <em>(Wells Fargo Bank </em>v. <em>Huse, </em>57 Cal.App.3d 927, 935 [129 Cal.Rptr. 522]). In leaving a gift to the \u201clawful issue\u201d of Eliot, the testatrix must be presumed to have been aware of and to have intended the legal consequences which flowed from the use of that term unless she expressed a contrary intent in the will. By failing to do so, she, in effect, made Civil Code section 1334 and the statute of succession a part of her will <em>(Estate of Watts, </em>179 Cal. 20, 22 [175 P. 415]).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The gift to \u201clawful issue\u201d was a gift to a class, and since there was no one in existence who fit that description when the testatrix died, the interest given the class was a contingent remainder. The gift was in fact subject to two conditions: first, that Eliot acquire \u201clawful issue,\u201d and second, that one or more members of that class survive him. Accordingly, the share of each member of the class was not determinable until Eliot\u2019s death. (Former Civ. Code, \u00a7 1337, now Prob. Code, \u00a7 123; <em>Estate of Ghiglia, </em>42 Cal.App.3d 433, 438 [116 Cal.Rptr. 827]; <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>229 Cal.App.2d 532, 537 [40 Cal.Rptr. 393].)</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Having concluded the words chosen by the testatrix designated the remaindermen who would take the trust corpus upon Eliot\u2019s death as the person or persons who would succeed to <em>his </em>property under the laws of intestacy, we are confronted with the pivotal question of whether the laws of succession which existed in the testatrix\u2019 time, or those which were in existence at the time of Eliot\u2019s death, are applicable. Apparently this precise question has not been answered in California. In other jurisdictions, however, when a will has left a remainder to the \u201cheirs\u201d of a life tenant, the majority of courts have held the statute should be applied as of the time of the life tenant\u2019s death. (See 80 Am.Jur.2d, Wills, \u00a7 1441; 96 C.J.S., Wills, \u00a7 695(5)e; also see Annot. at 139 A.L.R. 1107, 1111 et seq.) Taking a similar view, the Restatement of Property states in section 308: \u201cWhen a limitation is in favor of the \u2018heirs,\u2019 \u2018heirs of the body,\u2019 \u2018next of kin\u2019 or \u2018relatives\u2019 of a designated person, or in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>other groups described by words of similar import, and the persons who come within the term employed to describe the conveyees are to be determined by a statute governing the intestate succession of property, then the statute is applied as of the death of the designated ancestor, unless an intent of the conveyor to have the statute applied as of some other date is found from additional language or circumstances.\u201d (Rest., Property, \u00a7 308, p. 1706.) This section of the Restatement has been cited with approval in <em>Estate of Miner, </em>214 Cal.App.2d 533, 540 [29 Cal.Rptr. 601], and <em>Estate of Liddle, 162 </em>Cal.App.2d 7, 18 [328 P.2d 35],</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">The applicable rule is stated in Liddle: \u201c \u2018Normally, when a gift has been made to the \u201cheirs\u201d or \u201cnext of kin\u201d of a named individual, the donor has said in effect that he wants the property distributed as the law would distribute it if the named person died intestate. Accordingly, the normal time for applying the statute of descent or distribution is at the death of the named individual. This is, however, merely a rule of construction, and if the testator or grantor manifests an intention that the statute be applied either at an earlier or a later time, such intention will be given effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Estate of Liddle, supra, 162 </em>Cal.App.2d 7, 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">It is not significant that the terms used in the above quotation were \u201cheirs\u201d and \u201cnext of kin\u201d as distinguished from the words \u201clawful issue\u201d used in the will under consideration here. All three terms were equated in Civil Code section 1334 which specifically declared a testamentaiy disposition to any of them vested the property in those who were entitled to take under the law of succession. <em>(Wells Fargo Bank </em>v. <em>Huse, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.3d 927, 935.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   Because adults were adoptable, and entitled to inherit from their adopting parents in 1973 (see Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 221, 228), the trust corpus was properly distributed to Pamela Beddoe as the \u201clawful issue\u201d of Eliot at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Nothing expressed in the will suggests the testatrix would have wished any different result. The fact Eliot\u2019s widow (had he left one and no lawful issue) would have taken the entire remainder under the will shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>she did not intend to reserve the property for blood relatives, either her own or Mr. Potter\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">Appellants contend California cases have established that the phrase \u201clawful issue\u201d as used by a pre-1951 testator excludes adult adoptees. They cite <em>Abramovic </em>v. <em>Brunken, </em>16 Cal.App.3d 719 [94 Cal.Rptr. 303], <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>15 Cal.App.3d 381 [93 Cal.Rptr. 107], and <em>Estate of McCormack, </em>2 Cal.App.3d 492 [82 Cal.Rptr. 651]. The cases are not in point and thus not controlling. The critical date is not 1951 but 1931, the year the word \u201cissue\u201d was deleted when Civil Code section 1334 became Probate Code section 108. In each of the cases cited by appellants, Civil Code section 1334 was inapplicable. In both the <em>Abramovic </em>and <em>McCormack </em>cases dispositions were made which depended upon the meaning of the word \u201cissue\u201d but the wills were executed after the 1931 change in the statute. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ward, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.3d 381, involved a pre-1931 will but the devise was to \u201cchildren,\u201d a word never on the statutory list contained in Civil Code section 1334.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">There is no merit to appellants\u2019 contention that Civil Code section 1334 does not apply because the testatrix used the words \u201clawful issue\u201d as words of limitation, and not of purchase. The words \u201clawful issue\u201d are not used in the will to denote the duration of Eliot\u2019s estate in the property, but rather to designate the person or persons who are to take the remainder upon Eliot\u2019s death. Hence they are words of purchase or donation and not of limitation (Prob. Code, \u00a7 108, formerly Civ. Code, \u00a7 1335; Black\u2019s Law Dict. (4th ed.) pp. 1077, 1399; <em>Dickey </em>v. <em>Walrond, </em>200 Cal. 335, 340-342 [ 253 P. 706]).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Appellants argue Civil Code section 1334 is inapplicable because Paragraph Fourth of the will shows the testatrix used the word \u201cissue\u201d to mean \u201cchildren.\u201d We reject the suggestion. The only purpose of Paragraph Fourth was to assure that any distribution to \u201clawful issue\u201d under Paragraph Third would be \u201cper stirpes\u201d rather than \u201cper capita,\u201d and then to illustrate the meaning of the term \u201cper stirpes\u201d in layman\u2019s language. In both paragraphs the term \u201clawful issue\u201d was used as a technical term which had a statutory definition by virtue of Civil Code section 1334.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Contrary to appellants\u2019 final contention, reversal is not required because the court, despite their request, failed to make a finding concerning the meaning the testatrix intended the term \u201clawful issue\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>have. No extrinsic evidence was introduced bearing on the testatrix\u2019 intent, and consequently there was no conflicting evidence on the issue. Under these circumstances, construction of the will to ascertain intent is solely a judicial function, and an appellate court can make its own independent interpretation of the document <em>(Estate of Russell, supra, 69 </em>Cal.2d 200, 213; <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Bristol Development Co., </em>62 Cal.2d 861 [44 Cal.Rptr. 767, 402 P.2d 839]). Accordingly, no finding on the issue of intent was required and no prejudice resulted from the lack of one.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Brown (Gerald), P.J., and Coughlin, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b28-10\">In 1931, eight years after the will in question was executed, Civil Code section 1334 was transferred to the Probate Code, becoming section 108, and the word \u201cissue\u201d was deleted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Except for the fact it involved minor adoptees, <em>Wells Fargo Bank </em>v. <em>Huse, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.3d 927, is remarkably similar to this case. To the extent the last paragraph in the opinion could be taken to indicate the result <em>might </em>have been different had an adult adoptee been involved, we think it important to point out that the trial court in this case <em>rejected </em>appellants\u2019 requested finding that Eliot\u2019s \u2019\u2019motive for adopting Pamela Beddoe was to defeat the remainder interest granted to his sister, Beatrice B. Morse, and others in the trust created by the Will of Madeleine L. Moulton.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Retired Associate Justice of the Court of Appeal sitting under assignment by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
