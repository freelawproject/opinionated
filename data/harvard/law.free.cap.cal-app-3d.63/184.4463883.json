Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1089, 1105, 1108) be filed by October 26. Because of a showing made by R.P.I. (plaintiff) we advanced oral argument to our October 13 calendar and, at oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>argument R.P.I.\u2019s counsel stated that he intended his various memoranda be considered by us as his \u201creturn\u201d to the petition for a writ. We have so considered them.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">R.P.I. served Cohen\u2019s attorney with a request for admissions. Defendant apparently intended to make a denial of requests for admissions Nos. 2-35, but denied the same on information and belief. R.P.I. moved the trial court for an order under Code of Civil Procedure, section 2034, subdivision (a), that the facts be deemed admitted and for attorneys\u2019 fees. Petitioner, in opposition, filed a declaration showing that petitioner\u2019s counsel was ignorant of Los Angeles Superior Court Discovery Procedure Manual, 271 D1 and 271 D2<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and asked the court for permission to amend Cohen\u2019s answers to plaintiff\u2019s request for admissions by admitting requested admissions Nos. 2, 3, 6, 10, 11, 12, 18, 27 and 31 and by denying Nos. 21, 22, 23, 24, 29 and 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The trial court granted R.P.I.\u2019s motion and stated to defense counsel that , the proper procedure would be for a motion to be filed under Code of Civil Procedure, section 473. Petitioner filed such a motion, but it was denied. Hence, this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Code of Civil Procedure, section 2034, subdivision (a), states in part, that: \u201cUpon the refusal ... of a party to admit or deny . . . the truth of any matters of fact. . . the party serving such request may . . . make [an] application for an order requiring further answers to such request or, in the alternative, for an order that the . . . truth of said matters of fact be deemed admitted for the purpose of the action. ... If the motion is granted and if the court <em>finds </em>that the refusal or failure was without substantial justification the court may require the refusing . . . party . . . and the party or attorney advising the refusal... or either of them to pay the examining party the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining the order, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Since we are not furnished with a copy of the court\u2019s order, we will assume that the trial court made the finding required by Code of Civil Procedure, section 2034, subdivision (a). Nevertheless, and despite this assumption, and that Code of Civil Procedure, section 2034, subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>(a), authorizes the punishment imposed, we conclude that the punishment was too severe, under the foregoing circumstances. Thus, while petitioner is not to be excused for failing to be aware of the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure, section 2033 or of Los Angeles Superior Court section 271, we consider that the trial court abused its discretion by denying petitioner\u2019s motion under Code of Civil Procedure, section 473. Thus, Code of Civil Procedure, section 2033, subdivision (a) states, in part, that: \u201cEach of the matters of which an admission is requested shall be deemed admitted unless . . . the party to whom the request is directed files and serves upon the party requesting the admission either (1) a sworn statement denying specifically the matters of which an admission is requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why he cannot truthfully admit or deny those matters . . . .\u201d While it is true that a reasonable investigation is required to be made, <em>(Chodos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1963) 215 Cal.App.2d 318, 323 [30 Cal.Rptr. 303]) to enable a party to set \u201cat rest a triable issue so that it will not have to be tried,\u201d <em>(Cembrook </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 423, 429 [15 Cal.Rptr. 127, 364 P.2d 303]) it is not true (at least no cases are cited by the R.P.I./plaintiff and see <em>Holguin </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 812, 820 [99 Cal.Rptr. 653]) that a denial for lack of information or belief is valueless, despite Los Angeles Superior Court section 271 D2. In addition, R.P.I./plaintiff is not prejudiced by petitioner\u2019s denials, since R.P.I. already had learned of petitioner\u2019s intention to deny portions of the \u201cRequest for Admissions.\u201d If R.P.I./plaintiff prevails at the trial on the issues thus presented, and if the trial court finds that there were no good reasons for denials of matters of substantial importance, he may have a remedy.
