Additionally, appellant alleged that under paragraph 13 of the parties\u2019 contract and section 1717 of the Civil Code, he was entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in the sum of $8,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>At a pretrial conference on May 19, 1975, the trial court disallowed appellant\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees. The case proceeded to trial, and on May 30, 1975, the jury returned a verdict in favor of appellant in the sum of $7,589.26. Thereafter, on June 17, 1975, the court entered judgment. Appellant appeals from that portion of the judgment disallowing attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The sole issue on this appeal is whether section 1717 of the Civil Code requires an award of attorney\u2019s fees to appellant. Section 1717, in pertinent part, reads as follows: \u201cIn any action on a contract, where such contract specifically provides that attorney\u2019s fees and costs, <em>which are incurred to enforce the provisions of such contract, </em>shall be awarded to one of the parties, the prevailing party, whether he is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in addition to costs and necessaiy disbursements.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Thus, the resolution of this issue turns on whether or not the contract between appellant and respondent provided for attorney\u2019s fees in an action to enforce the provisions of the contract. The pertinent provisions of the contract provide: \u201c13. Subcontractor\u2019s Liability Insurance, Indemnity: . . . [The first paragraph of this section requires the subcontractor to maintain insurance to protect him from claims arising under workers\u2019 compensation laws, and from tort claims arising from damage to property or from bodily injury or death. The second paragraph continues as follows.]</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">\u201cThe Subcontractor shall indemnify and hold and save Larwin harmless from and against any and all actions or causes of action, claims, demands, liabilities, loss, damage or expense of whatsoever kind and nature, <em>including counsel or attorneys\u2019 fees, </em>whether incurred under retainer or salary or otherwise, <em>which Larwin shall or may at any time sustain or incur by reason or in consequence of any injury or damage to person or property </em>which may arise directly or indirectly from the performance of this Contract by the Subcontractor, whether such performance be by himself or by any subcontractor of his, or anyone directly or indirectly employed by either of them.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">In construing the contract, the trial court concluded: \u201cThere\u2019s no general provision anywhere in this contract... for attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the trial court based this conclusion on its interpretation of the contract language without receiving extrinsic evidence, the appellate court is not bound by that conclusion, but must give the writing its own interpretation <em>(Parsons </em>v. <em>Bristol Development Co. </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 861, 865-866 [44 Cal.Rptr. 767, 402 P.2d 839]; <em>Estate of Platt </em>(1942) 21 Cal.2d 343, 352 [131 P.2d 825]; <em>Davies Machinery Co. </em>v. <em>Pine Mountain Club, Inc. </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 18, 23 [113 Cal.Rptr. 784]; <em>Estate of Shannon </em>(1965) 231 Cal.App.2d 886, 890-891 [42 Cal.Rptr. 278]). In doing so, we agree with the trial court\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">While paragraph 13 of the contract provides for attorneys\u2019 fees in certain situations, it does not specifically provide for attorneys\u2019 fees <em>in an action on the contract </em>as is required to trigger operation of section 1717 of the Civil Code. Reading the entire paragraph 13 is h\u00e9lpful in interpreting the provision for attorneys\u2019 fees. Since the heading reads \u201cSubcontractor\u2019s Liability Insurance, Indemnity,\u201d and since the first paragraph deals with tort claims of third parties, the reasonable and logical interpretation of the second paragraph is that it provides for attorneys\u2019 fees in third party tort actions (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1643). Reading the second paragraph of paragraph 13 as covering \u201cactions on the contract\u201d would render it inconsistent with the balance of paragraph 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Taylor, P. J., and Rouse, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
