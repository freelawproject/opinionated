Westoby first contends that the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted, \u201cbecause there was insufficient evidence from which to conclude that defendant possessed a destructive device <em>in a reckless or malicious manner. </em>\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">Substantial evidence (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>71 Cal.2d 745, 755 [79 Cal.Rptr. 529, 457 P.2d 321]) was admitted at the trial from which the jury could reasonably have found the following to be true. Westoby had fashioned, and possessed under the charged circumstances, a pipe bomb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>complete with explosive contents, timer switch, batteries, and wires connected with an inside flashcube. With the wires in place a closing of the timer switch would have caused the device to explode.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Westoby\u2019s contention is based upon evidence that when the device was found, it was \u201cbelieved that one of the battery wires was disconnected,\u201d and that the timer had not been set; thus making it \u201creadily apparent that the device . . . was inoperative and inert,\u201d since it \u201ccould not have been exploded without reconnecting the loose battery wire and setting the timer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The contention is patently without validity. A similar contentio\u00f1 was found to be without merit in <em>People </em>v. <em>Heideman, </em>58 Cal.App.3d 321 [130 Cal.Rptr. 349]. One need not possess a destructive device already set to explode in order to violate Penal Code section 12303.2. The jury could reasonably have determined that Westoby\u2019s possession was either reckless <em>or </em>malicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">II.  It is next urged that the court erred in not instructing the jury, <em>sua sponte, </em>on an additional lesser and included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">There appear to be two lesser offenses necessarily included within the offense of <em>recklessly or maliciously </em>having in one\u2019s possession a <em>destructive device and explosive, </em>of which Westoby was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">One is the offense <em>here mentioned for the first time, </em>that proscribed by Penal Code section 12303, which provides that: \u201cAny person ... who ... possesses any destructive device .. . shall be punished by imprisonment . . . .\u201d This offense is distinguishable from.section 12303.2, in that the requirement that the possession be \u201creckless or malicious\u201d is absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">The other lesser and included offense is that of which the jury found Westoby not guilty. It is proscribed, as noted, by <em>Health and Safety Code </em>section 12305, which states: \u201cEvery perso\u00f1 not in the lawful possession of an explosive who knowingly has any explosive in his possession is guilty of a felony.\u201d In this offense also, the requirement of recklessness or maliciousness is missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">It will be seen that one who recklessly or maliciously possesses a destructive device (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12303.2) necessarily possesses the explosive contained therein, for without it there could be no destructive device.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>The jury, permitted to find that Westoby possessed a destructive device with its explosive, but without recklessness or maliciousness (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 12305), did not do so. Instead they found that he had possessed the destructive device with its explosive contents, recklessly or maliciously (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12303.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Westoby\u2019s instant contention that the trial court should, <em>sua sponte, </em>have instructed the jury on the included offense of Penal Code section 12303, is valid.  There is an obligation to instruct <em>sua sponte </em>on all lesser and necessarily included offenses \u201cwhen the evidence raises a question as to whether all of the elements of the [greater] charged offense were present....\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sedeno, </em>10 Cal.3d 703, 715 [112 Cal.Rptr. 1, 518 P.2d 913].)  Here the prosecutor in charging, and the trial court by instructing on, the Health and Safety Code section 12305 offense, obviously concluded that the evidence would support a finding that Westoby had not acted recklessly or maliciously.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">But the jury by their verdict necessarily concluded, on substantial evidence, that Westoby had in fact acted recklessly or maliciously. In a not dissimilar context, the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Sedeno, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 703, 721, stated: \u201c[I]n some circumstances it is possible to determine that although an instruction on a lesser included offense was erroneously omitted, the factual question posed by the omitted instruction was necessarily resolved adversely to the defendant under other, properly given instructions. In such cases the issue should not be deemed to have been removed from the jury\u2019s consideration since it has been resolved in another context, and there can be no prejudice to the defendant since the evidence that would support a finding that only the lesser offense was committed has been rejected by the jury.\u201d In the instant case, it must reasonably be said that any evidence or inference \u201cthat would support a finding that only the lesser offense was committed [had] been rejected by the jury.\u201d We accordingly find the rationale of <em>People </em>v. <em>Sede\u00f1o, supra, </em>applicable to Westoby\u2019s instant contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">III.  The stated charge against Westoby, of which he was found guilty, was that he had violated \u201cPenal Code Sec. 12303.2 (possession of destructive device\u2014pipe bomb),\u201d in that he \u201cdid recklessly or maliciously have in his possession a destructive device and explosive on a public street and highway, and near a private habitation, and in a public place ordinarily passed by human beings.\u201d The jury\u2019s verdict recited that he was found guilty of \u201ca violation of California Penal Code Section 12303.2, possession of destructive device-pipe bomb.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>The verdict was not \u201cuncertain,\u201d as insisted by Westoby. \u201c \u2018The form of the verdict is regarded as immaterial so long as the juiy\u2019s intention to convict of the crime charged under the allegations of the information is unmistakably expressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Savala, 2 </em>Cal.App.3d 415, 419 [82 Cal.Rptr. 647] [disapproved on other grounds, <em>People </em>v. <em>Beagle, </em>6 Cal.3d 441, 452 (99 Cal.Rptr. 313, 492 P.2d 1)].)  \u201c[W]hen the judgment record, by reference to the indictment, information or complaint, to which reference is specifically made, sufficiently shows the offense of which a defendant has been convicted, and for which he is sentenced, the reference to or description of the offense is sufficient, and . . . the defendant is not prejudiced by inaccurate statements with relation thereto, and the judgment is not void on that account.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>80 Cal.App.2d 691, 695 [181 P.2d 958].) The jury\u2019s intent to convict Westoby of the greater Penal Code section 12303.2 offense is manifest.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">It was not necessary, at least in the context of this case, that the jury be required to agree alternatively on whether the thing possessed was a destructive device <em>or </em>an explosive, and on whether Westoby acted recklessly <em>or </em>maliciously. In such a situation \u201cit is not necessary that all jurors agree on one or more of several theories proposed by the prosecution; it is sufficient that each juror is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of [the offense as] defined by the statute.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Milan, 9 </em>Cal.3d 185, 195 [107 Cal.Rptr. 68, 507 P.2d 956].) \u201cThere is no merit to the argument that the jury should have been instructed to agree unanimously about defendant\u2019s mens rea before finding him guilty. In the context of the offense charged, a person who possesses an explosive either maliciously or recklessly is equally culpable because in either case he creates an unacceptably high risk of harm to the community.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Heideman, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.3d 321, 333.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">IV.  It is next urged by Westoby that the court erred in allowing the introduction of the \u201cpolice experiments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Upon being found, the subject pipe bomb was opened and examined by one who thereafter was a witness at the trial. When the police were later notified, some of its parts and ingredients had been thrown away. One of the parts, according to the witness, was the flashcube which could not be found. A police officer thereafter conducted tests with different types of flashcubes and found that one type would ignite, or blow up, a device such as that in issue. He also reconstructed the device from other of its parts and ingredients which were found and from the witness\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>description, and was able to \u201cblow up\u201d the device. He testified concerning these experiments, over Westoby\u2019s objection, at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">It is argued that the information upon which the experiments were made was unreliable, and that \u201cthe conditions of the experiment were [not] substantially similar to those which gave rise to the issue on which the evidence [was] offered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The trial court had broad discretion in determining whether to admit or exclude experimental evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>40 Cal.2d 483, 491 [254 P.2d 501]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>203 Cal. 628, 633 [265 P. 818]; Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) \u00a7 648, pp. 609-610.) We observe no abuse of discretion. And we note that such shortcomings as are now complained about were apparent to the jury, which presumably considered them in weighing the experiments\u2019 probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">V.  Westoby next argues that Penal Code section 12311, prohibiting a grant of probation to persons convicted of violating Penal Code section 12303.2, constitutes cruel and unusual p\u00fcnishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">This contention also, is invalid. We opine that the statutory denial of probation is reasonable in relation to the magnitude of the offense. Even if \u201creasonable men differ as to whether the punishment here is proportionate to the crime we must defer to the Legislature, for it has the \u2018broadest discretion possible ... in specifying punishment for crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Foss, </em>10 Cal.3d 910, 937 [112 Cal.Rptr. 649, 519 P.2d 1073].) And we note that: \u201c[C]ourts have no inherent power to grant probation\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clay, </em>18 Cal.App.3d 964, 969 [96 Cal.Rptr. 213]); the power is wholly statutory <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>172 Cal.App.2d 30, 34 [342 P.2d 410]; <em>People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>37 Cal.App. 192, 197 [174 P. 102]). \u201c \u2018Clothed with the power to prescribe penalties for violations of criminal statutes, it necessarily follows that the legislative branch of the government has the power to declare that in certain of these cases, probation may not be granted.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bennett </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>131 Cal.App.2d 841, 845 [281 P.2d 285]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hess, </em>104 Cal.App.2d 642, 685 [234 P.2d 65].)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">VI. Nor is merit seen in the contention that the penalty provisions of Penal Code section 12303.2 deny Westoby equal protection of the law. The point is unsupported by authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>VII.  We do not find, as is lastly contended by Westoby, that inadequacy of his trial representation reduced the \u201ctrial to \u2018a farce and a sham.\u2019 \u201d The complaint is of a failure to make certain motions and objections which in our opinion would have been without merit and denied. Westoby\u2019s trial representation was well within the standards of <em>People </em>v. <em>Ibarra, </em>60 Cal.2d 460, 464-466 [34 Cal.Rptr. 863, 386 P.2d 487], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>13 Cal.3d 749, 754-755 [119 Cal.Rptr. 705, 532 P.2d 857] (cert, den., 423 U.S. 860 [46 L.Ed.2d 88, 96 S.Ct. 115]).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">For the reasons stated in our opinion, the judgment is affirmed. The appeal, insofar as it purports to be from an order denying a new trial, is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Moli\u00f1ari, P. J., and Sims, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 27, 1977.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
