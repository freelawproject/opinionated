Her only heirs at law were appellant and John D\u2019lndia, her (Patricia\u2019s) husband and the respondent herein. Respondent was duly appointed administrator of Patricia\u2019s estate. In March 1973, acting as administrator and on behalf of Patricia\u2019s \u201cheirs\u201d pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 377,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he commenced an action for damages for her wrongful death against certain defendants allegedly responsible therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">By order entered in the estate proceedings in July 1974, upon respondent\u2019s petition, the probate court approved his execution of a negotiated settlement of the wrongful death action whereby he would receive the gross sum of $25,000 as administrator. The settlement having been executed, appellant filed in the probate court her petition for an \u201capportionment\u201d to her, as an \u201cheir\u201d of Patricia\u2019s and pursuant to section 377 (see fn. 1, <em>ante), </em>of the full $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">In a declaration filed with the petition, appellant alleged that by reason of Patricia\u2019s death she had suffered a loss of actual \u201csupport\u201d which she calculated at $5,700 upon the bases of her age (62) at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>of Patricia\u2019s death, her life expectancy thereafter (18.9 years), and the alleged fact that Patricia had theretofore been paying her $25 per month for her \u201csupport.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She further claimed $34,200 as the value of her loss of Patricia\u2019s \u201ccomfort and society,\u201d calculated over the same 18.9 years at the arbitrary rate of $1,500 per year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Her aggregate claim of \u201closses,\u201d in the amount of $39,900, thus accounted for her demand that the entire $25,000 be apportioned to her.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Appellant and several other witnesses testified at a hearing conducted by the probate court upon her petition. The court thereafter signed formal findings and conclusions, adverse to her, as to the losses of both \u201csupport\u201d and \u201ccomfort and society\u201d she claimed to have incurred by reason of Patricia\u2019s death.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judgment which followed ordered that appellant \u201ctake nothing by her petition,\u201d and that it was thereby \u201cdenied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>Appellant contends that the probate court erred, in denying her any apportionment, (1) because \u201c[t]he evidence established\u201d her loss of financial support which she had been receiving from Patricia in the latter\u2019s lifetime and (2) because \u201c[t]he evidence established\u201d that she \u201csustained a pecuniary loss, including love, affection, . . . [and similar factors]..in consequence of Patricia\u2019s death. (The quoted passages are from appellant\u2019s opening brief.) These contentions may not be sustained; we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-3\"><em>The Loss Of \u201cComfort And Society </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">We consider the second argument first.  Under California law, an heir is entitled to recover wrongful death damages for <em>pecuniary </em>loss alone. <em>(Estate of Riccomi </em>(1921) 185 Cal. 458, 461 [197 P. 97, 14 A.L.R. 509]; <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 690, 692 [36 Cal.Rptr. 321, 388 P.2d 353]; <em>Fields </em>v. <em>Riley </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 308, 313 [81 Cal.Rptr. 671]; 4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Torts, \u00a7 790, pp. 3087-3088.) For purposes of this rule, <em>pecuniary </em>loss may include the loss of such elements as personal companionship or society but only if\u2014and to the extent that\u2014it may reasonably be assessed in <em>pecuniary </em>terms under the evidence in the particular case. <em>(Fields </em>v. <em>Riley, supra, </em>at pp. 313-315; <em>Riley </em>v. <em>California Erectors, Inc. </em>(1973) 36 Cal.App.3d 29, 32 [111 Cal.Rptr. 459, 69 A.L.R.3d 1033]; <em>Mize </em>v. <em>Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 436, 453 [120 Cal.Rptr. 787].)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The Supreme Court of the United States obliquely referred to this limitation in <em>Sea-Land Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gaudet </em>(1974) 414 U.S. 573 [39 L.Ed.2d 9, 94 S.Ct. 1582], where it cited California law as permitting \u201crecovery \u00a1for the pecuniary value of the decedent\u2019s society.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 587, fn. 21 [39 L.Ed.2d at pp. 22-23].) The <em>Sea-Land </em>court went on to hold that \u201closs of society\u201d was compensable <em>as such </em>in the federal wrongful death action before it <em>(id., </em>at pp. 585-590 [39 L.Ed.2d at pp. 21-24]) and that the term included the loss of \u201clove,.affection, care, attention, companionship, comfort, and protection\u201d <em>(id, </em>at p. 585 [39 L.Ed.2d at pp. 21-22]): i.e., that \u201closs of society\u201d was compensable in the federal action without the <em>pecuniary </em>aspects thereof which California law requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The latter interpretation of the <em>Sea-Land </em>holding materialized in a subsequent federal decision which involved multiple wrongful death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>actions in an international and interstate context. <em>(In re Paris Air Crash of March 3, 1974 </em>(C.D.Cal. 1975) 399 F.Supp. 732.) The court there held that the California law of damages applied <em>(id., </em>at pp. 742, 743) and that the court would \u201cadopt the liberalization over California\u2019s interpretations of the phrase \u2018pecuniary loss\u2019 as laid down by the Supreme Court in <em>Sea-Land Services </em>v. <em>Gaudet . . . [supra] </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(In re Paris Air Crash, supra, </em>at p. 747.)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Appellant urges that this court \u201cadopt\u201d the liberalized <em>Sea-Land-Paris Air Crash </em>rule, which would mean that she could claim a right to apportionment, for the \u201closs of comfort and society\u201d which she suffered in fact, without the necessity of showing the <em>pecuniary </em>values thereof which California law requires. But the <em>Sea-Land </em>decision is limited to the wrongful death action it actually involved, which was brought under specific federal maritime law. <em>(Sea-Land Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gaudet, supra, </em>414 U.S. 573 at p. 574 [39 L.Ed.2d at p. 15].) The <em>Paris Air Crash </em>court did not disparage the \u201cpecuniary\u201d limitation of wrongful death damages under California law, but applied the more liberal <em>Sea-Land </em>definition of \u201closs of society\u201d because of the national interest of the United States <em>(In re Paris Air Crash, supra, </em>399 F.Supp. 732 at pp. 745-747) presented in an array of consolidated wrongful death actions which had infinite multinational and multistate ramifications. (See <em>id., </em>at pp. 735-736, 741-742.)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Both decisions are thus limited in their reach, and federal decisions are in no event controlling in matters of state law. (6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7 674, pp. 4587-4588.)  To establish a right to apportionment based upon the \u201closs of comfort and society\u201d she alleged, appellant therefore bore the burden of showing the <em>pecuniary </em>aspects of that loss which the California law of wrongful death damages requires. <em>(Fields </em>v. <em>Riley, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.3d 308 at p. 313.)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The conflicting evidence on this subject, as received at the hearing upon appellant\u2019s petition, involved only her and respondent\u2019s differing assessments of the closeness, and the endearing quality, of the relationship between her and Patricia. Whatever the reciprocal closeness of that relationship might have been, she presented no evidence which supported a <em>pecuniary </em>evaluation of her \u201closs\u201d of Patricia\u2019s \u201ccomfort and society\u201d beyond the purely arbitrary evaluation she had placed upon it in her declaration. (See fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>Fairly interpreted, the trial court\u2019s pertinent finding stated this. (See finding \u201cX.\u201d as quoted in fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>The finding means that appellant did not sustain her burden of showing a measurably <em>pecuniary </em>\u201closs of comfort and society\u201d which California law requires <em>(Fields </em>v, <em>Riley, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.3d 308 at pp. 313-315), and there is no occasion to disturb the finding on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">The <em>Loss Of \u201cSupport\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Appellant\u2019s contention as to what \u201c[t]he evidence established\u201d in her favor, upon this issue, translates into the arguments that she incurred a \u201closs of support\u201d by reason of Patricia\u2019s death <em>as, a matter of law </em>or, at least, that the evidence is insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s determination to the contrary. The arguments require a review of the evidence received at the hearing, which established the following facts without substantial dispute:</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Patricia had been the youngest of appellant\u2019s three daughters. The other two were \u201cEleanor\u201d and Barbara Benjamin.' Patricia married respondent in 1967. Except for a 10-month period during which they had separated in 1970 and 1971, they had lived^as husband andTvifer m Daly City, until Patricia died in 1972. She was continuously employed throughout the marriage, and Was receiving a net salary of $120 per week at the time of her death. Respondent was an art student during most of the marriage, but was intermittently employed as a part-time teamster.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">During the five-year period of Patricia\u2019s marriage, appellant variously lived with her (appellant\u2019s) brother in Escal\u00f3n, at her own home and with Barbara in San Francisco, and at Eleanor\u2019s home in San Rafael. Both Barbara and Eleanor were married and raising families during this period. Appellant\u2019s regular income consisted of monthly Social Security payments and a small pension ($58 per month) which she received as her late husband\u2019s widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">The evidence was in marked conflict as to the fact or amount of \u201csupport,\u201d if any, appellant had received from Patricia prior to the latter\u2019s death. Appellant testified that Patricia had regularly given her \u201c$25 a month\u201d throughout Patricia\u2019s marriage; that the payments were always made in cash; and that appellant had kept no record of them. Mrs. Niedomys, her friend, testified that she had seen Patricia give money to appellant on several occasions in Escal\u00f3n, where the witness had lived since 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>Respondent testified that he had never seen Patricia give money to appellant;, that he was never aware that she had done this; and that no such expenditures appeared to have been made from Patricia\u2019s income, most of which was deposited in bank accounts within his personal knowledge. He further testified that he had always been with Patricia on the very few occasions when she had been in the presence of Mrs. Niedomys in Escal\u00f3n.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">The evidence having been in conflict as indicated, it is obvious that appellant did not establish <em>as a matter of law </em>that she had suffered a pecuniary loss of \u201csupport\u201d in consequence of Patricia\u2019s death. Her alternative argument, as to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court\u2019s determination that she had incurred no such loss in point of fact, is subject to familiar rules which control appellate review and which appellant has ignored:</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">When a finding of fact is challenged upon the ground that the evidence is insufficient to sustain it, the power of an appellate court begins and ends with the determination whether there is <em>any </em>substantial evidence, contradicted or not, which supports the finding. <em>(Foreman &amp; Clark Corp. </em>v. <em>Fallon </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 875, 881 [92 Cal.Rptr. 162, 479 P.2d 362]; 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>Appeal, \u00a7 245, pp. 4236-4238. For the measure of \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d which will have this effect, see 6 Witkin, <em>loc. cit., </em>\u00a7 248, p. 4240.)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Appellant having attacked the trial court\u2019s pertinent findings upon this basis, she is required to set forth in her briefs <em>all </em>the material evidence on the subject and not merely her own evidence. Unless this is done (and appellant has clearly not done it here), the error claimed must be deemed waived. <em>(Foreman &amp; Clark Corp. </em>v. <em>Fallon, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 875 at p. 881.)  All issues of witness credibility are within the exclusive province of the trier of fact. <em>(Nestle </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 920, 925 [101 Cal.Rptr. 568, 496 P.2d 480], See 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>Appeal, \u00a7 246, pp. 4238-4239.)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">These rules are to be applied to the trial court\u2019s actual finding or findings adverse to appellant on the \u201closs of support\u201d issue. Its finding No. \u201cIX.\u201d (quoted in fn. 5, <em>ante) </em>does not squarely meet the issue because it refers to Patricia\u2019s frequent payments of \u201csmall sums of money\u201d to appellant without explicitly stating that they did not constitute \u201csupport.\u201d Appellant had proposed a finding that the payments <em>were </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>\u201csupport.\u201d An expressly negative finding would have been more to the point, we may not infer it because of appellant\u2019s explicit request for an affirmative finding (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 634), and the issue of \u201csupport\u201d was highly material.  We nevertheless perceive no reversible error, for failure to find on a material issue (see 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>Trial, \u00a7 337, pp. 3139-3140), for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">Appellant has not expressly claimed reversible error upon that ground. (See 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>Appeal, \u00a7 425, p. 4391.) Additionally, and irrespective of the shortcomings of finding IX., the trial court stated as a conclusion of law (No. 111) that appellant was \u201cnot entitled to apportionmentofthe lump sum settlement .T7T\u2019\u2019 (See in. 5, <em>ante.) </em>We may treat this statement as a finding of ultimate fact despite its designation as a conclusion of law. (4 Witkin, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>Trial, \u00a7 323, par. (1), p. 3127.) In light of its omnibus language, it includes a finding of the ultimate fact that appellant was \u201cnot entitled to apportionment\u201d because the payments of money she had received from Patricia did not constitute \u201csupport.\u201d The omnibus finding having been sufficient to support the judgment in this respect, the court\u2019s failure to have been more specific in finding No. X does not constitute prejudicial error. (4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>Trial, \u00a7 343, pp. 3144-3145.)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Whether we identify the decisive finding in the omnibus statement, or in a very liberal interpretation of finding No. IX, or in both, it is adverse to petitioner on the issue of pecuniary ^loss of support.\u201d  In either event, it is to be sustained on appeal because substantial evidence supports it. <em>(Foreman &amp; Clark Corp. </em>v. <em>Fallon, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 875 at p. 881; <em>Nestle </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d 920 at p. 925.)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Caldecott, P. J., and Christian, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-14\">As pertinent to this proceeding, the statute (hereinafter \u201csection 377\u201d) provided: \u201c377.

(See fn. 1, <em>ante.) </em>It has not been disputed at any point that she is an \u201cheir\u201d of Patricia\u2019s, which was established when one-half of Patricia\u2019s separate property was distributed to her in the estate proceedings as such. (See Prob. Code, \u00a7 223.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The arbitrary feature of this computation is shown in the actual allegations of appellant\u2019s declaration on the subject of her \u201closs\u201d of Patricia\u2019s \u201ccomfort and society,\u201d which read in full as follows: \u201cThe relationship between me and my daughter, the decedent, was a very close one. Since her marriage I saw her once or twice per week. We talked on the telephone almost every day. She visited me at my home\u2014she usually came alone and would stay about an hour unless we had dinner together. The <em>pecuniary loss </em>to me of the <em>comfort and society </em>of my daughter is inestimable. <em>My attorney informed me that at $1,500.00per year for my life expectancy this would amount to $34,200.00.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b796-7\">The amount actually subject to apportionment turned out to be $16,290.03, which represented the net balance of the $25,000 settlement proceeds after the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in the wrongful death action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b796-8\">The pertinent findings and conclusions were these:</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">\u201cFINDINGS OF FACT...</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">\u201cIX.
