J.</author>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">The petitioners in these consolidated proceedings under ORS 183.400 challenge the validity of the Land Conservation and Development Commission\u2019s \u201cAdministrative Rule for Application of the Statewide Planning Goals to the Incorporation of New Cities.\u201d OAR 660-14-000 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Petitioners first contend that the rule exceeds LCDC\u2019s statutory rule-making authority \u201cby requiring that exceptions be taken to Goals 3, <em>4, </em>11 and 14 before a county authorizes an incorporation election for a city on undeveloped lands outside an urban growth boundary.\u201d ORS 183.400(4) (b). Petitioners argue that the requirement has <em>no </em>basis in the goals and that, in substance, the portions of the rule that impose the requirement are <em>de facto </em>amendments to the goals that were not promulgated in accordance with the statutory procedure for goal amendments. Petitioners are correct. <em>1000 Friends of Oregon v. Wasco County Court, </em>299 Or 344, 361-70, 703 P2d 207 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Petitioners<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> contend next that LCDC also exceeded its statutory authority by adopting the sections of the rule which require cities and counties to assure that incorporations within acknowledged urban growth boundaries are consistent with applicable comprehensive plans. The thrust of petitioners\u2019 argument is that, in cases where local government boundary commissions have authority to approve or disapprove incorporation proposals, the rule effectively requires cities and counties to do what the relevant statutes give them no power to do. <em>See </em>ORS 199.410 <em>et seq. </em>Although susceptible to petitioners\u2019 reading, we are satisfied that, read as a whole, the rule effectively assigns responsibility to the boundary commissions under the circumstances petitioners describe and that it does not require counties and cities to do anything that they are powerless to do under those circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Petitioners filed their challenges to the rule long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>before the Supreme Court decided <em>1000 Friends of Oregon v. Wasco County Court, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This opinion decides only the specific issues that petitioners have raised concerning the rule\u2019s validity. Nothing in this opinion or our disposition should be understood as implying that LCDC\u2019s rule is valid in any respect that we have not expressly held it to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Rule held invalid in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-8\"> In <em>McKnight v. LCDC, </em>69 Or App 642, 687 P2d 170 (1984), <em>rev den </em>299 Or 522 (1985), we dismissed a petition challenging the validity of the temporary rule that OAR 660-14-000 <em>et seq </em>replaced on the ground that the adoption of the permanent rule mooted the challenge to its temporary predecessor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b677-9\"> The City of Rajneeshpuram has petitioned and appeared separately from the other petitioners. It does not join in the contention discussed in this paragraph.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b678-5\"> Because the decision in that case was likely to, and, in the event did, have a substantial bearing on the issues here, we deferred our decision until the Supreme Court had decided Wasco <em>County Court.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
