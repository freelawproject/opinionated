On June 21, 1979, Janice bought a pet skunk from defendant Perfected Pets, Inc., a pet shop in Portland. It had purchased the skunk earlier in June from defendants Taylor\u2019s Pets, Inc., and Robert and Joan Taylor (Taylor\u2019s Pets), who had raised it on their Minnesota pet farm. Janice kept the skunk in her house and occasionally took it to the homes of the other plaintiffs. Nine or ten days after Janice bought it, it began to attack and bite people, lose fur and develop sores on its body. It bit Paula. Although it did not bite Nora, she handled it, fed it and came into contact with its saliva. The skunk also did not bite Paula\u2019s 16-year-old brother, Brad, but he came in contact with the skunk\u2019s saliva, because he handled the skunk at a time when he had open cuts and scratches on his arms from cutting blackberry bushes. Moreover, during play, the skunk had licked Brad several times with its tongue and also had stuck its nose in Brad\u2019s mouth. The skunk bit Janice and Shirley, and Betty came in contact with its saliva.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Janice and Paula took the skunk back to Perfected Pets. Janice asked if she was caring for the animal properly. Perfected Pets advised Janice to change the skunk\u2019s diet and she took it home again. The new diet had no effect, however, and the skunk died nine or ten days later. Janice took it to a veterinarian for an autopsy. Both the Oregon State Health Division and the Washington State Health Department confirmed that it was rabid. Dr. Williams of the Oregon State Health Division testified that the skunk had probably been in the incubation stage of rabies when it had left the pet farm in Minnesota.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Until recently, prophylactic rabies treatments consisted of 21 daily injections of duck embryo vaccine with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>boosters.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Injections ordinarily were made in the abdomen. The shots could cause intense pain at the site of the injection, nausea, headaches, muscle aches and mild temperature elevations. Occasionally the shots caused anaphylactic shock and neuroparalytic accidents. If a person were infected with rabies and did not undergo treatment, death was almost certain. The vaccine, however, did not always prevent rabies.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">A doctor from the Oregon State Health Division ordered rabies treatments for Nora and Paula and others whom the skunk had bitten or who had been exposed to its saliva. Because of his history of allergies, Brad\u2019s family physician concluded that the injections could cause anaphylactic shock and death and advised against them. He did not take the injections.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Nora experienced severe reactions to the vaccine. She suffered welts and bruises at the site of the injections. She received injections on top of welts and bruises from earlier injections. During the course of the treatment she experienced constant nausea and vomiting, lost between 20 and 25 pounds, could not watch television and could not drive a car because of motion sickness from the treatments. She had medical costs and lost wages totaling $1,006.20. Paula experienced nausea, soreness, irritability and pain connected with welts at the site of the injections. She had medical costs of $325.90. Both Paula and Nora were aware that their lives were endangered even after taking the treatments. Paula became withdrawn and reclusive because of worry.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Brad worried because he could not take the shots. He had to stay under the constant observation of his family. He testified that his anxiety caused him to lose sleep, but it did not limit his physical activities or cause him to lose wages or incur medical expenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> None of the plaintiffs contracted rabies.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Nora, Paula and Brad\u2019s complaint was based on strict products liability. ORS 30.920.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It did not allege breach of warranty or that any defendant engaged in intentional or negligent misconduct. Shirley, Janice and Betty\u2019s complaint alleged breach of warranty in addition to strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Throughout the trial, defendants often raised identical objections, and the trial court considered motions and objections stated by counsel for Perfected Pets to have been stated as well for Taylor\u2019s Pets. On appeal, however, Perfected Pets and Taylor\u2019s Pets submitted separate briefs. They raise six common assignments of error, and we also consider four other assignments of Perfected Pets. Three of the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>assignments of error are directed at all of the plaintiffs. Defendants assert that a live animal is not a \u201cproduct\u201d and that the court, therefore, erred when it denied motions for a directed verdict at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case and at the close of all the evidence and motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. These assignments are the only ones that Taylor\u2019s Pets asserts against Nora and Paula. Accordingly, if the skunk is a \u201cproduct,\u201d Taylor\u2019s Pets\u2019 appeal against Paula and Nora fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">All of the remaining assignments relate to whether one or more of plaintiffs may recover damages for some aspect of the emotional distress that they suffered. Three are common assignments of error, concern only Brad and assert that because he suffered no \u201cphysical harm\u201d he may not recover for emotional distress and that the trial court erred, therefore, when it denied motions for a directed verdict at the close of Brad\u2019s case and at the close of all the evidence and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Perfected Pets\u2019 four separate assignments are that the court erred when it failed to give two requested jury instructions respecting plaintiffs\u2019 claims of emotional distress, failed to strike plaintiffs\u2019 \u201callegations\u201d of emotional distress \u201crelating to the fear of death\u201d and denied its pretrial motion to dismiss Brad\u2019s claim because it asserts that he only alleged that he suffered \u201cemotional distress\u201d damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">We turn first to the issue of whether a live animal is a \u201cproduct\u201d under ORS 30.900 <em>et seq. </em>It is a question of first impression in Oregon. In Illinois, live animals are not products within products liability law. In <em>Anderson v. Farmers Hybrid Co., Inc., </em>87 Ill App 3d 493, 42 Ill Dec 485, 408 NE2d 1194, 1199 (1980), the defendants sold diseased pigs, which subsequently infected and caused the death of several other pigs in the buyer\u2019s lot. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">\u201c[T]he changeable nature and health of living creatures, and the potential effect of events and conditions outside the control of the seller on such creatures, lead us to conclude that the trial court was correct in finding that the gilts at issue in this case are not products for purposes of imposing strict liability in tort under Section 402A. While a \u2018product\u2019 may be unchanged from its natural state, viable, and not the result of manufacturing processes, it must also be of a fixed nature at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the time it leaves the seller\u2019s control. * * * Living creatures, such as the swine in the instant case, are by their nature in a constant process of internal development and growth and they are also participants in a constant interaction with the environment around them as part of their development. Thus, living creatures have no fixed nature in the same sense as the blood or the mushrooms can be said to have a fixed nature at the time they enter the stream of commerce.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><em>See also Whitmer v. Schneble, </em>29 Ill App 3rd 659, 331 NE2d 115 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">New York, however, has held that a claim can be stated for strict liability for the sale of diseased hamsters. <em>Beyer v. Aquarium Supply Co., </em>94 Misc 2d 336, 404 NYS2d 778 (NY Sup Ct 1977). Although <em>Beyer </em>does not address the argument in <em>Anderson v. Farmers Hybrid Co., supra, </em>that living creatures do not have a fixed nature at the time they enter the stream of commerce, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">\u201c[T]here is no reason why a breeder, distributor or vendor who places a diseased animal in the stream of commerce should be less accountable for his actions than one who markets a defective manufactured product. The risk presented to human well-being by a diseased animal is as great and probably greater than that created by a defective manufactured product and in many instances, for the average consumer, a disease in an animal can be as difficult to detect as a defect in a manufactured product.\u201d 404 NYS2d at 779.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Defendants urge that the Illinois cases are the more persuasive. They also assert that the reference in ORS 30.910 to a \u201cproduct as manufactured and sold or leased\u201d shows that the legislature intended \u201cproducts\u201d to include only manufactured or processed products, not live animals. ORS 30.920(3), however, expresses the legislature\u2019s intent that ORS 30.920 \u201cshall be construed in accordance with the Restatement (Second) of Torts, sec. 402A, Comments a to m (1965).\u201d <em>Comment e </em>makes clear that a \u201cproduct\u201d need not be manufactured or processed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">\u201cNormally the rules stated in this Section [402A] will be applied to articles which already have undergone some processing before sale, since there is today little in the way of consumer products which will reach the consumer without such processing. The rule is not, however, so limited, and the supplier of poisonous mushrooms which are neither cooked, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>canned, packaged, nor otherwise treated is subject to the liability here stated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">We also do not accept the reasoning of the Illinois cases that live animals may not be deemed products because of their mutability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ORS 30.900 <em>et seq </em>cover products that are subject to both natural change and intentional alteration. ORS 30.915 and 30.920(1)(b) provide a defense to the seller or manufacturer that the product is not substantially \u201cin the condition in which it was sold or leased.\u201d We hold that the live skunk which Janice purchased was a product within the meaning of ORS 30.900 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Accordingly, we affirm Nora and Paula\u2019s judgment on the appeal of Taylor\u2019s Pets.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">As to the right to recover for emotional distress in a strict products liability action,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ORS 30.920 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">\u201cOne who sells or leases any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for <em>physical harm </em>or damage to property caused by that condition * * *.\u201d ORS 30.920(1). (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Defendants concede that Nora, whom the rabid skunk bit, and Paula, who was also in contact with the skunk\u2019s saliva, did suffer \u201cphysical harm,\u201d because they received the rabies injections. Defendants argue, however, that Brad did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>suffer physical harm, because he did not take the injections and did not suffer illness or death from contact with the skunk\u2019s saliva. They argue that the evidence shows only that he suffered anxiety because he knew that he might develop rabies. They assert that the court should have directed a verdict against Brad and should have granted a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, because he suffered no \u201cphysical harm.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">In contrast to ORS 30.920, ORS 30.900 defines \u201cproduct liability civil action\u201d as an action \u201cfor <em>personal injury, </em>death or property damage * * *.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) <em>See also </em>ORS 30.905(2); 30.915(2). The parties do not discuss the significance of the difference in language between those sections and ORS 30.920, which speaks of \u201cphysical harm.\u201d ORS 30.900 covers actions based on negligence as well as strict liability, <em>see Marinelli v. Ford Motor Co., </em>72 Or App 268, 696 P2d 1 (1985), including those arising out of failure to warn or instruct as to use, as well as out of a defect in the product. <em>See </em>ORS 30.900(2) and (3). Moreover, the 1979 Legislature adopted ORS 30.920 two years after adopting ORS 30.900 - 30.915. ORS 30.920 applies to strict liability claims if a person sells or leases a product in a defective condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">ORS 30.920 appears to state that plaintiffs may not recover for emotional distress unless they establish that they suffered physical harm. Although we have found no Oregon authority on the point, that position is in accordance with decisions from other jurisdictions interpreting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>\u00a7 402A (1965), upon which ORS 30.920 is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Although we reject the Illinois rule that a live animal is not a product, we find helpful two cases from Illinois bearing on the recovery of damages for emotional distress in an action for strict products liability. In <em>Woodill v. Parke Davis &amp; Co., </em>58 Ill App3d 349, 15 Ill Dec 900, 374 NE2d 683 (1978), <em>aff\u2019d </em>79 Ill 2d 26, 37 Ill Dec 304, 402 NE2d 194 (1980), the plaintiffs-sought damages based on strict products liability for injuries to their son, and for their emotional distress because of his injuries, which they alleged resulted from the administration of a prescription drug to the mother while she was pregnant. The Appellate Court affirmed the dismissal of the count for plaintiffs\u2019 emotional distress, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>\u201c[W]e do not believe that strict liability should be extended to include recovery for emotional distress and mental anguish to the parents of a minor who had suffered injury. First, because section 402A of the Restatement expressly limits recovery to physical harm. That section is entitled \u2018Special Liability of Seller of Product for <em>Physical Harm </em>to User or Consumer\u2019 (emphasis added), and it provides that \u2018[o]ne who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for <em>physical harm </em>thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer * * *\u2019 (emphasis added). Given the limitation underlined above in section 402A, we conclude that the Restatement did not intend a strict liability action for mental anguish or emotional distress. Furthermore, at present, Illinois recognizes no such action. Case law here allows a cause of action only for severe emotional distress caused by intentional conduct.\u201d 374 NE2d at 688.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Plaintiffs argue that Illinois\u2019 failure to extend recovery for emotional distress beyond the realm of intentional torts should take away any persuasive effect that <em>Woodill </em>may have. We disagree. Although Oregon has allowed recovery for emotional distress in negligence cases in which Illinois may not allow it, neither state has extended recovery for emotional distress to cases in which the plaintiff does not allege either negligence, intentional injury or breach of warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">In <em>Mink v. University of Chicago, </em>460 F Supp 713 (ND Ill 1978), the court relied on section 402A as stating the law of Illinois. It held that women who had been subjected to an increased risk of cancer by administration of DES without their knowledge had failed to state a claim for strict products liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">\u201c[0]ne of the essential elements in a claim for strict liability is physical injury to the plaintiff. The closest the complaint comes to alleging physical injury is the allegation of a \u2018risk\u2019 of cancer. The mere fact of a risk without any accompanying physical injury is insufficient to state a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>for strict products liability. <em>Rheingold v. E. R. Squibb &amp; Sons, </em>74 Civ. 3420 (SD NY 1975). Likewise, the plaintiffs may not rely on injury to their children to state a claim for relief for themselves, even though they allege mental anxiety and emotional distress as a consequence of the injury to their children.\u201d 460 F Supp at 719.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Here, Brad\u2019s exposure to and contact with the rabid skunk increased the risk that he would suffer physical harm.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He did not, however, suffer physical harm. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment for Brad Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">We now turn to the separate assignments of error of Perfected Pets. Because we have already determined Brad\u2019s appeal, we will respond only to the assignments of error that relate to Nora and Paula.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Perfected Pets argues that the court erred when it did not \u201cstrike the allegations of emotional distress relating to the fear of death\u201d in the pleadings and the evidence. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, however, does not make such an allegation but asserts that each of plaintiffs suffered \u201cpain and suffering, including mental pain and suffering.\u201d There is nothing for the court to strike. Perfected Pets also argues that the evidence showed that the emotional distress that Nora and Paula suffered did not result from the rabies injections and, therefore, did not result from the \u201cphysical harm\u201d that they suffered. The jury could have found that Paula\u2019s fear of death resulted from the physical harm of being bitten. The jury could also have found that Nora\u2019s fear of death resulted in significant part from the trauma of the injections, which Perfected Pets acknowledges constituted \u201cphysical harm.\u201d The trial court properly denied the motion to strike the allegations of emotional distress relating to the fear of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\"> Perfected Pets also assigns as error that the court failed to give this jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">\u201cOne may recover for emotional distress which is directly related to the actual physical injury suffered by that person. Emotional distress which is not caused by some physical injury is not compensable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>The court did not err in refusing to give this instruction. ORS 30.920 refers to \u201cphysical harm\u201d and not \u201cphysical injury.\u201d The terms are not interchangeable. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>\u00a7 7, <em>comments a </em>and <em>b </em>(1965). Moreover, at the time the instruction was given, the claims of plaintiffs Sease and Nelson, which included breach of warranty, were submitted to the jury. Perfected Pets did not ask that its requested jury instruction be limited only to the strict liability claims of plaintiffs. Under some circumstances, emotional distress damages may be recovered in an action for breach of warranty without a showing of accompanying physical harm. <em>See Wells v. Oldsmobile Co., </em>147 Or 687, 35 P2d 232 (1934) (damages for \u201cpersonal injuries\u201d may be recovered in actions for breach of warranty); <em>Restatement (Second) Contracts, </em>\u00a7 353 (1981) (emotional distress damages in an action for breach of contract recoverable absent physical harm if \u201cbreach is of such a kind that serious emotional disturbance was a particularly likely result\u201d). The court properly rejected the proposed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Perfected Pets also assigns as error that the court failed to give this jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">\u201cA plaintiff may recover only those damages which are a direct, reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant\u2019s action. Recovery for emotional distress is not allowed when the distress is unreasonable or where it results from a plaintiffs failure to make reasonable inquiry to learn facts which would reduce or eliminate the distress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Perfected Pets submits no authority in support of the proposed jury instruction. The trial court did instruct the jury, without objection, \u201cthat a person who suffers damage has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid increasing that damage. There can be no recovery for increased damage caused by the failure to exercise such care.\u201d The trial court also instructed the jury that the law requires \u201cthat the compensation allowed be reasonable.\u201d Failure to give the instruction was not error. Accordingly, Perfected Pets\u2019 assignments of error as to Paula Hill and Nora Thayer are without merit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Judgments of Nora Thayer and Paula Hill affirmed; judgment for D.
