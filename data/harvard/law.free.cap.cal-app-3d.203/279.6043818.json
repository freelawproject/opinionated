The workers\u2019 compensation judge determined McFadden was injured in the course of his employment and awarded benefits. The appeals board reversed. We conclude the board erred and annul its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">Master Protection Company (Master) employed McFadden as an outside salesman. He received a flat monthly salary of $2,350 including a $350 car allowance. McFadden shared an office at Master\u2019s headquarters with a secretary and four other salesmen, but he spent most of his days outside the office making sales calls and maintaining client relations. His scheduled work hours were from 8:30 a.m. until 4:30 or 5 p.m., but Master had not designated any particular hours during which he was expected to take breaks or have lunch. McFadden, however, had discovered his lunch break <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>was an ideal time to discuss work-related matters, and he commonly joined his supervisors and fellow employees for business lunches away from the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">On the day of the accident, McFadden had been invited to lunch by a coworker, Kathy Severence. She had suggested they meet to discuss problems with respect to installation of a particular fire alarm system. Severence drove McFadden and their supervisor, Robert Nichols, to the restaurant in her car. Nichols testified that he recalled \u201cno one saying that it was a business lunch\u201d and he \u201ctries not to talk business at lunch.\u201d But he also testified, \u201cIt\u2019s common for it [business] to be discussed\u201d; he did not contradict McFadden\u2019s recollection the three of them did discuss business.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">McFadden sustained serious injuries when an uninsured motorist struck Severence\u2019s automobile on their return to the office. The workers\u2019 compensation judge, relying on <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 150 Cal.App.3d 117 [197 Cal.Rptr. 474], concluded McFadden\u2019s injuries were industrial in origin. He determined compensation was appropriate because Master paid McFadden a salary over his entire workday (i.e., Master compensated McFadden for his lunch hour) and because business was discussed at lunch.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The board disagreed, found the injury was not industrial, and reversed. It determined McFadden had \u201csubmitted no evidence that he rendered a service for his employer [during the lunch] or that he was compensated during lunch break.\u201d It concluded, \u201cWe are not persuaded by [McFadden\u2019s] testimony that [he] was required by his employment to go to lunch on the date of injury, or that the lunch had a business purpose. Moreover, we find no evidence that business was actually discussed. As pointed out by Mr. Nichols, it is not unusual for coemployees to eat lunch together or to discuss the work at that time. Such lunches do not constitute a benefit to the employer or an extension of the employment relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The board has misunderstood the issues and misread the record. McFadden is entitled to compensation benefits under applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">An injury is compensable under the workers\u2019 compensation law if it arises \u201cout of and in the course of the employment . . . .\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3600, subd. (a).)  Compensation for injuries sustained during uncompensated meal breaks away from the employer\u2019s premises is usually denied under the aegis of the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule; the employer-employee relationship is considered suspended during that period because the employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>er does not pay for the employee\u2019s services and the employee provides no benefits in return. (See <em>Mission Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 50 [148 Cal.Rptr. 292].)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">However, the rule is different where the employee is compensated during the lunch break. (See <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 418, 421 [193 Cal.Rptr. 374].) In those situations it is \u201creasonable [to infer] that by such an arrangement the employer has impliedly agreed that service will continue during such period.\u201d <em>(Western Pipe etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1942) 49 Cal.App.2d 108, 112 [121 P.2d 35].) This is true whether the employee is salaried or paid at an hourly rate. (See <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>150 Cal.App.3d 117, 120-121, fns. 1-2; <em>Western Greyhound Lines </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1964) 225 Cal.App.2d 517 [37 Cal.Rptr. 580].) Furthermore, all doubts as <em>to </em>whether a worker is acting within the course and scope of his employment should be resolved in the employee\u2019s favor. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3202; <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 585, 593 [190 Cal.Rptr. 158, 660 P.2d 382]; <em>Western Greyhound Lines </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>225 Cal.App.2d at p. 521.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The parties agree <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. supra, </em>150 Cal.App.3d 117, correctly states the law. In <em>Duncan, </em>the employee had worked as the bookkeeping manager in charge of her employer\u2019s San Francisco office. She received a flat salary and was authorized to take two short breaks during the workday and a half-hour for lunch. However, because she was so busy, she \u201cseldom if ever took the short breaks, and only occasionally took time off for lunch . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">On the day of the accident she worked from 8:30 a.m. until 12:45 p.m., at which time she decided to leave the building to get some fresh air. She soon decided to go to a nearby restaurant for lunch. On the way, she fell and sustained serious injuries. The workers\u2019 compensation judge and appeals board denied compensation on the theory off-premises injuries are not compensable and \u201cthe act in which the employee was engaged occurred during an \u2018uncompensated, lunch break which did not contribute directly or substantially to the employer\u2019s benefit.\u201d (150 Cal.App.3d at p. 119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The Court of Appeal annulled the board\u2019s order. It decided \u201cthe central question is whether a salaried employee is \u2018paid\u2019 during an authorized but unscheduled lunch break.\u201d (150 Cal.App.3d at p. 121.) Relying on a sister state decision, it answered the question in the affirmative: \u201cOur research has discovered no express California case in point. The closest legal authority we can find appears in an Alabama case in which the court adopted the view that a salaried employee working an eight and one-half hour day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>which included an unspecified half-hour lunch break was being paid during lunch. [Citation.] [1J] That this concept reflects the reality of the workplace is well illustrated by the facts of the instant case. As a matter of practice [the employer] permitted about one hour a day of break time, although, in fact, the nature of the job was such that [the employee] seldom if ever enjoyed a full hour. On a typical day she would work through all three break periods, and there is no evidence that [the employer] disapproved of this practice, or that any company practice could reasonably have alerted [the employee] that her salary did not cover the break periods. Accordingly, and particularly in view of the liberal policy of the workers\u2019 compensation law, it is a fair inference that her salary was apportioned equally over the entire eight and one-half hour workday, [fl] Since, therefore, at the time of her injury [the employee] was being paid, we conclude that she is entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits.fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">McFadden was authorized to take a lunch break, and he did so on numerous occasions, often with his fellow employees. His supervisor frequently joined him. His break was also unscheduled; because he was an outside salesman, he was free to take lunch (or not) as time and circumstances permitted. Finally, he was a salaried employee, and Master \u201c[did] not notify [him] that his . . . salary did not cover the meal period and was not equally apportioned over the entire work day.\u201d (2 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workmen\u2019s Comp. (2d ed. 1986) Course of Employment, \u00a7 9.04[4], pp. 9-61, fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Master\u2019s attempts to distinguish <em>Duncan </em>are unavailing. It argues it is not possible to find an implied agreement to apportion McFadden\u2019s salary over the entire day because he \u201coffered no testimony regarding the basis for a salary or the hours or times he was expected to work.\u201d However, this overlooks McFadden\u2019s testimony he was a salaried employee and Master\u2019s admission his scheduled work hours were from 8:30 a.m. until 4:30 or 5 p.m. Although Master also claims McFadden must \u201cprove\u201d he was paid during his lunch break, <em>Duncan </em>permits him to do that indirectly. McFadden presented a prima facie case under <em>Duncan, </em>and Master offered no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>contrary evidence. He is entitled to relief. (See <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 274, 281 [113 Cal.Rptr. 162, 520 P.2d 978].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The order denying compensation is annulled and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Scoville, P. J., and Crosby, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The petition of respondents Master Protection Company and Reliance Insurance Company for review by the Supreme Court was denied October 12, 1988.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-6\"> Other courts have assumed, without discussion, that a salaried employee is paid during break periods when the employment relationship contemplates those idle moments. (See, e.g., <em>Fremont Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 170 [137 Cal.Rptr. 847].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b241-7\"> The result we reach is in accord with the rationale behind the rule. McFadden lunched with other company employees and he testified (without contradiction) they discussed company business. Master benefitted. (See <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d at p. 421.) Therefore, we need not reach the broader issue as to whether salaried employees are always entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits for injuries sustained during any break period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b242-8\"> In light of our conclusion, we need not determine whether McFadden\u2019s injury is also compensable under the \u201cpersonal comfort\u201d exception to the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule. However, the decisions suggest he might be entitled to a determination that his injury was an industrial one under that doctrine as well. (See, e.g., <em>Fremont Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>69 Cal.App.3d 170; <em>Rankin </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 857 [95 Cal.Rptr. 275]; <em>Western Greyhound Lines </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>225 Cal.App.2d at p. 520.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
