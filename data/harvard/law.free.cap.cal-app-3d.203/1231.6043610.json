J.</author>\n<p id=\"AStb\">Petitioner challenges the denial of his motion to set aside the information against him pursuant to section 995 of the Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>Petitioner was charged by complaint with possession for sale of base cocaine, cocaine and heroin on December 1, 1987, in violation of sections 11351.5 and 11351 of the Health and Safety Code. At the preliminary hearing held on February 5, 1988, Officer Wayne Weir testified that on December 1, 1987, he was working on covert surveillance in the investigation of sales of narcotics in North Richmond. He was watching the corner of Fifth and Grove through binoculars and observed a number of transactions in which petitioner appeared to be exchanging something for money. The transactions involved either passing pedestrians or passing motorists. Officer Weir concluded that the transactions involved narcotics and by radio asked for the arrest of petitioner and a juvenile who appeared to have a stash of drugs from which petitioner was dealing. Officers Rubin and Wells responded and petitioner was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">On cross-examination, Officer Weir was asked where he and his partner were located when they made their observations. Officer Weir asserted the official-information privilege of section 1040, subdivision (b), of the Evidence Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court ruled that the privilege applied and the cross-examination was limited to questions regarding any obstructions or limitations to the observations. Thus, Officer Weir testified that the location was clear and unobstructed; that his observation point was about 50 yards from petitioner; that it was daylight and somewhat overcast. At the close of cross-examination, defense counsel took \u201cformal exception\u201d to the application of the privilege. On redirect, Officer Weir testified that the location was \u201ccurrently used as an ongoing operation for investigations\u201d and that ongoing investigations would be jeopardized by disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Officer Wells testified that he responded to Weir\u2019s radioed directions to detain petitioner and the juvenile and was directed by Weir to the stash of narcotics. When he found the stash of narcotics, he arrested the two for possession of narcotics for sale. Both subjects were strip searched and a hypodermic needle was found on petitioner. On cross-examination, Wells testified that he was supervising the drug task force that morning. He told Weir to position himself so that he could watch the street activity at Fifth and Grove. He did not tell him to use a specific location and did not know where Weir made his observations. Apparently he did not observe any of the activity of appellant as related by Officer Weir.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">Petitioner was held to answer the charges. He moved to set aside the information pursuant to Penal Code section 995 on the ground that refusing to allow cross-examination of Officer Weir concerning his location required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>that the information be set aside. The motion was denied and the instant petition followed. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 999a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">Section 1040 provides a privilege for \u201cinformation acquired in confidence by a public employee in the course of his or her duty and not open, or officially disclosed, to the public prior to the time the claim of privilege is made.\u201d (Subd. (a).) A public entity has a privilege to refuse to disclose official information if \u201c[d]isclosure ... is against the public interest because there is a necessity for preserving the confidentiality of the information that outweighs the necessity for disclosure in the interest of justice; . . .\u201d (Subd. (b)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">Petitioner contends that Weir\u2019s surveillance location does not come within the privilege because the record does not show that the location was \u201cacquired in confidence . . . during the course of his . . . duty.\u201d \u201cOfficer Weir did not \u2018acquire\u2019 knowledge of the location from which he was operating; he simply selected it, and chose to keep it secret.\u201d The effect of the magistrate\u2019s ruling, argues petitioner, is to elevate anything that comes within an officer\u2019s knowledge during an investigation to \u201cofficial information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">Petitioner takes too restrictive a view of the statutory word \u201cacquire.\u201d The term does not exclude information that is generated by the person claiming the privilege. To acquire means \u201cto come into possession ... of often by some uncertain or unspecified means.\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Diet. (1981) p. 18.) To hold, as petitioner seems to suggest, that the location could be official information if petitioner was told of it by Officer Wells rather than discovering it himself creates a distinction which is neither required by the statute nor consistent with the purpose of the privilege. We hold the surveillance location was information to which the privilege could apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">However, as Justice Kaus commented, the exercise of the privilege under section 1040 is a mixed blessing because of the requirement of an adverse finding in section 1042. <em>(Kelvin L. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 823, 830 [133 Cal.Rptr. 325].) Section 1042, subdivision (a) provides: \u201cExcept where disclosure is forbidden by an act of the Congress of the United States, if a claim of privilege under this article by the state or a public entity in this state is sustained in a criminal proceeding, the presiding officer shall make such order or finding of fact adverse to the public entity bringing the proceeding as is required by law upon any issue in the proceeding to which the privileged information is material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">The adverse finding is only required if the privileged information is <em>material. </em>In <em>In re David W. </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 840 [133 Cal.Rptr. 342], the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>defendant was accused of auto theft. It became important to the defense to ascertain the identification number of the car which was placed in a seciret location on the car by the manufacturer. A police officer testified concerning the number but claimed the privilege when asked its location; the defense, therefore, could not verify the number. The trial court allowed the privilege since public knowledge of the location of the secret identification number would destroy its purpose. However, the trial court appointed an independent expert witness to identify and examine the vehicle identification number of the car in question and testify in court as to his verification of that number. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 846.) Thus, the appellate court held that knowledge of the secret location was no longer material to the defense and no adverse finding was required. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 847.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">In the instant case the Attorney General argues that the location of the surveillance is not material on the question of guilt or innocence. However, he concedes that \u201cwhat is important is whether or not Officer Weir was able to adequately observe the transactions.\u201d The purpose of the defense in learning the location was to test that very observation\u2014did Officer Weir actually have a clear and unobstructed view of the scene? This was the very issue to which the privileged information was material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">In sustaining the privilege the magistrate has severely limited the petitioner\u2019s right to cross-examine on this material issue.  The right of cross-examination is more than a desirable rule of trial procedure. It is implicit in the constitutional right of confrontation, and helps assure the accuracy of the truth-determining process. <em>(Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1972) 410 U.S. 284, 295 [35 L.Ed.2d 297, 308-309, 93 S.Ct. 1038].) The Sixth Amendment\u2019s right of an accused to confront the witness against him is, just like it\u2019s right-to-counsel guaranty (see <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright </em>(1963) 372 U.S. 335 [9 L.Ed.2d 799, 83 S.Ct. 792, 93 A.L.R.2d 733]), \u201c \u2018 \u201ca fundamental right, essential to a fair trial\u201d \u2019 and \u2018thus [was] made obligatory on the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 400, 403. [13 L.Ed.2d 923, 926, 85 S.Ct. 1065])  When invoking the privilege results, as here, in depriving the petitioner of his fundamental right to cross-examination on a material issue, an adverse finding is mandated by section 1042 and the magistrate\u2019s failure to make one requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">For the guidance of magistrates faced with similar decisions in the future we briefly address the question of what \u201cfinding of fact adverse to the public entity\u201d the magistrate should have made. The Law Revision Commission Comments to section 1042 suggest that the consequences of invoking the privilege are based upon the public policy of simple fairness, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reynolds </em>(1953) 345 U.S. 1, 12 [97 L.Ed. 727, 735, 73 S.Ct. 528, 32 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>A.L.R.2d 382] that: \u201csince the Government which prosecutes an accused also has the duty to see that justice is done, it is unconscionable to allow it to undertake prosecution and then invoke its governmental privileges to deprive the accused of anything which might be material to his defense.\u201d The commission suggests that, if the privileged information is material to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, the consequences of its invocation should be dismissal pursuant to <em>People </em>v. <em>McShann </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 802 [330 P.2d 33], The commission further suggests that if the privileged information relates to narrower issues such as the legality of a warrantless search, the consequence might be the striking of the testimony of a particular witness or the court\u2019s fashioning of \u201csome other order appropriate under the circumstances,\u201d citing <em>Priestly </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 812 [330 P.2d 39].</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">We agree with the Attorney General that the appropriate order here should have been for the magistrate to strike the testimony of Officer Weir\u2019s observations. Without that testimony there remains insufficient evidence to support the holding order. (See <em>Rideout </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 471 [62 Cal.Rptr. 581, 432 P.2d 197].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Let a peremptory writ of prohibition issue restraining the Contra Costa Superior Court from taking any further action other than to grant the motion pursuant to Penal Code section 995.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">Poch\u00e9, J., and Channell, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b999-8\"> All further statutory references are to the Evidence Code unless otherwise designated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
