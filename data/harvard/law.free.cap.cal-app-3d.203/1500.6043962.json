J.</author>\n<p id=\"Arq\">Thomas B. challenges a jury verdict finding him to be the father of Sherry H.\u2019s daughter, Elizabeth. In a separate appeal, Thomas contends the trial court lacked jurisdiction to award attorney fees to Sherry pending the outcome of his appeal from the paternity adjudication. Having consolidated the appeals on our own motion, we now conclude any error in the conduct of the paternity trial was harmless and the order awarding Sherry attorney fees on appeal was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1502\">*1502</page-number>I.-V.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">After Thomas filed his notice of appeal from the judgment of paternity, Sherry filed an order to show cause for attorney fees on appeal. She also served Thomas with a <em>notice </em>to produce certain financial documents at the hearing. Thomas initially objected to the production of those documents but thereafter stipulated he was able to pay any reasonable amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-7\">The court ordered Thomas to pay $7,500 in attorney fees.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It also ordered the financial documents be returned to him. Thomas complied with the fee order.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-8\">The gist of Thomas\u2019 argument is the court lacked jurisdiction to make <em>any </em>fee award until paternity was \u201cfinally adjudicated\u201d on appeal. Relying on our decision in <em>Thomas B. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 255 [220 Cal.Rptr. 577], and viewing attorney fees as a form of permanent support, he contends there can be no final determination of support because there has been no final adjudication of paternity. As we shall explain, he is wrong.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">But first, we reject Thomas\u2019 contention his appeal from the paternity judgment divested the court of jurisdiction, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 916, to award attorney fees. \u201cThe purpose of the rule depriving the trial court of jurisdiction pending appeal in civil actions is to protect the jurisdiction of the appellate court; the rule prevents the trial court from rendering the appeal futile by changing the judgment into something different. [Citations.] Accordingly, whether a matter is \u2018embraced\u2019 in or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1503\">*1503</page-number>\u2018affected\u2019 by a judgment within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 916 depends on whether postjudgment proceedings on the matter would have any effect on the \u2018effectiveness\u2019 of the appeal. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Horowitz </em>(1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 377, 381 [205 Cal.Rptr. 880].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">Here, the challenged attorney fee order is merely collateral to the paternity judgment. The award itself has no relationship to the effectiveness of Thomas\u2019 appeal from the paternity adjudication. Furthermore, it is absurd to think an appeal could deprive the trial court of the ability to award attorney fees to defend the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">The critical language in <em>Thomas B. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d 255 is the following: \u201c[A]n action to establish parentage is essentially comprised of four component parts: a prima facie showing of paternity for purposes of pendente lite support; a determination of an appropriate temporary award; the final adjudication of paternity; and a determination of permanent support (subject, of course, to subsequent modification upon a showing of changed circumstances). Each must be determined at a <em>separate </em>hearing. []|] The effect of our holding is to require the trial court to bifurcate the issue of paternity (both prima facie and final adjudications) from that of support. Although Thomas\u2019 bifurcation motion was denied and the parties anticipate both issues will be litigated at the <em>same </em>trial, Thomas need not produce <em>any </em>documents until paternity is finally determined. If Sherry is successful at the first phase of the proceeding, the trial must be continued to provide her ample time to review Thomas\u2019 records, including his tax returns.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 265-266, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">The term \u201cfinal adjudication of paternity\u201d as used in <em>Thomas B. </em>refers to the <em>determination made at trial, </em>independent of and notwithstanding any appeal. It is no coincidence each reference in the opinion to \u201cfinal adjudication\u201d follows a reference to \u201cprima facie\u201d or \u201ctemporary.\u201d Indeed, the term \u201cfinal adjudication\u201d was used to distinguish the adjudication made at the trial from the one made at the interim order to show cause hearing; the term \u201cfinal\u201d was not intended to mean \u201cafter affirmed on appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In any event, viewing the attorney fee award as a form of interim support, a position espoused by Sherry, the trial court clearly had jurisdiction to modify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1504\">*1504</page-number>award and to resort to Thomas\u2019 personal financial records to do so.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The judgment and order are affirmed.

We denied the motion but ordered Thomas to comply with the fee order, indicating failure to do so would result in dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1180-13\">Thomas also argues \u201cas a result of the order of the trial court, [he] has no way of recovering these attorneys\u2019 fees from [Sherry] in the event that the judgment of paternity is ultimately reversed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-14\">A reversal of the paternity judgment would not, of course, have impacted the propriety of the fee award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1181-8\"> Nor does an appeal negate the conclusive determination of paternity made at trial for purposes of compelling production of tax returns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1182-8\">Thomas asserts he should not have been required to produce financial documents at the hearing; hence, any ruling based on the documents produced was erroneous. We fail to see his point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-9\">After Thomas stipulated he was capable of paying any reasonable amount of attorney fees, the documents were returned to him. The challenged order was not based on the documents produced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1182-10\"> Sherry contends Thomas\u2019 appeal from the attorney fee award is frivolous and warrants the imposition of sanctions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-11\">\u201c[A]n appeal should be held to be frivolous only when it is prosecuted for an improper motive\u2014to harass the respondent or delay the effect of an adverse judgment\u2014or when it indisputably has no merit\u2014when any reasonable attorney would agree that the appeal is totally and completely without merit.
