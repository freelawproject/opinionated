J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANZ\">Robert L. Duesler was convicted of second degree murder. On appeal he contends the sentencing court erroneously deducted his presentence conduct credits without an adequate hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Duesler was a night janitor. Arriving at work one night, he drove into a parking lot where the victim was controlling traffic. Duesler explained he worked there, but the victim ordered him to get out of his car. Duesler did not respond, but drove home, returned with a gun and shot the victim several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Duesler was charged with murder by use of a handgun. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, 12022.5.) He pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. The jury found Duesler guilty of second degree murder. Duesler withdrew his insanity plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">The trial court sentenced Duesler to 15 years to life in state prison, plus a 2-year enhancement for use of a deadly weapon. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 190, 12022.5.) At the sentencing hearing, the court credited Duesler with 76 days of \u201cwork time\u201d credit, but ruled he was not entitled to \u201cgood time\u201d credit based upon the probation report\u2019s statement that he violated jail rules on 4 occasions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court\u2019s withholding of Duesler\u2019s conduct credits was made without discussion by the parties. The court briefly mentioned the infractions listed in the probation report and concluded Duesler was not entitled to good behavior credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">Under Penal Code section 4019, certain prisoners are entitled to good behavior credit for time spent in county jail, \u201cunless it appears by the record that the prisoner has not satisfactorily complied with . . . [jail] rules and regulations . . . .\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 4019, subd. (c).) Prisoners confined to jail prior to sentencing for a felony conviction are among those entitled to Penal Code section 4019 credits. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 4019, subd. (a)(4); see <em>People </em>v. <em>Sage </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 498, 508 [611 P.2d 874].)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">At the sentencing hearing, Duesler did not object to the court\u2019s ruling denying him Penal Code section 4019 conduct credits. He now challenges it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>as an abuse of discretion.  He first contends any decision to deduct \u201cgood time\u201d credits should be made only by the sheriff or Department of Corrections, since conduct credits are intended to be a disciplinary tool to motivate good prisoner behavior. We disagree. Conduct credits for presentence custody are credited to the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment \u201cin the discretion of the court imposing the sentence.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2900.5, subd. (a).) It is the duty of the sentencing court to determine \u201cthe total number of days to be credited . . .\u201d for presentence custody. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2900.5, subd. (d); see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Sage, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at pp. 508-509; <em>People </em>v. <em>Montalvo </em>(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 57, 62-63 [183 Cal.Rptr. 242]; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 3043.)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Although the sheriff is authorized to deduct conduct credits for inmates jailed under a misdemeanor sentence or as a condition of probation, his role with respect to presentence custody credit is to provide the sentencing court with information, records and recommendations. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 252; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sage, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 509.) The sheriff or the People have the burden to show that a defendant is not entitled to Penal Code section 4019 credits. <em>(See People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 808, 815 [175 Cal.Rptr. 59].)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Duesler relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Chew </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 45, 47 [217 Cal.Rptr. 805]. But that case dealt with credit for prison time between the original sentence and a remand for resentencing after an appeal. The court held that <em>prison </em>(as opposed to jail) time credits \u201cshould be initially determined by the responsible administrative agency, not the sentencing court.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see Pen. Code, \u00a7 2930 et seq.) The <em>Chew </em>court carefully limited its holding to prison credits and recognized that \u201cjail time\u201d credits under Penal Code section <em>4019 </em>are a proper concern of the sentencing court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chew, supra, </em>172 Cal.App.3d at p. 50.)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Duesler further asserts he was denied a fair hearing prior to the withholding of his conduct credits. At the sentencing hearing, the issue of Duesler\u2019s conduct credits was dealt with very briefly and without discussion by either party. Duesler was not notified in advance of the setitencing hearing that the issue would be raised by the trial court. Although the probation report referred to his poor jail behavior, it did not raise the issue of conduct credits. The record, in fact, contains no recommendation by the probation officer or sheriff as to Duesler\u2019s custody credits, as contemplated by California Rules of Court, rule 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">In <em>In re Walrath </em>(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 426, 432 [164 Cal.Rptr. 923], the court agreed an inmate is \u201centitled to certain procedural safeguards before his good time credits [can] be deducted.\u201d Citing <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell </em>(1974) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>418 U.S. 539 [41 L.Ed.2d 935, 94 S.Ct. 2963] [involving a similar Nebraska conduct credit statute], the <em>Walrath </em>court listed the following requisite safeguards: \u201c(1) advance written notice of the claimed violation of prison rules; (2) a hearing at which the prisoner [has] the right to call witnesses and present evidence, so long as institutional security [is] not threatened thereby; (3) where necessary because of the prisoner\u2019s illiteracy or the complexity of the issues, assistance from other inmates or staff; and (4) a written record of the proceedings, including a statement by the factfinder as to the evidence relied upon and the reasons for the disciplinary action taken. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The procedural requirements discussed in <em>Walrath </em>apply to administrative hearings conducted by the sheriff at the county jail. <em>(In re Walrath, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.3d at pp. 432-433.) We have found no cases discussing the due process requirements applicable when a sentencing court deducts a defendant\u2019s presentence conduct credits. It is apparent, however, that some minimum due process safeguards must be provided. Courts, including the United States Supreme Court, have recognized that conduct credits are an important liberty interest of inmates. <em>(Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, supra, </em>418 U.S. at p. 557 [41 L.Ed.2d at pp. 951-952]; <em>In re Walrath, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.3d at p.432.) Although <em>Walrath </em>limited its discussion to jail hearings, its mandate of due process safeguards applies equally to a sentencing court\u2019s deduction of presentence custody credits. We conclude that before a sentencing court may withhold conduct credits, the defendant is entitled to prior notice and an opportunity to (1) rebut the findings of his jail violations, and (2) present any mitigating factors. <em>(In re Walrath, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.3d at p.433.)</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The presentence report is an appropriate vehicle for alerting the defendant that his conduct credits are in jeopardy where it suggests or recommends such action. That was not the case here, although the report did touch on Duesler\u2019s behavioral problems in the jail. Duesler\u2019s counsel should have sought a continuance to contest the court\u2019s proposed action, but because he may have been uncertain of his legal basis for such a motion in this rather obscure area of the law, we do not believe it would be appropriate to penalize the defendant for the error in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Ill, IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The judgment is reversed insofar as it purports to fix behavior credits, and the matter is remanded to the trial court for recomputation of the credits after a hearing held in accordance with the views expressed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Crosby, J., and Wallin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b233-13\"> Apparently, he was cited for being out of bed after lights out, tearing a sheet into strips, fighting over another inmate\u2019s newspaper, and cooking inside the \u201ctank.\u201d Duesler was punished by jail authorities for three of these infractions by loss of roof and visitation privileges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b235-8\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 273.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b236-7\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 273.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
