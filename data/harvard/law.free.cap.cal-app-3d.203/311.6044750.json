Code, \u00a7 273.5)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and of misdemeanor battery (\u00a7 242); the jury was unable to agree on a charge of assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)). Appellant admitted a prior separate prison term. (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b).) The court sentenced appellant to an aggregate term of three years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Appellant contends that section 273.5 is vague, and, therefore, convicting him under its provisions deprived him of due process; that the court erred in its instructions on included offenses; and that the court abused its discretion in ruling that appellant could be impeached with a particular prior conviction. We find all of appellant\u2019s claims to be without merit and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">\n<em>The Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">On October 24, 1986, Evelyn M. lived in a San Francisco apartment with June G., Frances P., and appellant. Ms. M. and Ms. P. had moved into the apartment together at the beginning of the year; Ms. G. had just moved in and was staying temporarily while her place was being remodeled. Ms. M. testified that she and appellant had been living together two years. She explained that although he had his own apartment, they were \u201ctogether a lot.\u201d When asked if theirs was a \u201cboyfriend-girlfriend\u201d relationship, she answered, \u201cYes. We lived together in one bed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">On the day in question the four were in the apartment watching television and drinking whiskey. At about 7 p.m., suddenly and without provocation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>appellant jumped up, kicked a chair aside, grabbed Ms. M. \u201creal hard,\u201d took her dentures out of her mouth (stating he was going to throw them away), and said, \u201c \u2018You\u2019re going down.\u2019 \u201d Appellant picked her up and put her out an open window, hanging her upside down while he held her about the knees and threatening to drop her to the ground four stories below.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">After Ms. M. managed to get back into the room and sit in a chair, appellant picked it up with her in it and slammed her on the floor, repeating this move twice. While this was going on, Ms. G. attempted to get appellant away from Ms. M., but he threw her into a rocking chair, hurting her arm and shoulder. Meanwhile, Rhonda F., Ms. M.\u2019s daughter, called two or three times. Appellant kept hanging up on her, but Ms. M. finally let her know she wanted the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">After appellant slammed Ms. M. into the floor, she asked to go to the bathroom. He told her to stay where she was and to urinate on the floor, which she did. Just then appellant turned to change a television channel; Ms. M. heard the police at the door and admitted them.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Ms. M. suffered several bruises from appellant\u2019s assaults upon her. Her testimony was corroborated by that of one of her roommates, her daughter, and the police. Officer David Tussey testified, inter alia, that both appellant and Ms. M. had clearly been drinking but that neither was incapacitated from the alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Appellant testified that on the day in question he and Ms. M. argued about a debt and that she gave him her dentures as security for her payment. Later Ms. M. angered him by twice stating that he was going to visit \u201c \u2018slant-eyed whores\u2019 \u201d in Oakland. He admitted pushing her \u201chard, but not hard enough to hurt her.\u201d He denied holding her out the window or forcing her to urinate in the living room. He said he had moved in with Ms. M. in February 1986, moved out after a \u201c[cjouple\u201d of months, and lived in a hotel for four to five months, then moved back in with her, but slept mostly on a back porch or in a walk-in closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">\n<em>Validity of Section 273.5</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">Section 273.5 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Any person who willfully inflicts upon his or her spouse, or any person who willfully inflicts upon any person of the opposite sex with whom he or she is cohabiting, corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition, is guilty of a felony . . . . [jj] (b) Holding oneself out to be the husband or wife of the person with whom one is cohabiting is not necessary to constitute cohabitation as the term is used in this section. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Appellant contends that the term \u201ccohabiting\u201d is vague, that this renders section 273.5 void on its face, and that therefore he was deprived of due process when he was convicted of violating it. The principles to be applied to a void-for-vagueness attack are well established by the appellate courts and are fairly summarized as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u201cBoth article I, section 7, of the California Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution declare that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law. It has been recognized for over 80 years that due process requires inter alia some level of definiteness in criminal statutes. [Citation.]  Today it is established that due process requires a statute to be definite enough to provide (1) a standard of conduct for those whose activities are proscribed and (2) a standard for police enforcement and for ascertainment of guilt. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Burg </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 257, 269 [198 Cal.Rptr. 145, 673 P.2d 732], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u201c \u2018The fundamental policy behind the constitutional prohibition of vaguely worded criminal statutes was stated in <em>Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(1939) 306 U.S. 451, at page 453 . . . : \u201cNo one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes. All are entitled to be informed as to what the State commands or forbids.\u201d [The California Supreme] court noted a further purpose of the prohibition in <em>People </em>v. <em>McCaughan </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 409, 414 . . . , where Justice Traynor stated, \u201cA statute must be definite enough to provide a standard of conduct for those whose activities are proscribed as well as a standard for the ascertainment of guilt by the courts called upon to apply it.\u201d [Italics omitted.] The generally accepted criterion is whether the terms of the challenged statute are \u201cso vague that [people] of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 798, 809 [201 Cal.Rptr. 311, 678 P.2d 886].)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Slight theoretical uncertainty does not render a statute invalid. \u201c \u2018The presumptive validity of a legislative act militates against invalidating a statute merely \u201c. . . because difficulty is found in determining whether certain marginal offenses fall within . . . [its] language.\u2019\u201d <em>(Bowland </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 479, 492 [134 Cal.Rptr. 630, 556 P.2d 1081], [citation].) We are not obligated to \u2018consider every conceivable situation which might arise under the language of the statute\u2019 [citation], so long as it may be given \u2018a reasonable and practical construction in accordance with the probable intent of the Legislature\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 810.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Not every offender of every statute may be heard to argue vagueness. \u201c[0]ffenders cannot complain of the vagueness of a statute if the conduct with which they are charged falls clearly within its bounds [citation].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Weaver </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d Supp. 23, 36 [197 Cal.Rptr. 521].) \u201cIn examining statutes challenged on vagueness grounds, courts have looked not merely at the hypothetical cases to which the statute has uncertain applicability, but also at the act allegedly committed by the charged defendant. . . . \u2018. . . [fl] Void for vagueness simply means that criminal responsibility should not attach where one could not reasonably understand that <em>his </em>[or <em>her] </em>contemplated conduct is proscribed.\u2019 [Citations.] . . . Thus plaintiffs cannot complain of the vagueness of a statute if the conduct with which they are charged falls clearly within its bounds.\u201d <em>(Bowland </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 479, 492 [134 Cal.Rptr. 630, 556 P.2d 1081].)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">When we apply these principles to the case at bench, it is clear that appellant\u2019s allegation of vagueness must fail for several reasons. First, he is a \u201chard core violator\u201d who cannot be heard to complain. Ms. M. testified that she and appellant had \u201clived together in one bed\u201d for two years. Under any definition they were cohabiting, and the fact that applicability of section 273.5 to some other forms of living arrangements might be uncertain does not change that fact. In other words, as to appellant the statute is not vague, and that is all the due process to which he is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Second, a corollary to the above \u201chard core violator\u201d rule is that \u201c[A] statute is sufficiently certain if it employs words of long usage or with a common law meaning, \u2018notwithstanding an element of degree in the definition as to which estimates might differ.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Lorenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 49, 60 [216 P.2d 859].) Even if appellant may be heard to attack the statute, under this rule the statute is clearly constitutional, since the term \u201ccohabit\u201d has been used in California statutes and decisions for at least 100 years and has an established common law meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">As early as 1888, a member of the Supreme Court observed that \u201cliving together and cohabitation mean the same thing.\u201d <em>(Sharon </em>v. <em>Sharon </em>(1888) 75 Cal. 1, 56, 61 [16 P. 345] (dis. opn. of Thornton, J.).) A few years later, in <em>Kilburn </em>v. <em>Kilburn </em>(1891) 89 Cal. 46, 50 [26 P. 636], the court stated that \u201cby cohabitation is not meant simply the gratification of the sexual passion, but \u2018to live or dwell together, to have the same habitation, so that where one lives and dwells there does the other live and dwell also.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">After 1902, the appellate courts settled on the definition as stated that year in <em>Estate of Mills </em>(1902) 137 Cal. 298, 301 [70 P. 91]: \u201cThe word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>\u2018cohabiting,\u2019. . . means the living together of a man and woman ostensibly as husband and wife. (1 Bishop on Marriage, Divorce, and Separation, sec. 1669, note 1.)\u201d (See <em>Kusior </em>v. <em>Silver </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 603, 609-614 [7 Cal.Rptr. 129, 354 P.2d 657], for a discussion of the derivation and meaning of the term.) This definition has been used extensively in civil litigation, especially where paternity is an issue under, for example, Civil Code section 7004 [child born within 300 days after \u201ctermination of cohabitation\u201d] or Evidence Code section 621 [\u201cthe issue of a wife cohabiting with her husband\u201d is presumed the child of the marriage]. And further, it is well settled that \u201c\u2018Cohabitation means simply to live or dwell together in the same habitation; evidence of lack of sexual relations is irrelevant.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Michael H. </em>v. <em>Gerald D. </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 995, 1006 [236 Cal.Rptr. 810].)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Numerous California statutes use the term \u201ccohabit,\u201d or some variation of it, as well, all without stating a definition. For example, Civil Code section 43.4 eliminates the cause of action for \u201c[a] fraudulent promise to marry or to cohabit after marriage.\u201d Civil Code section 51.3, dealing with senior citizen housing, refers to \u201cspouse, cohabitant, or person providing primary . . . support.\u201d Civil Code section 4425 refers to persons who have \u201cfreely cohabited with the other as husband and wife,\u201d and section 4801.5 of the Civil Code refers to persons \u201ccohabiting with a person of the opposite sex.\u201d (See also Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7004 (see <em>ante), </em>7017; Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 621 (see <em>ante), </em>972 [marital privilege inapplicable where spouse charged with crime against a \u201ccohabitant\u201d of either spouse]; Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 266d [causing cohabitation when not married, for profit], 785 [jurisdiction for bigamy is where \u201cmarriage took place, or cohabitation occurred\u201d], 1106 [proof of marriage and cohabitation in bigamy case].)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Section 13700, subdivision (b), provides: \u201c \u2018Domestic Violence\u2019 is abuse committed against an adult or fully emancipated minor who is a spouse, former spouse, cohabitant, former cohabitant, or a person with whom the suspect has had a child or has or has had a dating or engagement relationship.\u201d  This provision of the legislation known as \u201cLaw Enforcement Response to Domestic Violence\u201d is of particular interest because it promotes the same goal as the provision under consideration\u2014the protection of persons from violence committed by their domestic partners or others with whom they have a significant relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Thus, under the rule recited in <em>Lorenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>35 Cal.2d at page 60, section 273.5 cannot be successfully attacked, because the term \u201ccohabit\u201d has a settled meaning which is clear under the law of this state. It follows that under the traditional two-part void-for-vagueness analysis discussed at the outset, this statute is valid as applied in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>because it affords notice to appellant that his conduct was proscribed<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and because there is a clear standard for law enforcement officials and for the courts to apply.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The original statute, former section 273d, was a \u201cwife beating\u201d statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Legislature expanded its scope by the enactment of section 273.5, which was undoubtedly intended to remove the requirement that the parties be married. (See Note, <em>The Battered Wife\u2019s Dilemma: To Kill or To Be Killed </em>(1981) 32 Hastings L.J. 895, 904, fn. 58.) \u201cWe decline to frustrate the Legislature\u2019s clear and legitimate purpose in enacting the statute involved here. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Burg </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 272.)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\n<em>Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\"><em>Cohabitation. </em> It follows from the above discussion that the court properly refused to instruct the jury that a finding of cohabitation required a finding of sexual relationship. The court\u2019s answers to the jury\u2019s questions on the meaning of the term \u201ccohabit\u201d correctly stated that sexual relations were not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\"><em>CALJIC No. 17.12. </em>Appellant was charged in count I with violation of section 273.5, and in count II with violation of section 245, subdivision (a)(1). The jury found him guilty of the offense charged in count I, but could not agree on a verdict on count II. During its instructions to the jury the court first correctly defined each of the charged offenses, as well as their included offenses, without attempting to explain the verdict forms. For example, after defining all the offenses, the court said, \u201cIf the jury is not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the offense charged in Count I. . . and it unanimously so finds, it may convict him of any lesser offense if the jury is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty of such lesser related offense.\u201d An instruction about count II was given with substantially identical wording.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">The court then told the jury that they had been instructed on \u201call the rules of law that may be necessary\u201d to reach a verdict. After that the court said, \u201clet me just briefly review with you the verdict forms in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>And then the court made the statements cited by appellant as error. The court told the jury that in the event they unanimously agreed that appellant was not guilty of the crime charged in count I, \u201cthen, and only then, would you consider the verdict form\u201d for the included offense of battery. The court further told the jury that if they unanimously agreed that appellant was not guilty of the crime charged in count II, \u201cthen and only then would the jury deliberate upon the lesser offense to which this verdict form applies . . .\u201d on the included assault charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">These instructions followed the general form of CALJIC No. 17.12 (1984 rev.; see 4th ed. 1987 pocket pt.), which was drafted in an effort to effectuate the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 503, 519-520 [183 Cal.Rptr. 647, 646 P.2d 809], that a criminal defendant may be entitled to a partial verdict of acquittal on the greater offense even though the jury is deadlocked on an included offense. (Com. to CALJIC No. 17.12 (4th ed. 1987 pocket pt., pp. 80-81.) Appellant cites the form of the instruction used by the trial court as error because of the \u201cdo not consider\u201d language not found in CALJIC. (He concedes that no prejudice occurred as to count II, on which the jury hung, but argues that the \u201cdo not deliberate\u201d language impacted on the deliberations about count I.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">We have previously held that the \u201cacquittal-first\u201d language in CALJIC No. 17.10 is a proper reflection of the <em>Stone </em>holding. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Zwiers </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 1498, 1503 [237 Cal.Rptr. 123], review den. Aug. 20, 1987.) Although the \u201cdo not deliberate\u201d language used by the court in relation to count II may be slightly more restrictive, it did not constitute error. As we stated above, the court below first instructed the jury on the law correctly defining the charged and included offenses. The language which appellant questions was used later and then only to explain how to use the verdict forms. The court instructed the jury to take its instructions as a whole, and we must presume they did so. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Zack </em>(1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 409, 416 [229 Cal.Rptr. 317].) Therefore, the jury must have understood that the court was stating that they should not consider using the verdict form, i.e., returning a verdict, for the included offense until they had decided to acquit of the greater offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">This was in accordance with the holding and language in <em>Stone (Stone </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 519), as we interpreted it in <em>Zwiers, </em>and which as yet has not been disapproved, though it remains unexplained, by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Even if error occurred, it was harmless. The \u201cdo not deliberate\u201d language was used only as to count II, on which the jury hung and as to which the court declared a mistrial. The jury had little difficulty with count I. After they resolved their questions about the meaning of \u201ccohabit,\u201d they took only about an hour to arrive at a decision. There is no indication in the record that the language of which appellant complains caused him any prejudice, and we find none.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\n<em>Impeachment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Appellant had suffered two prior felony convictions, one in about 1967 for auto theft, and one in 1980 for assault. The court held a hearing in accordance with <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111]. It then decided that both crimes involved moral turpitude, that the auto theft was more probative on the issue of honesty and credibility, and that under Evidence Code section 352, the probative value of the assault was outweighed by its prejudicial potential. The court therefore ruled that appellant could be impeached with the auto theft but that the assault would be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Appellant cites this ruling as an abuse of discretion. In light of the court\u2019s careful consideration of the facts and the law, we find this contention frivolous and not worthy of further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">White, P. J., and Merrill, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-12\"> All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b277-10\"> Appellant\u2019s counsel stated at oral argument that appellant does not rely on the \u201cnotice prong\u201d of the vagueness test, but on the \u201cequal application\u201d prong.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b277-11\"> We note, as urged by the People, that section 273.5 does not punish cohabitation; it punishes violence. \u201cCohabitation defines one of the protected classes, that is, unmarried cohabitors; it is not a constituent part of the prohibited activity.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gutierrez </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 944, 951 [217 Cal.Rptr. 616] [upholding constitutionality of section 273.5 against equal protection attack].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Section 273d was and remains a \u201cchild beating\u201d statute as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b278-8\">We are aware that two published Court of Appeal decisions upholding the \u201cdo not consider\u201d language have been ordered unpublished or have had review granted. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(Cal.
