Sweeten, </em>11 <em>N. J. Super. </em>39 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950), we perceive here no occasion to consider the implied agency of a wife to pledge her husband\u2019s credit in the purchase of necessaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The statement of the evidence submitted in pursuance of <em>Bules </em>1:2-23 and 4:2-6 discloses that the plaintiff testified \u201cthat Mr. Sweeten had authorized him to deliver the groceries enumerated in the book account to Mrs. Sweeten and, that he would be responsible for the debt,\u201d and that the plaintiff \u201cdenied that Mr. Sweeten had at any time directed him to discontinue the account.\u201d We find no contradiction of that testimony in the record before us. Moreover we are informed in the statement of the evidence of an affidavit made by Mr. Sweeten in a matrimonial cause in which he deposed: \u201cIn addition to providing my wife with a home, she also has the privilege of going to Krassan\u2019s store in Woodbury, where she may purchase unlimited amount of meats, vegetables and groceries for her demands and the bills for the purchase of the said commodities are paid by me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\"><em>Wanamaker v. Ulizio, </em>102 <em>N. J. L. </em>166 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1925), records a case in which the wife opened an account in her husband\u2019s name, with his knowledge and consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">In the present case the judgment eventuated from proof of the breach of an express contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
