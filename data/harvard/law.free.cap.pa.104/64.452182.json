Gitt, trustee, now for the use of said Edmund C. Gitt, in his own right, against Henry Eichelberger, Bufus A.

Plea, not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-10\">On the trial, before MoClean, P. J., both parties claimed through Henry Gitt, who, it was admitted, owned the tract in fee simple on and prior to March 1st 1849. On that day, by articles of agreement under seal, the said Henry Gitt sold the tract in question to his son Abdiel F. Gitt for the consideration of $5;915, payable as follows : $2,000 to be paid at the distribution of TIenry Gift\u2019s estate, after his death, among his children ; the balance to be paid in annual instalments of $200 each, the first payment to be made April 1st 1852 ; bonds to be given for said purchase-money, <em>\u201c </em>the bonds to be a lien on said farm until paid at the distribution of Henry Gift\u2019s estate, Abdiel F, Gitt to receive as cash as many of the bonds falling due last and unpaid, <em>\u201c </em>as it may require to equalize him in his legacy with the other heirs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-11\">On the date of said articles of agreement, Abdiel F. Gitt executed and delivered to Henry F. Gitt eighteen bonds of $200, and one bond for $115, payable annually on April 1st, in each year, from 1853 to 1871, inclusive. The ten bonds in suit were those due from 1853 to 1862, inclusive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-12\">Abdiel F.

Gitt to Henry Gitt for purchase-money, being those in'suit, have never been paid; that by the express clause in the deed from Henry Gitt to Abdiel F. Gitt, produced by the defendants, and through which they claim, the property was conveyed subject to the lien of said purchase-money, and that they, the plaintiffs, were entitled to enforce payment in this action of the balance of the original purchase-money, represented by said bonds so due and unpaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-9\">The defendants claimed that the receipt in the deed from Henry Gitt to Abdiel F. Gitt was evidence that the purchase-money was paid in full; that there was no connection between said deed and the bonds in suit, and that after the lapse of more than twenty-eight years continuous possession (adverse as to the payment oE purchase-money) since the date of the deed by themselves and their predecessor in title, the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover in this possessory action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-10\">The plaintiff's offered in evidence the articles of agreement of Marcll 1st 1849, between Henry Gitt and Abdiel F.

Gitt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>The defendants presented inter alia, the following points :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-5\">1. \u201c That the defendants, and A. F. Gitt, under whom they claim, and through whom they derive title, having been in actual, visible, continued, notorious, distinct and hostile possession of the premises in dispute for more than 21 years prior to the issuing of the writ in this suit, cannot now be disturbed in their possession by the plaintiff's, and the verdict should be in their favor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-6\">Answer. \u201c Our answer is, I know of no evidence in this case of the possession of the premises in dispute being hostile; and the question of the application of the statutory limitation to the facts in the case is reserved, as also in the fifth point.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-7\">2. The deed from Henry Gitt and wife, to A. I\u2019. Gitt, for the premises in dispute, executed and delivered December 21st 1853, with a receipt therein in full for the payment of the purchase money, accompanied by delivery of possession of the premises to A. F. Gitt; and a conveyance of the same premises by A. F. Gitt to Henry Eichelberger and Bufus A. Eichelberger, December 2d 1872, without any notice to them or knowledge by them of any claim for any of the purchase money by the representatives of Ilenry Gitt, until the issuing of the writ in this suit \u2014 constitute a waiver of any lien that might otherwise have been enforced. Equitable liens are not favored by our law; and after such great delay the plaintiffs, under the facts in this case, is held to have waived his right .to relief.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-8\">Answer. \u201c This point is not affirmed. The clause in the deed from Henry Gitt and wife to A. F. Gitt for the premises in dispute, \u2018 Subject to the payment of $5,915, the purchase money,\u2019 must be regarded on the question of notice to Henry Eichelberger and Bufus A. Eichelberger. Equitable liens are not favored by our law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-9\">3. \u201cHenry Gitt, the grantor, having, by his receipt in his deed to A. F. Gitt, acknowledged the payment to him of the purchase money in full by A. F. Gitt, such receipt is good against him and all who derive title subsequently from him, and protects the defendants from any claim now being set up by the plaintiffs for any of the purchase money.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-10\">Answer. \u201c This point is not affirmed. As we said in answer to the second point, the clause in the deed from Henry Gitt and wife to A. F. Gitt for the premises in dispute \u2018 Subject to the payment of $5,915, the purchase money,\u2019 must be regarded on the question of notice to Henry Eichelberger and Bufus A. Eichelberger.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-11\">4. \u201cThe Auditor\u2019s report making a final distribution of the estate of Nancy Gitt, having been confirmed by the court April 17th 1864, and recorded, is a full and complete adjudica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>tion of all claim for this purchase money, when it provides, inter alia, as follows: \u2018 For the purpose of making a final distribution of the estate, it was agreed before the Auditor that all bonds and obligations given by the sons should be brought into the account, and be applied as above stated, in payment of their respective shares, and that any surplus not required for that purpose should be rebated and distributed at cash value,\u2019 .... \u2018All bonds and obligations against the heirs are to be canceled and given up, and final settlement made as of April 1st 1861.\u2019 It was notice to the defendants, when they purchased the premises in dispute in December 1872, that all claim for this purchase money was satisfied and extinguished.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-5\">Answer. \u201c The question of fact raised by this point must be considered with the other testimony in the case, and then determined. It is contended as you have seen, on the one hand, that this language in the Auditor\u2019s report does not refer to these 10 bonds, and, on the other hand, it is said it does ; so that you must take all the testimony together in determining the question of fact.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-6\">6. \u201c Under all the evidence in the ease, and the law applicable thereto, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-7\">Answer. \u201cThis point is not affirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-8\">The court submitted the case to the jury mainly to find whether the bonds in suit had been paid, and if not, instructed them to find for the plaintiffs, subject to the question of law reserved, whether the statute of limitations was a bar to plaintiffs\u2019 recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-9\">In the general charge the court said, inter alia:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-10\">\u201c But if the Messrs. Eiehelberger, who took this title from A. F. Gitt in December 1872, with this title from Henry Gitt to Abdiei, containing this clause subject to the payment of the purchase money, had not found the articles of agreement, \u2014 if they had gone to the Register\u2019s office to have inquired after the settlement of the estate of Henry Gitt, the vendor, they would have found the will of Henry Gitt; and there again they would have seen that the testator refers to the conveyance of this Oak Grove farm, among others, and provides by that will that the bonds given for the payment of the purchase money are to be a lien on said property for which they were given until paid \u2014 the bonds were to be a lien on this property for which they were given until paid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-11\">Yerdict for the plaintiffs for the land described in the writ, to be released upon the payment by defendants of $3,001.91 with interest from date of verdict, within twelve months, subject to the opinion of the court upon the question reserved as above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>The court afterwards overruled a motion to enter judgment for defendants on the point reserved non obstante veredicto, and entered judgment for the plaintiffs on the verdict and the reserved point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-5\">The defendants thereupon took this writ of error, assigning for error the admission of the documentary and oral evidence offered by the plaintiffs, as mentioned in the foregoing report; the answers to defendants\u2019 points ; the portion of the charge above quoted, and the entry of judgment for the plaintiff on the point reserved.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b87-6\"><em>David Wills, </em>for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2D\">\u2014 The whole case was burdened with, and the jury misled by incompetent and irrelevant evidence. Henry Gift\u2019s will, which was proved long-subsequent to his deed, could not operate as declarations in favor of the plaintiffs, his representatives, against the defendants who claimed under his grantee. The articles of agreement were merged in the deed, and inadmissible to charge the grantee, no fraud being alleged. The bonds and the deed could not be connected by parol evidence. The settlements of the estates of Henry Gitt, Nancy Gitt and Mary Ann Gitt, were inadmissible to affect the defendants, who were not parties to those proceedings. But the Auditor\u2019s report, we say, shows that all the bonds were settled and paid. If, when the defendants purchased from A. F. Gitt, in 1872, they saw the old deed (and there is no evidence they did), it would only have informed them that in 1853 it was executed with a clause appended, subject to the payment of $5,915 purchase-money. Twenty-nine years had elapsed since the execution of the deed, and this length of time was a bar to any action that might be brought for an} unpaid purchase-money, and A. F. Gift having been in undisturbed possession of the land during this long period of time, it was entirely safe to pay this purchase-money, and take possession of this farm. They could confidently rely on the rule of law that this deed contained a merger of all articles of agreement relating to the sale of this land by Henry Gitt to A. F. Gitt. The doctrine of equitable liens on land has never been admitted into Pennsylvania jurisprudence: Kauffelt <em>v. </em>Bower, 7 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 64; Semple v. Burd, 7 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 286; Megargel <em>v. </em>Saul, 3 Whart. 20; Hiester <em>v. </em>Green, 12 Wr. 96; Zentmyer <em>v. </em>Mittower, 5 Barr 403. The receipt in a deed is good against the grantor, and all who derive title subsequently from him: Penna, Salt Co. <em>v. </em>Neel, 4 P. F. S. 9. The plaintiffs are barred by laches ; by the statutes of limitations (March 26th 1785, \u00a7 2, Purd. Dig. 927, pl. 3 ; April 27th 1855, \u00a7 7, P. L. 368); by the common law presumption of payment, by our adverse possession, and by estoppel: Hunt <em>v. </em>Wall, 25 Sm. 413; Campbell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>v. </em>Braden, 15 Norris 388; McCall <em>v. </em>Webb, 7 Norris 150; Strimpfler <em>v. </em>Roberts, 6 Harris 283; Pryor <em>v. </em>Wood, 7 Cas. 142; Pratt <em>v. </em>Eby, 17 P. F. S. 396. This is just such a stale claim as the policy of the law, the Limitation Acts, and the above decisions will turn out of court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-6\"><em>R. G. McCreary, </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b88-7\">Mr. Justice Trunkey</author>\n<p id=\"AfL\">delivered the opinion of the court, November 12th 1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Henry Gitt conveyed the land to Abdiel E. Gitt, on December 21st 1853, \u201csubject to the payment of five thousand nine hundred and fifteen dollars, the purchase money.\u201d These are apt words for imposing a lien, the grantee took the estate, conditioned for the payment of a certain sum, and performance of the condition may be enforced by action of ejectment: Strauss\u2019 Appeal, 49 Pa. St. 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">When A. F. Gitt sold the land, the purchasers saw on the face of the title the condition upon which it was held by the vendor, and they cannot complain of want of notice. The formal receipt for the purchase-money, being without dato, is presumed to be of the date of the deed, and, therefore, is not prima facie evidence that the lien so plainly expressed, was satisfied ; it is of no greater value than the acknowledgment of payment of the consideration written in the body of the deed. If the purchasers had made inquiry of the proper parties they could have learned whether the money was actually paid, and they stand in'the vendor\u2019s shoes, holding the land as if they had bought with express notice of the amount remaining unpaid. The rule is, that whatever puts a party on inquiry amounts to notice, where the inquiry becomes a duty, as in the case of a purchaser of land, and would lead to a knowledge of the requisite fact by the exercise of ordinary diligence and understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">Possession has been held by A. E. Gitt and his grantees under the terms of the deed from Henry Gitt, and the statute of limitations is as far from applying, as if they had held under articles of agreement for sale and purchase of the land. There is no pretence of evidence of possession other than upon the condition named in the deed. While holding as purchasers, subject to payment of the purchase-money, they cannot acquire a title under the statute, and the defendants first point was rightly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">It is true, as the defendants allege, that the contract dated March 1st 1849, between Henry Gitt and A. E. Gitt, was merged in the deed, and that no action will lie upon it. But it is pertinent evidence upon the question whether the bonds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>upon wliicli tlie plaintiff founds his action, were part of the purchase money. The contract and bonds are of same date, it provided for such bonds, that they should be a lien on the land till paid, that two thousand dollars should be paid at the distribution of Henry Gift\u2019s estate, and, contingently, that A. F. Gitt should have so many of the last bonds as would equalize his legady with the others. In connection therewith the will was competent, not to show a lien on the land, but to show the legacies, and to be followed by the acts of A. F. Gitt as one of the administrators cum testamento annexe. He made and filed an inventory of the personal estate of Henry Gitt, deceased, which included these bonds. In the Auditor\u2019s report of distribution, confirmed April lltli 1861, all the bonds were taken into the account and settled, except the ten in controversy ; and there is oral testimony that in 1861 he gave-these ten to E. O. Gitt, trustee of Mary Ann Gitt, one of the legatees of Henry Gitt, deceased. The -accounts and distributions of the estates of Nancy Gitt and Mary Ann Gitt were received, not to charge A. F. Gitt, but to show the sums allowed him as credits upon the bonds, the subject of this action. \u2019 A. F. Gitt was a party to the inventory, administrator\u2019s account, and proceedings before the Auditor in the settlement of Henry Gift\u2019s estate. We are not convinced that there was error in the receiving of testimony. It rested on the plaintiff to satisfy the jury by sufficient evidence that the bonds were a part of the purchase money and the sum that remained unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Nor was it error to refuse the defendants\u2019 fourth point. The question of fact was properly submitted to be determined upon the oral and written evidence. The agreement recited in the Auditor\u2019s report, relative to the cancellation and giving up of bonds for the purpose of final distribution of Henry Gitt\u2019s estate, cannot be treated as notice to purchasers of satisfaction of the lien for purchase money, for the report does not show that all the bonds were satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The lien created by the deed was for a certain sum. Other evidence shows that bonds were given for same debt, payable \u2022at different dates, the last in 1871. Eleven of the bonds, amounting to twenty-one hundred and fifteen dollars, including two that are in this suit, became due within twenty-one years preceding the bringing of this action. In 1861, A. F. Gitt accounted for and settled all the bonds, except the ten he had given to the plaintiff. Within twenty-one years the credits were made upon the bonds held by the plaintiff for the distributive shares due A. F. Gitt in the estate of Nancy Gitt and the estate of Mary Ann Gitt. If it be conceded that the Act of April 27, 1855, P. L. 368, should be so liberally construed as to apply to all kinds of charges upon real estate to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the ordinary presumption of payment applied, it cannot avail the defendants as a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. The period of limitation runs from the time the charge was due and payable'. If it began against each bond when it became due, the evidence of claim by and of payment to E. O. Gitt on account of the bonds which he held, is too strong for the court to rule that any of them are barred by the statute. Had the court charged, as the defendants requested, that there can be no recovery on the bonds due twenty-one years before the writ issued, it would have been error, for that would have taken the question of payment or claim on account of the bonds, within said time, from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Judgment affirmed. The time for payment of the money extended till January 21st 1884.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
