J., it appeared that the indorsement ivas written uuder the following circumstances :\u2014 William Scott and Andrew Scott were brothers and had been engaged in business together. The former, during his last illness, sent for his counsel, Thomas M. Marshall, Esq., to draw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>his will. Upon its execution, the said William Scott produced the certificate in question and after remarking that he had never had a settlement with his brother Andrew in their business relations, expressed a wish to assign $4,000 of this deposit to him. lie, therefore, requested Marshall to write the indorse, merit in question and when this was done, signed and handed it to Marshall with the remark that \u201che should take it with him and put it in his safe; that it was for Andrew Scott.\u201d Marshall look the certificate thus indorsed with him, retained it in his office until after the testator\u2019s death, which occurred several months later, and then handed it to Andrew Scott.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-6\">There was some evidence that William Scott, after the execution of this indorsement and before his death, instituted a search for said certificate and complained that it had been lost or stolen. This was offered by the plaintiffs as tending to show that there was no delivery of the certificate made or contemplated to be made in the lifetime of William Scott.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-7\">The court instructed the jury that the evidence not only failed to show, but expressly negatived the theory, that any delivery was made during the lifetime of the donor ; that as the indorsement was without consideration, it had no validity as a, contract. He, therefore, directed the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-8\">Verdict accordingly for the plaintiff, and judgment thereon. The defendant took this writ of error, assigning for error the said instruction of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b610-9\"><em>A. M. Brown </em>and <em>John S. Ferguson, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJBf\">\u2014 In furtherance of the donor\u2019s undoubted intention, the court should have sustained the assignment either as an executed gift or as a contract. The donor delivered the certificate to Marshall, with the instruction to take it, that it was for the donee. This was evidently an instruction to deliver it, the only delivery that the donor, a dying man, could possibly make. To constitute a valid gift it need not be delivered to the donee by the donor, but as in this case, it may be given to some third person for the donee\u2019s use, and this will be a valid delivery: Allen <em>v. </em>Cowan, 28 Barb. 101; Pringle <em>v. </em>Pringle, 9 P. F. S. 281. But the transaction was more than a gift. It was an instrument executed under seal, having as its consideration the obligation of the donor to the donee for past services. It was a solemn promise to pay $4,000 in settlement of a debt, and, as such, should have been sustained.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b610-10\"><em>J. M. Stoner, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4FB\">\u2014 Whether or not William Scott intended to deliver the certificate or have it delivered, is immaterial. Unless in point of fact it was so deliv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>ercd during Ins lifetime, it is without validity: McCarven\u2019s Estate, <em>7 </em>W. N.

A gift is a contract executed. The act of execution is the delivery of possession. Without delivery, it is only a contract to give, not binding for want of consideration: Campbell\u2019s Estate, 7 Barr 100; Withers <em>v. </em>Weaver, 10 Id. 391; Kidder <em>v. </em>Kidder, 9 Casey 268; Trough\u2019s Estate, 25 P. F. S. 115; Zimmerman <em>v. </em>Streeper, Id. 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">In the.present case there was no delivery to the donee, nor to any person for his use. The donee placed in the hands of his own attorney the certificate of deposit, and the order to pay a part of the sum therein specified to the donee, ile did not instruct his attorney to deliver it to the donee. The latter had no knowledge of any act of the donor relating to the intended gift. Without delivery the whole evidence was insufficient to support the paper as an executed contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
