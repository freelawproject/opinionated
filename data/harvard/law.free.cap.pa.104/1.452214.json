There is a, long line of authorities that, if the appeal is erroneous, the appellant should be allowed to perfect it within a given time, and that it is error to quash the appeal: Means <em>v. </em>Trout, 16 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 349; Huntingdon <em>v. </em>Jackson, 2 P. <em>&amp; </em>W. 431; Adams <em>v. </em>Null, 5 W. &amp; S. 363; Koenig <em>v. </em>Bauer, 7 Smith 171. These cases all involve the substantial point here concerned and evince the desire of this court to preserve the party\u2019s right to a jury trial; they all concern the recognizance required by the Act of 1810, while this case concerns also the affidavit required by the Act of April 20th 1876, (P. L. 43, Purd. Dig. 2083-4); but the former is as imperatively demanded by the earlier Act as is the latter by the later: Woodruff <em>v. </em>James, 2 Weekly Notes 50. Moreover, the transcript does not show the case to be within the Act of 1876, as the work and labor may have been that of superintendence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b19-6\"><em>R. M. Speer </em>(with him <em>H.

The Act of 1876, supra, being remedial, should be liberally construed to effect its object; it is imperative also, and makes it a condition precedent that the affidavit shall be filed before the appeal is taken: Heitler <em>v. </em>Earing, 18 Pittsb. L. J. 59; Wilson <em>v. </em>Kelly, 31 Smith 411; Lovering <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 1 Pittsb. 333; Carter <em>v. </em>Hess, 3 Weekly Notes 325; Mountney <em>v. </em>McFarland, 7 Phila. 392.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b19-7\">Mr. Justice Paxson</author>\n<p id=\"AF3\">delivered the opinion of the court, October 18th 1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-8\">We think the court below erred in striking off the appeal from the justice. It is true the recognizance as originally taken was defective, if we regard the case as coming within the Act of 20th April 1876, P. L. 43, which requires bail for the debt and costs upon appeals from judgments rendered \u201cfor wages of manual labor.\u201d This error in the recognizance was discovered by counsel for appellant on the day the appeal was filed, and a rule was at once taken to perfect the recognizance. The court below granted leave to amend; the additional recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>nizancs was filed, and subsequently tlie plaintiff\u2019s counsel obtained a rule to slrow cause why the appeal should not be stricken off. This rule was made absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-4\">The law favors the right of appeal. It involves the right of- trial by jury. Where an appeal has been taken in good faith, and within the time prescribed by law, it is usual to allow a defect to be amended. In other words, to perfect the appeal. So where a recognizance is defective, it is usual to allow it to be perfected where it produces no delay and does the other side no injury. The books are full of such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">Aside from this, it is more than doubtful whether the case comes within the Act of 1876. That Act refers only to the \u201c wages of manual labor.\u201d The transcript is \u201c for work and labor Don on farme.\u201d It may be argued that work and labor on a farm is manual labor. But this is a mere argument and a transcript should deal in facts. For anything that appears the work may have been that of superintendence merely. It must be remembered that the Act of 1876 is class legislation, and where one man claims a right that is not common to citizens generally, every requisite to bring the case within the Act should appear upon the docket of the justice, clearly and not argumentatively. It is especially proper to apply this rule where one of the parties is attempting to deprive his opponent of a trial by jury upon a mere technicality.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">The judgment is reversed, the appeal is reinstated and a procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
