Farm No. 1 was sold by the executors and bought by A. as trustee for the devisees. He then leased the same to B. (one of the devisees) who held it for several years, until it was again sold by A. under order of Orphans\u2019 Court. After the widow\u2019s death, B. had possession of farm No. 2 for several years, when he was made administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of the testator\u2019s estate, and sold the said farm as the will directed. A.\u2019s account as trustee and B.\u2019s account as administrator were both confirmed by the Orphans\u2019 Court, without exception. Subsequently, upon the appointment of an Auditor to report distribution of the funds in the hands of both accountants, derived from the sale of the two farms, the other devisees sought to charge B.\u2019s share of the fund with certain rents and profits, which it was claimed he owed the estate, on account of farm No. 1, during the time it was held by A. as trustee, and of farm No. 2 during the time between the widow\u2019s death, and B.\u2019s appointment as administrator :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b162-7\"><em>Meld, </em>that this would not be done, in the said proceeding for distribution, B.\u2019s contract of lease having been in his own right, and not as administrator, and his account as administrator having been duly confirmed by the court.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b162-8\">October <em>2d </em>1883.</decisiondate>\n<judges data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"A7H\">Before Mercur, C.

A. Purman, trustee in the matter of the sale of the real estate of said decedent; and also the funds in the hands of R. P. McCormick, administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of said decedent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-11\">At the audit the following facts appeared ; Robert McCormick died April 29th 1869, leaving to survive him, a widow, Lavinia, a son, Jacob McCormick, and twelve other children. His real estate consisted of two farms, one called the \u201c Home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Farm \u201d and the other the \u201c Krouse Farm.\u201d By his will dated February 20th of the same year, he directed that the Krouse farm should be sold and the proceeds divided among his children share and share alike, \u201c deducting from those who have received a part of their shares, what they have received so as to make them all equal.\u201d The Home farm the testator left to his wife during her life-time, with the direction that Robert P. McCormick, his son, move into the house with his mother, and take care of her for the use of the farm, paying taxes, etc. The will further jwovided that after the widow\u2019s death, the executors should sell the Home farm, also, and divide the proceeds among the testator\u2019s children share and share alike.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-6\">The widow died in September 1877. The executors sold the Krouse farm, as directed, and conveyed the same by deed, to the purchaser. But the latter having failed to \u00a1Day the balance of the purchase-money, the farm was again sold, bn a judgment for the same, by the sheriff, and bought by A. A. Purman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-7\">Purman held the farm in trust for the devisees set out in the will, and as such trustee sold it in June 1881, under an order of Chphans\u2019 Court; and a part of the fund for distribution by the Auditor was the proceeds of this sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-8\">Qn February 18th 1875, A. A. Purman, the trustee, rented the Krouse farm, by a written lease, to R. P. McCormick, who went on the farm in pursuance of said lease, and, as alleged by him, paid rent to Purman, during the time he occupied the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-9\">In June 1880, upon the death or removal of the executors under the will, R. P. McCormick was appointed administrator d. b. n. c. t. a., and soon afterwards sold the Home farm as the will directed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-10\">Jacob McCormick and the other devisees claimed before the Auditor that R. P. McCormick ought to be charged with the rents arising from the use of the Krouse farm while he had possession of it under Purman, to the amount of $600, and that he occupied the Home farm during the interval between the widow\u2019s death and the sale thereof, without making any return to the heirs, for which they claimed $600 more. They therefore asked the Auditor to marshal and adjust the estate by bringing into the distribution said $1,200, which they claimed was in R. P. McCormick\u2019s hands, and to require him to resort to the same for the payment Of his share in the estate and the shares of those held by him by assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-11\">In regard to these claims the Auditor reported as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-12\">\u201cIt appears from evidence that R. P. McCormick did occupy said Home farm for a term of about two years without making any returns to the other heirs in the way of rents. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>It is also sought to charge R. P. McCormick with <em>rents arising </em>from the use of the \u201c Krouse Farm,\u201d belonging to the estate aforesaid, he having rented said farm from A. A. Purman, Esq., trustee for the heirs of Robert McCormick, deceased. With reference to both claims, first, the administrator\u2019s account by R. P. McCormick, administrator, has been filed and confirmed by the court without exception being made in any way. The same is true of the account of A. A. Purman, trustee, and no account or charge of rent or rents made in any shape in either case. As to the justice of the claim, there seems to be no question, but as to an Auditor appointed by the Orphans\u2019 Court having power to adjust such claims, under the above state of facts, seems very questionable, and with all the power directly conferred and inferred by the construction put upon the Acts of Assembly relative to the Orphans\u2019 Court, your Auditor, after a ca'reful examination of all the cases cited by the counsel, and many others not cited, has failed to find wherein power has been delegated to him to settle such matters as the above, or wherein the essentials for making such adjustment have followed the power contemplated.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-5\">Exceptions filed to this report by Jacob McCormick, et ah, were dismissed by the court, Willson, P. J., delivering the opinion, which was, inter alia, as follows: \u201c There is nothing in the will of the decedent that differs from the directions usually contained in wills for the sale of real estate, and as has uniformly been held, the rents and profits of real estate, until sold, go to the heirs or persons named in the will, and if any one of them occupies real estate, he must account to the other heirs and not to the decedent\u2019s estate. While the Orphans\u2019 Court has fall power to settle and distribute the estate of decedents. it cannot do so as to the estates of the living. Anything that R. P. McCormick may owe on account of rents for the use of the real estate since his father\u2019s death must be settled in some other forum than the Orphans\u2019 Court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-6\">A deci\u2019ee was therefore entered confirming the Auditor\u2019s report, whereupon the exceptants took this appeal,' assigning for error the deci\u2019ee of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b164-7\"><em>A. A. </em>Purman, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ase\">\u2014 By the dii\u2019ections in the will to sell the real estate and distribxxte the proceeds, it was converted into personalty, fx-om the date of the testator\u2019s death : Allison <em>v. </em>Wilson, 13 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 332; Dundas\u2019s Appeal, 14 P. F. S. 330; Bell\u2019s Appeal, 16 P. F. S. 503. The effect of this was to render the executors accountable for the management of the real estate, or, in other words, for its rents and profits: Silverthorn v. McKinster, 2 Jones 72; Tucker <em>v. </em>Horner, 10 Phila. 124 This accountability, of course, descended to the administrator, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>d. b. n. c. t. a.: Drenkle <em>v. </em>Sharman, 9 W. 488; Richardson <em>v. </em>Id., 9 Parr 431; Carter <em>v. </em>Trueman, 7 Barr 315; Acts of March 12th 1800, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 4, and February 24th 1834, \u00a7 67. It is plain, therefore, that the Orphans\u2019 Court had jurisdiction: to marshal the rents and profits in this case, and adjust the rights and equities between the co-devisees: Barklay\u2019s Estate, 10 Barr 390; Scott on Intestates 55, 325; Redfield on Wills 352 (2d. ed.); 2 Williams on Ex\u2019rs 1457; Thompson\u2019s Appeal, 6 Wright 345.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-4\"><em>Donley </em>(with whom were <em>Barb do Dig hr am), </em>for appellee.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEF\">The doctrine of conversion does not apply to this case. R. P. McCormick never occupied either farm as administrator, c. t. a. In the case of the &lt;l Krouse Farm,\u201d he was lessee of Purman; and the heirs should have excepted to the latter\u2019s account as trustee. The \u201c Home Farm \u201d McCormick sold soon after his appointment as administrator, and his account as such was confirmed without exception. The Orphans\u2019 Court is limited in its jurisdiction to the powers given by the statutes, and it has not the general powers of a court of equity: Weyand <em>v. </em>Weller, 3 Wright 443; McCullough\u2019s Appeal, 2 Jones 197; Torrance <em>v. </em>Torrance, 3 Smith 505; Ainey\u2019s Appeal, 11 W. N. C. 568. It has no jurisdiction of a controversy between coheirs as to matters which have arisen since the decease of their ancestor; nor has it the power anywhere conferred to settle questions of rent between co-heirs arising since their ancestor\u2019s death. The rents belong to the heirs, and not to the estate or the administrator: Landis\u2019 Estate, 2 Phil. 217; Burnell\u2019s Estate, 9 W. N. C. 334; Haslage <em>v. </em>Krugh, 1 Casey 97.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The opinion of the court was delivered October 15th 1883.</p>\n<author id=\"b165-6\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ADQ\">\u2014 When the <em>\u201c </em>Krouse Farm \u201d was purchased by Purman it passed out of the hands of the appellee. Thenceforth Purman held it in trust for the heirs. Any contract which the appellee afterwards made with Purman for renting the land ivas in his own right, and not as administrator. He held it under a written lease, and according to its terms and conditions. Soon after his appointment as administrator he sold the <em>\u201c </em>Home Farm.\u201d He filed an account of his entire administration. It was confirmed, and the Auditor appointed to distribute the fund adjndged to be in his hands. We see nothing in the whole evidence to authorize the court in this distribution to charge the appellee with any greater sum than that fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
