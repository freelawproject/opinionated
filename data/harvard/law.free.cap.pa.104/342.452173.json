M. Jack, Esq., to boas follows : Samuel Wallace died January 18th 1881, leaving a will dated August 27th 1869, in which he provided as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AJpx\">\u201cItem First: To my beloved wife, Susan Wallace, I give and bequeath one-half of my household furniture to bo divided at its appraised value, one-third of all my personal property, except the proceeds or price of my farm which I lately sold, of which I bequeath one-third of the interest that may accrue on the same to be paid to her in half yearly payments during her natural lifetime, said bequests to her to be in lieu of dower.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-8\">\u201cItem Second: To my grandson, Speer Wallace Guthrie, -I give and bequeath the sum of two thousand dollars, and also one-third part of the proceeds of the sale of my farm aforesaid, \u2022the whole of this bequest I allow to be put at interest or invested to the best advantage by my executor for the use of said .Speer W'allace Guthrie, and paid over to him when he attains the age of twenty-one years, and in case of his death before ho attains his majority, or without issue, then it is my will that all that'I hereby bequeath to him, including also one-half of my household and kitchen furniture or the value thereof (which is hereby made part of this bequest), shall descend to and bo jointly inherited by my four sisters, Jean, Nancy, Rebecca and Rachel and their heirs as provided in item fourth for the distribution of the \u2018 residue and remainder.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-9\">\u201c Item Third : To my sister, Rebecca Knott, I give and bequeath the sum of five hundred dollars to be paid out of the first money in the hands of my executor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-10\">\u201cItem Fourth: All the residue and remainder of my estate, after paying my funeral expenses, just debts, bequests hereby made, &amp;c., I give and bequeath to my four sisters, Jean, Naucy, Rebecca and Rachel, to each one-fourth, to them and to their heirs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-11\">Susan Wallace died July 20th 1881, leaving a will of which she appointed W. R. Truby executor. The Auditor found that the farm referred to in the first item of the will was sold for $9,697.76 ; and the remainder of the decedent\u2019s personal estate amounted to $8,229.22. Truby, as executor of Mrs. Wallace, claimed that the intention of the testator was that his widow should be entitled to one-third of the latter sum before the debts and expenses were paid, and to the interest of the former sum during her life; thus throwing the expenses of administration, &amp;c., upon the residuary legatees. The Auditor, however, deducted the debts and expenses first, and awarded one-third of the residue to her executor, together with the interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>upon the fund produced by the testator\u2019s sale of his farm accruing between the dates of testator\u2019s death and of Mrs.-Wallace\u2019s death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-5\">Rebecca Knott, the testator\u2019s sister, died during his lifetime on February 1st 1877, leaving five children and several grandchildren, the issue of a deceased son. The testator having left a lineal descendant, Speer Wallace Guthrie, the Auditor held, that the Act of May 6th 1811, \u00a7 2 (Purd. Dig. 1176) did not apply, that the legacy to her lapsed and became part of the residuary fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-6\">The principal contest arose upon the fourth clause of the testator\u2019s will. It appeared that Jean Barnett, who had resided about six miles from the testator, and frequently visited his house, died thirty years before bis will was executed. Nancy Tomb lived in Blairsville, two miles distant, died September 21st 1865, and the testator attended the funeral. The will in question -was drawn for the testator by John Barnett, a fanner and a man of advanced age at the time. The testator\u2019s two other sisters, Rebecca Knott and Rachel Cunningham died before the testator, but after the execution of his will; and all four of his sisters left issue, surviving, him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-7\">The Auditor held that the legacies to the testator\u2019s sisters lapsed by reason of their death before him, and awarded the residuary -fund to those entitled under the intestate laws : viz. one-third to Truhy, executor of the decedent\u2019s widow, and two-thirds to Speer Wallace Guthrie, the testator\u2019s grandson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-8\">Exceptions filed to this report by the representatives of Jean Barnett, Nancy Tomb, Rebecca Knott and Rachel Cunningham, deceased, and by W. R. Truby, executor of Susan Wallace, deceased, were dismissed by the court, Blair, P. J., filing the following opinion :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-9\">I. Two of tho residuary legatees were dead when this will was made, and all of them died before the testator. The Auditor held that these legacies lapsed, or were void. In opposition to this opinion, it is contended that the word heirs in the residuary clause was not used in its usual legal sense, but that testator thereby meant to bequeath to the heirs of his sisters an estate proceeding directly from him to them. It will be noticed that the Act of May 6th 1844, preserving legacies to the issue of brothers and sisters, when such legatees die before testator, does not apply, as the testator, in the present case, left a lineal descendant, in the person of Speer Guthrie, a grandson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-10\">The weight of authority in Pennsylvania favors the conclusion at which the Auditor arrived : Sword <em>v. </em>Adams, 3 Yeates 34; Dickinson <em>v. </em>Purvis, 8 S. &amp; R. 71; Sloan <em>v. </em>Hanse, 2 Rawle 28; Ritter <em>v. </em>Fox, 6 Wharton 99; Comfort <em>v. </em>Mather, 2 W. &amp; S. 450; Campbell <em>v. </em>Jamison, 8 Barr 498; Gross\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Estate, 10 Barr 360; Appeal of the Trustees, 1 Outerhridge 187. Distinctions might be attempted between these cases and the present one, but I think they would not prove very satisfactory, and would tend to confuse the principle asserted in their decisions. Here, the residuary bequest is to my four sisters, Jean, Nancy, Rebecca and Rachel, to each one-fourth, to them and to their heirs. In Gittings <em>v. </em>McDermott, 2 M. &amp; K. 69, the language of the residuary clause was as follows: \u201c All the remainder of my property of whatsoever description, &amp;c., I give and bequeath iu equal shares to each of my dear sisters, viz: to my dear sister Mary Stewart, one-half, and to my sister Sarah Gittings, the other half of the said property, and upon their death respectively, to their heirs. Lord Brougham said that if the bequest of the residue stood alone, the death of one of the sisters in the lifetime of the testatrix would have caused a lapse, and a lapse was saved in that case mainly by the use of the word or, in previous bequests. Much importance seemed to be given to this word when the bequest is to one or his heirs. In 2 Williams on Executors 1088, 5th ed., it is said: \u201cIt appears to be now established that when there is a bequest to A. or his personal representatives, or, to A. or his heirs, the word \u2018 or,\u2019 generally speaking, implies a substitution, so as to prevent a lapse.\u201d See the force attached to it in Gross\u2019s Estate, supra, where Sorver <em>v. </em>Berndt, same book 213, is corrected and placed upon its proper foundation. In Sloan <em>v. </em>Hanse, supra, the court would not even construe the word \u201c or \u201d so as to save a lapse. In the present will the copulative is used instead of the disjunctive, which would make a stronger case against exceptants. It is not for us to pronounce a decree that'would seem to disturb the current of decision in this state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-5\">II. Exception is taken by counsel for the estate of Mrs. Wallace to the scheme of distribution adopted by the Auditor. She was the widow of testator, and it is thought she did not get all she was entitled to under the will. Her husband left her one-third of all his personal property absolutely, excepting, however, from this bequest, the sum of $9,697.76, the price for which he had sold his farm. He gave her one-third of the interest that might accrue on this sum during her life, these bequests to be in lieu of dower. It is contended she ought to get the one-third of the absolute bequest,' before deducting debts, and expenses of administration. This would give her about a thousand dollars more than the Auditor allowed her, and take an equal sum from the grandson. The reasons assigned for the adoption of this method of distribution are, that the widow is to be treated as a purchaser of what she got, and her legacy would, therefore, not abate even in favor of a child. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>But it is not a question of abatement. The question is how' much did testator give his widow ? The will says, the one-third of his whole estate absolutely, less a certain sum, the price of his farm, out of which he creates a specific or demonstrative legacy for his grandson and another for his widow during her lifetime. The Auditor gave her the one-third of the first bequest after deducting debts and expenses of administration. The argument is that he should have given her the third before such deductions were made, in other words, that she was entitled to a third of what testator owed. If the language of the will required such a construction, we would have to follow it. But an estate consists of what is left, after the payment of debts and the expenses of administrating it, and when one-third, or any other fractional part thereof is bequeathed, we readily understand what is meant. If he had given her a specific sum, in lieu of dower, so large as not to leave enough for payment of debts, and specific legacies, these legacies would have to give way to the claims of the widow. She was not bound to accept under the will if she was dissatisfied with the provision made for her. The residuary clause does not warrant the construction so ingeniously urged on behalf of the widow. It does not say she shall have her bequest before any debt is paid. The debts are mentioned before the bequests. It provides, as residuary clauses usually do, that after payment of funeral expenses, debts and bequests, the remainder shall go as directed. It would require much plainer language than this to show that testator meant to give his widow a sum equal to one-third of his debts and expenses of administration in addition to the one-third of his estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-5\">Exceptions dismissed and report confirmed : whereupon, Peter Barnett et al., children and heirs of Jean Barnett, Raney Tomb, Rachel Cunningham and Rebecca Knott, deceased, and W. R. Truby, executor of the last will and testament of Susan Wallace, deceased, took these appeals, assigning for error the decree of the court, dismissing .their exceptions and confirming the Auditor\u2019s report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b362-6\"><em>J.

The cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>relied on by tlie appellees do not apply.

In that case as in Dickinson <em>v. </em>Byron, 8 S. &amp; R. 71, testator was not aware of the death of his legatees when he made his will. Here, the bequests to the testator\u2019s two sisters whom he knew to be dead when he made his will should not be held to lapse. Those who were in his mind as the objects of his bounty could not have been his dead sisters but their children ; and this interpretation would not only effectuate his intention but prevent intestacy.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-4\"><em>M.

In our case no one can be affected but the residuary legatees, and the law casts upon them the burden of testator\u2019s debts and expenses of administration: Ward on Legacies 374; Kirk\u2019s Estate, 8 Weekly Notes 107; Reed <em>v. </em>Reed, 9 Watts 263; Earp\u2019s Will, 1 Parsons 460; McGlaughlin <em>v. </em>McGlaughlin, 12 Harris 22; Duncan <em>v. </em>Alt, 3 P. <em>&amp; W. </em>382; Conrad\u2019s Appeal, 9 Casey 49; Walker <em>v. </em>Dunshee, 2 Wright 430.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-6\"><em>George W.

He left no other lineal descendants. After providing for the widow and grandson by his will, he gave a legacy of $500 to liis sister Rebecca Knott, and then disposed of tiie residue as follows : \u201c All the rest and remainder of my estate, after paying my funeral expenses, just debts, bequests hereby made, &amp;c., I give and bequeath to my four sisters, Jean, Nancy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Rebecca and Rachel, to each one-fourth, to them and to their \u2022heirs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Two of the sisters, Jean and Raney, were dead at the time the testator made his will, and this fact was known to him. The other sisters Rebecca and Rachel died during the lifetime of the testator. All of them left children who survived the testator. The Auditor and the court below held that the legacies to all of the sisters lapsed by reason of the death of the respective legatees during the life of the testator, from which ruling this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">It was urged for the appellants that the word \u201cheirs\u201d in the residuary clause was not used in its ordinary sense as a word of limitation, but that the testator intended it as a word of purchase, and to bequeath to the heirs of his sisters an estate proceeding directly from him to them. A number of authorities were cited to show that in wills the word heirs is sometimes construed to mean children. Guthrie\u2019s Appeal, 1 Wright 13, was especially relied upon, where Justice Strong said: \u201c Undoubtedly the word heirs may be shown by the context to have been used in the sense of sons, daughters, children, &amp;c., and when it is so used the rule in Shelley\u2019s case is inapplicable.\u201d There are several cases where the word \u201c heirs \u201d has been held to mean children, but they were all instances where such was the evident intent of the testator as gathered from the will itself. This will contains nothing from which such an intent can be inferred. And the fact that the testator knew that two of his legatees were dead when he made his will, and intended the legacies to go to their children, can make no- difference unless he has expressed his intention in his will: Sword <em>v. </em>Adams, 3 Yeates 34; Comfort <em>v. </em>Mather, 2 W. &amp; S. 450; Campbell <em>v. </em>Jamison, 8 Barr 498; Sloan <em>v. </em>Hanse, 2 Rawle, 28; Dickinson <em>v. </em>Purvis, 8 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 71; Ritter <em>v. </em>Fox, 6 Wharton 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">It would be unprofitable to pursue this subject further ; indeed I would have not said so much but for the reason that wo were asked to abate somewhat the rigor of the old rule, and give effect to what the appellants contend was the intent of the testator. Our answer is that the decree of the court below carries out the testator\u2019s intent so far as he expressed it in his will, and that the rule referred to is a rule of property, sustained by a long line of authority both in England and in this country and too firmly embedded in our system of law to be uprooted by anything short of an Act of Assembly. There are already two statutes in this state which have to some extent modified the rule of the common law, viz : the Act of April 8th 1833, which saves the lapse in favor of a child or other lineal descendant, and the Act of May 6th 1844 which contains a similar pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>vision in favor of the children of a brother or sister where the testator leaves no lineal descendants. Neither Act applies to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">There is no merit in the widow\u2019s claim to have the testator\u2019s debts, expenses of the administration and costs of audit deducted from the residuary fund. There is no residuary fund nntil the debts and expenses are paid. The testator gave bis widow one-third of all his personal property absolutely, excepting however from this bequest the money for which bis farm should be sold. This amount was $9,897.76. Iio gave her the interest on one-third of this for life; the two bequests to be in lieu of dower. The claim of the widow would add about $1,000 to her share, and deduct that much from the grandson. The reason assigned for her claim is that the bequests in her favor are in lieu of dower; hence slie is a purchaser, and as to her there can be no abatement. It is not a question of abatement. The gift of one-third of the personal estate is a gift of oue-third of what may be left after the payment of debts and expenses. As this is ali her husband left her there is no abatement. We find no error in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The decree is affirmed and the appeals dismissed at the costs of the respective appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
