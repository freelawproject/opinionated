This for the purpose of showing that the plaintiff had the right to sue the witness and recover on the note at any time after its maturity, and that therefore the sureties were not discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-5\">Defendants object to the evidence offered, on the ground that the witness is not a defendant in the suit now on trial, judgment having been taken against him ; and secondly, that his evidence would create a liability on others and not on himself ; and third, by reason of the death of Dr. Ross, he is incompetent; and fourth, that his evidence is in contradiction of the \u2022written receipt and is incompetent on that ground.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-6\">Plaintiff amends his offer so as to coniine it to the proof of the facts occurring in the lifetime of Dr. Ross.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-7\">Defendants object that the witness is not competent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-8\">.

Apart from these Acts the witness was incompetent at common law, and under prior legislation, because he was a party defendant to the record, and his co defendants objected to his testifying, ilis testimony related to matters occurring during the lifetime of T. W. Ross, a joint maker of the note, to affect his estate. It was immaterial that judgment had been entered against him for default of appearance, he remained a party to. the record: Wolf <em>v. </em>Fink, 1 Barr 435; Swanzey <em>v. </em>Parker, 14 Wr. 454; Branthoover <em>v. </em>Cook, 5 Out. 209; Scott <em>v. </em>Lloyd, 12 Peters 149; Ash <em>v. </em>Guie, 1 Out. 493.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-6\"><em>J.

M. </em>Garrison, for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_M\">\u2014 The authorities chiefly relied on by plaintiffs in error, were cases of joint obligations by all the defendants; the note in this case is joint and several. Clark, at the time of the trial, was in no way interested in the event of the litigation-his liability was fixed by the judgment against him, which we say, discharged him from the record of the issue trying: Simpson\u2019s Executor <em>v. </em>Bovard, 24 P. F. S. 351; Talmage <em>v. </em>Burlingame, 9 Barr 21; Miller <em>v. </em>Stem, 2 Barr 286. The defence set up by the sureties was entirely personal to themselves. Clark was not even liable for the costs incurred in litigating that defence. lie was therefore a competent witness, apart from the Acts of 1865 and 1869, which we admit do not apply to the case: Good <em>v. </em>Calvert, 1 Pennypacker 140. The testimony given by Clark was competent: Weaver u. Wood, 9 Barr 220; Powell on Coal Company <em>v. </em>McShain, 25 P. F. S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>238; Shughart <em>v. </em>Moore, 28 P. F. S. 469; Graver <em>v. </em>Scott, 30 P. F. S. 88; Greenawalt <em>v. </em>Kohne, 4 Norris 369.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The opinion of the court was filed October 15th 1883.</p>\n<author id=\"Agi\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AMC\">\u2014 Clark was not a party in the issue being tried. He was not interested in the result. As to him the judgment had become final mine months before he was offered as a witness. His liability was fixed absolutely. The defence set up by the plaintiffs in error was personal as to the sureties. It did not, raise the question of consideration, or original liability on the note. The makers of the note were jointly and severally bound. The witness testified voluntarily to rebut a presumption which the sureties sought to raise from the payment of interest by the witness. The defence of the sureties being purely personal the witness was competent for the plaintiff below: Talmage <em>v. </em>Burlingame, 9 Barr 21; Simpson\u2019s Executor <em>v. </em>Bovard, 24 P. F. Smith 351; Good <em>v. </em>Calvert, 1 Pennypacker 140. It is very doubtful whether the receipt unexplained could have operated to the injury of the sureties.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
