Fobmeb adjudication \u25a0\u2014whether bar to second application for judgment for taxes. An order of the county court refusing judgment for taxes is not a bar to a subsequent application for judgment, unless-it was rendered upon the merits. If the former application for judgment was denied for informalities, only, in the mode of levying the tax, it will not constitute a bar to the subsequent collection of the same tax.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b210-7\" pgmap=\"210(89) 211(62)\">2. A railway company filed objections to the rendition of judgment against it for the road tax of 1889, for the following reasons: First, because the board of supervisors did not cause such tax to be levied as required by law; second, because there was no order of record showing the levy; third, because no notice was given to the company to appear and work out such tax; fourth, because the overseer did not deliver the list of delinquent road tax to the supervisor in the time required bylaw; fifth, because the county collector failed to designate on the tax books to what district the tax belonged; and sixth, because the property was not properly described in the collector\u2019s advertisement. The court sustained the objections: Held, that the judgment was no bar to a further application for judgment for the same tax and that of the next year.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b211-5\" pgmap=\"211\">3.

The People, 92 Ill. 619. That ease, however, is plainly distinguishable from the case at bar. There the objection to the rendition of judgment was, that the lands of the Cemetery Company were exempt from taxation under the provisions of its charter. The objection went to the justice of the tax itself, as it denied the liability of the objector to pay any tax at all without reference to the nature of the proceedings for the assessment or levy or collection of the tax. The question of exemption from taxation was there the only question to which the evidence was directed; and the county court, \u201cheld the lands were not subject to taxation, and thereupon a formal judgment was entered of record * * * denying the application for judgment against the lands in question.\u201d It was on account of the nature of the objection, as striking at the right to impose any tax whatever upon the lands involved, that section 276 of the Eevenue Act was held to afford no authority for ignoring the previous judgment denying the application of the collector. The rule in the Cemetery case was expressly limited \u201cto a case where there had been a trial on the merits,\u201d and it was said that the rule there laid down did \u201cnot apply where there has not been a trial on the merits.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b214-5\" pgmap=\"214\">In the case at bar, the judgment of May, 1890, must be considered with reference to the nature of the objections then presented to the court. The application of the collector made at that time was refused because the particular objections then made were sustained. What was the nature of those objections? They did not attack the justice of the\" tax, nor urgfe that the railroad company was not liable to pay the road taxes sought to be collected from it. The objections merely set up certain informalities and defects in the mode of procedure for the assessment, levy and collection of the road tax. They go mainly to the manner of levying the tax, and not to the merits of the tax itself. They, are such objections as can be cured or corrected by the officials making them.</p> <p id=\"b214-6\" pgmap=\"214\">Section 191 of the Eevenue Act says, that \u201cno error or informality in the proceedings of any of the officers connected with the assessment, levying or collecting of the taxes, not affecting the substantial justice of the tax itself, shall vitiate or in any manner affect the tax or the assessment thereof.\u201d The judgment here pleaded in bar was not a judgment, that the tax was unjust and such an one as ought not to be paid by the company, but that the application for judgment made in May, 1890, could not then be granted because of certain informalities which existed at that time. There is nothing in this record to show that those informalities existed when the application for judgment was made in May, 1891.</p> <p id=\"b214-7\" pgmap=\"214(43) 215(30)\">Section 277 of the Eevenue Act provides as follows: \u201cIf the tax or assessment on property liable to taxation is prevented from being collected for any year or years by reason of any erroneous proceeding or other cause, the amount of such -tax or assessment which such property should have paid may \u00a1be added to the tax on such property for any subsequent year, in separate columns, designating the year or years.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b215-5\" pgmap=\"215\">On the trial below the people introduced in evidence the -collector\u2019s return, or \u201csworn report of the list of delinquent \u2022lands, together with proof of publication thereof and notice of \u2022application.\u201d This return made a prima facie case, and such prima facie case was not overcome by introducing a judgment \u2022rendered a year before, which sustained objections to the \u25a0manner of assessing and levying the tax. We said, in Chiniquy v. The People, 78 Ill. 570, that the collector\u2019s return, \u201cof itself, is evidence, and ample evidence, of the assessment, the levy of the tax, and that it is due and unpaid, upon which the statute requires the court to render judgment, unless the objecting tax-payer shall show that it is substantially unjust to render the judgment against the land.\u201d In The People v. Givens, 123 Ill. 352, we also said: \u201cThe collector was not bound to show, that the tax was legally assessed, by proof, .until the presumption created by-his return of the delinquent .list was overcome, and it was the manifest duty of the county court to have rendered judgment upon the collector\u2019s report of delinquent lands and proof of publication, as required by law.\u201d When the collector made his prima facie case, \u201cif there were irregularities or valid reasons why this tax was not legally \u25a0assessed, the burden was upon defendant in error to establish such irregularity or illegality.\u201d (Idem.)</p> <p id=\"b215-7\" pgmap=\"215(103) 216(43)\">Inasmuch as the tax of 1889 was \u201cprevented from being \u2022collected\u201d for that year by reason of what were claimed to be \"\u201cerroneous proceedings,\u201d the amount of such tax was properly added to the tax for 1890. Non constat but that all the defects urged against the tax in May, 1890, had been corrected \u25a0since that time. This being so, the collector\u2019s return, together \u25a0with his application for judgment for the taxes both of 1889 \u2022and 1890, was prima facie evidence of the assessment and levy \u25a0of the tax of 1889 as well as of that of 1890, and it was the duty of the objecting tax-payer to show that there were defects-subsequent in date to May, 1890, or that the defects then existing still continued to exist when the tax for the year 1889 was added to that for the year 1890.</p> <p id=\"b216-5\" pgmap=\"216\">The judgment of the county court is reversed and the caus\u00e9is remanded to that court for further proceedings in accordance with the views herein expressed.</p> <p id=\"b216-6\" pgmap=\"216\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
