An instrument by a party in which he states that in consideration of one dollar, as well as for affection, he assigns and sets over-to his daughter all of his property, real and personal, to. have the same after his death, is good as a testamentary disposition, and valid when properly attested.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b649-9\" pgmap=\"649\">2. Same\u2014what is sufficient signing\u2014making mark.

Same\u2014proof of, where one witness is dead. One of two attesting witnesses to a will died before the will was offered for probate. The surviving witness, on the application for probate, testified that they both were present when the testator signed the instrument, and that the latter saw the testator sign it, and that it was so signed by him in the presence of both the witnesses, and it was proved that the signature-of the deceased witness, as subscribed, was in his handwriting, and that the will itself was in his handwriting, and that he was present and superintended the execution of the instrument. This was held sufficient,, and met the requirement of section 6 of the act relating to wills. In such case, the testimony of the surviving witness that he believes the-testator was of sound mind when he signed the instrument, will suffice.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b649-12\" pgmap=\"649\">5. Same\u2014statements of testator bef\u00f3te signing. A few minutes before the execution of a will the testator told a witness that he was making his will, and desired him to come to an attorney\u2019s office and witness it, which the witness did: Held, that such statement and request so shortly before the signing of the will might be regarded as a part of the res gestts, and proper evidence to indicate the testator\u2019s intention to make the paper signed, his will.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b649-13\" pgmap=\"649(22) 650(53)\">6. Same\u2014parol declarations of testator before and after signing. The parol declarations of a testator made before or after the execution o\u00a3 the will are not admissible for the purpose of invalidating the will.

The material part of the testimony of McClellan, as introduced by the defendants upon the trial, is as follows: I am Circuit Clerk \u00aef Macon County and have been 22 years; I knew Joseph Robinson 25 years, I guess; I saw this instrument of writing in J. S. Post\u2019s office on May 7, 1877; by request of Joseph Robinson I went up to J. S. Post\u2019s office and witnessed the same; my best recollection is I was standing on the sidewalk in front of Skelly\u2019s grocery store when he made the request; at that time his mind and memory were both good; he said he was making his will and wanted me to witness it; J. S. Post was acting as an attorney; J. S. Post wrote and prepared the instrument in controversy in this ease, proposed by Eliza Jane Brewster as the will of Joseph Robinson; upon that occasion I went with Robinson to Post\u2019s office for the purpose aforesaid; Robinson signed it by his mark and Post and I witnessed it; the instrument was signed by Robinson himself in the presence of Post and myself; we were all present at the same time\u2014Robinson signed it and then Post and I signed it as witnesses; Post and I signed it as witnesses in the presence of and at the request of Robinson; that is J. S. Post\u2019s signature and I saw him write it there; that is the signature of E. McClellan and in his handwriting; when he executed this instrument Robinson\u2019s mind was sound and his business capacity was good; I had business transactions with him up to within six months of his death; I don\u2019t recollect whether the instrument was read over to him or not at that time; I knew Post for 40 years and was intimately acquainted with him; he was a practicing attorney; I have seen him write and am familiar with his handwriting; the body of the instrument is in his handwriting ; he is dead\u2014his death occurred before January 17,1890\u2014 about five years ago, I think; I saw Robinson make his mark to said instrument; I don\u2019t know whether Rost saw Robinson sign it by making his mark or not; he was present and in a position where he could have seen him sign it; Post superintended the execution of the instrument; I can\u2019t tell whether Robinson saw me sign my name as a witness; he was in a position to have seen me sign it; we all signed it at the same time and at the same table and were within a few feet of each other during the whole transaction; Robinson controlled his real and personal property himself; it was only a few minutes after he requested me to go up to Post\u2019s office before I went up and saw him sign the paper in controversy; the instrument had been prepared previous to our going there upon that occasion; the instrument now shown me is the same which was shown to me when I testified in the County Court at the time it was admitted to probate. Upon cross-examination the \"witness said: Robinson could not read or write; part of the time he was a man of very intemperate habits; I don\u2019t think his habits were worse in 1877 than at other times;.I don\u2019t think he was an habitual drinker; I do not think he was intoxicated when I met him on the street; Skelly\u2019s grocery was across the street from Post\u2019s office\u201480 feet probably; I walked across the street with Robinson; I remained at Post\u2019s office some time talking, after I signed the paper; it was written when we got there except the signature; I think the words \u201cJoseph Robinson, his mark\u201d were written when we got there; I don\u2019t think it was read over to Robinson while I was there; I don\u2019t recollect that Post or Robinson said anything about the \u25a0contents of the paper or about the paper having been read over to Robinson; he did not request me to sign it as a witness in the office, but on the side-walk; he did not have the paper with him when he met me on the sidewalk; this is the paper they requested me to sign when I got up in the office; I do not recollect whether Robinson said anything about this paper being his will after we got into the office; when my attention was first called to this paper, my recollection of it was very indistinct; if I had not seen my signature, I could not have recalled the transaction; before April 4,1890,1 told Mr. Johns I could not remember whether anything was said to me by Robinson about this paper being a will. Upon his re-direct examination, the witness said: Robinson was all right as to-sobriety when this instrument was executed; he was in a condition to transact business intelligently at that time; no persons were in the office at the time except Post, Robinson and myself; my opinion is that Robinson understood all about it; \u2022 I do not pretend to say of my own knowledge that Robinson knew the contents of this paper which I signed as a witness.</summary><summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-4\" pgmap=\"654\">The defendants examined only two other witnesses besides McClellan.

There is a concurrence of the four requisites which have been held to be necessary in order to entitle a will to probate. (Canatsey v. Canatsey, 130 Ill. 397). 1. The instrument is in writing and was signed by Joseph Robinson. McClellan swears, that lie saw Robinson make his mark, and a signature is just as effective where the testator makes his mark, as where he signs his name. (Doran v. Mullen, 78 Ill. 342). 2. The instrument is attested by two credible witnesses, McClellan and Post. The subscribing, witnesses signed the instrument in the presence of Robinson and at his request, and their names are written opposite or under the word \u201cattest.\u201d It is not indispensable that the witnesses should subscribe any formal clause of attestation. (1 Redf. on Wills\u20144 ed.\u2014page 232, sec. 6, and note 14). 3. McClellan, one of the subscribing witnesses, .swears, that he and Post, the subscribing witnesses, were present when Robinson signed the instrument, and that he, McClellan, saw Robinson sign it, and that it ivas so signed by Iiim in the presence of the two subscribing witnesses. The 4wo subscribing witnesses do not declare on oath in this ease ihat they were present and saw the testator sign the instrument in their presence, because one of them died before the will was admitted to probate in the County Court. But section 6 of the Act in regard to Wills provides, that \u201cin all \u25a0cases where any one * * * of the witnesses to any will '* * * shall die * * * so that his * * * testimony cannot be procured, it shall be lawful * * * to admit proof of the handwriting of any such deceased * * '* witness, * \u2022 * * and such other secondary evidence as is admissible in courts of justice to establish written contracts .generally, in similar cases.\u201d Here, it was proven that the signature of J. S. Post, as subscribed to the instrument, was in the handwriting of said Post, and that the instrument itself was in his handwriting, and that he was present and superintended the execution of the instrument. We think that the proof required by section 6 was furnished, and that, under that \u2022section, the will was as much entitled to probate, as though the deceased witness had been present. 4. It is proven by the testimony of McClellan that he believes Robinson to have \u25a0been of sound mind and memory when he signed the instrument. We are of 'the opinion that the execution of the instrument was properly established by proof.</p> <p id=\"b657-7\" pgmap=\"657(42) 658(65)\">Second, it is claimed by the plaintiffs in error, that the court helow erred in admitting evidence of the declarations of the testator, made before, and subsequent to, his execution of the instrument in question. It is also claimed, that the court erred in instructing the jury that the presumption of the testator\u2019s knowledge of the contents of the instrument arising from the fact, that he signed it, might be considered by them \u201cin connection with all the other evidence in the case in determining the question as to whether he actually knew the contents of the paper at the time he executed it.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b658-4\" pgmap=\"658\">The parol declarations of a testator made before or after th\u00e9 execution of the will cannot be admitted for the purpose of invalidating the will. (Dickie v. Carter, 42 Ill. 376). It has been held, however, that declarations of a testator made subsequently to the execution of a will may sometimes be admitted merely for the purpose of showing his knowledge of its contents in cases where it has been charged that he was imposed upon by not being informed of such contents. (1 Redf. on Law of Wills\u20144 ed\u2014page 567, chapi 10, secs. 14 and 15). In the present ease, we think that the evidence of such declarations might well hav\u00e9 been omitted, but we do not think that they could have done the complainants any harm. Where the execution of a will by the testator is proven, as was done in this case, in such manner as the statute prescribes, it will be presumed that the testator knew its contents. (1 Redf. on Law of Wills\u20144 ed\u2014pge 567, chap. 10, sec. 14, note 61). Our statute of Wills does not require that the party executing a will shall make a declaration that it is his will. (Dickie v. Carter, supra). In this case, however, the proof does show, that the testator told McClellan he was making his will and wanted McClellan to witness it. The paper in controversy was produced to McClellan a few minutes after he was asked to go to Post\u2019s office to witness a will. It is true, that the instrument was not read over to Robinson at the time of its execution, nor did he then formally declare in words that it was his will. But it is not necessary to prove that the testator knew the contents of the will. Such knowlege is presumed . \u25a0from the fact of .his execution of it. (Doran v. Mullen, supra; Keithley v. Stafford, 126 Ill. 507).</p> <p id=\"b659-4\" pgmap=\"659\">In the case at bar, the complainants introduced no proof whatever to rebut the presumption of knowledge arising from. the execution of the instrument. If, therefore, the evidence of subsequent parol declarations tending to show knowledge of its contents had not been introduced, the jury would have been justified in finding that Robinson knew the contents of \u25a0the paper from the fact that he signed it. The evidence of the declarations was merely cumulative and in aid of the presumption arising from the execution. There is no proof that any fraud or imposition was practiced upon Robinson, or that anything was done to conceal from him the nature or meaning of the instrument which he was signing. Where testimony only tends to establish what, in the absence of proof, is a legal presumption, it may be irrelevant, but it can certainly work no injury in the absence of any proof tending to rebut or overthrow such presumption. (Powell v. McCord, 121 Ill. 330; In re Will of Dorothea Bonse, 18 Brad. 433).</p> <p id=\"b659-5\" pgmap=\"659\">Third, as to the form of the instrument. \u201cA last will and testament may be defined as the disposition of one\u2019s property to take effect after death. \u201d (1 Redf. on Law of Wills,\u20144 ed\u2014 page 5, chap. 2, sec. 2, par. 1). The instrument in controversy is a disposition of property to take effect after death. It is testamentary in character and wholly executory. The daughter was not to have or become the owner of the estate until her father\u2019s death. The vesting is deferred both in interest and possession until the death of the maker. The statement to McClellan, that he was making his will and the request to McClellan that he come and witness the will, made as such statement and request were only a few moments before signing the paper so as to be really a part of the res gestee, indicate that .it was Robinson\u2019s intention to make this instrument his will. (Frew v. Clarke, 80 Penn. State Rep. 170; Johnson v. Yancey, 65 Am. Dec. 646; 20 Ga. 707; Badgley v. Votrain, 68 Ill. 25; Olney v. Howe, 89 id. 556; Roth v. Michalis, 125 id. 325; Comer v. Comer, 120 id. 420).</p> <p id=\"b660-3\" pgmap=\"660\">Fourth, the instructions given conform to the views herein expressed. The only one of the given instructions, which is complained of, has already been noticed. Counsel for plaintiffs in error urge it as error, that the court below refused to give instructions numbered 5 and 6 asked by the complainants. Upon a careful comparison of these refused instructions with those that were given, as they are set forth in the record, we find that all which is material in the former is expressed in the latter.</p> <p id=\"b660-4\" pgmap=\"660\">The decree of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b660-5\" pgmap=\"660\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
