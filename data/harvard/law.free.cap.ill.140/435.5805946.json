Where a railway company entered into an agreement with another company, whereby the former acquired, by lease, the right to run its trains over the tracks of the latter for ten years, and then removed the ties and rails on its own road and failed to occupy the land over which its road passed for nine or ten years, but without an intention to permanently abandon the same, it was held, that such company, by its acts, did not lose its right of way.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b435-11\" pgmap=\"435\">2.

Durfee and others, to enjoin the occupancy of the right of way across twenty-five acres off the south end of the south-east quarter of the south-west quarter of section 10, in township 16, range 2, east of the third principal meridian, in the county of Macon, and State of Illinois, of the width of one hundred feet. The., title to the land stood in Elisha B. Durfee, who was a minor at the time the railroad was constructed across said land./ The title thereto was acquired by condemnation, in 1871, and] \"the payment of $1350 for such right of way. The right of way was acquired by the Peoria, Lincoln and Decatur Bail-Way Company, which afterwards, by consolidation with the Decatur, Mattoon and Southern Railway Company, formed the complainant corporation. All the other land for the right \u25a0of way, except one piece, was acquired by deed, and that one was condemned and afterwards deed executed for the same. The land before referred to, from the year 1871, when it was \u2022acquired, to the spring of 1880, was used in operating trains \u25a0over the same to and into Decatur. In the spring of 1880, George L. Bradbury, then general manager of appellee\u2019s road, ''entered into a contract with the Illinois. Central Bailroad Company to run trains over the Central to the Union depot, and to the junction of the Central with what is known as the \u201cjoint track,\u201d belonging to the Terre Haute and Peoria, and the Peoria, Decatur and Evansville companies, and also for the joint use of the depot and facilities. The contract was for ten years, and expired on the 7th day of June, A. D. 1890. After the contract was made, appellee ceased to use the old right of way, and from that time until the hearing used the Illinois Central tracks. The defendants base their right to take possession of and occupy the right of way on the ground that the railroad company has abandoned the right of way. Upon the hearing the circuit court entered a decree in favor of the complainant, as prayed for in the bill, and the decree was affirmed in the Appellate Court.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b436-4\" pgmap=\"436\">Messrs.

After acquiring the right of way the company constructed its road upon it, and used it in running its trains to and into Decatur, from 1871 to 1880. In the spring of 1880 the company entered into a contract with the Illinois Central Company, under which it acquired a right, for a period of ten years, to use the tracks of the Central Company. After this contract was made, the company ceased to use the right of way in question, and the rails and railroad ties were removed, and the'right of way was fenced up T\\ith \u25a0\u00abother adjoining lands, and defendant Durfee for a number of years paid .taxes on the right of way in connection with the land he owned, and the question presented is, whether these acts constituted an abandonment of the right of way on the part of the railroad company.</p> <p id=\"b439-5\" pgmap=\"439\">It appears from the testimony of Bradbury, the, general manager of the road at the time the contract was made with the Illinois Central company, and also from the evidence of Ewing, who succeeded Bradbury, that the railroad company had no intention of abandoning the right of way. This is \u2022confirmed by the evidence of the chief engineer, who testified that the intention of the company ultimately was to resume the running of trains over the old right of way. Under this evidence we perceive no ground whatever upon which it could be held that the railroad company had lost-its right of way by abandonment. It is conceded in the argument, to constitute an abandonment there must be non-user and an intention to abandon. Here was a non-user for a definite and fixed period \u2022of ten years, with no intention to abandon permanently the right of way, and we are aware of no authority under which it can be held the railroad company lost its right of way under \u25a0such a state of facts. In Barlow v. Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad Co. 29 Iowa, 276, it was held that the railroad \u25a0company did not lose its right of way from a failure to occupy the land acquired for that purpose, for a period of thirteen years; and in Columbus v. Cincinnati Southern Railroad Co. 37 Ind. 294, where the railroad company had entered into a contract with another company for the use of a part of its track, it was held that the taking up of the rails from a part \u2022of the track and removing them to a new track did not constitute an abandonment.</p> <p id=\"b439-6\" pgmap=\"439(34) 440(119)\">No importance is to be attached to the fact that appellant \u2022paid taxes on the right of way. His payment was under no diitle or color of title, and, however long continued, could confer no right. Nor can the appellant rely upon nine or ten years\u2019 possession as conferring any rights to him in the right of way. Had he entered claiming the land as his own, and occupied adversely for a period of twenty years, such an adverse possession might have been relied upon as a bar to any title held by the railroad company. Or had he entered under-color of title, and paid taxes for the period provided by the-statute to bar a recovery by the owner, a different question would arise. But the entry here was under neither title nor color of title, and hence our Statute of Limitations could not. be invoked as a defense.</p> <p id=\"b440-5\" pgmap=\"440\">The judgment of the Appellate Court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b440-6\" pgmap=\"440\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
