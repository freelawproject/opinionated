Practice\u2014conceded facts\u2014waiver of proof. Where, on the trial of an action to recover of a railway company for a personal injury on the ground of negligence in operating the road, it is practically conceded by both parties that the defendant was in the possession of the road and operating it, and that the men in charge of the road and its machinery were servants of the defendant, the objection that such facts are not proven will be devoid of merit.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b614-9\" pgmap=\"614\">2. Instructions'\u2014whether assuming facts. On the trial of an action to recover for a personal injury to the plaintiff, the court instructed the jury, that if they found the defendant guilty, then, in assessing the plaintiff\u2019s damages, they might take into consideration, not only the bodily disability occasioned by the accident, if any was proved,, but \u201calso an impairment of the plaintiff\u2019s general health which is shown by the evidence, and which the jury believe, from the evidence, will affect or impair his future ability to attend to his ordinary business, the same as if the injury complained of had not occurred.\u201d By another instruction for the plaintiff the jury were told, that in estimating his damages, present and prospective, they should give only such damages as were shown by the evidence, and in many of the defendant\u2019s instructions the jury were told that the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery must be shown by a preponderance of the evidence: Held, that the instruction first mentioned, taken in connection with the others, was not such as to mislead the jury, as assuming that the plaintiff\u2019s general health was impaired by the injury.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b614-10\" pgmap=\"614\">3.

Appears\u2014reviewing questions of fact. Where the Appellate Court \u25a0affirms a judgment of the trial court for the plaintiff, in an action to recover for a personal injury and an injury to property, the judgment of affirmance will settle affirmatively all controverted questions of fact in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, and they will not be subject to review in this court.

The question as to&gt; whether the damages awarded in the case are excessive or notr is a question of fact, and not a question of law that arises here. Beeler v. Webb, 113 Ill. 439; Joliet v.

A trial resulted in a verdict for plaintiff,, upon which judgment was rendered, and which was, on appeal,, affirmed by the Appellate Court.</p> <p id=\"b617-7\" pgmap=\"617\">All questions of fact are by the judgments of the circuit and Appellate Courts settled affirmatively in plaintiff\u2019s favor, and are not the subject of review in this court. This includes the-extent of plaintiff\u2019s injury and right of recovery. Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad Co. v. Holland, 122 Ill. 461; Joliet v. Weston, 123 id. 642, and cases cited.</p> <p id=\"b617-8\" pgmap=\"617\">It is insisted, however, that the court erred in giving the ninth instruction for the plaintiff, as follows:</p> <p id=\"b617-9\" pgmap=\"617\">\u201cThe court further instructs the jury, that if they find the defendant guilty under the testimony and instructions of the-court, then, in assessing the plaintiff\u2019s damages, the jury may-take into consideration not only the bodily disability occasioned by the accident, if any is proved, but also an impairment of the plaintiff\u2019s general health which is shown by the-evidence, and which the jury believe, from the evidence, will affect or impair his future ability to attend to his ordinary business the same as if the injury complained of had not occurred.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b617-10\" pgmap=\"617(64) 618(360) 619(130)\">It is urged the court thereby assumed as a fact that \u201can-impairment of the plaintiff\u2019s general health\u201d was shown by the evidence, and that fact being assumed, took the question of whether there was permanent impairment from the jury. It is stated by counsel for appellee that the word \u201can,\u201d as shown in the instruction as originally given, was \u201cany,\u201d so that it-read as given, \u201calso any impairment of plaintiff\u2019s general health which is shown by the evidence,\u201d etc., and that the \u25a0error occurred in copying the instruction into the transcript. A suggestion of diminution of the record is made, and leave asked in this court to file an amended record. We have not \u25a0seen proper to determine appellee\u2019s right to the leave asked, .for the reason that we are inclined to concur with the Appellate Court, that while the instruction, in the form in which it appears in the record, can not.be approved, when it is considered in connection with the context and other instructions given! it could have done no injury. The objectionable clause is preceded by an instruction to the jury, that if they find for the plaintiff, in assessing his damages they might take into \u2022consideration the \u201cbodily disability occasioned by the accident, if any is proved.\u201d And immediately following the objectionable clause, and coupled to it by the conjunction \u201cand,\u201d is the \u25a0statement, that the jury are to take into consideration any impairment of plaintiff\u2019s general health \u201cwhich they believe, from the evidence, will affect or impair his future ability\u201d to \u25a0attend to his business. By the tenth instruction given for the plaintiff the jury were told, that in estimating the plaintiff\u2019s damages, present and prospective, they should give only \u25a0such damages as were shown by the evidence. In numerous instructions given on behalf of the defendant they were instructed, that to enable the plaintiff to recover, his right to do \u2022so must be shown by a preponderance of the evidence. It \u2022seems impossible that the jury could have been misled into \u25a0supposing that the court assumed as a fact that there had been permanent impairment of the plaintiff\u2019s general health. Moreover, it appears that the plaintiff, then seventy years old, \u25a0was by the collision thrown from his wagon, striking the ground some fifteen feet away, with great violence. One result was concussion of the brain, rendering him unconscious at the time and delirious for many days. His neck, shoulders :and body were bruised, one bone of his forearm broken and the other dislocated at the wrist, and, traumatic cataract supervening from the injury, he had, at the time of the trial, practically lost the use of one eye. It is true, a physician testified that the broken and dislocated wrist, at the trial, was \u201ca pretty good wrist,\u201d or \u201ca very good wrist;\u201d but it is appar\u25a0ent this language was used in a comparative sense, and not .as intending to intimate that the wrist was not permanently injured. Without commenting further upon the evidence it is, when all the evidence is considered, practically undisputed that the plaintiff was, in the language of the Appellate Court, ^\u2018seriously and permanently crippled\u201d and disabled. The instruction was not liable to mislead the jury, and its being given was not prejudicial error.</p> <p id=\"b619-5\" pgmap=\"619\">It is also objected that the declaration was defective, and insufficient to support a judgment. The particular defect alleged is, that the ad damnum appears at the end of the third count of the declaration, and not elsewhere. The declaration consists of what appear to be four counts, the fourth being added after the ad damnum. There is no pretense that the first three counts do not state a good cause of action. But it is said, that if the evidence warrants a recovery at all, it could be under the third count only, as the ad damnum can apply only to that- count. The uniform practice is to place the ad damnum at the end of the declaration, and it then applies to counts which precede it. It is not necessary or proper to add it to each count. (Burst v. Wayne, 13 Ill. 599.) If objectionable on special demurrer, the first three counts of the declaration were clearly sufficient after verdict.</p> <p id=\"b619-6\" pgmap=\"619(77) 620(115)\">It is objected that there was no evidence showing that appellant was the owner of or operating the railway, or that the men in charge of the hand-car were in the employ of appellant. The fact that the defendant was in possession of the railroad and operating it, and that the men in charge of the hand-car were its servants, was assumed and practically conceded by both parties, and the case throughout tried on that theory. In at least three of the instructions asked by the defendant, and given, the fact that the defendant was in possession of the railroad and operating it is directly assumed. No objection was made, or suggestion of the want of direct proof of these facts, before the return of the verdict. Under these circumstances the contention is without merit. Both the court and jury were warranted in proceeding upon the theory that the proprietorship of the railroad, and the relation of the men in charge of and operating the hand-car with the defendant, were uncontroverted, and there was no issue, as there was in fact no real contention, in respect of such facts.</p> <p id=\"b620-5\" pgmap=\"620\">We find no error in this record which entitles appellant to a reversal of the judgment of the Appellate Court, and it is accordingly affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b620-6\" pgmap=\"620\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
