After finding that clear and convincing evidence supported a court-ordered waiver of the father\u2019s required consent in the child\u2019s best interest, the trial court ordered the waiver and granted the adoption. Perceiving no abuse of the court\u2019s discretion, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-15\">I. Statement of Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b538-16\">Beginning in the winter of 2006-2007, E.P. had a sexual relationship with K.H. The relationship ended after seven or eight months because E.P. disapproved of KH.\u2019s drinking habits. Not long thereafter, on October 6, 2007, K.H. gave birth to A.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-17\">For the first three months of her life, A.H. lived with her mother in homeless shelters. On January 28, 2008, the District\u2019s Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA) removed A.H. from her mother\u2019s care. On January 31, CFSA filed a peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>tion for neglect, and A.H. was committed forthwith to the agency for placement in foster care.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On March 28, a magistrate judge granted the government\u2019s motion for constructive service of process on the unknown father, and a notice was posted on March 81 in the Juvenile and Neglect Clerk\u2019s Office for a period of two weeks stating \u201cthat a neglect proceeding has been scheduled\u201d for A.H. \u201cborn to [K.H.] on October 6, 2007.\u201d The notice ordered the unknown father to appear at the next scheduled hearing, with date and time provided, adding that he had a right to seek custody of the minor child, that he had a court-appointed attorney, and that failure to respond to the notice could result in the court proceeding without the father being present.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Five weeks later, on May 7, K.H. stipulated before the magistrate judge that her daughter, then seven months old, was a neglected child, and the judge entered an order to that effect. K.H. also submitted an affidavit of paternity that identified the father as either a man named E. or a man named N. She was unable to provide last names or any other identifying information, but she said that she could point out addresses where these men could be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">District of Columbia law requires a hearing, within one year after a child\u2019s entry into foster care, to determine a plan for the child\u2019s permanent custody.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, on May 21, 2008, the magistrate judge confirmed that the permanency goal was reunification of A.H. with her mother, K.H., and ordered the provision of appropriate social services to facilitate that goal. Three months later, on September 3, the magistrate judge reiterated that the permanency goal was reunification but recognized that the case was likely to move toward guardianship or adoption. Were that to happen, the natural father would have to either claim or waive his right to custody;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> thus, the judge asked the parties to launch an effort to locate A.H.\u2019s father. Thereafter, social workers were often unable to reach K.H., who also missed two appointments with the investigator assigned to locate the father. A court-appointed counsel for the unknown father also hired an investigator, who was unsuccessful in finding the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">At a hearing on December 8, 2008, the magistrate judge ordered the permanency goal changed from reunification to adoption, and on January 16, 2009, a motion was filed<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to terminate the parental rights of both K.H. and the child\u2019s father. Sometime in January, if not earlier, the petitioner, C.L.O., expressed an interest in adopting A.H., who was moved, as a result, from her first foster home to C.L.O.\u2019s care on January 25. The child was a little over one year old. C.L.O. brought A.H. to medical and dental appointments, as well as to developmental, language, and speech assessments. Over the course of a year, social workers expressed satisfaction at several status hearings that, under C.L.O.\u2019s care, A.H. was thriving and on target developmentally.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">C.L.O. filed a petition for adoption on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>October 19, 2009,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> when A.H. had just turned two years old. K.H. received a notice of the petition within a few days, and efforts were made to serve notice on a man named E.T. (not E.P.) and another named N. Meanwhile, as he acknowledged later at trial, E.P. had learned from his cousin some two months earlier, in August 2009, that \u201cK. had the baby and that K. wanted [E.P.] to come and get the baby.\u201d E.P. further testified that he then knew \u201cit might have been a possibility\u201d that the baby was his child, and that he decided to seek out K.H. to \u201csee what the problem was since she said [to his cousin] she couldn\u2019t handle ... having the baby.\u201d Not knowing where to find K.H., E.P. initially relied on his cousin to contact her. He waited two weeks for his cousin to report back; he heard nothing from her. E.P. then went with his cousin to K.H.\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He learned from K.H.\u2019s family that she had left the house with her baby, implying that she would return. E.P. returned to the grandmother\u2019s house three or four more times over the next \u201cmonth or less,\u201d without finding K.H. or the baby there. He made no further effort to find mother or child.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">At the next hearing on January 26, 2010, K.H. consented to A.H.\u2019s adoption. Arrangements were made once more for K.H. to accompany a CFSA investigator, who was also a process server, to try to locate A.H.\u2019s father. This time they succeeded. E.P. was served with a notice for termination of parental rights (TPR) on January 28 \u2014 five months after he had learned about the child \u2014 and with a notice of the proposed adoption a month later on February 23. E.P. maintains that he had been unaware that A.H. was in a foster home until he was served with the TPR notice in January, and that he had not been certain the child was his until a DNA test confirmed his paternity in March 2010. Immediately after the DNA result, E.P. said, he contacted CFSA. Without waiting for a court order, the agency arranged for E.P. to have two, one-hour supervised visits with A.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">E.P. attended the next scheduled status hearing on March 25, 2010 and notified the magistrate judge that he wished to work toward gaining custody of his child. Because E.P. had just been identified as the father, the judge chose to maintain the goal of adoption. However, he deferred a hearing on the adoption petition, giving the parties additional time to discuss their respective positions. Taking into account the child\u2019s young age and the absence of information about E.P.\u2019s ability to care for her, the magistrate judge formalized E.P.\u2019s visitation rights with an order allowing supervised visits of at least one hour each week, and he granted CFSA, the guardian <em>ad litem, </em>and the foster mother (C.L.O.) discretion to determine together whether to permit unsupervised visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Four months later on July 26, 2010, having failed to obtain permission for unsupervised visits, E.P. filed a motion for unsupervised visitation and for appointment of an independent social worker. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>The magistrate judge denied the motion as well as a motion to reconsider. The judge held a permanency hearing on September 14, at which E.P. withheld his consent to A.H.\u2019s adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">On October 14, 2010, the magistrate judge convened a show cause hearing<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to evaluate whether the court, in the child\u2019s best interest, should waive the statutory requirement for E.P.\u2019s consent to the adoption. By that time, A.H. had just turned three years old. She had been in foster care for all but three months of her life, and the petitions for TPR and adoption had been pending for nine months and eight months, respectively. The parties presented extensive evidence over the course of four days, including testimony from C.L.O. and E.P., as well as from three of E.P.\u2019s daughters (by other mothers); the mother of one of his daughters; E.P.\u2019s own mother; four social workers who had been supervising the case; A.H.\u2019s daycare teacher; a child psychiatrist; and a clinical psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">C.L.O. testified that she has a bachelor\u2019s degree, as well as a master\u2019s degree in social work, from Howard University. She has been employed by CFSA as a supervisory social worker for twenty years. C.L.O. has one biological teenage daughter for whom she has always been the primary caretaker. She lives with L.A.L., her daughter\u2019s biological father, and she owns her home. She was forty-nine years old at the time of the hearing, she said, and was in good health except for high blood pressure controlled by medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">C.L.O. then testified about the close relationship A.H. has developed with C.L.O. and her family. A.H. refers to C.L.O. as \u201cmom.\u201d She refers to C.L.O.\u2019s biological daughter as her sister or her best friend. L.A.L. and A.H. have a positive relationship, and A.H. refers to L.A.L. as her \u201cdaddy.\u201d C.L.O. further testified that she believed removal of A.H. from her home would be \u201ctraumatic\u201d for the child. C.L.O. also testified that, if the adoption were approved, she would agree to allow E.P. to develop a relationship with his daughter, beginning by inviting him to holidays and special events and then giving A.H. more freedom to decide when to meet with her father as she gets older.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">A.H.\u2019s daycare teacher testified that A.H. was a healthy and active child, with no behavioral problems, good hygiene, excellent attendance, and good communication and social skills. She described C.L.O. as \u201cvery attentive\u201d to A.H.\u2019s needs. Emily Colebrook, one of the CFSA social workers, testified that \u201cC.L.O. took every step that was recommended\u201d for A.H.\u2019s care and \u201creally went above and beyond to make sure [A.H.] continued to progress.\u201d Ms. Colebrook added that C.L.O. and L.A.L. had a very positive relationship with A.H.; the relationship was trusting, nurturing, loving, and marked by appropriate disciplinary boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">Kathryn King, a supervisory social worker, testified about the attentive care that C.L.O. was providing and stressed the bond that had developed between A.H. and her pre-adoptive family. Ms. King further testified that she believed it would be devastating for A.H. to be removed from C.L.O.\u2019s home because \u201cshe\u2019s totally bonded to [C.L.O.j\u2019s family, her biological daughter, her boyfriend [L.A.L.]. She\u2019s\u2014 that\u2019s her family.\u201d Carolyn Nicholson, a third CFSA social worker, testified similarly about the positive relationship between A.H. and C.L.O., stating that A.H. appeared to be \u201cfully integrated into that foster family.\u201d On the other hand, a fourth CFSA social worker, Marie Cohen, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>testified about the positive nature of EJP.\u2019s visits with his daughter and stated that she was not comfortable with the permanency goal of adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The magistrate judge then heard testimony from E.P. that he was unemployed at the time of the hearing but was actively seeking employment, and that his income consisted of unemployment compensation, food stamps, and payments for odd jobs. At the time of the hearing, E.P. lived with his mother, for whom he provided some financial support. E.P. was fifty-five years old at the time of the hearing and in good health, with the exception of high blood pressure controlled by medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">E.P. testified that he has had seven children (including A.H.) with five different women, and that he was \u201calways very active with [his] kids,\u201d having a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with each. E.P. acknowledged, however, that he did not know what his eldest son (aged thirty-six and living in Wisconsin) \u201cwas up to.\u201d E.P.\u2019s second and third sons were killed at a young age following involvement in criminal activity. None of E.P.\u2019s sons finished high school.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">E.P.\u2019s eldest daughter, D.P.W., was thirty at the time of the hearing. She testified that E.P. had lived with her mother until D.P.W. was five years old and that he had been engaged in her upbringing. She also lived with E.P. for five months when she was fourteen, after becoming pregnant. E.P.\u2019s second daughter, E.J., testified that she had spent many weekends with her father growing up and that he had provided her with necessities such as school supplies. Neither D.P.W. nor E.J. finished high school, but they have since obtained General Equivalency Degrees (GEDs) and job training.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">According to E.P.\u2019s third daughter, S.C., E.P. maintains a close relationship with her and participates in her high school education. S.C.\u2019s mother stressed that, with the assistance of family members and hired nurses, E.P. had cared for S.C., as well as S.C.\u2019s five siblings, for a number of years immediately following S.C.\u2019s birth when S.C.\u2019s mother was seriously ill. S.C.\u2019s mother testified that during this time E.P. \u201cwould cook, he would wash the clothes, help with the kids, take them out to play.\u201d E.P. testified that he had paid child support for one of his seven children and provided for them informally when needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">The magistrate judge learned from a social worker that E.P. had not missed a single visit with A.H., who had responded positively except on one occasion, when she exhibited an unusual reluctance to engage with him. E.P. brought his daughter a snack for each visit, as well as a basket for Easter; cake, ice cream, and a doll for her birthday; and clothing on another occasion. After a number of visits, A.H. began referring to E.P. as \u201cdaddy.\u201d E.P. testified that he hoped A.H. could gradually experience a transition to his custody, but he was not able to articulate a plan for her care if he were to obtain custody. He added that A.H. would reside with him at his mother\u2019s home along with his seventy-year-old mother and a \u201cCousin James.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">At the hearing, E.P. acknowledged that he had a criminal record. In 1991, he pled guilty to attempted carnal knowledge, and a year later he pled guilty to simple assault. E.P. had earlier failed to come forward \"with information about the attempted carnal knowledge conviction when social workers asked him to disclose prior convictions, if any. Two of the social workers testified, accordingly, that they had refused to grant E.P. unsupervised visits with A.H. because they had been concerned about his judgment and character.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">Finally, a child psychiatrist, Dr. Susan Thuet, and a clinical psychologist, Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Charles Missar, offered expert clinical opinions about A.H.\u2019s respective attachments to C.L.O. and E.P. Dr. Thuet testified that the strongest aspects of attachment are witnessed from birth to about three and a half years old, a period when the risks associated with breaking attachments \u2014 sadness, crying, irritability, and sleep problems \u2014 are the greatest. Based on her observation of A.H. with C.L.O., and then with E.P., during two consecutive, forty-five minute \u201cattachment\u201d studies, Dr. Thuet testified that in her clinical opinion A.H. had developed positive attachments of equal strength to C.L.O. and E.P. She added that she believed A.H. would be sad and distressed to leave her pre-adoptive home with C.L.O.\u2019s family, and that there was a risk of long-term psychological harm in doing so that would turn on a number of factors, including the nature of the relationship A.H. developed in a different home, the results of therapy, and A.H.\u2019s own constitution. She testified, however, that the psychological harm to A.H. would be the same if she were no longer permitted to interact with E.P. because \u201cthe strength of the attachment ... between her and her father was very significant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Dr. Missar\u2019s testimony differed from Dr. Thuet\u2019s, including his distinction between a \u201cbond\u201d and an \u201cattachment.\u201d Dr. Missar defined a psychological attachment as \u201cmuch deeper than a bond relationship.\u201d He stated that the short-term consequences of breaking an attachment for a child under four to five years old include \u201cemotional regression\u201d and a likelihood that the child will \u201ccry, break down, have temper tantrums, act out.\u201d The long-term consequences include having \u201ctrouble reattaching to people.\u201d He agreed that the first four years of a child\u2019s life were the most critical with regard to the development and maintenance of attachments. Dr. Missar further testified that, based on his review of background materials as well as Dr. Thuet\u2019s report, A.H. had developed a positive bond with E.P. and that breaking that bond would have an emotional impact on A.H. But he stressed that in his clinical opinion A.H. had developed a more profound relationship with C.L.O. \u2014 an attachment \u2014 and that breaking that attachment would lead to immediate emotional regression and a likelihood of long-term emotional complications.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">In both opening statement and closing argument, counsel for C.L.O. maintained that E.P. had not \u201cembraee[d] his parental responsibilities with sufficient urgency and enthusiasm\u201d to support \u201cany presumptive evidentiary weight to which he may otherwise be entitled.\u201d Counsel argued, in addition, that C.L.O. had satisfied the clear and convincing evidence standard entitling her to adopt A.H. Counsel for the government agreed. A.H.\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>argued that E.P. had seized his constitutional \u201copportunity interest\u201d but that the adoption would nonetheless be in the child\u2019s best interest. The guardian explained that \u201c[fit\u2019s unfortunate how the events transpired, but the child already has a family, and I don\u2019t see any reason for that family relationship to be disrupted at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">On November 18, 2010, the magistrate judge found by clear and convincing evidence that, in the best interest of A.H., the court would waive E.P.\u2019s consent to adoption. On March 9, 2011, the judge issued written Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Waiving Consent of Biological Father. The final decree of adoption was issued the same day by another magistrate judge in chambers, and E.P. filed a timely motion for review. On May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>23, 2011, the trial judge,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> after reviewing the record,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> affirmed the final decree and all preliminary orders. E.P. filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The trial judge reviewed the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, conclusions, and final order, applying the same standard of review as this court would apply on appeal of a judgment or order of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial judge reviewed the magistrate judge\u2019s order for errors of law, abuse of discretion, or clear lack of eviden-tiary support,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and affirmed. We, in turn, review the trial judge\u2019s order.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Although \u201c[w]e are mindful that from a procedural standpoint, our role is to review the order of the [trial] judge, not the magistrate judge, ... we do not believe our powers of appellate review are so limited that, in reviewing the trial court\u2019s final order we may not look to the findings and conclusions of the fact finder on which that ruling is based.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, we review the magistrate judge\u2019s factual findings as the findings of the trial judge and review for \u201cabuse of discretion or a clear lack of evidentiary support.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As to alleged errors of law, however, we review the record <em>de novo, </em>without deference to the judges below.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-15\">\u201cThe determination of whether a birth parent\u2019s consent to the adoption of a child has been withheld contrary to the child\u2019s best interest is confided to the trial court\u2019s sound discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We therefore review the court\u2019s order for abuse of discretion, \u201c \u2018determining whether the trial court exercised its discretion within the range of possible alternatives, based on all the relevant factors and no improper factors.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cIn so doing, \u2018we ... evaluate whether its decision is supported by substantial reasoning drawn from a firm factual foundation in the record.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-16\">III. Applicable Law</p>\n<p id=\"b544-17\">As a general rule, the trial court may not grant a petition for adoption of an infant child without a written statement of consent from the child\u2019s living parents, both the natural mother and the natural father.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The court, however, after a hearing, may waive this required parental consent upon a finding that consent is \u201cwithheld contrary to the best interest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>child.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201cWhere a biological parent declines to consent to a proposed adoption, the prospective adoptive parent must ordinarily show by clear and convincing evidence that consent is being withheld contrary to the child\u2019s best interest.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The \u201cbest interest\u201d determination requires the court to apply the same factors used in a proceeding to terminate parental rights.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Three of those factors are relevant here:<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">(1) the child\u2019s need for continuity of care and caretakers and for timely integration into a stable and permanent home, taking into account the differences in the development and the concept of time of children of different ages;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">(2) the physical, mental and emotional health of all individuals involved to the degree that such affects the welfare of the child, the decisive consideration being the physical, mental and emotional needs of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-12\">(3)the quality of the interaction and interrelationship of the child with his or her parents, siblings, relatives, and/or caretakers, including the foster parent;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">The court must apply these factors with full recognition of the \u201cgravity of a decision whether to terminate parental rights.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The court therefore begins by recognizing \u201cthe presumption that the child\u2019s best interest will be served by placing the child with his natural parent, provided the parent has not been proven unfit.\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Even for fit fathers, however, there is a limitation. The court will invoke the presumption or preference<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> in favor of a fit, unwed, noncustodial father only when the court finds that he timely grasped his constitutional \u201cliberty\u201d interest \u2014 now commonly called his \u201copportunity interest\u201d\u2014 protected by due process.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> That is to say, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>the father must have \u201cearly on, and continually, done all that he could reasonably have been expected to do under the circumstances to pursue that interest\u201d in developing a custodial relationship with his child.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">When a fit, unwed, noncustodial father has seized his opportunity interest, his resulting right to presumptive custody \u201ccan be overridden only by a showing by clear and convincing evidence that it is in the best interest of the child to be placed with unrelated persons.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> But suppose the same father has failed to seize his opportunity interest, yet opposes the adoption of his child. Does the trial court employ the same standard for terminating the father\u2019s parental rights, namely, whether clear and convincing evidence demonstrates that he is withholding his consent contrary to the child\u2019s best interest? This court has not expressly addressed this question, and, as we shall see, we need not answer it here. From the trial judge\u2019s review, we discern that she reached conclusions in the alternative: that (1) based on subsidiary facts found by the magistrate judge, E.P. had surrendered his opportunity interest, but that (2) even though the magistrate judge did not mention E.P.\u2019s opportunity interest in the written findings of fact and conclusions of law, the record supplied clear and convincing evidence supporting the waiver. A majority of the division agrees that we need not address the first alternative, because the majority agrees that even if E.P. did grasp his opportunity interest, the court-imposed waiver of his consent to the adoption was supported by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We turn, therefore, to our explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">IV. The Child\u2019s Best Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">Both the magistrate judge and the trial judge found clear and convincing evidence that C.L.O.\u2019s adoption of A.H., facilitated by a court-imposed waiver of E.P.\u2019s right to consent, was in the child\u2019s best interest. We turn to the applicable statutory criteria, beginning with the first of the three applicable factors.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">\n<em>(1) The child\u2019s need for continuity of care and caretakers and for timely inte</em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>\n<em>gration into a stable and permanent home, taking into account the differences in the development and the concept of time of children of different ages.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqEh\">E.P. argues that the evidence shows \u201che would provide a stable, loving home for A.H.\u201d This may be true, but his contention neglects to consider the child\u2019s need for \u201ccontinuity of care\u201d and \u201ctimely integration\u201d into a home that is not only \u201cstable\u201d but also \u201cpermanent.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Record evidence supports the magistrate judge\u2019s findings that A.H. has been removed twice from her primary caretaker \u2014 once from her biological mother and then from her first foster home; that A.H. has lived with C.L.O. since January 25, 2009 and has been a member of C.L.O.\u2019s family \u201cfor more than half of her short life\u201d; that C.L.O. has been the primary care provider for her biological daughter since the child\u2019s birth in 1997; and that E.P., to the contrary, has not been the primary care provider for any of his seven children, except during brief periods. The magistrate judge credited the testimony of both expert witnesses that A.H. would \u201csuffer significant emotional harm if she were removed from the care of C.L.O.\u201d The judge also noted that \u201cthe social workers and the child\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem\u201d </em>supported the adoption.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Indeed, the guardian <em>ad litem </em>stated during closing argument with respect to this first factor that \u201c[fit\u2019s unfortunate how the events transpired, but the child already has a family, and I don\u2019t see any reason for that family relationship to be disrupted at this point.\u201d The record supports the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusions of law that A.H. has a \u201csecure and loving\u201d relationship with C.L.O.; that C.L.O. has demonstrated her ability to provide stability and permanence; that E.P. has not demonstrated this same ability; and that removing A.H. from her pre-adoptive, foster home would cause her to \u201csuffer substantial harm.\u201d Accordingly, the trial judge did not err in finding by clear and convincing evidence that this factor should be weighed in favor of adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">\n<em>(2) The physical, mental and emotional health of all individuals involved to the degree that such affects the welfare of the child, the decisive consideration being the physical, mental and emotional needs of the child.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">In applying this factor, a trial judge may consider whether breaking a child\u2019s secure attachment to the pre-adoptive foster parent would have a negative impact on the child\u2019s physical and mental health.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The judge may also consider a parent\u2019s emotional maturity, parenting skills, and ability to meet the emotional needs of the child.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">The magistrate judge found that, overall, both E.P. and C.L.O. were in good physical health. He credited the testimony of both expert witnesses that A.H. would suffer emotionally if her attachment to C.L.O. and C.L.O.\u2019s family were broken. He found that A.H. \u201cwould not suffer nearly the same emotional trauma if she has decreased contact with her father in the coming months and years, given the limited nature of their relationship.\u201d He cred<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>ited C.L.O.\u2019s testimony that she would allow some ongoing contact between A.H. and E.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The magistrate judge also made a number of findings regarding the parenting skills of the two parties. He found that E.P. had fathered seven children, two of whom died following involvement in criminal activity and most of whom had not finished high school. He further found that E.P. had provided child support for only one of his seven children. He found that E.P. had been convicted of attempted carnal knowledge and simple assault on separate occasions and that E.P.\u2019s \u201cinvolvement in criminal activity demonstrates significant problems with his judgment.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The magistrate judge then found, based on the evidence and the demeanor of the parties, that \u201cC.L.O. will be a much more reliable, dependable, and responsible care provider for [A.H.] than [E.P.].\u201d These findings of fact are supported by the record and, taken together, support a finding by clear and convincing evidence that A.H.\u2019s mental and emotional needs would be better served by remaining in C.L.O.\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\n<em>(3) The quality of the interaction and interrelationship of the child with his or her parents, siblings, relatives, and/or caretakers, including the foster parent.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The magistrate judge entered three findings relevant to this third factor: A.H. had lived with C.L.O. since January 25, 2009; E.P. first visited A.H. on March 17, 2010 and participated in regular weekly visits thereafter; and A.H. has a \u201cwarm, loving relationship\u201d with C.L.O.\u2019s biological daughter and her daughter\u2019s father [L.A.L.] and has been accepted as a member of that family. The judge discussed \u201cthe substantial testimony about the secure and loving emotional connection between [A.H.] and C.L.O., whom [A.H.] refers to as \u2018Mommy.\u2019 \u201d In addition, he credited the testimony of Dr. Missar that A.H. \u201cwould suffer far more serious emotional harm if she were separated from C.L.O. than if she were separated from [E.P.],\u201d as well as \u201chis testimony that the attachment between [A.H.] and C.L.O. is far more significant to [A.H.] than [her] relationship with [E.P.]\u201d The magistrate judge summarized: \u201cIt is quite clear that the child\u2019s relationship to C.L.O. is far more developed than her relationship with her father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">E.P. argues that the magistrate judge should have credited not Dr. Missar\u2019s testimony but that of Dr. Thuet, who testified that the harm to A.H. would be as great from leaving E.P. as from terminating her relationship with C.L.O. However, \u201c \u2018as a general proposition, when faced with conflicting expert testimony, the trial court may credit one expert over the other, or disregard both in rendering its judgment.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The magistrate judge\u2019s finding that favors Dr. Missar\u2019s testimony over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>that of Dr. Thuet is supported by the record.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Assessment of the demeanor and persuasiveness of competing expert witnesses is a primary role of the trial judge, and this court will not \u201credetermine the credibility of witnesses\u201d when the trial judge has had an \u201copportunity to observe their demeanor and form a conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">At the time of the hearing, C.L.O. had provided for A.H.\u2019s every daily need for almost two years, while E.P. had diligently attended every scheduled visit with his daughter. But E.P.\u2019s visits consisted of no more than weekly structured visits of an hour and a half at the offices of the social workers for a period of eight months. Based on the length and quality of these interactions, the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in finding by clear and convincing evidence that \u201cthe quality of the interaction and interrelationship\u201d of A.H. with C.L.O. and her family was substantially greater than the quality provided by E.P. and thus weighed in favor of A.H.\u2019s adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The trial judge upheld the magistrate judge\u2019s order after a careful review, ruling that his findings were supported by the record. Furthermore, based on the assumption that E.P. had grasped his constitutional opportunity interest, the trial judge ruled that clear and convincing evidence required waiver of E.P.\u2019s consent and supported adoption by C.L.O. in the best interest of A.H. In reviewing both judges\u2019 decisions, we have \u201c \u2018evaluate[d] whether [the] decision is supported by substantial reasoning drawn from a firm factual foundation in the record.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that E.P. withheld his consent to the adoption of A.H. contrary to the child\u2019s best interest, and thus in entering a final decree granting the adoption of A.H. by the petitioner-appellee, C.L.O.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-10\">.

It is unnecessary to decide either question because we uphold the trial court\u2019s determination by clear and convincing evidence that E.P. withheld his consent to the adoption contrary to the best interest of A.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-17\">As a legal matter, whether E.P. grasped his opportunity interest is relevant to whether he was entitled to due process and a legal presumption in favor of placing A.H. with him because he is her biological parent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But in this case we are not presented with any issue of due process \u2014 E.P. undeniably received all the due process to which he could have been entitled, including the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For that same reason, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>E.P. received the full benefit of the presumption in favor of a fit biological parent. When that presumption applies in an adoption proceeding, all it means is that waiver of the biological parent\u2019s consent requires proof of the child\u2019s best interest by clear and convincing evidence rather than a mere preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">To be sure, a father\u2019s efforts (or lack thereof) to establish and maintain a parental relationship with his child are <em>factually </em>relevant to whether clear and convincing evidence establishes that he is withholding his consent to adoption contrary to the child\u2019s best interest. But there is no question that the trial court properly considered E.P.\u2019s efforts as part of the totality of relevant facts in this case. Because the court assumed that E.P. was entitled to a parental preference and properly applied the clear and convincing evidence standard in light of the relevant TPR factors and our ease law, it makes no difference that the court made no formal legal determination as to whether E.P. grasped his opportunity interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">As to the second question we do not decide, the parties to this appeal did not even brief whether our statutory scheme (as distinct from due process) requires a trial court to apply the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof in deciding whether to waive the biological father\u2019s consent to adoption if he did not grasp his opportunity interest. This court\u2019s previous cases have not decided that precise question \u2014 though waiver of consent usually is bound up with a concurrent termination of parental rights, and the statute governing termination of parental rights of neglected children appears to require clear and convincing evidence that <em>termination </em>is in the child\u2019s best interest whether or not the father grasped his opportunity interest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Assuming, as Judge Ferren argues, that our statutory scheme also requires a waiver of parental consent to adoption to be supported by clear and convincing evidence in every case, I perceive no need for the trial court in adoption proceedings ever to make a separate finding as to whether the unwed, noncustodial father grasped his opportunity interest. As I see it, that determination has no legal significance under our statutory scheme if the same standard of proof is required either way it turns out.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-18\">. <em>See Lehr v.

The consequences are many, affecting the parent, the child, often the other parent and relatives, the District of Columbia and its courts as <em>parens patriae, </em>and in some cases, like this one, a pre-adoptive family. Thus, the question whether an unwed, noncustodial father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>has \u2014 or has not \u2014 grasped his constitutional opportunity interest in assuming custody of his child can be of extraordinary significance in determining whether the child ultimately will remain with the father. If the father, otherwise fit, has grasped that interest, the law gives him a preference \u2014 a presumptive right to custody. If he fails to grasp it, however, he loses that presumption, a loss that, as time passes, significantly diminishes his chance to gain custody, especially if the child, as in this case, is living in foster care with a pre-adoptive parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Therefore, when a father is confronted with a termination proceeding \u2014 including a proceeding for adoption when the court has to decide whether to waive, against his will, the father\u2019s statutory right to consent \u2014 it is of unquestionable importance that the trial court pay very careful attention to this \u201copportunity interest\u201d issue, making careful findings that justify the decision. The ruling on the preference, \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d coupled with a lucid explanation, is crucial, I believe, for fairness to the father. And, of significance as well, the elaborated ruling is necessary to serve the appearance of justice overall.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Given the gravity of the court\u2019s decision, I am not satisfied with an approach that simply assumes the opportunity interest is intact and then proceeds to weigh the competing claims to custody. In the first place, an assumed opportunity interest can be used only when the court is going to find clear and convincing evidence that the father should <em>not </em>keep his child. Paradoxically, therefore, this device creates the appearance of a judicial failure to pay adequate attention to this potentially determinative issue. Because terminations of the parental rights of unwed, noncustodial fathers are not uncommon, the mere assumption that the opportunity interest remains intact in lieu of detailed findings to that effect is likely to appear to be a shortcut to the inevitable termination of rights \u2014 indeed, a shortcut perceived cynically as an insincere makeweight toward termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">This may be particularly true where allegations of state action or interference by the mother or other family members, despite assertive, continuing efforts by the father to develop a relationship with his child, should alert the court to the possibility that the noncustodial father has grasped his opportunity interest. Such a scenario may well suggest that the father should acquire custody, despite the child\u2019s bonding with a pre-adoptive family \u2014 a result that could too easily remain unexplored in a court\u2019s ruling to the contrary after merely assuming the father\u2019s custodial preference.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Obviously detailed findings may lead, perhaps more often than not, to a ruling that the father has failed to grasp his opportunity interest, a message at odds with the ostensibly better news that an assumed opportunity interest conveys. But, as I see it, that assumed custodial preference offers the father little, if any, good news when he learns that his rights are to be terminated nonetheless. Better to spell out the truth in every case than create false impressions on the way to disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">This is not to say that judges who employ an assumed preference for the father actually fail to give the question careful attention; to the contrary, I have every confidence that they do. But a procedure that commonly embraces the \u201cassumption\u201d approach does not invite the kind of confidence in the result that detailed findings will bring, whether for or against the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">The foregoing analysis, calling for a merits ruling with findings on a father\u2019s opportunity interest, addresses essentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>an appearance problem that an objective, outside observer would likely identify. But there is also a compelling subjective reason for treating the opportunity interest with care: the perception of the father himself. When the trial court assumes a custodial preference for the father, and then finds clear and convincing evidence sufficient to terminate his parental rights in favor of an adoptive family, the father may understand that he has been given the benefit of a constitutional right \u2014 and yet lost. But he may be more likely to understand, if not accept, the ultimate result if the trial court comes to grips with his opportunity interest by spelling out whatever positives there may have been that cut in favor of the preference \u2014 even though in the end he does not prevail on the claimed preference and, for that and other reasons, he is unable to acquire custody of his child. He will at least have been assured, more completely than a mere assumption would warrant, that the court has taken his case into account in full, without any shortcut that might have ignored important evidence. Given the significance of cutting off a natural parent\u2019s right to custody, I believe that a father\u2019s enhanced understanding of the result, beginning with detailed examination of his opportunity interest, may help with his acceptance of an adverse ruling, even though the trial judge would have been correct, given the record, in granting an adoption on the mere assumption that the father\u2019s opportunity interest had remained intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\">Finally, time \u2014 meaning delay \u2014 is often at the heart of child custody decisions as bonding begins to occur between a child in foster care and the pre-adoptive family. There may be cases in which the trial court, either by failing to address the opportunity interest or by merely assuming the father has grasped it, risks reversal because this court cannot conclude that clear and convincing evidence supported the adoption if the father\u2019s custodial preference remains in place.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In either situation \u2014 omission or assumption \u2014 this court will not be able to rule on the adoption absent definitive resolution of the father\u2019s claimed opportunity interest. A magistrate judge, therefore, should not chance a time-wasting remand for consideration of an opportunity interest that could have been resolved in the initial proceeding. (There may be still other cases in which the trial court does rule on the opportunity interest, concluding that its resolution is, or is not, outcome-determinative, and this court disagrees. But that possibility does not negate the necessity for initial fact-finding.)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">I am under no illusion that every father will find solace in the kind of trial court attention to his opportunity interest that I am recommending here. I am not even sanguine about how many fathers, for whom terminations of parental rights are sought, are invested in taking responsibility for their children. My point, therefore, is simply this: there are noncustodial fathers who do care \u2014 who care deeply \u2014 and I believe that our justice system, not knowing in advance who they are, should operate in every case as though one\u2019s fatherhood matters to him, both for the sakes of all the individuals involved and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>the public\u2019s confidence that justice is being accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">I turn, now, to this case. Throughout the show cause hearing, counsel for the parties discussed E.P.\u2019s opportunity interest, the related presumption in favor of a birth parent, and the evidence with respect to that presumption. In his final order, however, the magistrate judge did not mention E.P.\u2019s opportunity interest in concluding that \u201cthere is clear and convincing evidence that [E.P.] is withholding his consent to the petition for adoption contrary to the best interest of the child.\u201d Later, the trial judge, in her review, noted that the magistrate judge \u201cdid not state that the father [had] failed to exercise his opportunity interest,\u201d but the trial judge added that the magistrate judge had \u201canalyzed many facts toward that end.\u201d Then, after reviewing these facts, the trial judge concluded that \u201c[cjlearly these facts were sufficient for the [magistrate] judge to find that the father ... failed to grasp his opportunity interest.\u201d The trial judge concluded, having assumed that the magistrate judge \u201cdid not deal with the father\u2019s opportunity interest,\u201d that \u201cthe evidence and findings clearly support the waiver of consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">In reviewing the trial judge\u2019s opinion, all members of this division agree that the judge \u201creached conclusions in the alternative: that (1) based on subsidiary facts found by the magistrate judge, E.P. had surrendered his opportunity interest, but that (2) even though the magistrate judge did not mention E.P.\u2019s opportunity interest in the written findings of fact and conclusions of law, the record supplied clear and convincing evidence supporting the waiver.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As explained in the court\u2019s opinion, the division majority relied on the trial judge\u2019s second alternative, assuming that E.P.\u2019s opportunity interest was intact, and then sustained the judge\u2019s ruling that, nonetheless, clear and convincing evidence supported the court\u2019s waiver of E.P.\u2019s right to consent to the adoption followed by its order granting C.L.O.\u2019s petition to adopt A.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">Unwilling to proceed from the trial judge\u2019s second alternative, I turn to the opportunity interest on the merits. After reviewing the record, I am satisfied that the trial judge\u2019s first alternative is supported by the magistrate judge\u2019s findings. That is to say, the subsidiary facts found by the magistrate judge support an ultimate finding \u2014 a conclusion of law<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 that E.P. failed to grasp his opportunity interest. Although the magistrate judge \u2014 the fact-finder \u2014 did not rule on E.P.\u2019s opportunity interest, our standard of review, as indicated in the court\u2019s opinion, allows us, like the trial judge, to rule <em>de novo </em>on questions of law. And because the question of whether E.P. grasped his opportunity interest is a question of ultimate fact, meaning a question of law, we are empowered to answer that question by marshaling subsidiary facts found by the magistrate judge (to which we defer in the absence of clear error).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>To date this court has announced five, non-exhaustive factors relevant to determining whether a noncustodial father has grasped his opportunity interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">(1) the presence or absence of an established relationship between the child and an existing family; (2) whether the father has established a custodial, personal, or financial relationship with his child, or assumed responsibilities during the mother\u2019s pregnancy; (3) the impact, if any, of state action on the father\u2019s opportunity to establish a relationship with his child; (4) the age of the child when the action to terminate parental rights is initiated; and (5) the natural father\u2019s invocation or disregard of statutory safeguards designed to protect his opportunity interest.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">As to the first, fourth, and fifth factors, no one contests that A.H. has an \u201cestablished relationship\u201d with C.L.O. and her family or that A.H. was one year and three months old at the time the petition to terminate parental rights (TPR) was filed. Nor does the District of Columbia provide a statutory safeguard, such as a \u201cputative father registry\u201d that would permit a man anticipating fatherhood to register his interest in \u201cassuming a responsible role in the future of his child\u201d (thus ensuring that he receives prompt \u201cnotice of any action to terminate his parental rights\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">As indicated in the court\u2019s opinion,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> E.P. cites the third factor \u2014 determinative on a different set of facts<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 claiming that government action (including inaction) interfered with his pursuit of his opportunity interest in developing a relationship with his daughter. He maintains, first, that the District of Columbia failed to act on the information available to find him after A.H. was born. He is wrong. The record reflects that the District made great effort, based on very little available information and with little cooperation from the natural mother, to locate the unknown father of A.H. And there can be no doubt that the District immediately notified E.P. of his right to participate in the pending judicial proceedings as soon as E.P. had been identified as a potential father.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">E.P. then argues that the court\u2019s denial of his requests for unsupervised visits with his daughter and the court\u2019s denial of his request for an independent social worker impeded his ability to assert his custodial rights. These contentions, as applied to his claimed custodial preference, are unavailing for three reasons. First, on January 28, 2010, a CFSA investigator served E.P. with notice of the TPR proceeding, but it was not until several weeks later, in March, after learning of the DNA test results, that E.P. contacted CFSA and requested visits with A.H. By the time E.P. showed any interest in arranging visits with A.H., therefore, his opportunity interest \u2014 largely neglected over the seven-month period from August 2009 to March 2010 \u2014 had expired (as I shall explain in the paragraphs that follow). Second, CFSA social workers, sustained by the court, refused unsupervised visits because of E.P.\u2019s conviction for attempted carnal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>knowledge and, even more importantly, his failure to disclose it when asked about prior convictions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Finally, the trial court is tasked with focusing on the best interest of the child, not on the parent\u2019s rights,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the court concluded that there was no basis for finding that the CFSA social workers were inappropriately biased. There was, accordingly, no abuse of discretion by CFSA or the magistrate judge in declining E.P.\u2019s requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The only open question, therefore, concerns the second factor: absent a custodial relationship (an uncontested finding), did E.P. grasp his opportunity interest \u201cearly on\u201d by assuming responsibilities during KH.\u2019s pregnancy or, after the child\u2019s birth, by \u201ccontinually [doing] all that he could reasonably have been expected to do under the circumstances to pursue that interest\u201d by establishing a personal or financial relationship with A.H.?<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The magistrate judge found from E.P.\u2019s testimony that he had had a \u201ccasual relationship\u201d with K.H., including unprotected sex, \u201cfor a period of a few months\u201d beginning in the winter of 2006-2007. A.H. was born on October 6 of 2007. E.P. testified that he was not aware that K.H. was pregnant while he was with her, and the magistrate judge did not find that he was aware. Rather, the magistrate judge found that E.P. had become aware of his likely fatherhood \u201csometime in the summer of 2009,\u201d when his cousin told him that K.H. had \u201chad a child,\u201d that he \u201cwas the father,\u201d and that K.H. wanted E.P. \u201cto take care of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">The magistrate judge made several findings relevant to E.P.\u2019s pursuit of his opportunity interest from the time in 2009 that his cousin first told him about a child, namely: that (1) E.P. had \u201cattempted on more than one occasion to find [K.H.] by going to the home of her family members and leaving messages\u201d and had been \u201cunsuccessful in finding her\u201d;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that (2) he \u201cdidn\u2019t see [K.H.] until she showed up at his home with a process server in January of 2010\u201d; that (3) E.P. had \u201conly provided financial support to one of his seven children\u201d \u2014 not A.H.; and that (4) after service of \u201cnotice of these proceedings in early 2010, and confirming paternity through DNA testing, Mr. [P.] arranged to begin visiting [A.H.] through the social workers of the Board of Child Care,\u201d beginning March 17, 2010, and \u201che has participated in regular weekly visits (which generally last one and one-half hours)\u201d ever since. In this connection, the magistrate judge credited the social workers\u2019 testimony that E.P. had \u201cinteracted appropriately with [A.H.] during these visits.\u201d All of the magistrate judge\u2019s findings are supported by the record and in several instances are derived, without doubt, from uncontested testimony more specific than the finding itself.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>I conclude that, as a matter of law, E.P. gave up his opportunity interest in obtaining permanent custody of A.H. because of his insufficient effort to find K.H. and \u201ctake care of the child\u201d (as K.H. had requested through E.P.\u2019s cousin) during the seven-month period between the time he learned that A.H. might be his child (August 2009) and his first contact with CFSA (March 2010) upon learning that DNA tests had proved that she was his child. Given this seven-month delay, I am satisfied that, from E.P.\u2019s first awareness of likely fatherhood, he did not \u2014 as this court has stressed a noncustodial father must\u2014 \u201ccontinually do all that he could reasonably have been expected to do under the circumstances\u201d to pursue his opportunity interest by seeking \u201ca custodial, personal, or financial relationship\u201d with the child.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">More specifically, rather than instigate an energetic search and join his cousin in looking for K.H., after knowing there \u201cmight have been a possibility\u201d that A.H. was his child, E.P. relied solely on his cousin and waited two weeks for her to report back. E.P. then made only three or four attempts over \u201ca month or less\u201d to find K.H. at her grandmother\u2019s house (which he acknowledged was only a five-minute drive from his home), apparently giving up easily on KH.\u2019s relatives. Nor did he seek out other alternatives. He did not contact CFSA, the agency most likely to be informed about a wandering, perhaps neglectful mother with a child \u2014 reportedly his \u2014 that, according to his cousin, the mother wanted him \u201cto take care of.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Nor, in case he was unaware of CFSA by name, did he go to the police for help in finding the government agency most likely to be aware of a neglected child. Finally, even after K.H. and the CFSA investigator confronted E.P. at his home on January 28, 2010, with service of formal notice of the TPR proceeding, E.P. did nothing to assert an interest in custody until he learned weeks later, in March, that he assuredly was A.H.\u2019s father.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Especially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>in the context of the strong public policy to achieve expeditious permanent custody once a child has entered foster care,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> a noncustodial father will lose his opportunity interest \u2014 there will be no legitimate excuse \u2014 if his effort to pursue his child is dilatory, as E.P.\u2019s was.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">In sum, on this record, E.P.\u2019s opportunity interest was forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Because E.P. has failed to grasp his opportunity interest and lost his presumptive right to custody as a result, there remains the question whether the trial</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">birth as early as August 2009, and I have explained how he should have begun to assert his custodial rights at that time. court, in deciding whether to waive E.P.\u2019s required consent to the adoption of A.H., must find clear and convincing evidence that E.P.\u2019s consent is \u201cwithheld contrary to the best interest of the child,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> as in the case of a fit, unwed, noncustodial father whose opportunity interest is assumed or grasped.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Or, given the fact that E.P. has forfeited the parental preference that accompanies that interest, does he revert to the status of a non-parent and thus open himself to a decision based on a mere preponderance of the evidence?<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-14\">As noted in the opinion for the court, we have never addressed this question.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Nonetheless, we have noted that the law provides two methods for terminating parental rights: \u201ca termination proceeding brought by the District or the child\u2019s legal representative under D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2353 (2001),\u201d and \u201can adoption proceeding commenced by a private party, as a part of which a court may grant the adoption over the objection of a natural parent \u201cwhen the court finds, after a hearing, that the consent or consents are withheld contrary to the best interests of the child\u2019 under D.C.Code \u00a7 16-304(e) (2001).\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We added, moreover, that \u201cthe second method is the functional equivalent of the first,\u201d and that whether parental rights are relinquished in a termination or an adoption proceeding, \u201cthe court making the decision on what is in the child\u2019s best interest must be guided by the factors set forth in \u00a7 16-2353(b)\u201d of the termination statute.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The termination statute provides that this determination must be made by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Unlike the termination statute, however, the adoption statute does not contain an express burden of proof for imposing a court-ordered waiver of the parent\u2019s right to consent. I am satisfied, however, that just as the termination statute requires clear and convincing evidence to justify a termination of parental rights, a court-imposed waiver of a parent\u2019s consent to adoption \u2014 inherently terminating parental rights \u2014 must satisfy that same burden of proof, without regard to whether the father\u2019s opportunity interest has remained intact while pursuing custody against the claim of a pre-adoptive foster parent. I see no reason why the fact that the termination issue arises in a contest between two individuals (father and pre-adoptive foster parent), rather than in a proceeding brought against the father alone by the District or the child\u2019s legal representative, should create any lesser burden on the pre-adoptive foster parent to justify taking the child from the natural father. If the situation generated two sequential proceedings, termination then adoption, the father\u2019s loss of his child could be justified only by clear and convincing evidence, followed by separate consideration of the adoption. The fact that the same ends are sought in one proceeding should not make any difference in the standard applicable to termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">This conclusion flows from another perspective as well. In an adoption proceeding, the question whether the court should waive the father\u2019s required consent and grant the adoption is not merely a matter of comparing the father with the pre-adoptive foster parent; the court also has to make an independent judgment about that pre-adoptive parent under stringent statutory requirements focused on \u201cthe best interests of the prospective adop-tee.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Thus, even if a court would find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>the father a less reliable permanent custodian than a stranger (a preponderance determination, 51 percent to 49 percent) \u2014 in part because the father had lost his opportunity interest \u2014 that finding <em>in itself </em>would not necessarily be saying that the child\u2019s best interest will be served by the proposed adoption. Although the adoption statute, unlike the termination statute, does not prescribe the quality of evidence necessary to justify an adoption, that statute nonetheless prescribes stringent criteria that must be satisfied before a favorable decree is entered, whether a natural parent is in the picture or not. It seems to me, therefore, that, especially when those criteria are added to the requirements of the termination statute, clear and convincing evidence is required to support the termination/adoption decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Finally, there is a constitutional underpinning to this discussion. In <em>Santosky v. Kramer,</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court opined that because natural parents have a \u201cfundamental liberty interest ... in the care, custody, and management of their child,\u201d their parental rights may be terminated only by clear and convincing evidence, not merely by a fair preponderance of the evidence. A year after <em>Santosky, </em>however, in <em>Lehr v. Robertson,</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court intimated that a father who fails to grasp his opportunity interest may lose constitutionally mandated protections in an adoption proceeding. Nonetheless, even if <em>Lehr </em>casts doubt on whether the Constitution imposes <em>Santosky\u2019s </em>clear and convincing evidence standard in the adoption context when a father has failed to grasp his opportunity interest, our statutory law in the District of Columbia would not be affected. The District\u2019s adoption statute recognizes a residual liberty interest in a natural parent, including an unwed, noncustodial father without regard to his opportunity interest, by guaranteeing notice and a hearing when waiver of consent to adoption is at issue.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> And nothing in <em>Lehr </em>undermines the statutory standard, as this court interprets it, for termination of a natural father\u2019s parental rights by court-ordered waiver of his consent in an adoption proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">For all the foregoing reasons, therefore, I conclude that E.P. did not grasp his opportunity interest, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that clear and convincing evidence supported the court-ordered waiver of his consent to the adoption of his daughter, A.H., by the petitioner, C.L.O.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-13\">. <em>See ante </em>at 511-12 notes 28 &amp; 29 and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-4\">. <em>See In re S.M., </em>985 A.2d 413, 417 (D.C.2009) (holding remand required to allow trial court to apply best interests balancing test while honoring preference for fit parent where District of Columbia conceded trial court had clearly failed to consider whether presumptive parental preference applied): <em>Appeal of H.R., </em>581 A.2d 1141, 1180-81 (D.C.1990) (holding remand necessary because trial court applied best interest standard without incorporating parental preference).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\">. <em>Ante at 512.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b553-9\">. <em>See Washington Chapter of Am.

E.P. testified that he was not aware that A.H. was in foster care until he received notice from the process server in January 2010. However, as noted in this court's opinion, <em>ante </em>at 514 n. 37, the magistrate judge made findings with regard to E.P.\u2019s judgment, which suggested that E.P. was, or should have been, aware that his child might be neglected. The magistrate judge found: Mr. [P.\u2019s] relationship with [A.H.\u2019s] mother reflects poor judgment. Mr. [P.] chose to engage in unprotected sexual relations on more than one occasion with someone who[] he believed had a drinking problem, and who[] social workers concluded had mental health problems and was not even able to provide adequately for her own hygiene or that of her child. Furthermore, ... Mr. [P.] ... chose to engage in relations which obviously could have resulted, and in fact did result, in the unplanned pregnancy of a woman who was apparently poorly equipped to raise a child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b556-11\">.E.P. argues, contrary to the law governing opportunity interest, that his \"first opportunity to assert his rights with respect to his daughter was the March 25 [2010] status hearing.\u201d He is incorrect. \"[A] court evaluating a father\u2019s assertion of his opportunity interest is entitled to focus on the extent of the father\u2019s involvement <em>as soon as he learns of the pregnancy.\" Appeal of H.R., </em>581 A.2d at 1162 (emphasis added).

There may be avenues for pursuing an opportunity interest, such as the police or other government agency, that some fathers may be reluctant to try. I do not address whether such reluctance could ever be justified, for E.P. has not asked us to do so. But, if there could be a legitimate reason for ignoring a potential avenue for exploration, that would make all the more important the unrelenting pursuit of other avenues. On the facts here, it is clear that E.P. did not even come close to pressing K.H.'s family to find her and the child. Merely four visits over a \u201cmonth or less\u201d to the grandmother's house, where an uncle and aunt also resided or at least frequented, did not satisfy the requirement that he must have \"early on, and continually, done all that he could reasonably have been expected to do under the circumstances to pursue [his opportunity] interest\u201d in developing a custodial relationship with his child. <em>Appeal of H.R., </em>581 A.2d at 1162-63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b557-10\">.

I understand Judge Glickman to say that, because the trial court found clear and convincing evidence to support its waiver of E.P.\u2019s consent to adoption, that ruling not only accorded E.P. the constitutional protection required for termination of his parental rights, but also implicitly recognized E.P.\u2019s presumptive right to custody of A.H. Respectfully, I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"AGq\">A termination of the father\u2019s parental rights by clear and convincing evidence may satisfy the Constitution, but that does not resolve whether the father had grasped his opportunity interest, and thus obtained a custodial preference, before the court ruled. A father\u2019s presumptive right to custody \u2014 a custodial preference \u2014 is not necessarily inherent in, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>established by, the \"clear and convincing\u201d standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar_\">As Judge Glickman acknowledges in his concurring opinion, a determination as to whether a father has grasped or lost his opportunity interest is \"factually relevant\u201d to whether the court finds clear and convincing evidence to justify termination of his parental rights by waiving the father\u2019s consent to adoption. But a ruling that terminates parental rights after applying that standard of proof does not \u2014 without express reference to the opportunity interest \u2014 indicate whether the court has, or has not, premised its ruling on a custodial preference favoring the father.</p>\n<p id=\"A3M\">I cannot quarrel with the legality of a trial court's <em>expressly </em>assuming a custodial preference for the father but concluding that clear and convincing evidence justifies a court-ordered waiver of the father's consent to adoption, in the child's best interest. For the reasons expressed in the foregoing opinion, however, I believe that such a course, in lieu of a considered ruling on the opportunity interest, is ill advised.</p>\n<p id=\"AUQN\">Indeed, under Judge Glickman\u2019s analysis as I understand it, the trial court can waive a father's consent to adoption by finding clear and convincing evidence that termination of his parental rights will be in the child\u2019s best interest, without even mentioning the father's opportunity interest. And that will be true whether the case concerns facts, such as heroic efforts by the father or culpable state action, that keep the opportunity interest alive, or facts reflecting dilatory efforts by the father that effectively surrender that interest. If the facts present a close case, perhaps trial judges will discuss as they should \u2014 not merely assume \u2014 a father\u2019s custodial preference when terminating his parental rights. Even so, I do not find it appropriate to announce a rule that would permit the \"assumption\u201d shortcut in all cases when a father\u2019s parental rights are terminated, and especially not in the close cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
