On September 19, 1952 the grand jury presented against James Christy, George Eabatin, Julius Litus and Frank Hegyi an indictment composed of two counts in the first of which it charged the defendants therein named with the perpetration jointly on July 1, 1952 of an atrocious assault and battery upon one Carl Eevy. The second count accused them of the corarais<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>sion jointly on the same occasion and upon the same person of a simple assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The defendants were tried, and the petit jury returned the verdict: \u201cGuilty against all four defendants on all counts.\u201d The defendants Christy and Rabatin were each sentenced to imprisonment in the New Jersey State Prison and they prosecute the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Counsel for these appellants contends that the judge committed 11 errors in the conduct of the trial, many, if not all, of which necessitate the reversal of the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">It is observed that substantially all of them pertain to the court\u2019s charge to the jury. It accordingly will be illustrative and expedient to reproduce <em>verbatim et literatim </em>those passages of the charge which have primarily attracted our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Particularly noticeable is the court\u2019s characterization of the presumption of innocence. We quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">\u201cThe Court has already told you that the State must prove its case and must prove it to you beyond a reasonable doubt. Now, what do we mean by that? As introductory to that, the Court will reiterate the criminal law has extended its charity to the accused by accrediting to him the legal presumption of his innocence until the contrary is shown, and shown beyond a reasonable doubt. He is always entitled to such a charge unless there has been a substantial admission on his part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Thus the jurors heard the court explain that the law confers upon a defendant accused of crime the presumption of innocence as a charity to be accredited to him \u201cunless there has been a substantial admission on his part.\u201d We have supposed the presumption of innocence to be an elementary, axiomatic, almost sacrosanct principle which for centuries-has been embedded in the very foundation of the administration of our criminal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">Greenleaf traces the origin of this principle to <em>Deuteronomy </em>and quotes <em>Mascardus de Probaiionibus </em>to disclose that the principle was in substance embodied in the laws of Sparta and Athens. True, the author of an article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>in the <em>North American Review, </em>January 1851, stated that no express mention of the presumption of innocence as a legal principle is discoverable in the books of the common law earlier than 1802. Whether the assertions of those explorers of the law are true or mistaken, we shall not take the time to inquire. We do not, however, hesitate to express the conviction that in the law the presumption of innocence of one criminally accused is a principle to the benefit of which the accused is lawfully entitled rather than merely a charitable gratuitous bestowal.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Moreover the trial judge superimposed a vague qualification upon the right of the defendants to have the jury informed of the presumption. He stated that a defendant was \u201centitled to such a charge unless there has been a substantial admission on his part.\u201d There is in the criminal law and procedure an egregious distinction between an admission which may be of fact and a confession of guilt. To illustrate, an \u201cadmission\u201d by a defendant that he was at the scene of the crime might be classified as a \u201csubstantial\u201d one, yet it does not deprive the defendant of the presumption of innocence. However, the court did not impart to the jury any elucidative explanation of the type or quality of an admission which would have the substantiality to render a defendant undeserving of the so-called benevolent presumption of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Indeed, the court said nothing more in his charge on the subject of the presumption of innocence although counsel for the defendants had placed before him the following pertinent requests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">\u201c1. The defendants are presumed to be innocent and unless the crime charged, in each of its elements, is proved against them beyond a reasonable doubt, they are entitled to an acquittal. The burden of proving the defendants guilty rests upon the prosecution and never shifts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">2. The defendants are entitled to the presumption of innocence unless and until the jury agree upon a verdict of guilty upon consideration of all the evidence, and this beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">3. A person charged with crime is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. This presumption abides with him through the trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Therefore, when the jury go from the bar of the court to their room to deliberate, they enter the jury room with the presumption of innocence still protecting the defendants. In the various mental conditions, ranging from that in which the jury think the defendants innocent to that in which they are convinced beyond, a reasonable doubt of their guilt, they are entitled to the benefit of their uncertainty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">4. The presumption of defendants\u2019 innocence continues until overcome by proof establishing their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The authoritative sources of those requests are the decisions in <em>State v. Raymond, </em>53 <em>N. J. L. </em>260, 267 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1891); <em>State v. Burke, </em>81 <em>N. J. L. </em>93 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1911); <em>State v. Linker, </em>94 <em>N. J. L. </em>411 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1920); <em>State v. Kisik, </em>99 <em>N. J. L. </em>385 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1924); <em>State v. D\u2019Orio, </em>136 <em>N. J. L. </em>204 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1947). The requests to charge were denied and objection thereto noted at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Before concluding the discussion of this portion of the court\u2019s charge relating to the presumption of innocence, we must divulge that we have also noticed with additional concern that counsel for the defendants asked in request No. 5 the court to instruct the jury that the \u201cFailure of the accused to testify as a witness does not destroy the presumption of innocence.\u201d The defendants-appellants had not chosen to testify. The rule of law which the court was properly importuned to express to the jury was applicable to the situation in the case. The request was denied and we discover nothing of equivalent import in the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\"> It has been emphatically stated by our appellate courts that a pronouncement of a rule or direction of law must not be so equivocally or ambiguously expressed by the court to invite its likely misinterpretation by the jury. We find, for example, the following instruction by the court in the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">\u201c* * * You, in evaluating the testimony of the witnesses, <em>will talce </em>into consideration <em>the eharaeter of the. persons involved in the incident, </em>whether they were normally functioning or abnormally functioning, whether they were in such a position that they could see and know what was going on.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>It seems more than probable that the jury would regard the defendants also as \u201cpersons involved in the incident\u201d whose \u201ccharacter\u201d should be taken \u201cinto consideration\u201d in \u201cevaluating the credibility of the testimony of the witnesses.\u201d The character of these defendants had not been attacked nor were they witnesses in their own behalf. 20 <em>Am. Jur. </em>304, \u00a7 325. The jury may well have inferred from the evidence that the defendants were intoxicated and that in view of their presence in a saloon at such an unusual hour in the morning they were persons of bad character \u201cinvolved in the incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Another excerpt from the charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">\u201cWhen the State presents direct evidence of a material fact which is <em>prejudicial </em>to the defendant and which is within his personal knowledge, then his failure to deny the fact justifies an inference <em>unfavorable </em>to the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The rule which relates to the permissible presumption or inference produced by the failure of a defendant to testify on his own behalf in a criminal case has undergone judicial attention recently in <em>State v. Marinella, </em>24 <em>N. J. Super. </em>49 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952), cert. den., 11 <em>N. J. </em>612 (1953), and in <em>State v. Costa, </em>11 <em>N. J. </em>239, 253 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Manifestly the quoted instruction of the court does not conform to the rule expressed in those decisions. It is quite conceivable that a fact may be \u201cprejudicial\u201d but not inculpatory and that a multitude of inferences might be catalogued as \u201cunfavorable to the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Eequests to charge Nos. 14 and 15 read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">\u201c14. An indictment is not evidence of the facts charged therein and is not evidence of guilt. It is simply an accusation, not proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">15. The indictment is not evidence against the defendants and is not to be considered as such during the jury\u2019s deliberation upon the evidence in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">The transcript of the charge as stenographically reported and certified informs us that the court stated: \u201cBoth counsel agree, so it is hardly necessary for me to say that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>the indictment <em>is </em>evidence.\u201d (Italics ours.) <em>Cf. State v. D\u2019Orio, supra. </em>It is difficult to suppress the conjecture that the court\u2019s statement was momentarily inarticulate and is incorrectly reported. Perchance it may have been an inadvertent slip of the tongue. Pragmatically, we cannot ascribe dubious authenticity to the records transported to us on appeals with the tacit acquiescence of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The trial judge was not laconic in his representations of circumstantial evidence, yet he declined to charge defendants\u2019 request No. 11:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">\u201c11. When the ease against a defendant is made up wholly of a ehain of circumstances, and there is reasonable doubt in the minds \u25a0 of the jurors as to any fact, the existence of which is essential to establish guilt, the defendants should be acquitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-6\"><em>Vide, State v. Hauptmann, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>412, 432 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1935), <em>certiorari </em>denied 296 <em>U. S. </em>649, 56 <em>S. Ct. </em>310, 80 <em>L. Ed. </em>461 (1935). We discern no impropriety in the request or justification to have rejected it in the discussion of the probative influentiality of circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Requests to charge Nos. 8, 9, 10, and 12 expressed stable principles of law of relevance to the case and in our opinion they may have been fairly and appropriately utilized in the instructions to the jury. <em>State v. Raymond, supra; State v. Andrews, </em>77 <em>N. J. L. </em>108 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1908); <em>State v. Donohue, </em>2 <em>N. J. </em>381, 390 (1949); <em>State v. Geltzeiler, </em>101 <em>N. J. L. </em>415 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">Eor the reasons to which we have alluded we are impelled to reverse the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">Judgments reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
