TIo described the position of the ears as of the time of his arrival. Some time after the jury retired to deliberate, their foreman sent to the judge a note which contained this question : \u201cHow many feet west <em>(sic) </em>curb of Boulevard did Polk car first impact the Higgins car \u2014 according to Police Officer\u2019s festimony?\u201d On the return of the jury to the court the judge informed them that they would have to use their own recollection. The foreman then asked if the officer gave \u201cany direct evidence that would spell that out.\u201d The judge replied he did not recall any. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney asked to have the testimony of the police officer read. The court refused, saying that the jury must rely on their own recollection of the testimony. The judge also explained to the jury that when he said he did not recall the testimony, he did not mean to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>imply there was no such testimony, but that he simply meant he had no recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">In <em>State v. </em>Close, 106 <em>N. J. L. </em>321 (E. <em>&amp; A. </em>1929), a case involving first degree murder, in relation to a similar request by the jury, the court stated at <em>page </em>334:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">\u201cThe matter of reading any portion of the testimony given in a case appears to be a matter of discretion in the trial court. * * * Reading by the court to the jury of the testimony of one or more witnesses gives to that testimony of those witnesses an undue prominence over the other testiinony which is not so read * * *. The jury were certainly obliged to rely upon their best recollection as to what that testimony was, as well as to all the other testimony which was before them in the cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Compare <em>State v. </em>Sgro, 108 <em>N. J. L. </em>528 (E. <em>&amp; A. </em>1932); <em>State v. Dragone, 1 N. J. Misc. </em>84 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">In the present case we find that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to have the testimony of the police officer read to the jury after they had retired. Moreover, an examination of the record discloses there was nothing in the police officer\u2019s testimony to show at what point in the intersection the collision occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
