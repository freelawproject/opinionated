A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A30\">This appeal presents an interesting question of interpretation of the last will of Clarence Birdsall, who died in 1929. Was the equitable bequest to his daughter, Hina B. Brown, given by the Third paragraph of his will, defeated by her death in 1951 ? Or had the bequest vested in her indefeasibly ? The Division of Taxation concluded that the bequest was indefeasible and was part of Mrs. Brown\u2019s estate, and assessed against her estate a transfer inheritance tax in respect thereto. Mrs. Brown\u2019s administrator appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">The pertinent part of the Birdsall will reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-10\">\u201cThird: I leave in trust the sum of two hundred thousand (200,000.00) dollars, the interest therefrom to go to my wife, Catherine B. Birdsall, as long as she remains my Widow and this trust fund to continue in force until June 1, 1958 and then to be divided equally between my Son, John M. Birdsall and Daughter, Nina B. Brown or their legal heirs. At the death or marriage of my Widow, Catherine B. Birdsall, prior to June 1, 1958, the interest from this fund to be divided between my Son, John M. Birdsall, and my Daughter, Nina B. Brown, equally or their heirs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">Testator\u2019s widow was given the income of the fund for a term of years, that is, until June 1, 1958, subject to being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>cut down by her remarriage or death prior to that date. She survived her husband, the testator; did not remarry, and died June 23, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The principal fund on June 1, 1958 is \u201cthen to be divided equally between\u201d testator\u2019s children, John and Nina, \u201cor their legal heirs.\u201d Meanwhile, the income from the time of Mrs. Birdsall\u2019s death until June 1, 1958 is to be divided between testator\u2019s two children \u201cor their heirs.\u201d Both children survived their parents; John still lives; Mrs. Brown has passed away.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The deputy director argues first that the expressions \u201cor their legal heirs\u201d and \u201cor their heirs\u201d should not be considered words of purchase but should be regarded as words of limitation, indicating testator\u2019s intent that his children\u2019s interest is absolute, the equivalent of a fee in real estate. This would be an incongruous construction applied to the bequest of the income limited as it is to a term which will come to a close in 1958. Furthermore, such an interpretation would require reading the word \u201cor\u201d as if it were \u201cand,\u201d for the word \u201cor\u201d in the phrase \u201cor their heirs\u201d clearly implies a substitution. <em>Gittings v. McDermott, </em>2 <em>Myl. </em>&amp; <em>K. </em>69 ; 39 <em>Eng. R. </em>870 <em>(Ch. </em>1833) ; <em>Hand v. Marcy, </em>28 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>59 <em>(Ch. </em>1811). A departure from the words actually employed by a testator is not made except when necessary to give effect to what was clearly his intention. <em>Cody v. Bunn, </em>46 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>131 <em>(Ch. </em>1889).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">We have no doubt that testator intended an equal division between his son and daughter, but in the event of the death of either the share of the one dying should go to his or her \u201cheirs.\u201d On a bequest of personalty to the \u201cheirs\u201d of a person, those take who are entitled to his personal estate under the statute of distributions. <em>Hard v. Turnure, </em>39 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>121 <em>(Ch. </em>1884); <em>Hogate v. Hogate, </em>132 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>480 <em>(Ch. </em>1942). The insertion of the adjective \u201clegal,\u201d so that the term is \u201clegal heirs,\u201d does not in our opinion, denote a different testamentary intention. The distributees take in the proportions prescribed by the statute. <em>Scudder\u2019s Ex\u2019rs. v. Vanarsdale, </em>13 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>109 <em>(Ch. </em>1860); <em>Sandford v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number><em>Stagg, </em>106 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>71 <em>(Ch. </em>1930). And see <em>Page on Wills, </em>\u00a7 1065.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Did testator intend that, whether or not Mrs. Brown survived him, the persons whom he described as her heirs should take in her place if she died prior to June 1, 1958? Generally, where there is a gift to \u201cA or his heirs\u201d or to \u201cA or his issue\u201d or the like, or where there is a gift to \u201cA, but in the event of his death, then to his heirs\u201d or words to that effect, if A does not survive to the period of distribution, then his heirs, or other similar class, are substituted as legatees in A\u2019s place. <em>Restatement Property, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 252, 253. <em>Boggs v. Boggs, </em>69 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>497 <em>(Ch. </em>1905); <em>Security Trust Co. v. Lovett, </em>78 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>445 <em>(Ch. </em>1911); <em>Schmieder v. Meyer, </em>97 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>335 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1925). We find no sufficient reason for believing that Mr. Birdsall intended that there should be no substitution of beneficiaries unless Mrs. Brown predeceased him, or predeceased her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">A few words relative to the income. Since Mrs. Brown survived her mother, the gift of income to her became effective in enjoyment, and it may well be argued that she or her administrator thereupon became entitled to the income to June 1, 1958, despite her death in 1951 and regardless of any disposition of the trust <em>corpus. </em>But we <em>are </em>satisfied that this was not the intention of testator. Mrs. Brown\u2019s death cut short her right to the income and transferred the right to her \u201cheirs.\u201d <em>In re Smisson, </em>79 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>233, 240 <em>(Ch. </em>1912).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">No interest in the fund, income or <em>corpus, </em>was transferred as a part of Mrs. Brown\u2019s estate. The determination of the Division of Taxation is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
