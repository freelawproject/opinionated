This is an appeal by three remaindermen from a judgment of the Superior Court, Chancery Division, authorizing the invasion of the <em>corpus </em>of a trust fund for the benefit of the life tenant and requiring in addition the payment of $3,000 out of <em>corpus </em>with interest, which sum was borrowed by the wife of the life tenant from her sister-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The Attorney-General of the United States, as successor to the Alien Property Custodian, joins in the appeal on behalf of the United States of America, claiming that the interest of Erina Buss Wilcke, a remainderman, a national of an enemy country (Germany) is vested in the United States of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s father, Robert Segelken, died November 1, 1937, leaving a last will and testament admitted to probate November 11, 1937. The Trust Company of. New Jersey, a corporation, and the decedent\u2019s nephew, Eerdinand Michel, and the survivor of them, are therein named as executors. The Trust Company of New Jersey was appointed trustee of the trusts created by the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">In paragraph Twelfth of the will the testator devised and bequeathed all the rest, residue and remainder of his estate to The Trust Company of New Jersey to hold in trust for the following purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-11\">To receive and collect the rents, issues and profits due from all sources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-12\">ii.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-13\">Pay taxes, water rents, assessments, insurance premiums, repairs and maintenance of his real estate, and such other disbursements as are necessary to make to properly administer his estate, out' of the income collected by it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>III.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">\u201cThe balance o\u00a3 said income, after payment of the said expenses and disbursements and the making of said reservations, shall, from time to time, in such manner as to my trustee, in its absolute discretion, may seem best for the interests of my estate and the beneficiaries of said trust hereinafter named, be paid out as follows, to wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">A \u2014 One-half of said balance of said income shall be paid to my beloved wife, Cecelia Segelken, during her' lifetime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">Upon and after the death of my said wife, Cecelia Segelken, I direct ihat my trustee shall divide the trust fund created for the benefit of my said wife into twenty (20) equal parts and pay the following named persons, or their issue, the share as hereinafter set forth respectively, for their own use and benefit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">To my nephew, Ferdinand Michel,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">To my niece, Lucy Michel Leus,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-10\">To my nephew, Robert Segelken, son of my brother, William Segelken,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-11\">To my nephew, William Segelken, son of my brother, William Segelken To my nephew, William Segelken, son of my brother, Louis Segelken,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-12\">three (3) parts three (3) parts</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-13\">three (3) parts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-14\">three (3) parts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-15\">three (3) parts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-16\">I direct that the remaining five (5) parts shall be added to the trust fund hereinafter set up for my son, Robert Segelken, and held by my trustee on the same terms and conditions as provided for in the administration and distribution of said trust fund; provided, however, that in the event my son, Robert Segelken, predeceases my said wife, Cecelia Segelken, leaving children, then I direct that said five (5) parts shall be divided equally among the children of my said son, Robert Segelken, and added to their respective trust funds, hereinafter set up for them and administered and distributed according to the terms provided for the administration and distribution of said childrens\u2019 trust funds.

Thereafter he was supported by his father until his father\u2019s death on FTovember 1, 1937. Upon his father\u2019s death he received a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>legacy of $5,000. Yearly income from the trust was paid to him in varying amounts, the maximum being approximately $3,200 in 1941, and the minimum approximately $1,800 in 1950. Since January of 1951 plaintiff\u2019s wife says she found it necessary to seek financial assistance for their support. This assistance was sought and obtained from her sister-in-law, Inga Smith, in the form of loans totaling $3,000 for which she signed promissory notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The trial court found that under the provisions of the will it was testator\u2019s intention that there be adequate and proper provisions made for the support and maintenance of his wife and his son during their joint lives and for the son after the death of his wife, and that to that end the trustee may invade the <em>corpus </em>of the trust. Judgment was entered directing the trustee to pay plaintiff out of income and <em>corpus </em>the sum of $4,000 per year for the remainder of his life, and to pay to Inga Smith out of the <em>corpus </em>the loan of $3,000 with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">We think the trial court fell into error. As we read the will, the only direction to invade the <em>corpus </em>contained therein is to be found in the fourteenth paragraph, and that for a specific and limited purpose. In that paragraph testator directed that immediately after his death the <em>executors </em>shall make adequate and proper provision for his wife and son out of the principal or <em>corpus </em>of his estate \u201cuntil the income of my said estate coming into the hands of my said trustee shall be sufficient for such purpose.\u201d The testator apparently realized that some time would elapse before the trust could be set up and become income-producing, so in order to insure proper support and maintenance for his wife and son in the meantime, he directed his executors to use <em>corpus </em>for such purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Reading the will from its four corners, we find nothing to indicate that the testator intended invasion of the <em>corpus </em>of the trust estate for the support and maintenance of his son. Quite to the contrary is the direction to the trustee to make payment to the life tenant out of income only from the trust fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Moreover, invasion of the <em>corpus </em>is negatived by the provision Twelfth (III) (B) where the income from the trust fund after the death of the son Robert is directed to be divided among the son\u2019s children until they respectively arrive at the age of 21, when the <em>corpus </em>and accumulated income shall be paid to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">In the event that the son Robert died without leaving children surviving him, the income of the trust is to go to testator\u2019s wife for her life, and upon her death the <em>corpus </em>is to be divided among the children of the testator\u2019s brothers and his sister, <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\"> A court cannot order a trustee to pay to one <em>cestui </em>part of a fund which the testator has established for the benefit of others. <em>Hughes v. Federal Trust Co., </em>119 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>502 <em>(Ch. </em>1936); <em>In re Lucey, </em>98 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>314 <em>(Prerog. </em>1925); <em>Vrooman v. Virgil, </em>81 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>301 <em>(Ch. </em>1913). In 1 <em>Restatement, Trusts, </em>\u00a7 168(d) it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">\u201cThe court will not permit or direct the application of the principal to the support or education of one beneficiary where by the terms of the trust income only is to be so applied, if the result would be to deprive another beneficiary of property to which he is or may become entitled by the terms of .the trust,' whether the interest of such other beneficiary is vested or contingent, unless such other beneficiary consents to such application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">And neither has the doctrine of necessity any application to the property rights in a trust. \u201cThe rights cannot be altered to prevent a disappointment which the creator might have provided against had he foreseen the mishap.\u201d <em>Fidelity, &amp;c., Co. v. J. R. Shanley, &amp;c., Co., </em>113 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>562 <em>(Ch. </em>1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">We conclude that under the will the trustee is without power either express or implied to invade the <em>corpus </em>of the trust fund for the support of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
