The district court determined that the recipient violated the FCRA\u2019s notice and disclosure requirements, and awarded damages 615 F.Supp. 299 (1985). We conclude that the district court erred, and will therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-10\">On November 19, 1977, Donna M. Houghton was involved in an automobile collision with Bernice P. Rosenfeld, an insured of defendant, New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Company (NJMI). On March 16, 1979, plaintiff filed suit against Rosenfeld for injuries resulting from the collision, including a claim for lost earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-11\">On May 14, 1979, NJMI requested that Equifax Services, Inc., conduct an investigation of Houghton and prepare a written report. On a preprinted form provided by Equifax, NJMI specifically requested that the investigation include: (1) \u201cActivities since date of accident\u201d; (2) \u201cCover fully past health history (Illness, injuries, hospitalization, etc.)\u201d; and (3) \u201cGeneral Financial Information (Income, property, etc.).\u201d App. at 163a. Neither Equifax nor NJMI notified Houghton that NJMI had requested the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-14\">On May 22, 1979, Equifax submitted to NJMI a three-page report. App. at 164a. The report included information based on interviews with four of Houghton\u2019s neighbors, a previous report regarding an insurance claim made by Houghton\u2019s mother-in-law, Montgomery County Court records, a search for previous reports on Houghton, and an examination of existing \u201ccredit files.\u201d The report stated: \u201cWe did check available credit files through a confidential source, and we are unable to come up with any financial irregularities.\u201d App. at 164a. A copy was forwarded to NJMI\u2019s counsel and in November, 1979, NJMI settled the case with Houghton.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-15\">Some four years later, on October 21, 1983, Houghton first learned of the existence of the 1979 Equifax report, and requested several times that NJMI disclose its substance to her, which NJMI repeatedly refused to do. A year later she filed this action against NJMI alleging <em>inter alia </em>that NJMI had violated the FCRA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On cross motions for summary judgment, the district court ruled that the Equifax report was an investigative consumer report as defined by the FCRA, app. at 407a-14a, and that NJMI\u2019s failure to notify Houghton of its request and its subsequent refusal to disclose the report therefore violated FCRA \u00a7\u00a7 1681d(a) and 1681d(b). <em>Id. </em>at 414a-17a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a bench trial on damages, the court awarded Houghton $7,000.00 in compensatory and punitive damages, $7,770.00 in attorney\u2019s fees, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>$1,284.66 in costs. <em>Id. </em>at 423a, 427a. NJMI now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-6\">Before us NJMI challenges the district court\u2019s holding that the Equifax report requested by NJMI was an investigative consumer report within the meaning of FCRA \u00a7 1681a(d). NJMI also challenges the determination that it violated the FCRA by not providing Houghton notice and disclosure as required by the FCRA. Because the liability was determined by summary judgment, we apply the same standard as the district court; we must determine whether \u201cno genuine issue as to a material fact remain[ed] for trial, and that the moving party [was] entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Goodman v. Mead Johnson &amp; Co., </em>534 F.2d 566, 573 (3d Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1038, 97 S.Ct. 732, 50 L.Ed.2d 748 (1977). Review of the district court\u2019s resolution of questions of law is plenary. <em>See id. </em>at 574. We are satisfied that, distilled to its essence, this appeal presents questions of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-8\">NJMI first contests the district court\u2019s determination that NJMI violated the FCRA by not notifying Houghton that it had requested an investigative consumer report on her. It next argues that the district court erred in concluding that NJMI\u2019s failure to disclose the report to Houghton upon her request violated the FCRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-13\">Determining that the report Equifax submitted to NJMI was an \u201cinvestigative consumer report,\u201d the court said that NJMI was liable for not notifying or disclosing the report to Houghton. We disagree. Because NJMI did not request an investigative consumer report from Equifax, and because the report, on its face, did not appear to be an investigative consumer report from Equifax, and because the report, on its face, did not appear to be an investigative consumer report as defined in the statute, we have decided that NJMI cannot be held liable for its failure to comply with the Act\u2019s notice and disclosure provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-15\">The district court was persuaded that NJMI had violated \u00a7 1681d of the FCRA. This section covers only investigative consumer reports and requires all persons who \u201cprocure or cause to be prepared\u201d investigative consumer reports to notify consumers to whom the reports pertain, and to disclose the reports to them upon request.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Otherwise, unless adverse action pertaining to credit, insurance, or employment is taken, <em>see </em>\u00a7 1681m, recipients or users (here, NJMI) of the information obtained from a consumer reporting agency have no duty to notify, or disclose any information to, the consumer. In those instances, the Act affords consumers protection through \u00a7 1681g, which requires consumer reporting agencies (here, Equifax) to disclose information in their files to the consumer upon request.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">Because NJMI\u2019s request, on its face, did not ask Equifax for an investigative consumer report, we conclude that NJMI cannot be held liable for violating \u00a7 1681d(a), the notice provision of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-5\">Not every report issued from Equifax or other consumer reporting agencies qualifies as an investigative consumer report under the statute. The statutory definition provides that a \u201cconsumer report\u201d is a report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1256-6\">[U]sed or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer\u2019s eligibility for (1) credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) employment purposes, or (3) other purposes authorized under section 1681b of this title.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1256-7\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(d). An investigative consumer report is a particular species of consumer report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1256-8\">(e) The term \u201cinvestigative consumer report\u201d means a consumer report or portion thereof in which information on a consumer\u2019s character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living is obtained through personal interviews with neighbors, friends, or associates of the consumer reported on or with others with whom he is acquainted or who may have knowledge concerning any such items of information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1256-9\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1681a(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-10\">Relying on <em>Heath v. Credit Bureau of Sheridan, Inc., </em>618 F.2d 693 (10th Cir. 1980), and <em>Boothe v. TRW Credit Data, </em>523 F.Supp. 631 (S.D.N.Y.1981), the district court determined that because the credit information referred to in the Equifax report was \u201coriginally collected ... for one of the purposes listed in \u00a7 1681b,\u201d the report was a consumer report as defined by the FCRA. App. at 411a. Because other portions of the report were obtained through interviews, the court also concluded that it was an \u201cinvestigative consumer report,\u201d and found NJMI liable under \u00a7 1681d(a) for not providing notice to Houghton when it requested the report from Equifax. <em>Id. </em>at 415a n. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-19\">Our examination of the statute leads to a different interpretation. NJMI\u2019s request indicated that it concerned a \u201cpersonal injury claim.\u201d App. at 163a. It asked for a \u201cSpecial Activities Check\u201d limited to \u201cGeneral Financial Information,\u201d \u201cActivities since date of accident,\u201d and \u201cpast health history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nothing in the request indicated that NJMI desired a report on Houghton for a purpose encompassed within the statutory definition of an investigative consumer report. The request concerned only the genuineness of Houghton\u2019s personal injury claim and not her \u201celigibility for ... credit or insurance or employment____\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-22\">We therefore hold that because NJMI did not request an investigative consumer report on Houghton, no notice was required under \u00a7 1681d(a). The district court erred in finding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-23\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-24\">We next examine the court\u2019s conclusion that NJMI violated the FCRA disclo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>sure requirement for failing to disclose the report to Houghton after she requested it. The statute requires one to divulge the report upon request only if the report qualifies as a \u201cconsumer report\u201d as defined by the statute in \u00a7 1681a(d), as set forth previously in Part III B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">On its face the Equifax report did not contain sufficient detail to alert NJMI that it may have obtained an investigative consumer report from Equifax that was subject to the FCRA disclosure requirement. It was only a single isolated phrase of the Equifax report that prompted the district court to conclude that the report was a consumer report: that Equifax \u201cdid check available credit files through a confidential source and ... [was] unable to come up with any financial irregularities.\u201d App. at 164a. The district court conceded that had this phrase not been contained in the report, \u201c[NJMI\u2019s] position that the Report is not a consumer report would be persuasive.\u201d App. at 410a. We agree with the district court that nothing else in the report would bring it within the statutory perimeters of a \u201cconsumer report,\u201d but we disagree that the naked phrase \u201cavailable credit files\u201d was sufficient to alert NJMI that the report came within the pale of the statutory definition. Absolutely nothing in the report indicates that the \u201cavailable credit files\u201d served as a factor in establishing the consumer\u2019s eligibility for (1) credit or insurance to be used for personal, family, or household purposes, (2) employment purposes, or (3) \u201ca legitimate business need for the information in connection with a business transaction involving the consumer.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1681a(d) and 1681b(3). Had the Equifax report shown on its face that it was in fact an investigative consumer report, even though NJMI did not request such a report it might have been under an obligation to disclose it in response to a specific request. However, we need not reach that issue under the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-10\">We also do not agree with the district court\u2019s alternative holding that \u00a7 1681b(3)(E) should be read broadly, to include any report involving a business transaction in the statutory definition of consumer report, and that NJMI therefore had the duty to disclose the report. The district court determined that mere potential liability under an insurance policy constituted a \u201cbusiness transaction\u201d between NJMI and Houghton.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A broad interpretation of the \u201cbusiness transaction\u201d language of \u00a7 1681b(3)(E) would render the specificity of \u00a7\u00a7 1681a(d) and b(3) meaningless. We believe that any \u00a7 1681b(3)(E) business transaction must relate to one of the other specifically enumerated transactions in \u00a7\u00a7 1681a(d) and b(3), <em>i.e., </em>credit, insurance eligibility, employment, or licensing. This is to say that a consumer relationship must exist between the party requesting the report and the subject of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-11\">Here, no such consumer relationship existed between NJMI, the party requesting the report, and Houghton, the subject of the report. The only parties who had a consumer relationship were NJMI and Bernice P. Rosenfeld, NJMI\u2019s insured. Thus, the report on Houghton prepared by Equifax did not fall within the statutory definition of a consumer report under \u00a7 1681b(3)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-12\">We find the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Cochran v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>472 F.Supp. 827 (N.D.Ga.1979), persuasive. The <em>Cochran </em>court concluded that the \u201cbusiness transaction\u201d language of \u00a7 1681b(3)(E) included, of reports pertaining to insurance, \u201conly those information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>reports prepared to determine eligibility for insurance coverage or underwriting, and not those compiled to evaluate claims for benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 832. The court held that the \u201capparent conflict\u201d between \u00a7 1681a(d) and \u00a7 1681b(3)(E) should be resolved by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcXL\">recognizing the preeminence of \u00a7 1681a and then conforming the breadth of \u00a7 1681b to the former\u2019s bounds. Not to do this would render unnecessarily meaningless the \u00a7 1681a restrictive language and thereby would ignore a staunch canon of statutory interpretation. Conforming \u00a7 1681b to \u00a7 1681a preserves the integrity of both sections, while promoting the underlying purpose of the entire sub-chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 831 (footnote omitted). With the <em>Cochran </em>court, we rely on the rule that a statute should be interpreted so as to give effect to every phrase and not render any part superfluous. <em>Colautti v. Franklin, </em>439 U.S. 379, 392, 99 S.Ct. 675, 684, 58 L.Ed.2d 596 (1979); <em>Armstrong Paint &amp; Varnish Works v. Nu-Enamel Corp., </em>305 U.S. 315, 332-33, 59 S.Ct. 191, 199-200, 83 L.Ed. 195 (1938), <em>reh. denied, </em>305 U.S. 675, 59 S.Ct. 356, 83 L.Ed. 437 (1939). We also rely on the rule of <em>ejusdem generis </em>\u2014 when general words follow an enumeration of specific terms the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words. <em>Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., </em>446 U.S. 578, 588, 100 S.Ct. 1889, 1895, 64 L.Ed.2d 525 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-5\">Here, the district court relied upon <em>Ber-esh v. Retail Credit Co., </em>358 F.Supp. 260 (C.D.Cal.1973), where the court ruled an investigative insurance claim report came within \u201cthe broad language of \u00a7 1681b(3)(E).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262. The <em>Beresh </em>court, however, did not supply persuasive reasoned elaboration. It did not attempt to analyze the interpretation of \u00a7 1681a(d) and \u00a7 1681b(3), or apply concepts of statutory construction. Several courts have criticized the holding in <em>Beresh. See, e.g., Cochran, </em>472 F.Supp. at 832 (\u201c[W]e find that \u00a7\u00a7 1681a and 1681b should not be read in the <em>Beresh </em>way____\u201d); <em>Kiblen v. Pickle, </em>33 Wash.App. 387, 395, 653 P.2d 1338, 1342 (1982) (finding <em>Cochran </em>to be the better reasoned decision); <em>Daniels v. Retail Credit Co., </em>No. 72 CV-484, Slip op. at 7 (N.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 1976) (\u201c[RJeliance on ... <em>Beresh </em>... is not well founded.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-9\">We are convinced that <em>Cochran </em>is the better reasoned opinion and decide that the district court erred when it concluded, as an alternative holding, that this report came within the \u201cbusiness transaction\u201d provision of \u00a7 1681b(3)(E). NJMI\u2019s failure to disclose the report to Houghton, therefore, as a matter of law, could not violate the FCRA\u2019s disclosure requirement. The district court\u2019s conclusion otherwise was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-10\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-11\">We therefore hold that the district court erred in concluding that NJMI violated the FCRA by not notifying Houghton that it had requested the Equifax report and then not disclosing the report to Houghton. Because NJMI is not liable to Houghton, we need not address appellant\u2019s arguments concerning damages. The judgment of the district court will therefore be reversed and the case will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1254-12\">. Houghton also alleged that NJMI had violated her right to privacy under the United States and Pennsylvania constitutions, invaded her privacy under Pennsylvania common law, and intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1254-16\">. The court, however, found no federal or state constitutional violation, and found that NJMI had not invaded Houghton's privacy or intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon her.

Section 1681b, which is set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is directed to the circumstances under which a consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report. The most plausible construction of the language is to read \u201cthe other purposes\u201d language of \u00a7 1681a(d) as incorporating the \u201cpurposes\u201d set forth in \u00a7 1681b(3), so that a consumer report is defined, <em>inter alia, </em>as a report to be used for the purposes enumerated in \u00a7 1681(b)(3). This subsection permits a consumer reporting agency to furnish a consumer report to persons which it has reason to believe intend to use the information in connection with five designated purposes: (A) a personal credit transaction; (B) employment purposes; (C) the <em>underwriting </em>of insurance involving the consumer; (D) licensing or similar benefit; or (E) to a person who <em>\u201cotherwise </em>has a legitimate business need for the information in connection with a business transaction involving the consumer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-6\">The majority gives subsection (E) an extremely limited construction when it states, \u201cWe believe that any \u00a7 1681b(3)(E) business transaction must relate to one of the other specifically enumerated transactions in \u00a7\u00a7 1681a(d) and b(3), <em>i.e., </em>credit, insurance eligibility, employment or licensing.\u201d Majority at 1149. I hesitate to join the majority\u2019s construction for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-13\">1. I am concerned that if \u00a7 1681b(3)(E) is given such a limited construction when that subsection is considered in connection with the definition of consumer report, it may be given a similar construction when considered in the context of the section in which it appears. That section, \u00a7 1681b, provides that \u201ca consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and <em>no </em>other\u201d (emphasis added). The majority\u2019s language could be read to suggest that a consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report only in connection with a credit transaction, the underwriting of insurance, employment, or licensing. Although no consumer reporting agency is a defendant here, the majority\u2019s stress of the specificity of \u00a7\u00a7 1681b(3)(A) through (D) to support its construction for purposes of defining a consumer report is not easily separable from construction of the same section in the context of the permissible distribution by a consumer reporting agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-14\">2. The construction the majority applies is inconsistent with the established canon it refers to that \u201ca statute should be interpreted so as to give effect to every phrase and not render any part superfluous.\u201d Majority at 1150. The majority\u2019s construction renders subsection (E) superfluous. If (E) is limited to the four preceding subsections, there was no reason for Congress to have written it into the statute. Furthermore, if Congress did not intend that \u00a7 1681b(3)(E) be broader than the preceding subsections (A) through (D), it would not have introduced subsection (E) with the words <em>\u201coth</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number><em>erwise </em>has a legit\u00edmate business need ...\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-4\">3. I also would adopt the reasoning in <em>Cochran v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>472 F.Supp. 827 (N.D.Ga.1979), but I do not read that case as compelling the majority's construction. In <em>Cochran, </em>the court limited its discussion to the issue of whether an investigative report prepared in connection with a medical disability claim could be considered a \u201cconsumer report\u201d. The court reasoned that because elsewhere in the same statute Congress expressed its definition of consumer reports for insurance purposes, <em>see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1681a(d)(l), 1681b(3)(C), the courts could not expand the definition to include information gathered to substantiate insurance claims. <em>Id. </em>at 831. I believe that reasoning provides ample basis for the conclusion that the relationship between Houghton and NJMI was not the type of business transaction encompassed by \u00a7 1681b(3)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">4. If we were compelled to make a definitive construction of \u00a7 1681b(3)(E), and I think we are not, I would prefer the reading of the statute suggested in the majority\u2019s opinion, but not adopted by it. The majority notes that \u201cwhen general words follow an enumeration of specific terms the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.\u201d Majority at 1150. Thus, subsection (E) encompasses the types of business transactions <em>similar </em>to those set forth in subsections (A) through (D), but is not strictly limited to them. Although I cannot anticipate all of the types of business transactions to which subsection (E) would apply under my construction, I believe the section should be read to permit a consumer reporting agency to provide information in connection with a legitimate business transaction not specified in (A) through (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-10\">In sum, rather than extending the analysis in this case to implicate issues not before us, I would limit the statutory construction of \u00a7 1681b(3)(E) in this case to the holding that an insurance claim report is not a business transaction within that section. This construction is consistent with the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s administrative interpretation of the Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and suffices for purposes of deciding the case before us.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1259-7\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-8\">A consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other:</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-9\">(1) In response to the order of a court having jurisdiction to issue such an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-10\">(2) In accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-11\">(3) To a person which it has reason to believe\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-12\">(A) intends to use the information in connection with a credit transaction involving the consumer on whom the information is to be furnished and involving the extension of credit to, or review or collection of an account of, the consumer; or</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-15\">(B) intends to use the information for employment purposes; or</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-16\">(C) intends to use the information in connection with the underwriting of insurance involving the consumer; or</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-17\">(D) intends to use the information in connection with a determination of the consumer\u2019s eligibility for a license or other benefit granted by a governmental instrumentality required by law to consider an applicant\u2019s financial responsibility or status; or</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-18\">(E) otherwise has a legitimate business need for the information in connection with a business transaction involving the consumer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1260-6\">.
