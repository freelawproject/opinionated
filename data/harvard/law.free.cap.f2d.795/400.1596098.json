His appeal unsuccessful, <em>State v. Felde, </em>422 So.2d 370 (La.1982), Felde has since sought habeas relief in the state courts and federal district court to no avail. We now take up his habeas claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-15\">The petitioner\u2019s first claim is that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in the penalty phase of his trial, when his attorney, concededly acting on instructions, suggested to the jury that life imprisonment would be unbearable and requested that it return a sentence of death, a request the jury obliged. The petitioner contends that he was mentally incompetent to give such instructions and that in any event the attorney was derelict in his duty to follow them.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-16\">We dealt with a similar claim of ineffectiveness of counsel in <em>Autry v. McKaskle, </em>727 F.2d 358 (5th Cir.1984). In <em>Autry, </em>the petitioner was convicted of two counts of first degree murder after a vigorous defense. In the sentencing phase of the trial that followed, the defendant gave instructions to his attorney not to argue against the imposition of the death penalty, instructions that the attorney obeyed. Autry\u2019s habeas petition argued that the failure of the attorney to seek a competency hearing before abiding by such instructions amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel in the sentencing phase. We rejected that argument, declaring:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-17\">[T]he Supreme Court has refused pro se withdrawal of a petition for writ of cer-tiorari absent a competency hearing when counsel questioned his client\u2019s competence and supported his concern with a report by an examining psychiatrist who found him incompetent. <em>Rees v. Peyton, </em>384 U.S. 312, 86 S.Ct. 1505, 16 L.Ed.2d 583 (1965). It does not follow for us that refusing to plead for mercy after being convicted of two execution-style slayings will <em>alone </em>so implicate a defendant\u2019s competency as to render his counsel constitutionally ineffective for not seeking an inquiry into competency before abiding the client\u2019s decision. <em>There is no other evidence from trial or from the post-conviction evidentiary hearings that raises questions about Autry\u2019s competence. </em>The United States district judge found no suggestion of incompetence after reviewing the entire trial record and listening to the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Autry and all the witnesses. Those witnesses included the priest , who attended Autry on the eve of his aborted execution, Autry\u2019s mother and prison officials. <em>None suggested that Autry was or is other than competent.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-4\">While categorization of decisions as the personal choices of a criminal defendant or the tactical choices of counsel is not always an easy task, cf. <em>Jones v. Estelle, 122 </em>F.2d 159 (5th Cir.1983) (en banc), the United States district court found that Autry made the decisions he now charges his lawyer incompetently made. <em>If Autry knowingly made the choices, Carver was ethically bound to follow Autry\u2019s wishes. Foster v. Strickland, </em>707 F.2d 1339, 1343 (11th Cir.1983) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">* Jji # * sj&lt; s\u00a1c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">In sum, Carver [Autry\u2019s attorney] was not ineffective in not seeking a competency hearing before abiding Autry\u2019s decision, <em>absent a more substantial reason to suspect incompetence than the lawyer\u2019s view that Autry\u2019s decision was injurious to the case. 121 </em>F.2d at 362-363 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">In its disposition of this issue, the United States district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">The record shows that the court and defense counsel were familiar with the facts and circumstances underlying the defendant\u2019s demands, the physical conditions under which the defendant was maintained, and defendant\u2019s apparent competence to assist defense counsel in preparation and. conduct of trial. In the absence of apparent mental deficiency, defendant\u2019s pursuit of an \u201call-or-nothing\u201d result was not sufficient in itself to warrant a competency hearing. Defense counsel\u2019s familiarity with the defendant precludes a finding that he was ineffective in failing to seek a competency hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">The record shows that Felde\u2019s attorney was familiar with his client's condition as the trial commenced. But given the defense theory, insanity, and the evidence introduced to support it \u2014 as well as the facts surrounding Felde\u2019s incarceration \u2014 it is less clear to us that on the face of this record there was an \u201cabsence of apparent mental deficiency\u201d on Felde\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">We note the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s observation that Felde\u2019s sanity commission concluded that he was competent to stand trial at the time of the commission\u2019s report, <em>State v. Felde, </em>supra, 422 So.2d at 376, and the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that Felde was \u201cmentally competent to stand trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395. Counsel ordinarily would not be deficient in failing to request a second competency hearing for a defendant whom the state trial court has already found to be competent. The state court\u2019s finding of mental competence to stand trial, and, inferentially, mental competence to waive sixth amendment rights through the instructions Felde gave his attorney, is a finding of fact entitled to a presumption of correctness under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). <em>Maggio v. Fulford, </em>462 U.S. 111, 116-17, 103 S.Ct. 2261, 2263-64, 76 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, there are certain situations in which the presumption of correctness does not apply. \u00a7 2254(d)(l)-(8). One of those situations is arguably present in this case. Section 2254(d)(8) states that the presumption of correctness does not apply to fact determinations \u201cnot fully supported by the record.\u201d The issue we face, therefore, is whether the state court\u2019s determination of competence is fairly supported by the record, or if another exception applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-14\">The Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s finding that Felde was competent to stand trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>was apparently based entirely on the reports of the sanity commission members. However, the sanity commission reports are absent from the record before us, and there is no indication when its members completed their reports. The Louisiana Supreme Court states that Dr. Marceau, one of three examining psychiatrists, saw Felde on January 31, 1979, some 18 months before Felde\u2019s trial. The second commission member, Dr. Braswell, examined Felde on January 22 and February 19, 1979. The third, Dr. Mauroner, examined Felde on January 29, and February 5 and 19, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">In light of our reasoning in <em>Autry, </em>we believe the district court was obligated to determine whether the state court finding that Felde was competent to stand trial and thus to waive his right to counsel is fairly supported by the record. Such a determination cannot be made on the basis of the present record, which does not include the only information on which the state court based its finding of competence. Whether the examinations of Felde were close enough to the time of trial that the defense attorney need not have requested a competency hearing, in light of the intervening events Felde alleges took place, may be relevant to the district court\u2019s inquiry as to whether the state court finding is entitled to a presumption of correctness and to whether Felde\u2019s counsel should have asked for a second competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">We will thus remand for the purpose of considering this issue on an expanded record. If, on remand, the district court concludes that the state court finding of competence is not entitled to a presumption of correctness, the district court should conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings as to whether or not there was an \u201cabsence of apparent mental deficiency\u201d on Felde\u2019s part so that the principles enunciated in <em>Autry </em>were satisfied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Felde challenges as prejudicial certain remarks by the prosecutor in his closing statement and rebuttal. In those remarks the prosecutor referred to evidence not in the record, warning in addition that if the petitioner was found not guilty by reason of insanity he might easily escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">In federal habeas actions, improper jury argument by the state does not present a claim of constitutional magnitude unless it is so prejudicial that the petitioner\u2019s state court trial was rendered fundamentally unfair within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. <em>Kirkpatrick v. Blackburn, 777 </em>F.2d 272, 281 (5th Cir.1983). To establish that a prosecutor\u2019s remarks are so inflammatory as to prejudice the substantial rights of a defendant, the petitioner must demonstrate either persistent and pronounced misconduct or that the evidence was so insubstantial that (in probability) but for the remarks no conviction would have occurred. <em>Id. </em>At best, the petitioner suggests that \u201cit cannot be said with any degree of certainty\" that the allegedly prejudical remarks \u201chad no effect on the outcome\u201d of the case. That is true. The burden, however, was not on the state to make such a showing. The petitioner has failed to carry his burden of showing that the evidence against him was so insubstantial that but for these remarks no conviction would have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">Citing <em>Grisby v. Mabry, </em>758 F.2d 226 (8th Cir.1985) (en banc), the petitioner next argues that his right to a jury selected from a cross-section of the community was violated by the exclusion of thirty veniremen stricken for cause under <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 520, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968) because of their moral qualms about the death penalty. We have rejected this argument before, <em>see, e.g., Wicker v. McCotter, 183 </em>F.2d 487, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>493-494 (5th Cir.1986), and do so again today. More to the purpose, the Supreme Court has now likewise done so. <em>Lockhart v. McCree, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 59, 88 L.Ed.2d 48 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The petitioner\u2019s next claim is that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated by prosecution references to statements made by the petitioner to a psychiatrist during the course of the court-ordered sanity commission examination. Assuming, arguendo, that these statements were inadmissible in the state\u2019s case in chief since Felde had not been given the Miranda warning before the examination (even though Felde placed his sanity at issue), the statements were properly used during Felde\u2019s cross-examination and in the prosecution\u2019s closing statement and rebuttal for impeachment purposes. <em>Harris v. New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 226, 91 S.Ct. 643, 646, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">We find no merit in any of petitioner\u2019s claims save his contention that he lacked effective assistance of counsel in the sentencing phase of his trial. Since the record is incomplete on that point, we REMiAND to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-10\">. A \"person whose mental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial.\u201d <em>Drope v. Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 171, 95 S.Ct. 896, 903, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975). Felde does <em>not </em>argue that he was incompetent to be tried. <em>See </em>Rec. v. 1, at 44-45. Rather, Felde\u2019s competence is an issue in this case, in light of the allegations of the petition and his brief on appeal, only as to whether he could knowingly and intelligently waive his sixth amendment right to effective counsel at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\">. If the finding of competency by the state court is fairly supported by the record on which that finding was made, the state may nevertheless be required to resentence Felde depending on the findings of the district court on remand. A resentencing will be necessary if Felde can establish that his mental condition deteriorated significantly between his competency hearing and trial and: (1) his counsel was or should have been aware of his deteriorated mental condition, and (2) reasonably effective counsel would have determined that if another competency hearing had been requested the court probably would have found Felde incompetent to stand trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
