At the close of the sentencing hearing, the district court denied Wheeler\u2019s motion for bail pending appeal. The district court neither made written findings nor provided a transcript of oral reasons for the denial. Wheeler now requests that this court release her on bail pending appeal of her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-20\">Under the Bail Reform Act of 1984, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(b), a defendant is to be incarcerated pending appeal unless the court finds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-21\">(1) that the defendant is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person in the community if released;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-22\">(2) that the appeal is not for the purpose of delay;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-23\">(3) that the appeal raises a substantial question of law or fact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-24\">(4) that if that substantial question is determined favorably to defendant on appeal, that decision is likely to result in reversal or an order for a new trial of all counts on which imprisonment has been imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-25\"><em>United States v. Handy, </em>761 F.2d 1279, 1283 (9th Cir.1985) (quoting <em>United States v. Giancola, </em>754 F.2d 898, 901 (11th Cir.1985), and <em>United States v. Miller, </em>753 F.2d 19, 24 (3d Cir.1985)). Wheeler bears the burden of showing that she is not a flight risk or a danger to any other person or to the community. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 9(c). A \u201csubstantial question\u201d is one that is fairly debatable or fairly doubtful. <em>Handy, </em>761 F.2d at 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-26\">Fed.R.App.P. 9(b) requires that \u201cthe [district] court shall state in writing the reasons\u201d for refusing release pending ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>peal. The district court satisfies the writing requirement by issuing written findings or by stating the reasons for the decision orally and providing a transcript. <em>See United States v. Perdomo, </em>765 F.2d 942, 943 n. 1 (9th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Provenzano, </em>605 F.2d 85, 88 n. 5 (3d Cir.1979); <em>United States v. Fields, </em>466 F.2d 119, 121 n. 3 (2d Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Rule 9(b)\u2019s writing requirement \u201cperforms a vital mission,\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>417 F.2d 1154, 1156 (D.C.Cir.1969), both for litigants on appeal and for appellate courts. Only if provided with reasons for the district court\u2019s decision can an appellant intelligently renew a bail motion in the court of appeals. <em>Id. </em>Without specific findings, we cannot effectively and efficiently review a bail motion decision. <em>See United States v. Affleck, </em>765 F.2d 944, 954 (10th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Stanley, </em>469 F.2d 576, 584 (D.C.Cir.1972) (\u201cWithout elucidation of the basis for the judge\u2019s action, we cannot fairly evaluate the merits of either the application or the judge\u2019s decision thereon.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">Moreover, a district court\u2019s reasons for its decision must be adequately explained; conclusory statements are insufficient. <em>See Stanley, </em>469 F.2d at 585 (judge must fairly explain ruling so that it may be intelligently reviewed); <em>Fields, </em>466 F.2d at 121 (reasons must be stated with particularity); <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>452 F.2d 1333, 1336 n. 7 (D.C.Cir.1971) (\u201cA mere parroting of the provisions of the applicable statute is not an adequate substitute for a full statement of reasons.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 998, 92 S.Ct 1251, 31 L.Ed.2d 467 (1972); <em>United States v. Manarite, </em>430 F.2d 656, 657 (2d Cir.1970) (extensive colloquy without a concluding statement of reasons for decision insufficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">If a district court fails to comply with Rule 9(b), we will remand for the proper written findings, <em>United States v. Wong-Alvarez, </em>779 F.2d 583, 585 (11th Cir. 1985); <em>United States v. Bishop, </em>537 F.2d 1184, 1185-86 (4th Cir.1976); <em>United States v. Briggs, </em>472 F.2d 1229, 1230 (5th Cir.1973); <em>Jackson, </em>417 F.2d at 1156-57, unless we are satisfied that we should grant bail in accordance with Fed.R.App.P. 9(b) (appellate court may order release of appellant pending appeal \u201cupon such papers, affidavits, and portions of the record as the parties shall present\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case, we have neither the required Rule 9(b) written statement of reasons for denying release or a transcript reciting oral reasons by the district court, nor any sufficient basis for making a bail decision. We therefore remand to the district court with instructions that it provide a Rule 9(b) statement within ten days after this order is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-18\">. When we are satisfied that bail should be granted, this court may enter the proper order pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 9(b). Such an order may be appropriate in certain cases when further confinement of appellant during a remand of the bail motion would only frustrate the goals of the bail provisions. <em>See Virgin Islands v. Leycock, 678 </em>F.2d 467, 469 (3d Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
