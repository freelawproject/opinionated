The Post appeals from the District Court\u2019s ruling that HHS need not disclose some of the desired information, because it was \u201cprivileged\u201d \u201ccommercial or financial information\u201d within the meaning of exemption 4 to FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(4). The principal issue presented is whether HHS raised the defense that the desired information was \u201cprivileged\u201d under exemption 4 in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b314-20\">On February 14, 1980, the Post submitted a FOIA request to HHS, asking for copies of certain financial disclosure statements (\u201cForms 474\u201d) that scientists who review grant applications for the NCI must submit to HHS. HHS denied the request, claiming that the Forms 474 were exempted from disclosure by exemption 6 to FOIA, which exempts \u201cpersonnel and; medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6).. After exhausting its administrative remedies, the Post filed suit in the District Court for the District of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Columbia pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Before the District Court, HHS asserted that the Forms 474 were covered not only by exemption 6, but also by exemption 4, because they contained \u201cconfidential\u201d \u201ccommercial or financial information,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(4), and by exemption 3, because they were \u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court rejected HHS\u2019s exemption 3 defense, holding that no statute specifically exempted the Forms 474 from disclosure; rejected the exemption 4 defense, holding that exemption 4 did not apply to the Forms 474, which contained \u201cpersonal financial information as distinguished from economic data relating to corporations or other business entities\u201d; and accepted the exemption 6 defense, holding that the public interest in disclosure of the Forms 474 was weaker than the consultants\u2019 privacy interests. The District Court therefore granted summary judgment in favor of HHS. <em>Washington Post Co. v. HHS, </em>Civil Action No. 80-1681, slip op. (D.D.C. Dec. 4, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The Post appealed, and this court reversed the District Court\u2019s exemption 6 holding, on the ground that disclosure of the Forms 474 would not constitute a \u201cclearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d; we also reversed the District Court\u2019s holding that exemption 4 was inapplicable to the Forms 474, concluding that the Forms 474 contained \u201ccommercial or financial information\u201d within the meaning of exemption 4. <em>Washington Post Co. v. HHS, </em>690 F.2d 252 (1982) <em>(\u201cWashington Post I\u201d). </em>We therefore remanded the case to the District Court to assess HHS\u2019s contention that the Forms 474 contained information that was \u201cconfidential\u201d under exemption 4. In dictum, however, we also noted our surprise that HHS had not asserted that the Forms 474 contained information that was \u201cprivileged\u201d under exemption 4, and discussed the way in which we believed such an assertion ought to be analyzed \u201cin case the issue [was] raised on remand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">On remand, HHS not unreasonably took this dictum to be an invitation, and raised for the first time the exemption 4 \u201cprivilege\u201d defense. In advancing this defense, HHS relied principally on this court\u2019s earlier decision in <em>Association for Women in Science v. Califano, </em>566 F.2d 339 (D.C.Cir.1977) <em>(AWIS\u201d) </em>which had held that Forms 474 were privileged from civil discovery under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1). Before the proceedings on remand had been completed, the Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Weber Aircraft Corp., </em>465 U.S. 792, 799, 104 S.Ct. 1488, 1493, 79 L.Ed.2d 814 (1984), which held that certain information protected by a \u201cwell recognized\u201d civil discovery privilege was exempted from disclosure by exemption 5 of FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5), which exempts \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.\u201d HHS thereafter relied on <em>Weber </em>to buttress its exemption 4 \u201cprivilege\u201d defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The Post argued strenuously that HHS should not be permitted to raise a new defense of exemption so late in the day, citing this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Ryan v. DOJ, </em>617 F.2d 781, 791-92 (D.C.Cir.1980); <em>Jordan v. DOJ, </em>591 F.2d 753, 779-80 (D.C.Cir.1978) (en banc); and <em>Vaughn v. Rosen, </em>523 F.2d 1136, 1143 (D.C.Cir.1975). The District Court disagreed, however, holding that <em>Weber </em>constituted a change in the law sufficient to come within an exception to the rule announced in those cases, and that this court\u2019s opinion authorized HHS to raise the exemption 4 \u201cprivilege\u201d defense. <em>Washington Post Co. v. HHS, </em>603 F.Supp. 235, 237 n. 6 (D.D.C.1985). The District Court proceeded to consider that defense on the merits, and concluded that the Forms 474 were privileged under exemption 4. It therefore granted HHS\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action. The Post appeals, arguing both that HHS should not have been permitted to raise the exemption 4 \u201cprivilege\u201d defense, and that in any event the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Court incorrectly found the defense to be meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">It is common ground that the government ordinarily must raise all its claims of exemption in the original proceedings in district court, and may not thereafter assert new claims of exemption, either on appeal or on remand following appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Ryan, </em>617 F.2d at 791-92. We have, however, noted two exceptions to this general rule: the extraordinary circumstance in which forbidding the government from advancing an untimely claim of exemption might result in the release of, for example, information compromising national security, <em>Jordan, </em>591 F.2d at 780, or \u201csensitive, personal private information,\u201d <em>Ryan, </em>617 F.2d at 792; and the circumstance in which the government \u201cis forced to invoke an exemption [after the original proceedings in district court] because of a substantial change in the factual context of the case or because of an interim development in applicable legal doctrine,\u201d <em>Jordan, </em>591 F.2d at 780. It has not been contended that the first of these exceptions is applicable. As to the second, we disagree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that <em>Weber </em>was a change in the law sufficient to justify HHS\u2019s tardy assertion of its exemption 4 \u201cprivilege\u201d defense. That such a defense was available was fully apparent from this court\u2019s 1977 decision in <em>AWIS, </em>as is shown by the fact that in <em>Washington Post I </em>\u2014decided well before <em>Weber </em>\u2014 we expressed our puzzlement that HHS had failed to advance it in the original proceedings before the District Court. 690 F.2d at 267. It is clear, moreover, that HHS\u2019s decision to assert the defense on remand was not prompted by <em>Weber, </em>since that assertion was made before <em>Weber </em>was decided. <em>See </em>Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment at 4-5 (June 1, 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Finally, we do not think that our dictum in <em>Washington Post I </em>can properly be considered an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d justifying an exception to the rule that the government must assert all of its exemptions in the original proceedings before the district court. We do not agree with the dissent\u2019s conclusion that that dictum cannot \u201creasonably be read as anything other than a direction that the District Court consider the merits of a privilege claim should [HHS] choose to raise one on demand.\u201d Dissent at 209. The language in question consists of this court\u2019s instructions to the District Court as to the proper analysis of an exemption 4 \u201cprivilege\u201d defense, <em>\u201cin case the issue is raised on remand\u201d </em>(emphasis added). That language can assuredly be interpreted as merely recognizing the <em>possibility </em>that an exemption 4 \u201cprivilege\u201d defense might properly be raised on remand, and as inviting HHS to raise (and the District Court to consider) the defense only if its untimely assertion could be justified. That interpretation, albeit a narrow one, should have been preferred by the District Court (as it should be by the present panel), since the alternative \u201cdirection\u201d which the dissent infers would have been a direction to contravene the law of the circuit. As the dissent properly observes, one ought to \u201cact on the modest assumption ... that we fashion our opinions in conformity\u201d with the law, Dissent at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Nor do we agree with the dissent that the \u201cefficiency concerns underlying\u201d the requirement that the government assert its exemptions in a timely fashion are not applicable to this case. Dissent at 210. It is true, of course, that the parties have already litigated and the District Court has already decided the merits of the exemption 4 \u201cprivilege\u201d defense, and thus that enforcement of the timeliness requirement at this stage in the proceeding spares them no inconvenience. But this will be true whenever a district court mistakenly per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>mits the government to assert an exemption for the first time on remand; surely it cannot be suggested that such errors ought never be corrected on appeal. The timeliness rule is concerned not just with efficiency in a given case, but also with efficiency in the long run, and it disserves this broader goal to permit untimely defenses, even after they have been argued, to prevail. Moreover, efficiency cannot be purchased at the expense of unfairness. The unfortunate status of the present case is attributable, first, to the government\u2019s failure to raise the \u201cprivilege\u201d defense in the original proceedings, second, perhaps, to the failure of this court to make the import of its dictum in <em>Washington Post I </em>utterly clear, and, third, to the government\u2019s and the District Court\u2019s decision to give that dictum an interpretation that would place it in violation of our precedent. The only actor that cannot possibly be accused of any responsibility for the confusion is the Post, which defended the original proceedings on the basis of the arguments there raised and vigorously protested the introduction of new arguments on remand. It would be grotesque to present the Post with the bill for an entertainment which it alone insisted should not have been staged. We will not require this litigant, contrary to the well established law of this circuit, to overcome newly framed arguments on remand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to HHS on the ground that the Forms 474 contain information that was \u201cprivileged\u201d within the meaning of exemption 4 is reversed. The case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to determine whether the Forms 474 contain information that is \u201cconfidential\u201d under exemption 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-6\">. Although HHS contends that this rule prohibits only the untimely raising of a new numbered exemption, and not (what HHS did in this case) the untimely raising of a new <em>element </em>of a numbered exemption that has already been invoked, this contention is contradicted not only by common sense but also by this court's holding in <em>Vaughn, </em>523 F.2d at 1143.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b317-7\">. The dissent believes there is an inconsistency between this conclusion and the dissent written by the author of this opinion in <em>Conafay v. Wyeth Laboratories, </em>793 F.2d 350 (D.C.Cir.1986) (Scalia, J., dissenting), a case that involved as-sertedly erroneous denial of a motion for voluntary dismissal. Inconsistency with a position that has been rejected by a panel of this court would hardly impugn the correctness of our judgment. The author resists the temptation to explain why no inconsistency exists, since this is not the place to engage in vindication of personal views.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b317-8\">STARR, Circuit Judge, dissenting:</author>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">I respectfully dissent. In my view, the panel opinion in <em>Washington Post I </em>quite clearly invited the Government to assert an Exemption 4 \u201cprivilege\u201d claim. The specific situation at hand presents precisely the kind of \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d that justify an exception to the general rule requiring the Government to assert all exemptions before appeal to this court. <em>See, e.g., Ryan v. Department of Justice, </em>617 F.2d 781, 792 (D.C.Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">The majority concedes, as it must, that <em>Washington Post I </em>invited the Government\u2019s claim of privilege. The relevant portion of that opinion began in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-11\">The remaining issue is whether the list of financial interests is \u201cprivileged or confidential.\u201d The Government has not asserted that Form 474 is \u201cprivileged\u201d within the meaning of Exemption 4. We are puzzled as to why not____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">690 F.2d at 267 (footnote omitted). With this introduction, the opinion went on to provide several paragraphs of guidance on the privilege prong of the exemption, <em>\u201cin case the issue is raised on remand. </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). I do not see how these instructions could reasonably be read as anything less than a direction that the District Court consider the merits of a privilege claim should the Government choose to raise one on remand. To be sure, the District Court might have surmised that we simply had not considered the general rule against raising additional exemption claims on remand. But the District Court\u2019s divination as to <em>our </em>reasons for inviting consideration of the privilege claim is irrelevant. First, I should have thought that this court, like Congress, is to be charged with knowledge of existing law, particular<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ly the law of the circuit. <em>Cf Cannon v. University of Chicago, </em>441 U.S. 677, 696-97, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 1957-58, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (\u201c[I]t is always appropriate to assume that our elected representatives, like other citizens, know the law____\u201d). It is entirely proper for the District Court to act on the modest assumption that we know as much about our law as does Congress and that we fashion our opinions in conformity with that body of law. Second, regardless of the District Court\u2019s view about what assumptions may have animated our court, it is obligated to follow this court\u2019s instructions, especially when our system chooses not to favor the district courts with an opportunity to remand appellate opinions back upstairs for clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The majority nevertheless reverses the District Court on the ground that we are not faced with a risk of compromising national security or sensitive personal information, or with a substantial change in the factual or legal context \u2014 situations previously recognized as justifying exceptions to <em>Ryan\u2019s </em>general rule that an exemption claim is waived if not raised in the original District Court proceeding. <em>See </em>Maj.Op. at 208. The majority, with all respect, has adopted an unnecessarily wooden reading of our precedents. Unlike the law of the Medes and Persians, FOIA is a legal arena of unusual flexibility. For example, litigators in federal district court are blissfully free to advance exemptions never contemplated by the experts back home at the agency; the wondrous land of FOIA is a long way from <em>Chenery </em>territory. None of the cases cited by the majority, moreover, suggests that exceptions are available <em>only </em>in the two types of situations that the majority describes. Indeed, the general rule in this circuit is that waiver rules may bend in those \u201cexceptional circumstances ... where injustice might otherwise result.\u201d <em>District of Columbia v. Air Florida, Inc., </em>750 F.2d 1077, 1085 (D.C.Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The injustice of the majority\u2019s inflexible application of the waiver rule in the setting before us is manifest. The District Court faithfully followed our opinion in <em>Washington Post I, </em>which the majority now characterizes with beguiling ease as <em>dicta. </em>The parties, in turn, reasonably relied on this court\u2019s opinion in devoting months of their time, at considerable expense, to litigating the Exemption 4 privilege issue. The Post chose to proceed with that litigation, rather than simply resting on its objection that <em>Ryan </em>prohibits new exemption claims from being raised on remand. (Indeed, one member of today\u2019s majority has argued that, as long as an alleged error does not affect \u201cthe fairness of the outcome or the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the parties,\u201d a party who fails to rest upon an objection to an error should be deemed to have waived the objection. <em>Conafay v. Wyeth Laboratories, </em>793 F.2d 350, 355 (D.C.Cir.1986) (Scalia, J., dissenting)).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">In my view, the efficiency concerns underlying the <em>Ryan </em>rule were never intended to apply under such circumstances. <em>Ryan </em>itself, by providing for exceptions to the general rule, is a reaffirmation of the judiciary\u2019s commitment to sensible rules that make for the orderly and fair adjudication of FOIA issues. Today\u2019s majority prefers procedural purity to common sense, even though it is this court which beguiled the District Court and the litigators into devoting, some months to indulging in what we now write off as a frolic and detour. We should have greater respect for the judicial process than to turn the relationship between the trial and appellate courts into a shell game. In short, I think it ill behooves us, having invited resolution of the Exemption 4 privilege issue, now to rely on a crabbed interpretation of our own housekeeping rule in order to say that we did not really mean it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
