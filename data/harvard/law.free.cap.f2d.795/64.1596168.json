He applied for benefits after suffering a back injury at work. An administrative law judge (ALJ) found that his back impairment met disability Listing 1.05 C of 20 C.F.R. part 404, subpart P, appendix 1 (Listing of Impairments). Record, vol. 2, at 20. However, the ALJ found that Mr. Weakley was not entitled to benefits because, without an acceptable reason, he refused to have the back surgery his physician had prescribed. <em>Id. </em>(relying on 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1530 (1985)). After the Social Security Administration Appeals Council denied his appeal, record, vol. 2, at 4-5, Mr. Weakley sought relief from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma. That court rejected Mr. Weakley\u2019s claim for benefits in an opinion which made no mention that his back impairment met Listing 1.05 C. Record, vol. 1, at 26-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-17\">As we review the administrative and district court decisions, our role under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1982) is to determine whether there was substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the decision of the Secretary. <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 390, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1422, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971); <em>Tillery v. Schweiker, </em>713 F.2d 601, 603 (10th Cir. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-18\">A claimant has the burden of proving his disability by establishing a mental or physical impairment lasting at least 12 months that prevents him from engaging in any substantial gainful activity. <em>Channel v. Heckler, </em>747 F.2d 577, 579 (10th Cir.1984); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423(d)(1)(A), 1382c(a)(3)(A) (1982). Mr. Weakley has met this burden; the Secretary does not dispute that his back injury satisfies Listing 1.05 C.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-19\">The question, then, is whether there is substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s decision to deny Mr. Weakley his benefits because he refused to submit to prescribed surgery. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-1530 (1985). We have explained the test to be applied in determining whether such a refusal can be the basis for denying benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Courts reviewing whether a claimant\u2019s failure to undertake treatment will preclude the recovery of disability benefits have considered four elements, each of which must be supported by substantial evidence: (1) the treatment at issue should be expected to restore the claimant\u2019s ability to work; (2) the treatment must have been <em>prescribed; </em>(3) the treatment must have been refused; (4) the refusal must have been without justifiable excuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><em>Teter v. Heckler, </em>775 F.2d 1104, 1107 (10th Cir.1985) (citations omitted); <em>see also Jones v. Heckler, </em>702 F.2d 950, 953 (11th Cir. 1983). Once the claimant demonstrates that he is impaired, the government has the burden of demonstrating each of the four elements. <em>Cf. Hephner v. Mathews, </em>574 F.2d 359, 362 (6th Cir.1978) (once claimant makes prima facie claim of disability, then the Secretary has the burden to show the availability of work that claimant can perform).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The Secretary did not present substantial evidence that the rejected back surgery was expected to restore Mr. Weakley\u2019s ability to work. Indeed, doctors informed the AU that \u201cthere was a good possibility [that Mr. Weakley] would not have improvement with the recommended surgery\u201d and that \u201cimprovement may or may not occur with that treatment.\u201d Record, vol. 2, at 19. Testimony by only one physician arguably lends support to the Secretary\u2019s position. This doctor stated: \u201cThe patient was therefore found to be temporarily totally disabled. The problem is correctable by surgery. Following the surgery and the postoperative recuperation period, he would still have a residual of disability of a permanent nature estimated to be 15% to the body as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92. Thus, the only statement indicating that Mr. Weakley\u2019s back problems \u201cwere correctable\u201d was followed by a statement that Mr. Weakley would have a continuing disability that might or might not prevent him from returning to work. Therefore, the Secretary did not meet her burden and cannot use 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1530 (1985) as a basis for denying Mr. Weakley his benefits. Given this determination, we need not consider whether the surgery was properly prescribed, actually refused, or rejected unreasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Because the ALJ found that Mr. Weak-ley\u2019s back impairment met Listing 1.05 C, we order the Secretary to award Mr. Weak-ley disability benefits, including the benefits that have wrongly been denied him since January 26, 1984 (the date of the initial denial). If in the future the Secretary feels that she can produce evidence that Mr. Weakley is not disabled, she can initiate proceedings to demonstrate this. <em>See generally </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1588-.1599 (1985) (regulations for terminating disability benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
