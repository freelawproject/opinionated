We agree with the NLRB\u2019s conclusion that the integration sentence of the 1982 collective bargaining agreement eliminated the Christmas bonus as a term or condition of employment. Because the union, for that reason, had no right to bargain over the Christmas bonus when the company announced the discontinuation of the bonus, we affirm the Board\u2019s order dismissing the union\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Approximately forty years ago, Columbus began paying its employees an annual Christmas bonus. The bonus has never been the subject of a collective bargaining agreement between the company and the union. In mid-1982 the company and IBEW renegotiated their collective bargaining agreement. In a letter dated April 19, 1982, the company\u2019s representative notified IBEW that, upon the expiration of the current contract, Columbus wished to \u201cterminate all other agreements, written or oral, between the parties, whether such agreements be in the form of letters, memoran-da, grievance settlements or in any other form.\u201d Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">At the first renegotiation meeting, Columbus proposed a \u201czipper clause\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">Section 2. It is the intent of the parties that the provisions of this Agreement will supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, expressed or implied, between such parties and shall govern their entire relationship and shall be the sole source of all rights or claims which may be asserted in arbitration hereunder or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">The Union for the life of the Agreement hereby waives any rights to negotiate, or to negotiate or bargain with respect to any matters contained in this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">J.A. at 167. By letter of May 7, 1982, the union sought to clarify the scope of the first sentence, asking the company for \u201ca list and summary of all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, expressed or implied, which the Company believes to have contractual affect [sic] between the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169. The company answered in a letter of May 14, 1982, that it did not have such a list, and that the number of side agreements made by the parties over the years made it \u201cvirtually impossible to draw up an accurate list.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170. Columbus stated that it sought to terminate all existing agreements in order to \u201cwipe the slate clean before the new contract went into effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>During a contract negotiation meeting on May 19, 1982, the IBEW representative stated that he understood the intent of the zipper clause but indicated the union would complain to the NLRB about the company\u2019s refusal to offer a list of the agreements affected. <em>See Columbus &amp; Southern Ohio Electric Co., </em>No. 9-CA-19066 (Sept. 7, 1983), J.A. at 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">IBEW filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Regional Director of the NLRB, claiming that Columbus\u2019 failure to provide the requested list of side agreements constituted a breach of the company\u2019s duty to bargain. J.A. at 191. The Regional Director refused to issue a complaint on the ground that Columbus could not give IBEW information it did not possess. The Regional Director stated in a letter to the union that the employer sought \u201cto clear the table so that all matters were subject to inclusion within one written agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192. The union appealed to the General Counsel of the NLRB. IBEW argued that Columbus\u2019 position with respect to the zipper clause was broad, even including \u201cpast practices\u201d within its scope, and that IBEW was entitled to know \u201cspecifically what the Company want[ed] ... removed\u201d in the new con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>tract. <em>Id. </em>at 195-96. But, on July 29, 1982, the appeal was denied. <em>Id. </em>at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">On August 25,1982, after twenty-six separate bargaining sessions, Columbus and IBEW reached agreement on a new contract. J.A. at 205. The contract did not mention the Christmas bonus but did contain the zipper clause exactly as it had appeared in Columbus\u2019 original proposal. <em>Id. </em>At no time during the. negotiations did either party make express reference in the issue of how the contract would affect the Christmas bonus. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The company announced on November 23, 1982, that it intended to discontinue the Christmas bonus. J.A. at 205. IBEW filed a grievance on November 29, 1982, protesting the elimination of the bonus. When management did not accept the grievance, the union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Regional Director of the NLRB, asserting that Columbus had unilaterally altered the Christmas bonus in violation of its statutory duty to bargain over terms and conditions of employment. <em>Id. </em>at 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Relying on authority that the waiver of statutory rights under the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNLRA\u201d) must be \u201cclear and unmistakable,\u201d <em>see </em>J.A. at 208, the AU held for the union. The AU found that the issue of the Christmas bonus had never arisen during negotiations and that the company had admittedly not contemplated discontinuing the bonus until after the contract was executed. <em>Id. </em>at 210. The zipper clause, he therefore concluded, did not apply to the longstanding \u201cunilateral ]\u201d provision of the Christmas bonus, <em>id., </em>and he recommended that the company be ordered to cease and desist and to make the employees whole for the period during which Columbus was in violation of its duty to bargain. <em>Id. </em>at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The Board, acting through a three-member panel, reversed the AU\u2019s decision. <em>See Columbus &amp; Southern Ohio Electric Co., </em>270 N.L.R.B. 686 (1984). The Board reviewed the \u201ccomplete contract\u201d and found that the agreement addressed \u201can entire spectrum of issues,\u201d including a large number of specific provisions covering wages and compensation. <em>Id. </em>at 687. This fact, coupled with the sweeping language of the zipper clause itself <em>(e.g., </em>\u201csupersede all prior agreements and understandings,\u201d \u201cshall govern the[] [parties\u2019] entire relationship,\u201d \u201csole source of any and all rights or claims which may be asserted in arbitration here or otherwise\u201d), led the Board to conclude that the zipper clause constituted a \u201cclear and unmistakable waiver of the Union\u2019s right to bargain over the elimination of the Christmas bonus.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">Before we address the Board\u2019s holding that the zipper clause constituted an effective waiver of the union\u2019s right to bargain about the termination of the Christmas bonus, some statutory background is in order. Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act guarantees employees the right to \u201cbargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing,\u201d <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157 (1982), and section 8(a)(1) makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer \u201cto interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of [that] right[].\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) (1958). More directly, section 8(a)(5) of the Act makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer \u201cto refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(5) (1982). Section 8(d) of the Act defines this bargaining obligation as requiring the union and employer to \u201cmeet ... and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">In <em>NLRB v. Katz, </em>369 U.S. 736, 82 S.Ct. 1107, 8 L.Ed.2d 230 (1962), the Supreme Court announced that an employer\u2019s \u201cunilateral change\u201d in a subject matter within the scope of section 8(d) amounted to \u201ca violation of \u00a7 8(a)(5), for it is a circumvention of the duty to negotiate which frustrates the objectives of \u00a7 8(a)(5) much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>as does a flat refusal [to bargain].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 743, 82 S.Ct. at 1111 (footnote omitted). <em>Katz </em>dealt with an employer\u2019s unilateral changes in the terms and conditions of employment during an ongoing contract negotiation, <em>see id. </em>at 737, 82 S.Ct. at 1108, but it is clear as well that making unilateral changes in the terms and conditions of employment during the pendency of an existing collective bargaining agreement also violates the duty to bargain. <em>See Office &amp; Professional Employees International Union, Local 425 v. NLRB, </em>419 F.2d 314 (D.C.Cir.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">An employer\u2019s \u201c[p]ast practice\u201d can become \u201cclearly established as a term and condition of employment\u201d subject to the duty to bargain. <em>See </em>419 F.2d at 321. Specifically, a Christmas bonus, if tied to other remuneration and paid regularly over an extended period, becomes an element of wages and, therefore, a term and condition of employment that cannot be altered unilaterally. <em>See </em>5 T. Kheel, <em>Labor Law </em>\u00a7 19.04, at 19-17 to 19-19 &amp; n. 5 (1984); <em>compare NLRB v. Niles-Bement-Pond Co.; </em>199 F.2d 713, 714 (2d Cir.1952) (upholding a Board finding that a Christmas bonus paid \u201cover a substantial period of time and in amount ... based on the respective wages earned by the recipients\u201d were \u201cwages\u201d), <em>with NLRB v. Nello Pistoresi &amp; Son, Inc., </em>500 F.2d 399, 400-01 (9th Cir. 1974) (approving NLRB\u2019s finding that infrequent, sporadic Christmas bonuses unrelated to the size of the employee\u2019s salary were not \u201cwages, hours, or other terms and conditions of employment\u201d). In the case before us, no one disputes that the Christmas bonus, a regular practice going back some forty years, constituted a part of the employees\u2019 wages and could not have been eliminated unilaterally by Columbus prior to the 1982 collective bargaining agreement. The NLRB concluded, however, that the parties, by that agreement, had effected \u201ca clear and unmistakable waiver of the Union\u2019s right to bargain over the elimination of the Christmas bonus.\u201d 270 N.L.R.B. at 687; <em>see Road Sprinkler Fitters Local Union No. 669 v. NLRB, </em>676 F.2d 826, 832 (D.C.Cir.1982) (holding that waiver of statutory rights must be \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d). We do not need to decide the appropriate degree of deference, if any, to give to the NLRB\u2019s interpretation of a contract, for, upon examination of the contract, we find that our interpretation of the agreement is the same as that of the NLRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The Board\u2019s analysis relied upon the sweeping language of the first part of the zipper clause, the integration sentence, and not upon the second part, the waiver sentence. The Board emphasized the great breadth of the integration sentence stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_\">An examination of the contract language reveals that the parties clearly agreed that the provisions of the collective-bargaining agreement will \u201csupersede all prior agreements and understandings\u201d and that the collective-bargaining agreement would govern the parties\u2019 \u201centire relationship\u201d and be the \u201csole source of any and all rights or claims which may be asserted in arbitration hereunder <em>or otherwise.\u2019\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">270 N.L.R.B. at 687. Then, reasoning that the contract covered \u201can entire spectrum of issues,\u201d including many provisions on \u201cwages\u201d and other \u201ctypes of compensation,\u201d the Board concluded that the zipper clause waived the union\u2019s right to bargain over the elimination of the Christmas bonus. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">The Board\u2019s reasoning suggests that the integration sentence of the zipper clause extinguished the practice of giving a Christmas bonus by limiting the union\u2019s rights to compensation to those provisions found within the agreement. Because the adoption of the integration sentence \u201cwipe[d] the slate clean,\u201d the bonus no longer amounted to a term or condition of employment. Thus, by agreeing to the integration sentence, the union clearly and unmistakably lost any further right to bargain over the elimination of the bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>In light of the entire record, we believe that the Board correctly read the integration sentence of the agreement. The language of that sentence is both strong and sweeping, and the bargaining history makes it clear that the scope of its coverage is wide. The opening clause states that the collective bargaining agreement would \u201csupersede all prior agreements or understandings, oral or written, express or implied.\u201d Given the comprehensive provisions on compensation contained within the agreement, this clause serves to set aside all prior elements of compensation and replace them with the explicit compensation provisions contained in the contract. Thus, if the Christmas bonus clearly amounted to an \u201cagreement[] or understanding[ ], oral or written, expressed or implied,\u201d the first clause of the integration sentence set it aside in favor of the comprehensive compensation provisions of the new agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The bargaining history shows that this was precisely the case. After the company announced its intention to include a comprehensive zipper clause in the new agreement, the union asked for \u201ca list and summary of all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, expressed or implied, which the Company believes to have contractual affect [sic] between the parties.\u201d J.A. at 169. The company refused to provide the list requested, but rather sent a letter clarifying the scope of its proposal. That letter stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">[T]o avoid any misunderstanding as to the Company\u2019s intention, our letter ... notified you that we wish to terminate all agreements [when the new collective bargaining agreement takes effect]____ By specifying \u201call\u201d agreements, we feel we have made our notice clear and unambiguous. \u201cA11\u201d means just that \u2014 all. What we have [proposed] ... was to wipe the slate clean before the new contract goes into effect. Of course, both parties are free to make proposals during the present negotiations; and these proposals could, of course, include matters that have been included in a side agreement. Presumably, if the Union wishes to continue an agreement, it knows of the ex1 istence of that agreement, as it would have been a party to it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">J.A. at 170. Thus, the company viewed its proposal as comprehensive and unambiguously expressed that view to the union prior to any agreement on the proposal. Columbus sought by its inclusion of such a provision to \u201cterminate\u201d every preexisting \u201cagreement[ ] or understanding[ ]\u201d between itself and the union and to \u201cwipe the slate clean\u201d by the adoption of a new agreement. We must conclude, therefore, that the integration sentence terminated the bonus if the practice of paying the bonus amounted to an \u201cagreement[] or understanding[ ]\u201d under the company\u2019s proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">The company argues that its proposal did cover \u201cpractices\u201d and that the union understood this to be the case during the negotiations leading up to the adoption of the integration sentence of the zipper clause. Brief for Columbus at 18. The bargaining history bears the company out, for it provides a clear and unmistakable indication that the union understood the bonus to be within the category of \u201cagreements or understandings.\u201d After receiving the letter described in the previous paragraph, IBEW filed a complaint with the Regional Director of the NLRB requesting that the company be required to provide the desired list, but the complaint was dismissed. The union appealed to the NLRB General Counsel, explaining that it sought to find out which \u201cspecific agreements and understandings\u201d were within the proposal and, therefore, wanted the employer to supply \u201ca list of such material ... believed to be of contractual effect.\u201d J.A. at 195. In that same notice of appeal, the union described in great detail what it understood that \u201cmaterial\u201d to be, and what Columbus, therefore, proposed to \u201cterminate.\u201d Specifically, IBEW stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\"><em>The Employer\u2019s position is broad. It covers past practices, </em>arbitrators\u2019 awards as to the interpretation and scope of contract language, grievance settlement's] which may bear relevance to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>contract language, oral agreements] which over the course of years have been perpetuated into practices, and written understanding^] which also over the course of years have been perpetuated into practices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">J.A. at 195-96 (emphasis added). The General Counsel rejected the appeal, but the union still accepted the company\u2019s proposed integration sentence, notwithstanding the concededly broad scope of intended coverage. Thus, because the union unambiguously equated \u201cpast practices\u201d with \u201cagreements and understandings\u201d and understood the company\u2019s proposal, therefore, to sweep in all such practices, IBEW, by agreeing to the company\u2019s proposal, accepted the \u201ctermination]\u201d of all such practices, among which the Christmas bonus must plainly be counted.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Other parts of the integration sentence independently require the conclusion that the practice of giving a Christmas bonus was terminated. Following the initial clause just analyzed, the integration sentence continues by asserting that the collective bargaining agreement \u201cshall govern [the parties\u2019] entire relationship.\u201d This evinces a clear intent to do away with any element of that relationship not found within the four corners of the agreement, and, in the process, eliminates the Christmas bonus, which is nowhere to be found within that agreement. Finally, leaving no doubt about the intention to do away with anything not found within the new agreement, the parties included a clause stating that the contract was to be \u201cthe sole source of any and all rights or claims which may be asserted in arbitration ... or otherwise.\u201d By their plain terms, therefore, each of the three clauses of the integration sentence is sufficiently broad and comprehensive to have extinguished any right the union had to a Christmas bonus and terminated that bonus. The matter could not have been plainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The Board, therefore, correctly determined that the employer did not commit an unfair labor practice when the company announced on November 23, 1982, almost three months after the adoption of the new collective bargaining agreement, that the Christmas bonus was being discontinued, even though Columbus afforded the union no prior opportunity to bargain at that time. The Board\u2019s analysis might have begun and ended with the observation that \u201c[i]t is the unilateral <em>change </em>in a matter which is a mandatory subject of bargaining that constitutes a violation of the Act,\u201d <em>Alfred M. Lewis, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>587 F.2d 403, 411 (9th Cir.1978) (emphasis added), and that, because the collective bargaining agreement terminated the practice of giving a Christmas bonus, announcing the discontinuation of that bonus did not amount to a change in any such matter. The company merely implemented the change over which it and the union had bargained and to which they agreed in the adoption of the collective bargaining agreement. The Board\u2019s opinion, however, speaks of a \u201cwaiver\u201d which might make it appear that it rested upon the second sentence of the zipper clause rather than, as we do, the first sentence. We think, however, that this was merely a question of loose usage rather than a different rationale. For that reason, no problem is. created by <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 87, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943) (\u201cThe grounds upon which an administrative order must be judged are those upon which the record discloses that its action was based.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">The NLRB said that the \u201czipper clause agreed to by the parties constituted a clear and unmistakable waiver of the Union\u2019s right to bargain over the elimination of the Christmas bonus.\u201d 270 N.L.R.B. at 687. But the Board\u2019s opinion cannot be taken to rely in any way upon the second sentence of the zipper clause, that which \u201cwaives any rights to request to negotiate, or to negotiate or to bargain with respect to any matters contained in the Agreement.\u201d Indeed, that waiver, being confined to matters in the agreement, could not apply to the Christmas bonus since the bonus was not in the agreement. The Board\u2019s analysis rests entirely on the first, or integration, sentence, and entirely disregards the second, or waiver, sentence. Thus, the Board\u2019s analysis cannot be read as depending upon the union\u2019s waiving its statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>rights per se, but clearly depends instead upon the union\u2019s waiving its right to bargain by agreeing to forgo a necessary predicate to the exercise of that right. Because the effect of this is the same as the waiver of statutory rights, the agreement must meet the statutory standard that waiver be \u201cclear and unmistakable.\u201d <em>Road Sprinkler, </em>672 F.2d at 832. And it does. The. union explicitly and unmistakably agreed to eliminate the Christmas bonus as a term or condition of employment when it accepted the integration sentence of the zipper clause and, therefore, lost any bargaining rights regarding its elimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">That the company, by its own admission, did not decide to terminate the bonus until after the execution of the collective bargaining agreement does not alter the analysis. Columbus\u2019 express purpose was to rid itself of all obligations outside the contract, including obligations it could not identify or had not thought about. The zipper clause\u2019s integration sentence accomplished that. The slate being wiped clean, the company had an option. It could have paid a bonus and, perhaps, put itself on the road to reestablishing the bonus as a term or condition of employment, or it could not pay the bonus. It chose the latter course.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Accordingly, the order of the NLRB is</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
