We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-24\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b896-25\">The facts of this case and the history of the proceedings below are summarized in our opinion in <em>Doe v. Maker, </em>793 F.2d 1470 (9th Cir.1986). Only a few additional facts need be stated in order to provide the context of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-26\">Counsel for Doe and Smith moved for attorney\u2019s fees on March 5, 1984. The district court denied the motion on April 5, 1984, <em>see </em>Excerpts of Record (E.R.) item 300, at 2, but stated that it would entertain a motion for reconsideration should any cases then pending before the Supreme Court be decided in such a way as to render reconsideration appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 3. Doe and Smith did not timely file an appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>from this order. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Smith v. Robinson, </em>468 U.S. 992, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984), however, Doe and Smith moved for reconsideration. After examining the implications of <em>Smith, </em>the court denied the motion. <em>See </em>E.R. item 354. Doe and Smith take this appeal from that denial, not the original denial of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">The Education of the Handicapped Act, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401-1461 (as amended by the Education for All Handicapped Children act of 1975 (EAHCA)) \u2014 the primary source of the rights asserted by Doe and Smith\u2014 does not provide for awards of attorney\u2019s fees in actions brought to enforce its detailed substantive and procedural requirements. <em>See Smith v. Robinson, </em>468 U.S. 992, 1020-21, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 3472, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984). The plaintiffs base their claim for fees, instead, on section 505 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (section 1988). The claim under section 505 derives from the defendants\u2019 alleged violations of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, whereas the invocation of section 1988 is premised on alleged violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (section 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">A. <em>Section 505</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">For the reasons stated in part III.A of our opinion in <em>Doe v. Maher, </em>793 F.2d at 1470, none of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are cognizable under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Consequently, Doe and Smith are not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under section 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">B. <em>Section 1988</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">1. <em>Standard of review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">A district court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 is reviewable for abuse of discretion. <em>See Hamner v. Rios, </em>769 F.2d 1404, 1406 (9th Cir. 1985). The same standard applies to its denial of a motion for reconsideration. Nonetheless, \u201cany elements of legal analysis and statutory interpretation which figure in the district court\u2019s decision are reviewable <em>de novo.\u201d Hall v. Bolger, </em>768 F.2d 1148, 1150 (9th Cir. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-15\">2. <em>The merits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-16\">a. <em>Smith v. Robinson</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-17\">Section 1988 provides in pertinent part that \u201c[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of section[ ] ... 1983 ... of this title ... the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. In the instant case, the relief actually granted Doe and Smith by the district court was based only on the EAHCA. <em>See </em>E.R. item 354, at 2-3. The plaintiffs argue, however, that because they raised substantial \u2014 though unaddressed \u2014 claims under section 1983, they are entitled to attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the rule in <em>Maher v. Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 130-31, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 2575, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-18\">The Supreme Court addressed a similar situation in <em>Smith v. Robinson, </em>468 U.S. 992, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984). The Court held in <em>Smith </em>that the EAHCA\u2019s comprehensiveness indicated Congress\u2019s intent to bar litigants from circumventing the Act\u2019s remedial scheme \u2014 and thus obtaining attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 by resort to the more general provisions of section 1983. <em>See id. </em>at 1015-16, 104 S.Ct. at 3470-71. However, the section 1983 claim rejected by the Court in <em>Smith </em>was a <em>substantive equal protection claim </em>to a free appropriate public education. The Court left open the question whether a litigant could bring \u201can <em>independent due process challenge </em>to state procedures\u201d without interfering with the EAHCA\u2019s purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 1014 n. 17, 104 S.Ct. at 3470 n. 17 (emphasis added). It observed that such a challenge would not be inconsistent with the EAHCA, and it found \u201cno indication that agencies should be exempt from a fee award where plaintiffs have had to resort to judicial relief to force the agencies to provide them the process <em>they were constitutionally due.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>As this language indicates, in referring to an <em>independent </em>due process challenge, the Court meant a challenge based on <em>constitutional, </em>not merely <em>statutory, </em>rights. <em>See, e.g., Bonar v. Ambach, </em>771 F.2d 14, 18 (2d Cir. 1985); <em>Rose v. Nebraska, </em>748 F.2d 1258, 1263 (8th Cir. 1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 61, 88 L.Ed.2d 50 (1985); <em>Austin v. Brown Local School District, </em>746 F.2d 1161, 1164 (6th Cir. 1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 2114, 85 L.Ed.2d 479 (1985). Several courts interpreting <em>Smith </em>\u2014 notably the Eleventh Circuit in <em>Manecke v. School Board, </em>762 F.2d 912, 917-21 (11th Cir. 1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 809, 88 L.Ed.2d 784 (1986) \u2014 have blurred this distinction. We, however, regard it as crucial.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">b. <em>Statutorily based \u00a7 1983 claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">The Court in <em>Smith </em>did not specifically pass on the validity of a procedural claim based upon the \u201cand laws\u201d provision of section 1983, <em>see </em>468 U.S. at 1004-05, 104 S.Ct. at 3465. The plaintiffs contend that such a claim is appropriate here. The EAHCA, they argue, provides mechanisms for reviewing final substantive administrative determinations but not for enforcing the Act\u2019s procedural guarantees. They conclude that, under these circumstances, their invocation of section 1983 to secure injunctive relief is the only available means of vindicating their federal rights, and therefore does not conflict with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Association, </em>453 U.S. 1, 101 S.Ct. 2615, 69 L.Ed.2d 435 (1981), that \u201c[w]hen the remedial devices provided in a particular Act are sufficiently comprehensive, they may suffice to demonstrate congressional intent to preclude the remedy of suits under \u00a7 1983,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 20, 101 S.Ct. at 2626.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">We disagree with the plaintiffs\u2019 initial premise. We find no such \u201cgap\u201d in the EAHCA. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e)(2) empowers district courts to \u201cgrant such relief as ... is appropriate\u201d for violations of the Act. This authorization encompasses the authority \u201cto grant injunctive relief, either after an unsuccessful and allegedly unfair administrative proceeding, or prior to exhaustion of the state remedies if pursuing those remedies would be futile or inadequate,\u201d <em>Smith, </em>468 U.S. at 1014 n. 17, 104 S.Ct. at 3470-71 (noting the argument and citing cases). <em>See, e.g., Wilson v. Marana Unified School District No. 6, </em>735 F.2d 1178, 1181 (9th Cir. 1984); <em>Monahan v. Nebraska, </em>645 F.2d 592, 597 (8th Cir. 1981). There is no clearer example of futility than a case such as this. The local agency violated the Act\u2019s basic procedural dictates. Thus, Doe and Smith were entitled to injunctive relief directly under the EAHCA. The availability of this avenue of relief barred them from seeking similar relief\u2014 along with the added bonus of attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 under the \u201cand laws\u201d provision of section 1983. <em>See Sea Clammers, </em>453 U.S. at 20-21, 101 S.Ct. at 2626-27; <em>Department of Education v. Katherine D., </em>727 F.2d 809, 819-20 (9th Cir. 1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 2360, 86 L.Ed.2d 260 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">c. <em>Constitutionally based \u00a7 1983 claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-16\">Doe and Smith\u2019s alleged constitutional claims fare no better. As the Supreme Court stressed in <em>Smith, </em>\u201cplaintiffs may not rely simply on the fact that substantial fee-generating claims were made during the course of the litigation. Closer examination of the nature of those claims and the relationship between those claims and petitioners\u2019 ultimate success is required.\u201d 468 U.S. at 1007,104 S.Ct. at 3467. The crucial question, then, is whether the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims were both substantial and \u201creasonably related to [their] ultimate success.\u201d <em>Id., </em>468 U.S. at 1007, 104 S.Ct. at 3467.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-17\">The district court determined that they were not. The court stated that its orders \u201cwere premised on noncompliance with the EAHCA\u201d and that \u201c[n]either \u00a7 504 nor \u00a7 1983 provided any independent basis of relief.\u201d E.R. item 354, at 2-3. This conclusion is supported by the record. The plaintiffs grounded their due process claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>only on the defendants\u2019 violations of the EAHCA and section 504. <em>See </em>E.R. item 43, at 14 (Doe\u2019s 10th cause of action); <em>id. </em>item 76, at 19 (Smith\u2019s 14th and 15th causes of action). We decline their invitation to equate violations of statutorily established procedural rights with violations of the Constitution. If every failure to abide by EAHCA procedures were to raise constitutional due process problems, nearly all EAHCA cases would be converted into constitutional disputes. Such a revolutionary outcome is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">We do not hold that acts in violation of the EAHCA can never amount to constitutional due process violations \u2014 quite the contrary. <em>See, e.g., Rose v. Nebraska, </em>748 F.2d 1258, 1263-64 (8th Cir. 1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 106 S.Ct. 61, 88 L.Ed.2d 50 (1985) (holding that plaintiff can maintain an independent constitutional challenge based on alleged partiality of state due process hearing). In the instant case, however, the plaintiffs\u2019 EAHCA-related due process claims simply lacked the <em>independent </em>constitutional basis necessary for a valid cause of action under section 1983. <em>See Smith, </em>468 U.S. at 1014-15 &amp; n. 17, 104 S.Ct. at 3470 &amp; n. 17; <em>Bonar v. Ambach, </em>771 F.2d 14, 17-20 (2d Cir.1985); <em>Austin v. Brown Local School District, </em>746 F.2d 1161, 1164-66 (6th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 2114, 85 L.Ed.2d 479 (1985). As a consequence, they are not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b899-11\">SCHROEDER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AYR\">dissenting,</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">I respectfully dissent. The majority decides that there was no independent due process challenge within the meaning of <em>Smith v. Robinson, </em>468 U.S. 992, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984). In my view it conflicts with the decision of the Eleventh Circuit in <em>Manecke v. School Board of Pinellas County, </em>762 F.2d 912 (11th Cir.1985). The Eleventh Circuit there held that where a party is \u201cdenied due process by effectively being denied access to \u2018the carefully tailored administrative and judicial mechanism\u2019 found in the EHA, ... that party may seek relief under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 918 (quoting <em>Smith v. Robinson, </em>468 U.S. at 1008-09, 104 S.Ct. at 3468). Plaintiffs have been successful in this case on a similar claim that the state denied them the procedural mechanism of the EAHCA when it suspended them without determining whether their conduct was handicap related. I would not create a conflict in this regard and would hold that attorneys\u2019 fees are awardable under section 1988.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
