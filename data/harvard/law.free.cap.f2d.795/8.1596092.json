Since superintendents would be actively engaged in their duties at the premises during the same business hours when the SEA would post the notice, and, in most instances, are actual residents of the building, the likelihood of the janitor or superintendent seeing a notice affixed to the front door ... is very great.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Appellees\u2019 Petition for Rehearing at 2. Ap-pellees also bring to our attention, for the first time, provisions of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, Section D26-22.03 (Williams Press 1977, vol. 4 at 474 &amp; Supp. 1985-1986 at 166), requiring owners of a multiple dwelling with nine or more units to provide full-time janitorial services.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">We believe appellees\u2019 argument to be without merit. The magistrate specifically found that \u201cin New York City, paper notices affixed to [multiple dwellings] have a very short life span, regardless of whether they are affixed out of the reach of small children.\u201d The presence of a janitor or superintendent somewhere in the building, therefore, only marginally improves the chances that a landlord will receive the \u201cnailed\u201d summons. Moreover, the newly-cited ordinance requires only that a janitor live in the same block, albeit the owners must maintain in each building a sign with the janitor\u2019s name, address and telephone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">Appellees\u2019 argument might carry weight had the provisions for nail and mail service provided, as they might easily have done, that the \u201cnailed\u201d summons be given directly to the superintendent or the janitor in a multiple dwelling. It contained no such requirement, however. Instead, it left it to chance that such a person would happen upon the \u201cnailed\u201d summons during its \u201cvery short life span.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">The petition for rehearing is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
