Jurisdiction before the district court was based on the FTCA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2671-80 (1982). Appellate jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (1982). The district court determined that the government could be held liable for the asbestos sales under the FTCA. Because we conclude that the discretionary function exception protects the government\u2019s conduct, we will reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-17\">These consolidated cases were originally filed by approximately eighty present or former employees of the Manville, New Jersey, plant of the Johns-Manville Corporation. Plaintiffs alleged that they or their decedents had suffered injuries as a result of exposure to asbestos products supplied by defendants, including defendants Bell Asbestos Mines, Ltd. and Cassiar Mining Corporation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Certain defendants filed cross-claims and third-party claims against the United States for indemnity and contribution on the grounds that the government also had supplied asbestos to the Johns-Manville plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-18\">In December 1982, the government moved for dismissal of the third-party claims. The government argued that the General Service Administration\u2019s failure to place warnings on the asbestos was conduct protected from tort liability under the FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception. The magistrate who heard the motion concluded that the exception did not apply, and recommended that the district court deny the government\u2019s motion entirely. In July 1984, the district court determined that the facts of the case would not support the asbestos companies\u2019 claims for indemnification, and accordingly granted the government\u2019s motion with regard to that theory. The court agreed with the magistrate\u2019s report that the exception was inapplicable, however, and denied the government\u2019s motion to dismiss the third-party claims for contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-19\">In reaching its decision, the court noted that the record failed to reveal specific congressional directions to sell the asbestos without warnings. The court also found that the government did not affirmatively make a policy decision concerning warning labels. From these findings, the court reasoned that the decision not to warn was not the type of conduct Congress intended to protect from tort claims by the discretionary function exception, because \u201cto the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>tent an exercise of discretion entered the decision to warn, it was not that of a governmental policy maker, but merely that of a commercial supplier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">In January 1985, the government moved for reconsideration of its motion in the wake of our decision in <em>General Public Utilities Corp. v. United States, </em>745 F.2d 239 (3d Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 1227, 84 L.Ed.2d 365 (1985), the first Third Circuit case interpreting the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of the discretionary function exception in <em>United States v. S.A. Empresa de Viacao Aerea Rio Grandense, </em>467 U.S. 797, 104 S.Ct. 2755, 81 L.Ed.2d 660 (1984) <em>(\u201cVarig Airlines?\u2019). </em>The court denied the motion for reconsideration, but granted the government\u2019s alternative motion for certification as an interlocutory order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). We granted the government\u2019s motion for certification on August 7, 1985.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">The facts in this case are undisputed. Between 1966 and 1975, the United States supplied surplus asbestos to the Manville facility from government strategic material stockpiles. The General Services Administration (\u201cGSA\u201d) managed the disposal program pursuant to the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (\u201cStock Piling Act\u201d), 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 98-98h-l (1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 98b(e) of the Stock Piling Act governs the disposal of surplus strategic materials, and provides, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">\u00a7 98b. Purchase, storage, refinement, rotation, and disposal of materials</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACt\">The Administrator of General Services shall\u2014 (e) dispose of any materials held pursuant to this subchapter which are no longer needed because of any revised determination made pursuant to section 98a of this title, as hereinafter provided. No such disposition shall be made until six months after publication in the Federal Register and transmission of a notice of the proposed disposition to Congress____ Such notice shall state the reasons for such revised determination [of the necessary amount of strategic materials], the amounts of the materials proposed to be released, the plan of disposition proposed to be followed, and the date upon which the material is to become available for sale or transfer. <em>The plan and date of disposition shall be fixed with due regard to the protection of the United States against avoidable loss on the sale or transfer of material to be released </em>and the protection of producers, processors, and consumers against avoidable disruption of their usual markets ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-17\">50 U.S.C. \u00a7 98b(e) (1976) (emphasis added). Between 1966 and 1975, Congress passed at least four laws authorizing the GSA to sell stock-piled asbestos. Each reiterated the Act\u2019s direction to minimize \u201cavoidable loss.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-18\">The record reveals that GSA sold the asbestos in the following manner. GSA solicited invitations for bids for the asbestos \u201cas is\u201d in the original packaging. The bidders then would take delivery of the asbestos at the government\u2019s storage location. The contracts provided that the bidders would furnish the shipping.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>government argued before the district court that the GSA adopted this method of sale in an effort to minimize the costs of the sale to the government, as GSA believed the Stock Piling Act required. In support of this contention, the government submitted an affidavit of John G. Harlan, Jr., who supervised the strategic materials disposal program from 1958 to 1966 as the Deputy Commissioner of the Defense Materials Service, and from 1966 to 1969 as the Commissioner of the Defense Materials Service.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Harlan\u2019s affidavit, portions of which are set out in the margin, detailed the manner in which an asbestos sale would proceed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Our standard of review over the district court\u2019s order is plenary. Although this case involves the denial of the government\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the appropriate standard is the same as that for a motion of summary judgment because the court below considered documents outside the pleadings themselves in ruling on the motion. <em>See Bernitsky v. United States, </em>620 F.2d 948, 950 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 870, 101 S.Ct. 208, 66 L.Ed.2d 90 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-15\">The FTCA effects a waiver of the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity by permitting suits for compensatory damages for personal injury resulting from the conduct of a government employee acting within the scope of his employment. This waiver is subject to a number of exceptions, however. Pertinent to the instant appeal is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception, which provides that the FTCA does not apply to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">any claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the Government, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute or regulation, whether or not such a statute or regulation be valid, or based upon the exercise or performance of a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved was abused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">In its most recent discussion of the exception, the Supreme Court admonished courts to look to two factors in determining whether the exception applies: (i) whether the government employee\u2019s acts are the type of conduct that Congress intended to shield from tort liability through the exception; and (ii) if the challenged conduct involves the government acting in its capacity as a regulator of individual conduct, the exception presumptively applies. <em>See Varig Airlines, </em>467 U.S. at 813-14, 104 S.Ct. at 2765; <em>Merklin v. United States, </em>788 F.2d 172, 174 (3d Cir.1986). <em>See generally General Public Utilities Corp., </em>745 F.2d at 242-46. The <em>Varig Airlines </em>Court emphasized that Congress enacted the exception \u201cto prevent judicial \u2018second-guessing\u2019 of legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social, economic, and political policy through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d 467 U.S. at 814, 104 S.Ct. at 2765. The second factor is not involved here. The issue, therefore, is whether the GSA\u2019s decision not to label the surplus asbestos with warnings prior to sale is the type of conduct that Congress sought to shield from judical review.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">We find the Supreme Court\u2019s first decision concerning the discretionary function exception, <em>Dalehite v. United States, </em>346 U.S. 15, 73 S.Ct. 956, 97 L.Ed. 1427 (1953), particularly helpful in making this determination. Plaintiffs <em>in Dalehite </em>brought suit against the United States seeking damages for injuries sustained when two ships loaded with fertilizer exploded. The government had engaged the ships pursuant to a federal assistance program to transport the fertilizer to countries whose economies had been damaged by World War II. The fertilizer contained ammonium nitrate, an oxidizing agent used in the production of explosives; indeed, some of the fertilizer had been produced by recently-converted ordnance plants. Plaintiffs alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the government had been negligent in failing to include labels on the fertilizer packages warning of their explosive propensities.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">In holding that the discretionary function exception barred the action, the Supreme Court examined the FTCA\u2019s legislative history. Writing for the Court, Justice Reed observed that Congress added the exception to ensure that suits brought against the United States would be restricted to the \u201cordinary common law torts ... [such as] \u2018negligence in the operation of vehicles.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dalehite, </em>346 U.S. at 28, 73 S.Ct. at 964. In particular, Congress intended the exception to protect the government from suits stemming from \u201can authorized activity, such as a flood-control or irrigation project.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30, 73 S.Ct. at 965. The exception shields from tort liability \u201cthe discretion of the executive or the administrator to act according to one\u2019s judgment of the best course____ It also includes determinations made by executives or administrators in establishing plans, specifications or schedules of operations. Where there is room for policy judgment and decision there is discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34-36, 73 S.Ct. at 967-68 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">We are convinced that the exception applies in the instant case. Congress did not specify in the Stock Piling Act what factors should be considered in minimizing \u201cavoid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>able costs\u201d to the government, but instead entrusted the management of the asbestos disposals to the GSA\u2019s discretion. The GSA\u2019s choice of the particular terms of sale is similar to the \u201chow and when\u201d decision to flood land made by an administrator in a federal water project. <em>See Dalehite, </em>346 U.S. at 36, nn. 31-32, 73 S.Ct. at 965-66 nn. 31-32. We believe that the GSA\u2019s choice of the \u201cas is\u201d term plainly evidences a decision in which there was room for discretion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The failure to label stock-piled strategic materials disposed of pursuant to a Congressional mandate to avoid market disturbances and to maximize the government\u2019s revenues from the sales is not the type of common law tort for which Congress waived sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Obviously, the failure to label was part and parcel of the GSA\u2019s decision to sell \u201cas is,\u201d and therefore is shielded from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Our conclusion today is in line with two of the three published decisions involving the government\u2019s asbestos disposal program. <em>See In re All Maine Asbestos Litigation, </em>581 F.Supp. 963 (D.Me.1984) (discretionary function exception applies); <em>Stewart v. United States, </em>486 F.Supp. 178 (C.D.Ill.1980) (same); <em>but see Barlieb v. Turner &amp; Newall Ltd., </em>588 F.Supp. 473 (E.D.Pa.1980).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court below, however, concluded that the exception did not apply because the government failed to produce evidence showing that the GSA considered the health risks of asbestos in formulating its plan of sale. According to the district court, the lack of such evidence and the minimal cost of warning labels indicated that the decision not to warn was not a decision \u201cinvolving considerations of public policy, calling for a balance of such factors as cost of government programs against the potential benefit,\u201d <em>quoting Griffin v. United States, </em>500 F.2d 1059, 1064 (3d Cir.1974), and therefore was not covered by the exception. Under the district court\u2019s view of the exception, only those component judgments in the asbestos disposal program that balance social, political, or economic factors are entitled to protection from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">This view is essentially the position ap-pellees Bell and Cassiar urge us to adopt. According to appellees, the proper analysis requires isolating the decision to warn from the context of the strategic materials disposal program. Once identified, the component decision should be evaluated to determine if the government actually balanced policy considerations in making the decision. We disagree. The position that agency decisions can be broken down into component parts is fundamentally at odds with the Court\u2019s teaching in <em>Dalehite </em>that the exception bars suits challenging administrators\u2019 decisions initiating programs and establishing plans in accordance with official directions. <em>Dalehite, </em>346 U.S. at 36, 73 S.Ct. at 968. The test is not whether the government actually considered each possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>ble alternative in the universe of options, but whether the conduct was of the type associated with the exercise of official discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Moreover, we recently warned that our <em>Griffin </em>opinion must be read cautiously in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Varig Airlines </em>decision. <em>See General Public Utilities Corp., </em>745 F.2d at 246 &amp; n. 8.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Varig Airlines </em>stressed Congress\u2019s intention that the discretionary function exception prevent judicial second guessing of agency conduct in performance of a statutory mandate. The district court\u2019s decision to compartmentalize the decisional components of the GSA\u2019s asbestos disposal program is patently inconsistent with this direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">We find further support for our holding when we compare the appellees\u2019 position with the dissent\u2019s in <em>Dalehite. </em>In his dissent, Justice Jackson argued that the discretionary function exception applies to policy decisions made at the highest levels of a federal program. Once these \u201chigh altitude\u201d policy decisions were made, however, Justice Jackson contended that the individual decisions necessary for the implementation of an official program should be tested under the tort law, for when \u201c[t]he Government [acts] as landowner, as manufacturer, as shipper, as warehouseman ... there is no good reason ... to immunize the Government or its officers from responsibility for their acts____\u201d <em>Dalehite, </em>346 U.S. at 60, 73 S.Ct. at 980. Despite his eloquent dissent, the <em>Dalehite </em>Court rejected Justice Jackson's view that the exception applied only to \u201cgovernmental\u201d activities. Appellees here attempt to hold the government liable under the theory that when the government supplies a commodity, it should be liable as any other commercial supplier would be in negligently failing to warn of the commodity\u2019s risks. That route is foreclosed by <em>Dalehite, </em>however, because the government\u2019s conduct resulted from the implementation of the mandate to minimize costs to the government in the sale, a mandate that left the terms of sale to the GSA\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">To summarize, we hold that the district court erred by misconstruing the discretionary function exception. Accordingly, we will remand the case with directions to grant the government\u2019s motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b412-20\">.

In addition, the United States incurred substantial storage costs during the time that the asbestos was in national stockpile. Therefore, we at GSA felt it extremely important to fix the terms of dispositions to avoid further avoidable loss____</p>\n<p id=\"b414-17\">The [contracts for sale] provided that the materials were sold \"as is\u201d to be delivered \"freight on board\" carrier\u2019s conveyance at the storage location, and expressly disclaimed any express or implied warranty____</p>\n<p id=\"b414-18\">The asbestos offered for sale had usually been stockpiled for years. To test, warranty, repackage, or relabel such materials at the time of disposal or to incur avoidable handling or transportation expenses would have resulted in avoidable cost to the government. Moreover, no funds were allocated or authorized for repackaging or labeling. Therefore, the invitation for bids prepared at my direction and which I approved required that the asbestos be sold in the original packaging, with the same markings and in the same condition as it was acquired and stored.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-19\">With respect to asbestos, as with the other stockpiled commodities, we solicited bids only from knowledgeable industry members who regularly used and handled substantial quantities of the materials and who had an opportunity to inspect the materials where they were stored. We assumed these buyers would be better qualified than our own storage personnel to properly transport, unpack-age, handle and use the material in their manufacturing processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-20\">App. 66-70 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b414-21\">. The discretionary function exception operates as a bar to jurisdiction. <em>See Gibson v. United States, </em>457 F.2d 1391, 1392, n. 1 (3d Cir.1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b415-9\">. This case presents the question of the government\u2019s duty as a supplier of a dangerous chattel, one of the issues in our recent opinion in <em>Merk-lin v. United States, </em>788 F.2d 172 (3d Cir.1986). The government in <em>Merklin, </em>however, only asserted its immunity from suit as a regulator of the radioactive materials processing plant, and did not argue that the exception applied to the government\u2019s conduct in supplying radioactive materials to the plant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b416-5\">. The fact that the plan implemented may, in hindsight, seem ill-advised, imprudent, or lacking in a rational policy basis \u201cin no way changes the character of the function under scrutiny\"; rather the lack of a rational or careful plan or even the lack of policy goes to the actor\u2019s abuse of discretion. <em>General Public Utilities Corp., </em>745 F.2d at 245; <em>see Shuman v. United States, </em>765 F.2d 283, 290 (1st Cir.1985) (government\u2019s lack of care in developing policy, or in lacking any policy on an issue, is protected by the discretionary function exception).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b416-6\">. Our opinion does not imply that plaintiffs are without a judicial remedy when an agency designs and implements programs pursuant to Congressional direction. In many instances, the government\u2019s conduct will be reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act either as \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion\u201d or \"in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority or limitations.\" <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 706(2)(A), 706(2)(C) (1982); Rogers, <em>A Fresh Look at Agency \u201cDiscretion\u201d, </em>57 Tul.L.Rev. 776, 808-22 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b416-10\">. The government\u2019s liability as a seller of chattels pursuant to a surplus property disposal program has been raised in the postal-jeep sales litigation, where purchasers of the jeeps allege that the government negligently omitted warnings concerning the jeeps\u2019 handling characteristics. The one circuit court to consider this question held that the discretionary function exception applied. <em>See Ford v. American Motors Corp., </em>770 F.2d 465 (5th Cir.1985); <em>see also Shirey v. United States, </em>582 F.Supp. 1251 (D.S.C.1984). <em>But see Galanos v. United States, </em>608 F.Supp. 360 (E.D.Mich.1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b417-7\">. We need not decide here whether or not <em>Griffin </em>has survived <em>Varig Airlines. </em>We find that <em>Griffin </em>differs from the case before us in that there we were faced with the performance of a specific scientific evaluation in the execution of a regulation. The regulation, and not the scientific evaluation, involved policy determinations; for that reason, the court held that the scientific evaluation was not protected by the discretionary function exception. In the present appeal, however, we are faced with the formulation of a means to carry out a congressional directive. That formulation did involve policy determinations and it is, therefore, shielded by the discretionary function exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b417-8\">. Cassiar argues that the <em>Dalehite </em>Court held that there was no duty to warn because the applicable ICC regulations did not provide for (and may have prohibited) such warnings. According to appellee, the fact that the government followed the ICC regulations was the sole reason that the discretionary function exception shielded the decision not to warn. We disagree with this reading of <em>Dalehite. </em>The Court held that the decision not to warn was within the Army's discretion, a conclusion <em>supported </em>by (but not dependent on) \u201cthe fact that the ICC\u2019s regulations, for instance, could not be attacked by claimants under the [FTCA] by virtue of the first phrase of \u00a7 2680(a).\u201d <em>Dalehite, </em>346 U.S. at 42, 73 S.Ct. at 971.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b417-15\">. Bell argues that we should remand for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of the GSA\u2019s interpretation of the Stock Piling Act\u2019s direction to minimize \"avoidable cost.\" We do not believe that further development of the record is warranted. It is the challenged conduct, not the subjective interpretation of the authority to engage in such conduct, that courts examine to determine whether the exception applies. Commissioner Harlan\u2019s affidavit adequately describes the discretion Congress gave GSA to design and manage the asbestos disposal program. The affidavit is unrebutted, despite the fact that appellees have had the opportunity to develop evidence contradicting Harlan\u2019s affidavit since December 1982.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
