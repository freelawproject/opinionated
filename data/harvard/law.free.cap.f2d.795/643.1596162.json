SWYGERT, Senior Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b752-5\">FAGG, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The Secretary of the Department of Health &amp; Human Services appeals the district court\u2019s decision enjoining the Secretary\u2019s application of federal eligibility requirements to Missouri\u2019s Medicaid plan. The district court held that the implementation of the federal standards would establish eligibility requirements more restrictive than those the state had in effect on January 1, 1972, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(f) (commonly referred to as \u00a7 209(b)). We disagree with the district court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 209(b) and reverse its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The Medicaid program provides federal funds to participating states that choose to reimburse certain costs of medical treatment for needy persons. <em>Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, </em>453 U.S. 34, 36, 101 S.Ct. 2633, 2636, 69 L.Ed.2d 460 (1981). \u201cState Medicaid plans must comply with requirements imposed both by the Act itself and by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37, 101 S.Ct. at 2636.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">As originally enacted, Medicaid required participating states to provide medical assistance to individuals who were receiving cash payments under any one of four welfare programs established elsewhere in the Social Security Act. <em>Herweg v. Ray, </em>455 U.S. 265, 268, 102 S.Ct. 1059, 1062-63, 71 L.Ed.2d 137 (1982); <em>Gray Panthers, </em>453 U.S. at 37, 101 S.Ct. at 2636. In 1972, Congress restructured the Medicaid program and replaced three of the four welfare assistance programs with Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled (SSI). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">As a direct result of the restructuring, the number of individuals eligible under the new SSI standards increased significantly in many states.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-11\">Fearing that some States might withdraw from the Medicaid program rather than bear the increased costs imposed by the restructuring, Congress offered the States the \u201c\u00a7 209(b) option.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(f). Under the \u00a7 209(b) option, the States may elect to provide Medicaid assistance only to those individuals who would have been eligible under the State\u2019s Medicaid plan in effect on January 1, 1972.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-12\"><em>Herweg, </em>455 U.S. at 268, 102 S.Ct. at 1063. Hence, \u00a7 209(b) provides a limited exception to the federal eligibility requirements and allows participating states to avoid the increased fiscal burden that would otherwise result under the broader SSI standards. <em>Morris v. Morrow, </em>783 F.2d 454, 460 (4th Cir.1986); <em>Minnesota v. Heckler, </em>779 F.2d 1335, 1338 (8th Cir.1985); <em>Lewis v. Shulimson, </em>400 F.Supp. 807, 810 (E.D.Mo.1975), aff<em>'d </em>539 F.2d 794 (8th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Gourley v. Lewis, </em>430 U.S. 940, 97 S.Ct. 1570, 51 L.Ed.2d 786 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">Under the SSI program, Medicaid eligibility is based upon a maximum ceiling limiting the amount of income and resources a recipient can hold while receiving benefits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382. In determining an individual\u2019s available resources, the individual's home is not included. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1382b(a)(1); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1212.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-14\">Under Missouri\u2019s 1972 Medicaid plan, a medicaid recipient living in a nursing home could have his or her family home excluded from available resources \u201cduring the period of time the * * * recipient [remained] a patient in [a] nursing home or institution.\u201d Stipulated Exhibit No. 44, Joint Appendix at 148. The Secretary, however, has interpreted the term \u201chome\u201d more restrictively than Missouri as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-15\">the principal place of residence (i.e., the home) of an individual as long as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>resides there or intends to return to this residence. * * * If he is in a medical institution and if his spouse or a dependent lives in the home, it continues to be exempt as long as they continue to live in the home. However, this exclusion only applies where the reason for the recipient\u2019s absence from the home is institutionalization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Stipulation No. 30, Joint Appendix at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the homestead exemption under SSI has not been challenged, and for purposes of this appeal, we will assume its validity. \u201cIn the absence of a statutory definition of the term [\u2018home\u2019], it is appropriate to consider the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of that term.\u201d <em>Connecticut Department of Income Maintenance v. Heckler, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 2210, 2214, 85 L.Ed.2d 577 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">On appeal, the Secretary simply claims the district court improperly held that \u00a7 209(b) precludes him from insisting that Missouri comply with the federal eligibility standards that are more restrictive than the eligibility standards that were in effect in the state on January 1, 1972. Specifically, the Secretary takes the position that Missouri must apply SSI standards in determining whether the home will be included as a countable resource.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">The Secretary argues that \u00a7 209(b) does not allow a participating state to have standards more liberal than SSI. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.121(b)(1). Hence, to the extent that Missouri\u2019s plan does not conform with federal requirements, the Secretary claims that \u00a7 209(b) is irrelevant and therefore, he can insist that Missouri amend its plan. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">The Secretary\u2019s interpretation of a statute that he is charged with administering is entitled to substantial deference. <em>Income Maintenance, </em>105 S.Ct. at 2215. If the Secretary\u2019s interpretation is reasonable, judicial approval is proper, even though other reasonable interpretations exist. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">We conclude the Secretary\u2019s interpretation that \u00a7 209(b) does not provide an independent basis for Medicaid eligibility is reasonable. \u201cDespite its semantic complexity, we believe one thing is clear about \u00a7 209(b): it was designed solely to relieve states of a potential burden at their option. * * * [I]t does <em>not </em>confer authority upon states to create broader eligibility standards than exist nationally for SSI.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>783 F.2d at 459 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-14\">In <em>Morris, </em>the Fourth Circuit agreed with the Secretary\u2019s position that an individual must first meet the eligibility re? quirements under the SSI before \u00a7 209(b) is activated. <em>Id. </em>at 460. In other words, if an individual does not meet SSI\u2019s eligibility requirements, then \u00a7 209(b) is not applicable; it does not operate as a waiver of federal eligibility requirements simply because those requirements are more restrictive than what the state had in effect on January 1, 1972. We agree with the Fourth Circuit that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-15\">\u00a7 209(b) is a limited exception to the [federal] eligibility rules * * * and permits states to exclude individuals who would otherwise be eligible. * * * It follows that if an individual is not eligible under [SSI], then \u00a7 209(b) is irrelevant to the determination of Medicaid eligibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-16\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b753-17\">In addition to <em>Morris, </em>the legislative history, of \u00a7 209(b) supports the Secretary\u2019s interpretation as well. The House Ways and Means Committee considered the financial burden that participating states might suffer if required to cover the additional individuals that would be eligible under the newly structured SSI program. In doing so, the committee</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMB\">decided not to require the States to cover the newly eligible, but rather leave the decision up to each individual State. Your committee\u2019s bill would, therefore, provide that despite any other [eligibility] requirements * * *, no State shall be required to provide Medicaid coverage to any individual or family member in any month where such person would not have been eligible for such assistance under the State plan in effect on January 1, 197[2].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>H.R.Rep. No. 231, 92nd Cong. 1st Sess. 197, <em>reprinted in </em>1972 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4989, 5183. <em>See also Morris, </em>783 F.2d at 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">This committee statement supports the Secretary\u2019s interpretation that Congress intended for SSI eligibility requirements to apply as well to \u00a7 209(b) states, but that those states are permitted to exclude those individuals who would have been ineligible for Medicaid coverage under the state\u2019s plan in effect on January 1, 1972. \u201cBecause the \u00a7 209(b) option <em>only </em>exempts states from the requirement of covering all SSI recipients, it does <em>not </em>confer authority upon states to create broader eligibility standards than exist nationally for SSI.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>783 F.2d at 459 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Thus, we conclude the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 209(b) is reasonable. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s decision enjoining the Secretary from applying federal eligibility requirements to Missouri\u2019s Medicaid plan.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
