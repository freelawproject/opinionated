It was alleged that Stokes, an inmate in the Massachusetts prisons, had been confined in the segregated confinement status on several occasions, allegedly for unreasonably long periods of time without constitutionally adequate notice or review. The parties set forth the issue for resolution by the district court in an agreed statement of facts. The court found that the regulations in question are analogous to those discussed by the Supreme Court in <em>Hewitt v. Helms, </em>459 U.S. 460, 103 S.Ct. 864, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983) and ruled that these regulations created a protected liberty interest. The court therefore granted summary judgment on plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and denied same to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">The basis of the state\u2019s argument is that the Massachusetts regulations are distinguishable from those of Pennsylvania, which were analyzed in <em>Hewitt. </em>Appellants contend that the elements which the Supreme Court found crucial are lacking here. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-16\">The Supreme Court in <em>Hewitt </em>found that prison officials have broad administrative and discretionary authority over the institutions they manage. Prisoners retain only a narrow range of protected liberty interests. Therefore, administrative segregation is the sort of confinement that inmates can reasonably anticipate receiving at some point in their incarceration and it accordingly does not involve any interest independently protected by the Due Process Clause. The state, however, may create a protected liberty interest through the enactment of certain statutory or regulatory measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-17\">In analyzing the Pennsylvania statutes and regulations,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Court articulates two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>criteria which it believes separate regulations that create such interest from simple procedural guidelines: 1) the use of language of an unmistakably mandatory character, requiring that certain procedures \u201cshall,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d or \u201cmust\u201d be employed; and 2) the fact that the administrative segregation will not occur absent specified substantive predicates \u2014 viz., \u201cthe need for control,\u201d or \u201cthe threat of a serious disturbance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471-72, 103 S.Ct. at 871-72. As the Court succinctly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">\u201c[T]he repeated use of explicitly mandatory language in connection with requiring specific substantive predicates demands a conclusion that the State has created a protected liberty interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 472, 103 S.Ct. at 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Our review of the Massachusetts regulations in light of the Supreme Court analysis, and in comparison to the Pennsylvania regulations in <em>Hewitt, </em>leads us to affirm the decision of the district court. 103 CMR 430.19 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">\u201c(1) The superintendent or his desig-nee may authorize the placement of an inmate in detention in awaiting action status pending:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">(a) A hearing on a disciplinary offense by the inmate</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">(b) An investigation of a possible disciplinary offense by the inmate</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">(c) A transfer or a reclassification of the inmate to a higher custody status, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">(d) Imposition of isolation time sanction on the inmate when the inmate\u2019s continued presence in the general population poses a serious threat to persons, property, or the security of the institution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-15\">(2) The superintendent shall designate such person or persons as he de\u00e9ms appropriate to review the status of inmates housed in detention in awaiting action on a weekly basis. An inmate shall be released from detention when the reasons for his initial placement cease to exist or when his return to general population no longer poses a serious threat to persons, property, or the security of the institution or when he is no longer in the status specified in any one of 103 CMR 430.-19(l)(a) through 430.19(l)(d).\u201d .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-16\">103 CMR 420.13(2)(b) governing the transfer of inmates to a higher custody status provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-17\">\u201cWhere the Deputy Commissioner for Classification and Treatment or the Superintendent or his designee determines at any time prior to or during [a proceeding for reclassification to a higher custody status] that there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of the resident or to others, the resident may be placed in an awaiting action status until there is a final decision about a transfer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-18\">Both regulations contain substantive predicates which limit official discretion. In 430.19, they are the four conditions listed in 1(a) through (d). The predicate condition found in 1(d) and that in 420.13(2)(b) are of the same type as the example given by the Supreme Court \u2014 where the inmate\u2019s remaining in the general population poses a threat. Appellants argue that the criteria are largely non-predictive and ministerial in nature because they do not call for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>exercise of judgment or discretion on the part of correctional officials. We disagree. Both regulations clearly state that when any of these conditions are present, the correction officials <em>may </em>authorize the placement of the inmate in awaiting action status. Thus, while officials have the ultimate discretion to segregate the inmates, segregation is permissible only when one of the specific situations exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Appellants concede that there is mandatory language in 103 CMR 430.19(2). It is their contention, however, that there is no such language in subsection (1), which limits the discretion of the correctional officials in the <em>initial </em>placement in awaiting action status. We agree with the district court that an attempt to create a distinction between a review of the initiation of confinement and that of continuing confinement cuts the matter too finely. The mandatory language of 103 CMR 430.19 provides in part that the superintendent <em>shall designate </em>a person or persons to review the status of awaiting action inmates and that such review <em>shall take place </em>on a weekly basis. The inmate <em>shall be released </em>from the status detention when reasons for it cease to exist. While it is true that the Pennsylvania regulations provide more specifics on the process which is due to the inmate it is clear that both states\u2019 regulations anticipate rapid follow-up to review the inmates\u2019 detention status.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">We therefore agree with the district court that Massachusetts has, through the promulgation of these regulations, created a liberty interest entitling appellee to procedural due process in the initiation and continuance in awaiting action status detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\n<em>Affirm,ed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-18\">.

An investigation shall begin immediately to determine whether or not a behavior violation has occurred.
