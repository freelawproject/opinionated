Sirianni appeal from a district court order denying their motion to compel arbitration of claims arising under section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) (1982), and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Commission, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.-10b-5 (1985). For the reasons discussed below, we reverse the order of the district court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-7\">I. BACKGROUND.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-8\">Louis L. Phillips opened securities accounts for himself and for L.L. Phillips Charities, Inc. with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. in October 1978. The accounts were managed by Ben M. Sirian-ni, a vice president and registered representative of Merrill Lynch.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon opening the accounts, Phillips signed a standard \u201cCustomer Agreement\u201d and a standard \u201cOption Agreement\u201d, both of which provided that any controversies relating to the accounts \u201cshall be submitted to arbitration\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1502-13\">In July 1981, Phillips sued Merrill Lynch, charging that its registered representative, Sirianni, executed unauthorized option trades in Phillips\u2019 accounts and made various misrepresentations and omissions regarding those trades. Phillips\u2019 complaint alleged violations of section 10(b) of the 1934 Act and Rule 10b-5, section 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77Z(2) (1982), the Minnesota Securities Act, Minn.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 80A.01 et seq., .80A.03 (West Supp.1986), and state common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-14\">On March 27,1985, Merrill Lynch moved, pursuant to the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement, to compel arbitration of Phillips\u2019 claims arising under section 10(b) of the 1934 Act and Rule 10b-5. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1395\">*1395</page-number>court denied this motion<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and on May 9, 1985, Merrill Lynch appealed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On appeal, Merrill Lynch contends that the Federal Arbitration Act (Arbitration Act), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-14 (1982), requires enforcement of the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement, and that the 1934 Act does not create an exception to this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-5\">The centerpiece provision of the Federal Arbitration Act provides that arbitration agreements \u201cshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. In recent years, the Supreme Court has stressed that this provision, and the Arbitration Act as a whole, reflects a strong federal policy favoring the enforcement of arbitration agreements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court has indicated that arbitration agreements should be liberally construed, and that any doubt as to the arbitrability of an issue should be resolved in favor of arbitration. <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 3346, 3353-54, 87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985); <em>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, </em>470 U.S. 213, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 1242-43, 84 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985); <em>Southland Corp. v. Keating, </em>465 U.S. 1, 10-16,104 S.Ct. 852, 858-61, 79 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984); <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 24-25, 103 S.Ct. 927, 941-42, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983):</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-13\">In <em>Wilko v. Swan, </em>346 U.S. 427, 74 S.Ct. 182, 98 L.Ed. 168 (1953), however, the Supreme Court held a predispute arbitration agreement unenforceable with regard to claims arising under section 12(2) of the 1933 Act. The Court reasoned that a pre-dispute arbitration agreement is void under section 14 of the 1933 Act because it constitutes a stipulation binding the securities customer to waive compliance with a provision of the Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The provision referred to is the aggrieved party\u2019s right to select the judicial forum under section 22(a) of the 1933 Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1503-14\">The Court deemed section 22(a) \u201cthe kind of \u2018provision\u2019 that cannot be waived\u201d under section 14 by viewing it in conjunction with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1396\">*1396</page-number>the substantive right afforded a securities customer in section 12(2). The Court observed that section 12(2) \u201ccreate[s] a special right to recover for misrepresentation which differs substantially from the common-law action in that the seller is made to assume the burden of proving lack of scien-ter.\u201d <em>Wilko v. Swan, supra, </em>346 U.S. at 431, 74 S.Ct. at 184. It expressed concern that the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of this special right would be \u201clessened in arbitration as compared to judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435, 74 S.Ct. at 187. The Court, therefore, concluded that Congress must have intended section 14 to preclude the waiver of a section 22(a) judicial remedy for the section 12(2) right. <em>Id. </em>at 437, 74 S.Ct. at 188. In short, the <em>Wilko </em>Court decided that Congress, in enacting the 1933 Act, created an exception to the mandate of the Arbitration Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-4\">A number of courts of appeals have held that <em>Wilko </em>extends to claims arising under section 10(b) of the 1934 Act and Rule 10b-5. <em>E.g., Miller v. Drexel Burnham, Inc., </em>791 F.2d 850, 854 (11th Cir.1986) (per curiam); <em>McMahon v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., </em>788 F.2d 94, 98 (2d Cir.1986); <em>De Lancie v. Birr, Wilson &amp; Co., </em>648 F.2d 1255, 1258-59 (9th Cir.1981); <em>Mansbach v. Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben, </em>598 F.2d 1017,1030 (6th Cir.1979); <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v. Moore, </em>590 F.2d 823, 827-29 (10th Cir.1978); <em>Weissbuch v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>558 F.2d 831, 833-35 (7th Cir.1977); <em>Sibley v. Tandy Corp., </em>543 F.2d 540, 543 n. 3 (5th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 824,98 S.Ct. 71, 54 L.Ed.2d 82 (1977); <em>Ayres v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>538 F.2d 532, 536 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, 429 U.S. </em>1010, 97 S.Ct. 542, 50 L.Ed.2d 619 (1976). Recent Supreme Court pronouncements indicate, however, that this remains an open question. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, supra, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1240 n. 1; <em>Id. </em>at 1244 (White, J., concurring); <em>Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., </em>417 U.S. 506, 513-14, 94 S.Ct. 2449, 2454-55, 41 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1504-8\">In the present case, the. district court concluded, relying on its interpretation of this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Surman v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, </em>733 F.2d 59 (8th Cir.1984), that <em>Wilko </em>is to be read broadly. Therefore, the district court denied Merrill Lynch\u2019s motion to compel arbitration of Phillips\u2019 section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>On appeal, Merrill Lynch contends, relying on language in <em>Byrd </em>and <em>Scherk, </em>and on the strong federal policy favoring arbi-trability, that <em>Wilko </em>does not apply, to claims arising under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. Merrill Lynch argues that the Arbitration Act requires enforcement of its pre-dispute arbitration agreement with Phillips, and that the 1934 Act does not create an exception to this requirement. We agree.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1505-4\">In <em>Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., supra, </em>417 U.S. at 513-14, 94 S.Ct. at 2454-55, the Supreme Court, without deciding the issue, questioned the applicability of <em>Wilko </em>to section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Last term, in <em>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, supra, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1240 n. 1, the Court briefly reviewed the arguments raised in <em>Scherk, </em>yet concluded that the issue was not properly before it. In a separate concurrence, however, Justice White compared the 1933 and 1934 Acts and concluded that the extension of <em>Wil-ko </em>\u2019s reasoning to 1934 Act claims \u201cis a matter of substantial doubt.\u201d <em>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, supra, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1244 (White, J., concurring).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1505-5\">We observe that although the 1934 Act contains a non-waiver provision, section 29(a),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> virtually identical to section 14 of the 1933 Act, counterparts of the other two provisions relied on by the <em>Wilko </em>Court \u201care imperfect or absent altogether.\u201d <em>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, supra, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1244 (White, J., concurring). The jurisdictional provision of the 1934 Act, section 27, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa (1982), is narrower than section 22(a) of the 1933 Act. Section 27 requires a plaintiff to bring his or her action exclusively in federal court, while section 22(a) allows suit in federal or state court and prevents removal from a state court. <em>See supra </em>note 7, at 5. As the Supreme Court noted, compared to section 22(a) of the 1933 Act, section 27 of the 1934 Act \u201csignificantly restrict[s] the plaintiffs choice of forum.\u201d <em>Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., supra, </em>417 U.S. at 514, 94 S.Ct. at 2455 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-10\">Moreover, a plaintiff\u2019s cause of action under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 differs in important respects from his or her cause of action under section 12(2). <em>Berger v. Bishop Investment Corp., </em>695 F.2d 302, 308 (8th Cir.1982). First, the section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 private cause of action is implied rather than express. <em>Herman &amp; MacLean v. Huddleston, </em>459 U.S. 375, 380 &amp; nn. 9-10, 103 S.Ct. 683, 686 &amp; nn. 9-10, 74 L.Ed.2d 548 (1983). Second, unlike in a section 12(2) action, the plaintiff in an action under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 bears the burden of proving scienter. <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>190, 193, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1379-80, 1381, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976); <em>Hams v. Union Electric Co., </em>787 F.2d 355, 362 (8th Cir.1986).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1506-4\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wilko </em>rested, at least in part, on the \u201cspecial\u201d nature of the section 12(2) right, so described because it is expressly created by Congress and \u201cdiffers substantially from the common-law action in that\u201d a securities customer is not required to prove scienter to recover. <em>Wilko v. Swan, supra, </em>346 U.S. at 431, 74 S.Ct. at 184-85. As we have observed, the section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 cause of action lacks both of these attributes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-5\">Based on these differences between the 1933 and 1934 Acts, and on the strong federal policy favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements, we conclude that <em>Wil-ko\u2019s </em>holding and rationale does not extend to claims arising under section 10(b) of the 1934 Act and Rule 10b-5. The non-waiver provision of the 1934 Act, section 29(a), simply does not override the Arbitration Act in the same manner as section 14 of the 1933 Act when it is not buttressed by special rights and broad jurisdictional provisions similar to those found in the 1933 Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As Justice White stated, \u201cWilko\u2019s solicitude for the federal cause of action\u2014 the \u2018special right\u2019 established by Congress, 346 U.S. at 431, 74 S.Ct. at 184 \u2014 is not necessarily appropriate where the cause of action is judicially implied and not so different from the common law action.\u201d <em>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, supra, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1244 (White, J., concurring). We hold, then, that Congress has not evinced an intention to preclude the waiver of judicial remedies for the section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 rights at issue here.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, we reverse the order of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number>The decision in <em>Swink &amp; Co. v. Hereth; </em>784 F.2d 866 (8th Cir.1986), lends support for our holding here. <em>Swink </em>suggests that the reach of <em>Wilko </em>should be contained, rather than expanded. The case concerned a dispute arising out of the issuance of municipal bonds, for which Swink &amp; Company, Inc. and Hereth, Orr &amp; Jones, Inc. were co-managing underwriters. This court held that the <em>Wilko </em>doctrine does not override the arbitration proceedings of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board in disputes between municipal bond dealers and associated persons. <em>Swink &amp; Co. v. Hereth, supra, </em>784 F.2d at 868; <em>see also Halliburton &amp; Associates, Inc. v. Henderson, Few &amp; Co., </em>774 F.2d 441, 445 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-4\">Recently, however, the Second Circuit, in the first <em>post-Byrd </em>appellate court decision to consider the issue, held that claims arising under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 are not arbitrable. <em>McMahon v. Shearson/American Express, supra, </em>788 F.2d at 98. The court pointed to the similarity of the non-waiver provisions of the 1933 and 1934 Acts, as well as the strong public policy concerns inherent in the federal securities laws, as support for its decision. <em>Id. </em>at 98. The court acknowledged that <em>Byrd </em>and <em>Scherk </em>have cast doubt in this area, yet concluded that it was bound by \u201cclear judicial precedent in this Circuit\u201d holding that Wilko\u2019s reasoning extends to 1934 Act claims. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1507-5\">We are faced, however, with no analogous Eighth Circuit precedent. Despite Phillips\u2019 argument to the contrary, <em>Sur-man v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, supra, </em>is not an exception. In that case, we noted that \u201c[ljower federal courts have * * * held with consistency that <em>Wil-ko </em>applies * * * to claims arising under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\u201d <em>Sur-man v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, supra, </em>733 F.2d at 61. In <em>Surman, </em>however, the question of whether section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims are arbitrable was not before the Court because the appellants did not move to compel arbitration of their 1934 Act claims. <em>Id. </em>at 60. Thus, the remarks in <em>Surman </em>constitute merely observations on the state of the law and are purely dicta. Today, however, the question is before us, and we hold that predispute arbitration agreements are enforceable with regard to claims arising under section 10(b) of the 1934 Act and Rule 10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-10\">Accordingly, we reverse the order of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-11\">With regard to the remand, we observe from written materials furnished us by the parties that an arbitration award has been issued on Phillips\u2019 state law claims. <em>See supra </em>note 3. The arbitration award may well bar further proceedings by Phillips on the basis of issue preclusion, full satisfaction of claims or for other reasons. This court on the present record has no way of knowing whether Phillips may properly seek an additional or supplementary judgment on its federal securities claims. However, we presume that such issues which may arise from the effect of the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>arbitration award on the federal claims will be considered on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-4\">Finally, we observe that the federal appellate courts, in the absence of precedent in their own circuit, tend to rely on precedent in other circuits. Ordinarily, then, in deciding a case of this kind, we would defer to the opinion of another circuit, such as rendered by the Second Circuit in <em>McMahon, </em>and avoid creating a conflict within the circuits. We believe, however, that the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Sckerk </em>and <em>Byrd </em>have invited a reexamination of the applicability of <em>Wilko </em>to claims arising under section 10(b) of the 1934 Act and Rule 10b-5. Because we are not bound by the precedents of other circuits, we are free to make a new assessment of this issue. We have made that assessment, and now create a conflict within the circuits. We assume the Supreme Court will eventually decide this question.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1502-9\">.

Previously, the district court had granted Merrill Lynch\u2019s motion to compel arbitration of Phillips\u2019 state securities law and state common law claims. These claims were tried before an arbitration panel of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD). On July 2, 1985, after the present appeal was taken, the NASD arbitration panel issued its award, finding Merrill Lynch liable to Louis L. Phillips in the amount of $930,000 and to L.L. Phillips Charities, Inc. in the amount of $196,700. On July 9, 1985, Phillips filed a motion to confirm the arbitration award and a supplemental motion for prejudgment interest. Merrill Lynch filed a cross-motion for an order vacating, modifying, or remanding the arbitration award. On September 19, 1985, the district court denied Merrill Lynch's motion, granted Phillips\u2019 motion confirming the arbitration award, and entered judgment in Phillips\u2019 favor on all state law claims.

Since <em>Byrd </em>there has been considerable ferment in the federal district courts regarding the arbitrability of claims arising under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. Some courts, following Justice White\u2019s concurrence, have held such claims to be arbitrable. <em>E.g., Schriner v. Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., </em>635 F.Supp. 373 (N.D.Cal.1986); <em>Steinberg v. Illinois Co., Inc., </em>635 F.Supp. 615 (N.D.Ill.1986); <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc., </em>635 F.Supp. 234 (D.Md.1986); <em>Bob Ladd, Inc. v. Adcock, </em>633 F.Supp. 241 (E.D. Ark.1986); <em>Shotto v. Laub, </em>632 F.Supp. 516 (D.Md.1986); <em>Jope v. Bear Stearns &amp; Co., </em>632 F.Supp. 140 (N.D.Cal.1985); <em>Sacks v. Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., </em>627 F.Supp. 377 (C.D.Cal.1985); Prawer <em>v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>626 F.Supp. 642 (D.Mass.1985); <em>West v. Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc., </em>623 F.Supp. 26 (W.D.Wash.1985); <em>Houlihan v. Schmacker, </em>621 F.Supp. 48 (E.D.Mo.1985); <em>Peele v. Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., Inc., </em>620 F.Supp. 61 (W.D.Mo.1985); <em>Land v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>617 F.Supp. 52 (E.D.Va.1985); <em>Gerhardstein </em>v. <em>Shearson/American Express, Inc., </em>[Current] Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 92,512 (N.D. Ohio March 3, 1986); <em>Rockoff v. Shearson Lehman/American Express, Inc., </em>[Current] Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 92,513 (S.D.Fla.Feb. 12, 1986); <em>Frye v. Paine Webber Jackson &amp; Curtis, </em>[Current] Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 92,516 (N.D.Tex.Dec. 26, 1985). Other courts have continued to conclude that <em>Wilko </em>applies to 1934 Act claims and therefore have held that such claims are not arbitrable. <em>E.g., Shapiro v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., </em>634 F.Supp. 587 (S.D.Ohio 1986); <em>Bustamante v. Rotan Mosle, Inc., </em>633 F.Supp. 303 (S.D.Tex. 1986); <em>Blomquist v. Churchill, </em>633 F.Supp. 131 (D.S.C.1985); <em>Bale v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>627 F.Supp. 650 (D.Minn.1986); <em>Levendag v. Churchill, </em>623 F.Supp. 620 (D.S.C.1985). <em>See abo </em>Palmer, <em>Arbitration of Securities Complaints, </em>Nat\u2019l L.J., Dec. 9,1985, at 15, col. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-10\">Merrill Lynch contended at oral argument that two-thirds of the federal district courts that have considered the issue have held that claims arising under section 10(b) and Rule <em>10b-5 </em>are arbitrable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1504-11\">. Phillips contends that Merrill Lynch has waived any right to compel arbitration of claims arising under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 because of its delay in seeking arbitration and its active participation in this lawsuit. The district court concluded that Merrill Lynch\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>was timely in light of the recent Supreme Court decision in <em>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, supra. </em>We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion under the circumstances present in this case. <em>See Fogarty </em>v. <em>Piper, </em>781 F.2d 662, 663 (8th Cir.1986); <em>see also Fisher </em>v. <em>A.G. Becker Paribas, Inc., </em>791 F.2d 691, 698 (9th Cir.1986); <em>Rush v. Oppenheimer &amp; Co., </em>779 F.2d 885, 887 (2d Cir.1985). We note that a court should resolve in favor of arbitration \"any doubts concerning * * * an allegation of waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability.\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 24-25, 103 S.Ct. 927, 941, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1505-7\">. The Securities Industry Association, as <em>ami-cus curiae, </em>urges us to reassess the vitality of <em>Wilko </em>itself.

Justice Douglas, however, in a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Brennan, White and Marshall, reasoned that <em>Wilko </em>extends to 1934 Act claims. <em>Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., supra, </em>417 U.S. at 524-34, 94 S.Ct. at 2459-64 (Douglas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-12\">Justice White\u2019s concurrence in <em>Byrd </em>suggests that he has changed his mind. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v.

Justice White did agree with the majority that the issue of whether 1934 Act claims are arbitrable was not properly before the Court. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v.

Section 29(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78cc(a) (1982), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1505-15\">Any condition, stipulation or provision binding any person to waive compliance with any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder, or of any rule of an exchange required thereby shall be void.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1506-8\">. \"Imposition of liability under Section 12(2) * * * requires no showing of scienter, but rather permits recovery upon proof of a negligent misstatement or omission.\u201d <em>Berger v.

As support for its contention that 1934 Act claims are not arbitrable, Phillips argues that arbitration is less effective than adjudication in enforcing a plaintiffs rights under the 1934 Act. We believe that this argument, if it has any validity, is largely beside the point. Congress, through the Arbitration Act, as well as the Supreme Court have expressed increased approval for the use of arbitration rather than adjudication. <em>See supra </em>p. 1395. The question here is whether Congress has created an exception to the mandate of the Arbitration Act for a plaintiff\u2019s judicially implied section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 rights. We conclude that it has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-11\"><em>See also </em>Katsoris, <em>supra </em>not\u00e9 15, at 283-91, 309-14 (discussing securities arbitration procedures).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1506-12\">. Phillips raises two additional arguments which require only brief mention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-13\">First, Phillips appears to argue that Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation 15c2-2, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.15c2-2 (1985), and related SEC \u201cinterpretive releases\u201d either bar enforcement of the arbitration agreement at issue here or indicate that <em>Wilko </em>extends to 1934 Act claims. We disagree. SEC Regulation 15c2-2 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1506-16\">(a) It shall be a fraudulent, manipulative or deceptive act or practice for a broker or dealer to enter into an agreement with any public customer which purports to bind the customer to the arbitration of -future disputes between them arising under the Federal securities laws, or to have in effect such an agreement, pursuant to which it effects transactions with or for a customer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1506-17\">As Merrill Lynch points out, this regulation has no direct impact on the present case because it was adopted and promulgated after the contracts between Merrill Lynch and Phillips were executed. Furthermore, we conclude that in adopting Regulation 15c2-2 the SEC intended only to reflect what it believed to be a settled principle of law (i.e. that predispute arbitration agreements are unenforceable under both the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act). As this opinion indicates, the SEC was mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-18\">Second, Phillips, relying on one ambiguous sentence in a House Conference Report, argues that in enacting the 1975 amendments to the federal securities laws, Congress ratified the application of <em>Wilko </em>to the 1934 Act. H.R.Rep. No. 94-229, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. Ill (1975), <em>reprinted in part in </em>1975 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 179, 321, 342; Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Pub.L.No. 94-29, 89 Stat. 97. We reject this argument. <em>Cf. Hirschey v. F.E.R.C., </em>777 F.2d 1, 7-8 (D.C.Cir.1985) (Scalia, J., concurring) (criticizing routine deference to the detail of congressional committee reports).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1507-6\">. In a very recent decision, the Eleventh Circuit, relying simply on <em>pre-Byrd </em>precedent within that Circuit, also concluded that 1934 Act claims are not arbitrable. <em>Miller v. Drexel Burnham, Inc., </em>791 F.2d 850, 854 (11th Cir.1986) (per curiam). The only discussion of this issue in the court\u2019s brief per curiam opinion is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1507-7\">[W]e must vacate that portion of the district court order which compels arbitration of the 1934 Act fraud claim. Under the rule of <em>[Belke v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, </em>693 F.2d 1023, 1025-26 (11th Cir.1982) ], no claims based on the federal securities acts are arbitrable. Nothing in <em>Dean Witter v. Byrd </em>holds otherwise since the Supreme Court expressly declined to reach the arbitra-bility of 1934 Act claims. See <em>Byrd, supra </em>at 1240 n. 1. <em>Belke </em>remains the law of this circuit * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1507-13\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-14\"><em>See also Smoky Greenhaw Cotton Co. </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>785 F.2d 1274, 1275 n. 1 (5th Cir.1986) <em>(post-Byrd </em>decision observing in dicta that \u201cthis Court and many other lower courts consistently have extended <em>Wilko\u2019s </em>reasoning to the 1934 Act\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1508-5\">ROSS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aa7\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-6\">. I respectfully dissent. I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s holding that predispute arbitration agreements are enforceable with regard to claims arising under section 10(b) of the 1934 Act and Rule 10b-5. I adhere to the position that <em>Wilko v. Swan, </em>346 U.S. 427, 74 S.Ct. 182, 98 L.Ed. 168 (1953) applies and therefore precludes arbitration of such federal securities claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-7\">I take this position for three reasons. First, <em>Wilko </em>is still good law, and as the majority points out, eight circuits have extended it to 1934 Act claims. <em>See ante </em>p. 6. Moreover, neither <em>Scherk v. Alberto-Cul-ver Co., </em>417 U.S. 506, 94 S.Ct. 2449, 41 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974) nor <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Byrd, </em>470 U.S. 213, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 84 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985) hold that <em>Wilko </em>would not apply in the context of a section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5 claim. Second, in my judgment the similarity of the nonwaiver provisions of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act is of critical importance because I view section 14 of the 1933 Act to be the lynchpin of the <em>Wilko </em>analysis. Third, the policy considerations which underlay <em>Wilko, see </em>346 U.S. at 435-37, 74 S.Ct. at 186-88, apply to the 1934 Act claims as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-13\">Because of the absenc\u00e9 of clear precedent in this circuit,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>1 would give deference to the decisions of the Second Circuit in <em>McMahon v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., </em>788 F.2d 94, 98 (2d Cir.1986) and the Eleventh Circuit in <em>Miller v. Drexel Burnham, Inc., </em>791 F.2d 850 (11th Cir.1986) (per curiam) and hold that claims under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 are not arbitrable. Accordingly, in the instant case I would affirm the order of the district court denying the motion to compel arbitration of the claims arising under the 1934 Act.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1508-8\">. I do not view <em>Swink &amp; Co. v. Hereth, </em>784 F.2d 866 (8th Cir.1986) as support for the majority\u2019s position because it is clearly distinguishable. <em>Wilko </em>was inapplicable in <em>Swink </em>because it involved a dispute between municipal bond dealers and associated persons subject to the arbitration proceedings of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. <em>Id. </em>at 868.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
