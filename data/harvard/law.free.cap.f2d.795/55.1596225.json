We vacate the dismissal and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-22\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b163-23\">Young is presently incarcerated in the Missouri State Penitentiary. He is serving prison sentences totaling forty-four years for convictions rendered in two separate jury trials on counts of rape, sodomy, felonious restraint, and stealing. His convictions were affirmed on direct appeal. <em>State v. Young, </em>643 S.W.2d 28 (Mo.App. 1982); <em>State v. Young, </em>661 S.W.2d 637 (Mo.App.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-24\">Without the aid of counsel, Young submitted a habeas corpus petition to the federal district court for in forma pauperis filing. His asserted ground for relief was: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u201cFailure to treat, psychiatric services * * * [are] not being provided to the petitioner as to violate his Eighth Amendment rights against cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d His supporting facts were stated as follows: \u201cThat * * * [he was] sentenced to [a] prison term of 44 years under Section 589.-040 R.S.Mo.1984<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which clearly contemplated that rehabilitative treatment be concomitant with the sentence, that respondents should be directed to afford the relater [sic] treatment consistent with his sentence, or if such treatment not be readily available at Missouri State prison to transfer the relater [sic] to a correctional prison where treatment is available or to release him.\u201d An addendum to the petition stated facts establishing that he had exhausted this claim in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The district court permitted Young to file his petition on an in forma pauperis basis. The court then dismissed Young\u2019s petition without an evidentiary hearing, stating: \u201cThe petition alleges that Petitioner is not receiving psychiatric services which he believes he should be receiving as part of his original sentence. State sentencing schemes do not raise constitutional issues cognizable in federal habeas corpus proceedings except in exceptional circumstances. * * *; <em>Niemann v. Parrott, </em>596 F.2d 316, 317 (8th Cir.1979). Such extraordinary circumstances are not present in this case.\u201d Order, January 31, 1985. When the court later denied Young\u2019s petition for a certificate of probable cause, it further explained: \u201cPetitioner is not attacking the actual imposition of sentence or its length, but rather through self-diagnosis feels that the sentence should have included psychiatric care. The imposition of sentence is a discretionary act, limited only in length of time to be served and/or amount of fine by specific statutes. Petitioner may believe he deserves a different type of sentence, but variations of sentence are left to the trial judge\u2019s discretion.\u201d Order, June 4, 1985. This court subsequently issued a certificate of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">On appeal, Young contends that the facts alleged in his petition were sufficient to entitle him to an evidentiary hearing on whether his eighth amendment right to adequate psychiatric care has been violated. He also argues that he was legally incompetent to stand trial and that his court-appointed defense attorney failed to provide him with effective assistance of counsel. These latter two grounds for relief were first raised in a letter brief to this court in February of 1985; the grounds had not been raised in Young\u2019s petition. Young\u2019s petition did mention, however, that he had filed a motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Missouri Supreme Court Rule 27.-26, that the motion raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, that the motion had been dismissed, and that an appeal of that dismissal was pending in state court. The ineffective assistance of counsel claim and the incompentency to stand trial issue are therefore not ripe for decision at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Viewing Young\u2019s petition as an attack on the state sentence, the district court was correct in dismissing Young\u2019s petition. But reading Young\u2019s petition liberally, as is required in this case, it is apparent that Young has also raised a potentially viable eighth amendment claim based on a \u201cdeliberate indifference to serious medical needs [ (here, psychiatric treatment) ] of [a] prisoner[ ].\u201d <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 291, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). We therefore instruct the district court on remand to treat Young\u2019s petition as a complaint filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Leave to amend the complaint shall be granted liberally as justice requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">In accordance with the above, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Young\u2019s petition is vacated and the case is remanded for proceed- \u2022 ings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-9\">.
