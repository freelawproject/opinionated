We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-26\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-27\">In April 1983, Martin was hired by the Federal Aviation Administration (agency) as a Realty Specialist, GS-11. The agency issued to Martin in June 1984 a letter of warning of unacceptable performance and Martin was allowed ninety days in which to improve his performance. On October 17, 1984, the agency issued a notice of proposed removal charging Martin with three instances of unacceptable performance un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>der one critical element of his job and four instances of unacceptable performance under another critical job element. Martin was removed effective November 19, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">Martin asserts both procedural and substantive errors by the agency in effecting his removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">This court\u2019s scope of review is limited by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c). We affirm a decision of the Board sustaining the dismissal of a federal employee if the \u201cdecision complies with the applicable statute and regulations and [if] it has a rational basis supported by substantial evidence from the record taken as a whole.\u201d <em>Hayes v. Department of the Navy, </em>727 F.2d 1535, 1537 (Fed.Cir.1984). This court\u2019s role is further circumscribed when reviewing a performance-based action taken under Chapter 43 of Title 5 of the United States Code. As the court stated in <em>Lisiecki v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>769 F.2d 1558, 1562 (Fed.Cir.1985) (quoting S.Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 10 (1978) U.S. Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Admin.News 1978, p. 2723):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuA\">both the Board and the courts should give deference to the judgment by each agency of the employee\u2019s performance in light of the agency\u2019s assessment of its own personnel needs and standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">If the error was procedural in nature, it is well settled that petitioner is required to demonstrate that the asserted procedural error was harmful. <em>Handy v. United States Postal Service, </em>754 F.2d 335, 337-38 (Fed.Cir.1985). If the error was substantive, the agency\u2019s action will not be sustained. <em>Wilson v. Department of Health and Human Services, </em>770 F.2d 1048, 1054 (Fed.Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-9\">The requirements incumbent upon an agency in effecting a proper Chapter 43 removal or demotion action are to set up an approved performance appraisal system, communicate the written performance standards and \u201ccritical elements\u201d of an employee\u2019s position to the employee at the beginning of the appraisal period, warn of inadequacies in \u201ccritical elements\u201d during the appraisal period, and counsel and afford an opportunity for improvement after proper notice. <em>Lovshin v. Department of the Navy, </em>767 F.2d 826, 834 (Fed.Cir.1985) (in banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 1523, 89 L.Ed.2d 921 (1986). If those requirements have been satisfied, \u201can agency may reduce in grade or remove an employee for receiving a rating of \u2018unacceptable\u2019 <em>with respect to even a single </em>\u2018critical element\u2019.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-15\">The first error alleged to have been committed by the agency in removing Martin is that he was denied a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance. Martin contends this right is a substantive statutory one, citing <em>Sandland v. General Services Administration, </em>23 M.S.P.R. 583 (MSPB 1984). In that case, the Board concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1105-16\">Based on the statute, the implementing regulations and the legislative history, we find that an employee\u2019s right to a reasonable opportunity to improve is a substantive right; indeed, it is one of the most important rights, benefiting both the employee and the agency, in the entire Chapter 43 appraisal scenario.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1105-17\">... The agency\u2019s evidentiary burden, therefore, includes proof that the safeguard provided by 5 U.S.C. Section 4302(b)(6), the only substantive right identified by OPM as a principal statutory requirement, and a necessary prerequisite for all actions brought under Chapter 43, was properly afforded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1105-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-19\">Martin\u2019s contention that he was not afforded \u201cthe statutory right to a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance\u201d is without merit. There is no required specific time period to demonstrate improvement. All that is required is notice of deficient performance and a reasonable opportunity to improve. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4303; <em>Lovshin, </em>767 F.2d at 834. The presiding official\u2019s findings that Martin \u201cwas given an opportunity to improve his performance prior to the initiation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>the adverse action against him\u201d and that the ninety-day period given to Martin \u201cwas sufficient opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance\u201d are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">As part of this argument Martin alleges that the agency failed to provide him adequate training, failed to consider his improved performance during the notice period, and erroneously focused on his pre-no-tice period conduct in its removal charges. We do not reach the issue whether any of these contentions would have been substantive, because we hold that no error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">As to training, the presiding official found that Martin\u2019s prior experience with another federal agency qualified him for a GS-11 position. He was given on-the-job training and was provided needed assistance from a senior specialist until Martin requested that the assistance cease because he understood the basics of his job. Martin was furnished handbooks, checklists, and other written materials on handling cases, attended formal courses in his field of specialty, and declined attendance at at least one other course on the basis that he did not need the training. Based on the foregoing, Martin\u2019s contention that he was given minimal instruction as to agency policies, practices, and procedures is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">Martin next contends that his performance improved during the ninety-day notice period. This, too, is meritless. In several of the instances, the unacceptable performance occurred after the notice of unacceptable performance was issued. As the presiding official found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1106-7\">It is unlikely that the appellant could have closed all of his cases during the ninety days for improvement, but he had an opportunity to bring his cases up to date and, through diligent action, resolve some of his cases. I find that the ninety days given to the appellant was sufficient opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">Pet. Brief at 24a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-9\">Lastly, it is irrelevant that many of the charges in the notice of proposed removal were based upon unacceptable performance which occurred prior to the date of the notice of deficient performance. The statute clearly provides that a removal decision may be based upon instances of unacceptable performance \u201cwhich occurred <em>during the 1-year period ending on the date of notice [of the proposed removal].\u201d </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4303(c)(2)(A) (emphasis added). Thus, reliance upon any incidents of unacceptable performance which occurred from October 17, 1983, through. October 17, 1984, was entirely proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-12\">The second alleged error committed by the agency in effecting Martin\u2019s removal is that the failure by the agency to provide performance reviews in accordance with paragraphs 14 and 22a of FAA Order 3400.13 constituted harmful procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-13\">Paragraph 14 of FAA Order 3400.13 provides that supervisors are required to conduct three appraisals during the appraisal period, the first being at the beginning of the period, the second at the end of the first six months and the final one during the last sixty days of the appraisal period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-14\">The record clearly demonstrates that more than three performance appraisal interviews were conducted during the appraisal period: the first in September 1983, shortly after which, in October or November 1983, Martin was issued a copy of his performance standards for comment; again in January 1984, and in April 1984, twice in June 1984, and finally in September 1984 after Martin\u2019s ninety-day improvement period had expired. Thus, the finding of the presiding official that \u201cthe agency did conduct the quarterly reviews with [Martin] that were required under agency regulations\u201d is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-15\">Martin\u2019s contention that these reviews were not \u201cquarterly reviews\u201d as envisioned by the agency regulations appar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>ently stems from a failure of proper documentation. Paragraph 22a of PAA Order 3400.13 provides that the results of \u201cperiodic meetings between the employee and the supervisor during the appraisal period must be documented and a copy provided to the employee.\u201d While it does appear that not all of the quarterly appraisals may have been documented properly, a failure solely of documentation \u2014 as opposed to not conducting the appraisals in fact \u2014 constitutes a procedural error. Martin is required to demonstrate that the procedural error was harmful. <em>Handy v. United States Postal Service, </em>754 F.2d 335, 337-38 (Fed.Cir.1985). Martin has not shown how he has been harmed by the error. <em>See Mercer v. Department of Health and Human Services, </em>772 F.2d 856 (Fed.Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
