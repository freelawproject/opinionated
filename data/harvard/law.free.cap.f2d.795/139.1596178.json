At that time, new language was added to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo (a), the statutory provision creating a Provider Reimbursement Review Board (\u201cPRRB\u201d) to resolve disputes over payment amounts. In Health Care Financing Administration Ruling (\u201cHCFAR\u201d) 84-1, however, the Secretary of Health and Human Services interpreted that amended provision to continue to require hospitals to await completion of a cost year and subsequent issuance of a Notice of Program Reimbursement (\u201cNPR\u201d) before challenging PPS payments before the PRRB. The District Court below reached the same conclusion as thirteen other district courts which have considered the Secretary\u2019s interpretation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> finding it to be in conflict with the language of \u00a7 1395oo(a) and therefore invalid. <em>Tucson Medical Center v. Heckler, </em>611 F.Supp. 823 (D.D.C.1985). We agree that HCFAR 84-1 is contrary to congressional intent as expressed in the plain language and legislative history of the 1983 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">A. <em>The Prior Scheme: Retrospective Reimbursement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">For cost reporting years beginning before October 1, 1983, hospitals were reimbursed for the \u201creasonable cost\u201d of inpatient hospital services furnished to Medicare patients. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395f(b) (1982). Under the \u201creasonable cost\u201d system, which continues to apply to a limited class of providers, fiscal intermediaries such as Blue Cross make estimated interim payments to providers during the year and later retroactively adjust them to bring the amount paid into conformity with the actual, reasonable costs incurred by the hospital. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.405, 405.454 (1985). At the end of a cost reporting year the hospital submits a cost report to the intermediary, which audits the report to determine which costs are reimbursable. The intermediary\u2019s conclusion as to the total amount of reimbursement due the provider is contained in a Notice of Program Reimbursement (\u201cNPR\u201d). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 405.406(b), 405.453(f), 405.1803(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">Under this retrospective payment system, a <em>final </em>determination of the correct amount of reimbursement cannot be made until after the end of the cost year and the issuance of the NPR. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 405.-405(b), 405.454(f)(1). Consequently, the statutory provisions controlling appeals to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (\u201cPRRB\u201d or \u201cBoard\u201d) require a hospital to have \u201cfiled a required cost report\u201d and to challenge only \u201ca final determination of the organization serving as its fiscal intermediary ... as to the amount of total program reimbursement due the provider.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo (a) (Supp. II 1984). Under this scheme it is clear that an appeal to the PRRB must await issuance of the NPR, which is the fiscal intermediary\u2019s \u201cfinal determination ... as to the amount of total program reimbursement.\u201d <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1803(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">B. <em>The 1983 Amendments: The Prospective Payment System</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-15\">The Social Security Amendments of 1983 instituted \u201ca major change in the method of payment under medicare for inpatient hospital services.\u201d S.Rep. No. 23, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 47, <em>reprinted in </em>1983 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 143, 187. Certain types of hospitals, such as psychiatric hospitals and children\u2019s hospitals, and certain types of costs, such as medical education, continue to be reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395ww(a)(4), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>1395ww(d)(l)(B) (Supp.. II 1984). For most hospitals, however, Medicare now pays for inpatient services on the basis of prospectively determined rates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Congress instituted the Prospective Payment System (\u201cPPS\u201d) in order \u201cto reform the financial incentives hospitals face, promoting efficiency in the provision of services by rewarding cost/effective hospital practices.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 25, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 132, <em>reprinted in </em>1983 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 219, 351. By informing hospitals in advance of the payments they will receive per patient for various types of treatment, Congress hoped to induce the hospitals to lower their costs to levels below the amount of the payments. After PPS has been phased in, hospitals will be paid according to a standard national rate calculated for each of approximately 470 treatment categories or \u201cDiagnosis Related Groups\u201d (\u201cDRGs\u201d). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d); 49 Fed.Reg. 34,728, 34,780-90 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In enacting PPS, Congress provided for a transition or \u201cphase-in period to minimize disruptions that might otherwise occur because of a sudden change in reimbursement policy.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 25 at 136, <em>reprinted in </em>1983 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News at 355. During this period, initially scheduled to last three years and recently extended to four years, PPS payments will be based on a blend of a \u201cDRG prospective payment rate\u201d and a \u201chospital\u2019s target amount.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(l)(A). The hospital\u2019s target amount, referred to in the regulations as the \u201chospital-specific rate,\u201d is based on the hospital\u2019s actual costs during a designated \u201cbase year.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 412.70-74. Over the course of the transition period, the proportion of the per-discharge payment which is based on the hospital\u2019s costs decreases from 75% to 25% while the proportion based on DRG amounts increases accordingly.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(l), <em>amended by </em>Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, Pub.L. No. 99-272, \u00a7 9102, 100 Stat. 82, 155 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">The 1983 amendments also altered the statutory provision governing hospitals\u2019 appeals of PPS payment amounts to the PRRB. The new language provides for appeals by \u201cany hospital which receives payments in amounts computed under [PPS]\u201d and \u201cis dissatisfied with a final determination of the Secretary as to the amount of payment under [PPS].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo (a). The meaning of these amendments to \u00a7 1395oo(a) is the central issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">C. <em>HCFAR 84-1 and the Hospitals\u2019 Appeals</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">Relying on the new language in \u00a7 1395oo (a), hospitals began appealing intermediaries\u2019 final determinations of the hospital-specific portion of their PPS rates. The Board accepted jurisdiction over at least 31 such appeals. Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 94-155. On May 29,1984, however, the Secretary issued HCFAR 84-1, reversing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Board\u2019s jurisdictional position, tary ruled that The Secre-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF-\">an intermediary\u2019s estimation of a hospital\u2019s base year costs and modifications thereto, made for purposes of determining the hospital-specific rate under PPS ... is neither a final determination of program reimbursement nor a notice of the amount of program reimbursement as required by the statute and regulations. Accordingly, the PRRB has jurisdiction to review an intermediary\u2019s [determination] ... only after an NPR has been issued for the hospital\u2019s first cost reporting period under the prospective payment system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-3\">49 Fed.Reg. 22,413, 22,415 (1984). An identical interpretation of \u00a7 1395oo(a) is contained in the PPS regulations. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.72(b)(1) (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Each of the hospitals in these consolidated cases attempted to appeal some aspect of the calculation of its target amount or hospital-specific rate to the PRRB. J.A. at 200-08.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Each had received a \u201cFinal Notice of Base Period Cost and Target Amount Per Discharge\u201d before filing the appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 187-99. In each case, the PRRB informed the hospital that under HCFAR 84-1, \u201csince an NPR has not been issued for the applicable PPS cost year, the Board is precluded from conducting a hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209-16. The hospitals then filed complaints in the District Court seeking declarations that HCFAR 84-1 is invalid and orders requiring the PRRB to process their appeals. <em>Id. </em>at 13-53. The District Court consolidated these cases, granted summary judgment for the hospitals, and ordered the requested relief. 611 F.Supp. at 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"ATs\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"AMu\">The Secretary argues that his interpretation of \u00a7 1395oo(a), embodied in HCFAR 84-1 and the PPS regulations, is entitled to substantial deference. The District Court declined to defer to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation, finding his position in HCFAR 84-1 to be inconsistent with other regulations and inadequately explained. 611 F.Supp. at 826-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">A court\u2019s first task in reviewing an agency\u2019s construction of a statute is to determine \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter.\u201d <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). If a statute is silent or ambiguous, a court may assume that Congress implicitly delegated the interpretive function to the agency, but no such delegation may be found where Congress\u2019 intent is clear. <em>Id. </em>at 842-44, 104 S.Ct. at 2781-82; <em>Montana v. Clark, </em>749 F.2d 740, 745 (D.C.Cir.1984) (\u201cdeference to an agency\u2019s interpretation constitutes a <em>judicial </em>determination that Congress has delegated the norm-elaboration function to the agency\u201d and it would be absurd to assume that \u201cCongress delegated authority to vitiate or disregard its intent\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 246, 88 L.Ed.2d 255 (1985) . In short, \u201c[t]he traditional deference courts pay to agency interpretation is not to be applied to alter the clearly expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System v. Dimension Financial Corp., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 681, 686, 88 L.Ed.2d 691 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">Our inquiry into congressional intent encompasses both statutory language and legislative history. In conducting this inquiry, \u201cwe are not required to grant any particular deference to the agency\u2019s parsing of statutory language or its interpretation of legislative history.\u201d <em>Rettig v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., </em>744 F.2d 133, 141 (D.C.Cir.1984). By independently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>assessing congressional intent, the court ensures that \u201cdeference is not ... a device that emasculates the significance of judicial review____ A reviewing court \u2018must reject administrative constructions of [a] statute ... that are inconsistent with the statutory mandate or that frustrate the policy that Congress sought to implement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Securities Industry Association v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, </em>468 U.S. 137, 104 S.Ct. 2979, 2983, 82 L.Ed.2d 107 (1984) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The District Court concluded that \u201cthe plain language added to section 1395 oo (a) as part of the prospective payment system enacted by Congress in 1983 establishes that a determination such as the one made by the intermediary here is reviewable by the [PRRB] before an NPR is issued.\u201d 611 F.Supp. at 827. After independently assessing congressional intent, we reach the same conclusion, obviating any decision as to whether the District Court or the Secretary has the better of the deference debate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">B. <em>Statutory Language</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The many district courts which have interpreted \u00a7 1395oo(a) to permit PPS appeals prior to issuance of an NPR have, like the Eleventh Circuit, observed that the statute \u201cappear[s] to set up two different avenues of appeal for hospitals receiving medicare payments.\u201d <em>Charter Medical Corp. v. Bowen, </em>788 F.2d 728, 732 (11th Cir.1986) (dicta). The statute provides that [a]ny provider of services which has filed a required cost report within the time specified in regulations may obtain a hearing with respect to such cost report by a Provider Reimbursement Review Board ... <em>and ... any hospital which receives payments in amounts computed under subsection (b) or (d) of section 1395ww of this title and which has submitted such reports within such time as the Secretary may require in order to make payment under such section may obtain a hearing with respect to such payment by the Board, </em>if\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">(1) such provider\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMt\"><em>(A)(i) </em>is dissatisfied with a final determination of the organization serving as its fiscal intermediary ... as to the amount of total program reimbursement due the provider ..., <em>or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-13\">\n<em>(ii) is dissatisfied with a final determination of the Secretary as to the amount of the payment under subsection (b) or (d) of section 1395ww of this title, . . .</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-14\">(2) the amount in controversy is $10,-000 or more, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-15\">(3) such provider files a request for a hearing within 180 days after notice of the intermediary\u2019s final determination under paragraph <em>(1)(A)(i), or with respect to appeals under paragraph (l)(A)(ii), 180 days after notice of the Secretary\u2019s final </em>determination____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-17\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo (a) (Supp. II 1984). The references to subsections (b) and- (d) of \u00a7 1395ww are to provisions on calculating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>PPS payments.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The italicized portions were added by the Social Security Amendments of 1983. Pub.L. No. 98-21, \u00a7 602(h)(1), 97 Stat. 65, 165 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Viewing the amendments as a whole, we are inescapably drawn to the same conclusion as the District Court: \u00a7 1395oo (a) \u201cclearly contemplates two different kinds of appeal. One begins when the intermediary issues an NPR; the other, when the intermediary issues a notice of what will be paid under the PPS system.\u201d 611 F.Supp. at 825. Congress added new language to three different places in the statute in order to create parallel provisions for cost reimbursement and PPS appeals governing who may appeal, what determination may be appealed, and when an appeal must be filed. Our overall impression that Congress created a dual system to reflect the two different methods of calculating Medicare payments is further strengthened by considering the key changes separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">The opening portion of \u00a7 1395oo(a) defines who may appeal to the PRRB.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Secretary argues that the new language was intended solely to extend coverage of the old appeals route to PPS payments. Were that the case, however, no change at all would have been necessary in the opening paragraph. Under the interpretation contained in HCFAR 84-1, the only hospitals which can appeal PPS payments to the PRRB are those which have \u201cfiled a required cost report\u201d and are seeking \u201ca hearing with respect to such cost report\u201d\u2014 the same class of providers already specified in the pre-1983 statute. To accept the Secretary\u2019s interpretation we must assume that Congress added sixty words to the opening paragraph of \u00a7 1395oo(a) for no reason at all. This we cannot do consistently with our obligation to construe a statute so as \u201cto give effect, if possible, to every word Congress used.\u201d <em>Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., </em>442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 2331, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979); <em>see Young v. Community Nutrition Institute, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 2360, -, 90 L.Ed.2d 959 (1986) (upholding agency interpretation which does not render the statutory provision superfluous).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-18\">The effect of the new language in the opening paragraph of \u00a7 1395oo (a), contrary to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation, is to eliminate the requirement that PPS recipients file a cost report prior to appeal. <em>See Redbud Hospital District v. Heckler, </em>Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) \u00b6 34,085 at 9884 (N.D.Cal. July 30, 1984) [Available on WESTLAW, DCTU database]. The pre1983 language required the filing of \u201ca required cost report\u201d but the new language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>only requires hospitals which receive PPS payments to file \u201csuch reports ... as the Secretary may require in order to make payment under [PPS].\u201d Because Congress chose different language to describe the two different types of reports, we must \u201cpresume that Congress intended the terms to have different meanings.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Turnage, </em>750 F.2d 1086, 1091 (1984), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>755 F.2d 967 (D.C.Cir.1985). In addition, a cost report is not necessary \u201cin order [for the Secretary] to make payment under [PPS].\u201d Under the cost reimbursement system, \u201c[s]ince actual costs of services cannot be determined until the end of the accounting period, the providers must be paid on an estimated cost basis during the year.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.-454(b) (1985). Under the reimbursement system, their final payments cannot be made until a cost report has been filed and verified. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 405.454(f). Under PPS, in contrast, payment amounts are independent of current costs and can be determined with finality prior to the beginning of the cost year. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 412.71(d). Thus a year-end cost report is <em>not </em>a report which is necessary in order for the Secretary to make PPS payments, and the appeals provision applicable to PPS recipients cannot be read to require hospitals to file cost reports and await NPRs prior to filing a PRRB appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Congress\u2019 intent to eliminate the NPR requirement for PPS appeals is, however, most clearly revealed in the addition of subsection (l)(A)(ii). Prior to 1983, a provider of services could appeal to the PRRB when it was \u201cdissatisfied with a final determination of the organization serving as its fiscal intermediary ... as to the amount of total program reimbursement.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo (a)(1)(A) (1982). As the Secretary points out, Congress had to alter this language about \u201creimbursement\u201d to accommodate the new prospective payment system. This change alone, however, could have been made by adding a word or two to subsection (1)(A). Indeed, in other portions of the 1983 amendments Congress managed the switch from the language of reimbursement to that of PPS payments quite economically. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pub.L. No. 98-21 at \u00a7 602(h)(4), 97 Stat. at 165 (replacing \u201ccost reimbursement\u201d in \u00a7 1395oo(h) with \u201cpayment of providers of services\u201d). Instead, in this instance Congress added an entire new subsection which the Secretary\u2019s interpretation would effectively reduce \u201cto mere surplusage.\u201d 611 F.Supp. at 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The existing subsection on cost reimbursement appeals refers specifically to the NPR, which contains the intermediary\u2019s determination \u201cas to the amount of total program reimbursement.\u201d By adding subsection (l)(A)(ii), which contains no such reference to NPRs, Congress expressed its clear intention to change the prerequisites for PPS appeals. The new subsection refers to a determination of \u201cthe amount of the payment under subsection (b) or (d) of section 1395ww of this title.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo (a)(l)(A)(ii). Since everyone agrees that the phrase \u201camount of total program reimbursement\u201d in subsection (l)(A)(i) refers to the NPR, the amendment referring to the \u201camount of the payment under [PPS]\u201d must refer to something other than the NPR. <em>See Wilson v. Turnage, </em>750 F.2d at 1091 (use of different language demonstrates that Congress intended different meanings).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The statute itself explains what Congress meant by \u201cthe amount of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>payment under subsection (b) or (d) of section 1395ww.\u201d Section 1395ww(d) contains the methods for calculating PPS payments, including payments during the transition period. During that period, \u201cthe amount of the payment with respect to the operating costs of inpatient hospital services ... for inpatient hospital discharges in a cost reporting period\u201d is the weighted sum of \u201cthe hospital\u2019s target amount\u201d and a \u201cDRG prospective payment rate.\u201d The proportions of these two components are fixed by statute; the DRG prospective payment rate is fixed by the Secretary and is not subject to judicial review. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395ww(d)(l)(A), 1395ww(d)(7)(B); <em>see supra </em>at 6. Thus, the only variable factor in the final determination as to the amount of payment under \u00a7 1395ww(d) is the hospital\u2019s target amount, which the Secretary refers to as the hospital-specific rate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This target amount is defined . in \u00a7 1395ww(b)(3)(A) as a hospital\u2019s allowable operating costs during a fixed twelve month period.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The Secretary argues that the \u201camount of payment\u201d referred to in subsection (l)(A)(ii) is the total amount of PPS payments plus cost reimbursement, a figure calculated only in the NPR. The plain statutory language indicates otherwise. The subsection refers to the amount of payment under \u00a7 1395ww(d), which is the sum of a DRG per-patient rate and a target amount per patient. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(l)(A); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1395ww(a)(4), 1395ww(b)(3)(A) (target amount is per patient). In addition, differences in phrasing between subsection (l)(A)(i) on reimbursement and subsection (l)(A)(ii) on PPS payments indicate that Congress was referring to per-patient amounts in the latter subsection. Cost reimbursement appeals are from determinations of <em>\u201ctotal </em>program reimbursement ... for the <em>period </em>covered by [the cost] report,\u201d while PPS appeals are from determinations of the \u201camount of the [PPS] payment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1395oo (a)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Congress\u2019 omission of \u201ctotal\u201d and \u201cperiod\u201d as modifiers in subsection (l)(A)(ii) is a clear signal that the statute refers to per-patient amounts rather than the overall figures contained in the NPR.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Although the 1983 amendments are linguistically complicated, their semantic twists and turns do not obscure the fact that Congress has \u201cunambiguously expressed its intent through its choice of statutory language.\u201d <em>Young v. Community Nutrition Institute, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 2360, 2364, 90 L.Ed.2d 959 (1986).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The amount of payment to hospitals during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>the PPS transition period is a weighted sum of a hospital-specific amount and a DRG amount, with the weights and the DRG amount fixed by statute or the Secretary. Thus, once there is a final determination as to the hospital-specific amount there is a final determination as to the amount of payment as required \u2022 by \u00a7 1395oo (a)(l)(A)(ii). That amount is the per-patient amount calculated under \u00a7 1395ww(d) and is final once the Secretary has published the DRG amounts (as he has) and finally determined the hospital\u2019s target amount.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Here each of the hospitals has received a \u201cFinal Notice of Base Period Cost and Target Amount Per Discharge.\u201d The statute requires no more to trigger the hospitals\u2019 right to appeal PPS payments to the PRRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">C. <em>Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Our \u201cplain meaning\u201d reading of the statutory language is confirmed by the legislative history of the 1983 amendments. Although the Secretary invokes legislative history to support his interpretation in HCFAR 84-1, he focuses too narrowly on some descriptive language in the reports while overlooking the clearly-expressed purpose of the 1983 amendments as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Congress\u2019 primary purpose in switching from cost reimbursement to prospective payment was to provide hospitals with \u201cpredictibility regarding payment amounts\u201d and \u201cto reform the financial incentives hospitals face, promoting efficiency in the provision of services by rewarding cost/effective hospital practices.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 25, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 132, <em>reprinted in </em>1983 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 219, 351. Because the key to the PPS system is the hospital\u2019s advance knowledge of the amount of payment it will receive, payment rates must be determined with finality prior to the beginning of the hospital\u2019s cost year. Our \u201cplain meaning\u201d reading of the 1983 amendments effectuates the overriding congressional intent expressed in the legislative history by hastening the process of review so that a hospital will know at the earliest possible date exactly how much it will be paid per patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">A hospital\u2019s need to know in advance how much it will receive under PPS applies during the transition period as well. In order to ensure that PPS rates during the transition period would be determined with finality prior to the start of the fiscal year, Congress authorized the Secretary to rely on estimates of base year costs rather than to wait for issuance of the base year NPR. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>The conference report emphasizes that \u201cthe hospital\u2019s specific portion of the rate must be determined in advance of the hospital\u2019s fiscal year under the system.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 47, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 182, <em>reprinted in </em>1983 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 404, 472. By withholding PRRB review until an NPR has been issued, long after the close of the hospital\u2019s fiscal year, the Secretary \u201cfrustrate[s] the policy that Congress sought to implement.\u201d <em>Securities Industry Association v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, </em>468 U.S. 137, 104 S.Ct. 2979, 2983, 82 L.Ed.2d 107 (1984).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Although the Secretary acknowledges this legislative history in the portions of his brief describing the PPS scheme, Brief for Appellant at 7-11, he fails to acknowledge its import in construing \u00a7 1395oo(a). Instead, he focuses on two narrower aspects of the legislative history. First, he notes that the changes in \u00a7 1395oo (a) were included among the conforming amendments in the 1983 statute. As the hospitals point out, however, changes in the timing of PRRB review were necessary to \u201cconform\u201d to the radical changes made in the method of calculating Medicare payments. Under PPS, hospitals receive prospectively established payments rather than retrospectively established reimbursements. Under our reading of the statutory language, \u00a7 1395 oo (a) simply conforms the PRRB review process to this change in the method of calculating Medicare payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The Secretary relies heavily on language in the congressional reports stating that the amendments \u201cprovide for the same procedures for administrative and judicial review of payments under the prospective system, as is currently provided for cost-based payments. In general, the same conditions, which now apply for review by the PRRB and the courts, would continue to apply.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 25 at 143, <em>reprinted in </em>1983 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 362; <em>see also </em>S.Rep. No. 23, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 57, <em>reprinted in </em>1983 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 143, 197. But, as one district court has noted, \u201c \u2018[i]n general\u2019 implies that, \u2018in particular\u2019, some of the conditions would change.\u201d <em>Greenville Hospital System v. Heckler, </em>642 F.Supp. 15, 21 (D.S.C.1985), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>No. 85-1860 (4th Cir. Dec. 18, 1985). The conditions in \u00a7 1395oo(a) were changed only to conform the basic principles of PRRB review to the new payment approach under PPS. Certainly descriptive language in congressional reports as general as these references cannot override the plain meaning of the statutory language in which Congress has directly expressed its intentions. The legislative history cited by the Secretary thus fails to alter our reading of Congress\u2019 intent in amending \u00a7 1395oo(a). _ . .</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">HCFAR 84-1 is contrary to congressional intent as expressed in the language and legislative history of the 1983 amendments to \u00a7 1395oo(a). The statute provides for PRRB review once there has been a final determination of the amount of payment under PPS, which during the transition period requires only a final determination of a hospital\u2019s target amount. Hospitals therefore heed not wait until an NPR has been issued to challenge the hospital-specific portion of transition-period PPS rates. We hold that HCFAR 84-1 is inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>with the statute and that the PRRB erred in refusing jurisdiction over the hospitals\u2019 claims. The order of the District Court is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"Api\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-11\">. The plaintiff hospitals have identified thirteen district court opinions rejecting the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1395oo (a) embodied in HCFAR 84-1. Brief of Plaintiffs/Appellees at 1-2; Supplemental Memorandum at 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\">. The amendments create a <em>prospective </em>payment system, not a <em>prepayment </em>system as the District Court stated. 611 F.Supp. at 826. The term \"prepayment\" describes a method of distributing payments and implies that hospitals actually receive payments before treating a patient. The primary difference between cost reimbursement and prospective payment, however, is the manner in which payments are computed, not distributed. Under PPS the amount of payment per discharge is fixed in advance, is not based on a hospital\u2019s actual costs, and is not subject to retroactive adjustment. Hospitals receive these payments periodically, based either on actual discharges or on estimates as to the number and mix of cases. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.454(m) (1985). By contrast, reasonable cost payments are only estimates of the amount that will eventually be found to be reimbursable, so the amount of payment per patient is subject to retroactive adjustment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 405.454(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b250-14\">. As amended in April 1986, the statute sets the target percentage \u2014 the proportion of the PPS payment based on a hospital\u2019s actual costs \u2014 at 75% for the year beginning October 1, 1983, 50% for the next year, 45% for the third year, and 25% for the fourth and final transition year. The DRG percentage accordingly rises from 25% in the first year to 50% in the second, 55% in the third, and 75% in the fourth transition year. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(l)(C), <em>amended by </em>Pub.L. No. 99-272, \u00a7 9102(b), 100 Stat. 82, 155 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b251-6\">. Each of these hearing requests alleged that the amount in controversy was $10,000 or more, as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo (a)(2), countering the Secretary\u2019s contention that an amount in controversy cannot be calculated until an NPR has been issued. The hospitals simply multiplied the disputed per-patient amount by the number of Medicare patients they had discharged during the base year. <em>See </em>J.A. at 200-OS.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b252-9\">. We note, however, that the District Court may have erred in characterizing the Secretary\u2019s position on the need for an NPR as a \u201creversal of what until then had been the Secretary\u2019s consistent interpretation of the jurisdictional statute.\u201d 611 F.Supp. at 826. The Secretary seems to have consistently required issuance of an NPR before allowing appeal of PPS payments to the Board. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.1801(a)(l)(iii)-(iv), 405.1835(b), 48 Fed.Reg. 39,752, 39,834-35 (1983) (interim final PPS regulations); 49 Fed. Reg. 234, 279 (1984) (discussion in preamble to final regulations). Any PRRB decisions to the contrary do not establish an inconsistency in the Secretary\u2019s position. <em>See St. Francis Hospital Center v. Heckler, </em>714 F.2d 872, 874 (7th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1022, 104 S.Ct. 1274, 79 L.Ed.2d 679 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-19\">Any inconsistency in the Secretary\u2019s position arises because there seem to be two different sets of regulations which address the extent to which an intermediary\u2019s determination of the hospital-specific portion is \u201cfinal.\" <em>Compare </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1801(a) (NPR is the final PPS determination for purposes of appealability) <em>with </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.71(d) (intermediary\u2019s determination of target amount is final). While these conflicting regulations need to be reconciled or rejected, <em>see infra </em>at 148 &amp; n. 11, they do not represent a \u201creversal\u201d in the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1395oo (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b253-9\">. Subsection (d) of \u00a7 1395ww sets out methods for calculating PPS payments and refers to subsection (b) for an explanation of how to calculate a hospital\u2019s target amount. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395ww(d)(l)(A)(i)(I),1395ww(d)(l)(A)(ii)(I). At oral argument, the Secretary contended for the first time that subsection (b), added to the Medicare statute in 1982, involves cost reimbursement and so supports his argument that a single appeals process applies for both reimbursement and PPS payments. The mentions of \u00a7 1395ww(b) in \u00a7 1395oo(a), are, however, more easily read as referring only to the method for calculating the target amount which is included in subsection (b). The 1983 amendments to \u00a7 1395oo (a), both as proposed in the House and as adopted by Congress, referred only to subsection (d), which solely involves PPS payments. H.R.Rep. No. 25, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 291 (1983); H.R.Rep. No. 47, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 106 (1983) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1983, p. 143. The references to subsection (b) were added in a concurrent resolution after final passage of the amendments; the modifications made at that point were said not to make any substantive changes. H.R.Con.Res. 102, \u00a7 6(12), 98th Cong., 1st Sess., 129 Cong. Rec. HI824, H1826 (daily ed. April 7, 1983); 129 Cong.Rec. H1824 (daily ed. April 7, 1983) (statement of Rep. Pickle). Thus, the last minute addition of references to subsection (b) should not be read to expand the scope of the 1983 amendments from PPS appeals to both PPS and cost reimbursement appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b253-20\">. The Secretary correctly notes that the phrase \u201cany hospital which receives [PPS] payments\u201d simply defines which providers may appeal to the PRRB under \u00a7 1395oo(a). We therefore reject the hospitals\u2019 convoluted argument that they are entitled to immediate review of PPS payments because the . verb \u201creceives\" is in the present tense. The hospitals are entitled to review only when PPS payment amounts have been <em>finally </em>determined within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo (a)(l)(A)(ii). <em>See infra </em>at 148 &amp;n. 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b254-5\">. Our conclusion that Congress did not intend that cost reports would be required for PPS recipients seeking to appeal to the PRRB is bolstered by another provision of the 1983 amendments which directs the Secretary to continue requiring cost reporting by recipients of PPS payments. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(f)(l) (Supp.II 1984). The reason for the continuing requirement of cost reports was that Congress thought such reports would not otherwise be required from PPS recipients and wanted to ensure a continuing flow of information for states which relied on such reports for their own reimbursement programs. H.R.Rep. No. 47, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 182, <em>reprinted in </em>1983 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 404, 472. Thus, Congress seemingly thought that PPS recipients would not have to file cost reports at all absent its special directive to the Secretary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b255-6\">. In arguing that determination of the hospital-specific portion of the PPS payment is not a final determination of the \"amount of payment\u201d for purposes of subsection (l)(A)(ii), the Secretary stresses that the intermediary has only made a final determination of the hospital-specific <em>rate, </em>not the entire payment <em>amount. </em>The phrase \u201chospital specific rate\u201d is, however, the product of the Secretary\u2019s own regulations. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 412.70, 412.73. The statute itself refers to the hospital-specific portion of the PPS payment as the target <em>amount. </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(l)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\">. Several aspects of \u00a7 1395oo (a) reinforce our conclusion that congressional intent is clear and there has been no implicit delegation of authority to the Secretary to interpret the review provision. <em>See supra </em>at 143-144. One factor is the specificity of the statutory language at issue. When Congress uses broad and imprecise language, courts may assume that the agency has been delegated broad interpretive authority. <em>See AFL-CIO v. Donovan, </em>757 F.2d 330, 341 n. 7 (D.C.Cir.1985). By contrast, specific statutory language which is \u201cthe fruit [] of a conscious congressional effort to detail\u201d the scope of an agency\u2019s powers should not be read as conferring interpretive discretion on the agency. <em>Vanguard Interstate Tours, Inc. v. ICC, </em>735 F.2d 591, 596 (D.C.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">A second consideration is the fact that \u00a7 1395 oo(a) deals with procedures for challenging agency actions, not the substance of those actions. In <em>Vanguard </em>we rejected an .agency interpretation, finding that Congress had not accorded the agency broad discretion in interpreting the statutory provision governing who could intervene in its proceedings. 735 F.2d at 596. In general, Congress is less likely to delegate interpretive authority to agencies on basic procedural matters \u2014 such as rights of access to challenge or obtain judicial review of agency rulings \u2014 than it is on substantive matters such as when and what to regulate. In <em>Chevron, </em>the Court was most concerned with judicial intrusion into policy battles which Congress had either inadvertently failed to resolve or intentionally left to the agency to resolve. <em>Chevron, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 865-66, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2793-94, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <em>see also Young, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 2360, 90 L.Ed.2d 959 (1986) (upholding an agency\u2019s interpretation of its regulatory authority under a health and safety statute). By contrast, the Supreme Court did not even cite <em>Chevron </em>in a recent decision which rejected the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of statutory provisions governing the availability of judicial review of Medicare Part B determinations; the Court simply assessed the language and legislative history of the provisions and concluded that the agency\u2019s interpretation was contrary to Congress\u2019 clearly expressed intent. <em>Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 2133, 2137, 2142, 90 L.Ed.2d 623 (1986); <em>see also Bowen v. New York, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, &amp; n. 10, 106 S.Ct. 2022, 2027, 2029, &amp; n. 10, 90 L.Ed.2d 462 (1986) (rejecting agency interpretation of provision governing time for seeking judicial review).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b256-7\">. The statute requires that a determination as to the amount of PPS payments be final before it can be appealed to the PRRB. The Secretary does not dispute that his regulations specify that the intermediary\u2019s determination of a hospital\u2019s target amount per patient is final, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.71(d), but argues instead that only an NPR is a \"final determination\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1395oo (a), 42 C.F.r!. \u00a7 405.1801(a)(3). We have already rejected (he NPR requirement as inconsistent with the statutory scheme \u2014 nothing in the statute or legislative history supports the Secretary\u2019s position that he is authorized to impose an additional requirement of finality in the form of an NPR once the hospital\u2019s target amount has been set with finality pursuant to \u00a7 1395ww(d) and the implementing regulations. Because the Secretary\u2019s own regulations characterize the fiscal intermediary\u2019s setting of the hospital-specific rate as final, we find that the intermediary\u2019s determination of the hospital-specific portion completes the \"final determination\u201d of PPS payment amounts referred to in 1395oo (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\">. Although HCFAR 84-1 frustrates congressional intent by delaying PRRB review until long after hospitals have received their PPS payments, the Secretary\u2019s interpretation does not\u2014 as some district courts have mistakenly held\u2014 interact with another regulation to bar any review whatsoever. Plaintiffs here did not base their argument on this second regulation, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.72(a)(3)(ii) (1985), which is often referred to as the prospective relief rule. That. regulation applies only to appeals involving the NPR for the base year, which is used to calculate the hospital-specific portion. The regulation provides that the results of such base-year appeals will only be applied prospectively. <em>See Charter Medical Corp. </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>788 F.2d 728, 734-35 (11th Cir. 1986). Like HCFAR 84-1, the effect of the prospective relief regulation is to delay the point at which a hospital will definitively know the exact amount of its PPS payments, but the two regulations \u2014 either separately or together \u2014 do not completely bar relief for hospitals whose hospital-specific rates have been set erroneously.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
