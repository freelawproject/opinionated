The Blue Creek Unit consists of 76,500 acres located in the Siski-you Mountains. The Forest Service has inventoried approximately 31,500 of these acres as a roadless area.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On its northern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>boundary, the Blue Creek Unit adjoins the Eightmile and Siskiyou inventoried road-less areas. Blue Creek, the stream after which the Unit was named, flows into the Klamath River and contains important spawning habitat for several anadromous fish species. <em>Northwest Indian Cemetry Protective Ass\u2019n. v. Peterson, </em>565 F.Supp. 586, 590 (N.D.Cal.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Contained within the Blue Creek Unit is an area known as the \u201chigh country,\u201d which is considered sacred by Yurok, Ka-rok, and Tolowa Indians who live in the surrounding region. Although the Indians use specific sites within the \u201chigh country\u201d for prayer and religious purposes, the sacred area encompasses the entire region, not just the individual sites. <em>Id. </em>at 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">In 1972, the Forest Service began to prepare a multiple-use management plan and environmental impact statement (EIS) for the management of the Blue Creek and Eightmile Planning Units within the Six Rivers National Forest. In 1974 and 1975, the Forest Service circulated a draft, supplemental draft and final EIS which proposed various land use management plans for the Blue Creek Unit. In 1981, the \u201cBlue Creek Unit Implementation Plan\u201d (Management Plan) proposed to permit harvesting of 733 million board feet of Douglas fir from the Blue Creek Unit over an 80 year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">In 1977, the Forest Service issued another draft EIS that proposed alternative routes to complete construction of the last 6.02 miles (Chimney Rock Section) of a paved road from Gasquet, California to Orleans, California (G-0 Road). In 1982, the final EIS was issued for the proposed construction of the Chimney Rock Section through the Blue Creek Unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Plaintiffs objected to both proposed projects and, after exhausting administrative remedies, filed these actions in the district court. <em>Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association, et al. v. Peterson </em>was brought by the Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association (seven non-profit corporations and unincorporated associations), four individual plaintiffs of American Indian heritage, and two Sierra Club members. <em>State of California v. Block </em>was brought by the State of California acting through its Native American Heritage Commission. The complaints alleged that the Forest Service decisions to construct the Chimney Rock Section of road and to timber the Blue Creek Unit violated: (1) the first amendment of the United States Constitution; (2) the American Indian Freedom of Religion Act of 1978 (AIFRA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1996; (3) the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 <em>et seq., </em>and the Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131 <em>et seq.; </em>(4) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251 <em>et seq.; </em>(5) water and fishing rights reserved to American Indians on the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation, and defendants\u2019 trust responsibility to protect those rights; (6) the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706; (7) the Multi-Use Sustained-Yield Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 528-531; and (8) the National Forest Management Act of 1976, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1600 et <em>seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">Prior to trial, the district court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction on the understanding that no road construction would begin prior to a ruling on the merits. <em>Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Ass\u2019n. v. Peterson, </em>552 F.Supp. 951 (N.D.Cal.1982). After a full trial on the merits, the district court found that the challenged Forest Service decisions violated: (1) the first amendment; (2) NEPA and the Wilderness Act; (3) FWPCA; (4) Indian water and fishing rights on the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation, and defendants\u2019 trust responsibility to protect those rights; and (5) the Administrative Procedure Act. <em>Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Ass\u2019n. v. Peterson, </em>565 F.Supp. at 591. The district court accordingly issued an injunction: (1) preventing construction of the G-0 road and any timber harvesting or construction of logging roads in the high country; (2) prevent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>ing timber harvesting or construction of logging roads in the Blue Creek Roadless Area until an EIS was prepared evaluating its wilderness potential as part of adjoining roadless areas; and (3) enjoining timber harvesting and construction of logging roads anywhere in the Blue Creek Unit until an EIS was prepared specifying adequate measures to mitigate the impact of those activities on water quality and fish habitat in Blue Creek, and until studies were completed demonstrating that the proposed logging activities would not violate the FWPCA or reduce the supply of anadromous fish to the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation. <em>Id. </em>at 606. The government appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">While the appeal was pending in this court, Congress enacted the California Wilderness Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-425, 98 Stat. 1619 (1984), which was signed by the President on September 28, 1984. The Act places in wilderness, and out of the reach of logging, most but not all of the high country encompassed by that part of district court\u2019s injunction that is based on the first amendment. The Act left open a 1200 foot-wide corridor for completion of the G-0 Road, but Congress appears to have intended not to take any position on whether the Road should be completed. <em>See </em>H.R. Rep. No. 98-40, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 32; S.Rep. No. 98-582, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 29; 130 Cong.Rec. No. 113, pp. 18-19 (H.Rep. Sept. 12, 1984) (Remarks of Cong. Seiber-ling).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">On this appeal we address the following issues raised by the Forest Service:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">(1) Whether the district court erred in enjoining road construction and timbering in the high country of the Blue Creek Unit on the ground that such activity would impermissibly burden the Indian plaintiffs\u2019 first amendment right to the free exercise of their religion;</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">(2) Whether the district court erred in holding that the EISs prepared for the road and land management plans failed adequately to discuss the effects on water quality of the proposed actions;</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">(3) Whether the district court erred in holding that Forest Service\u2019s proposed actions would violate the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and state water quality standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b799-14\">I. First Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b799-15\">The first amendment prohibits governmental actions that burden an individual\u2019s free exercise of religion unless those actions are necessary to fulfill a governmental interest of the highest order that cannot be met in a less restrictive manner. <em>See Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 214-15, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1532-33, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972); <em>Sherbert v. Vemer, </em>374 U.S. 398, 403-09, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 1793-96, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963). In this case the government challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that certain proposed Forest Service management decisions, if implemented, would impermissibly burden the Indian plaintiffs\u2019 free exercise rights. Further, the government contends that even if its action would impose such a burden, it has demonstrated a governmental interest sufficient to override the Indians\u2019 religious interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-16\">A. Free Exercise Right</p>\n<p id=\"b799-17\">To establish a constitutionally valid free exercise claim, the Indian plaintiffs have the initial burden of demonstrating that governmental actions create a burden on their rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See School District of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number><em>Abington Township v. Schempp, </em>374 U.S. 203, 223, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 1572, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963); <em>Wilson v. Block, </em>708 F.2d 735, 740 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 956, 104 S.Ct. 371, 78 L.Ed.2d 330 (1983). That the Indians use the Blue Creek high country area for religious purposes and consider the area sacred is not enough to characterize the contemplated Forest Service actions as a burden on free exercise rights. The Indians have to show that the area at issue is indispensable and central to their religious practices and beliefs, and that the proposed governmental actions would seriously interfere with or impair those religious practices. <em>Wilson v. Block, </em>708 F.2d at 742-44; <em>Sequoyah v. TVA, </em>620 F.2d 1159, 1164 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 953, 101 S.Ct. 357, 66 L.Ed.2d 216 (1980); <em>Crow v. Gullet, </em>541 F.Supp. 785, 792 (D.S.D.1982), aff<em>'d, </em>706 F.2d 856 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 977, 104 S.Ct. 413, 78 L.Ed.2d 351 (1983).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-4\">The district court here found that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKT\">[f]or generations, individual members, spiritual leaders, and medicine persons of the Yurok, Karok, and Tolowa tribes have traveled to the high country to communicate with the \u201cgreat creator,\u201d to perform rituals, and to prepare for specific religious and medicinal ceremonies. Such use of the high country is \u201ccentral and indispensable\u201d to the Indian plaintiffs\u2019 religion____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-5\">Communication with the \u201cgreat creator\u201d is possible in the high country because of the pristine environment and opportunity for solitude found there. Construction of the Chimney Rock Section and/or the harvesting of timber in the high country, including \u201cclear-cutting,\u201d would seriously damage the salient visual, aural, and environmental qualities of the high country. The Forest Service\u2019s own study concluded that \u201c[intrusions on the sanctity of the Blue Creek high country are ... potentially destructive of the very core of Northwest [Indian] religious beliefs and practices.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">We agree with the district court that the proposed operations would interfere with the Indian plaintiffs\u2019 free exercise rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">There is a great deal of evidence in the record that the high country<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is indispensable to a significant number of Indian healers and religious leaders as a place where they receive the \u201cpower\u201d that permits them to fill the religious roles that are central to the traditional religions. There is abundant evidence that the unitary pristine nature of the high country is essential to this religious use.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, there is much evidence that the religious lives of many other Indians depends upon the services of those leaders who have received the necessary \u201cpower\u201d in the high country. On all of these points, there is virtually no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">The record also amply supports, indeed virtually compels, the conclusion that logging and the construction of logging roads would be utterly inconsistent with the Indians\u2019 religious practices. Because most of the high country has now been designated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>by Congress as a wilderness area, the issue of logging becomes less significant, although it does not disappear. The question of the completion of the G-0 Road, however, retains its full vitality.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">A substantial part of the evidence relied upon by the district court was the report prepared for the Forest Service by Dr. Theodoratus, <em>Cultural Resources of the Chimney Rock Section, Gasquet-Orleans Road, Six Rivers National Forest </em>(1979) (\u201cTheodoratus Report\u201d). That Report was not at all equivocal about the Road:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-5\">[T]he completion of the G-0 Road <em>via any of the proposed Chimney Rock alternatives (Routes 1-9) </em>will produce an irreparable impact on the spiritual and physical well-being of the adjacent Yu-rok, Karok and Tolowa communities. Such impact will be created through the degradation of salient environmental qualities pertinent to the power quests of medicinal and spiritual practitioners who serve these communities. It is recommended, therefore, that such an impact is, in fact, sufficient to justify the rejection of all proposed routes (Routes 1-9) of the Chimney Rock section of the G-0 Road.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 422 (emphasis original). While much of the adverse impact would be indirect, from increased uses made possible by the Road, the geographic and design features of the Road itself supply part of the impact. <em>Id. </em>at 417. At least one witness testified that noise levels from the proposed Road would interfere with religious uses of the high country. We conclude that the Indian plaintiffs demonstrated that the Road would interfere with the free exercise of their religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">The fact that the proposed government operations would virtually destroy the plaintiff Indians\u2019 ability to practice their religion differentiates this case from <em>Bowen v. Roy, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 2147, 90 L.Ed.2d 735 (1986). There the Court held that an Indian could not, on religious grounds, prevent the government from using a social security number that it had assigned to the Indian\u2019s child for purposes of providing governmental benefits. The Court stated: \u201cThe Federal Government\u2019s use of a Social Security number for Little Bird of the Snow does not itself in any degree impair [her father\u2019s] \u2018freedom to believe, express, and exercise\u2019 his religion.\u201d 54 U.S.L.W. at 4606. The Court also pointed out that the plaintiff was seeking to attack the government\u2019s conduct of its own internal operations, simply because they offended his religious sensibilities.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Here, however, the proposed road-building and logging operations would greatly impair religious exercises of the plaintiff Indians in the only place where they can be performed. In addition, logging and road-building on public lands, to which the public has access, is not the kind of internal governmental practice that the Court found beyond free exercise attack in <em>Roy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">We also reject the government\u2019s argument that the free exercise clause cannot be violated unless the governmental activity in question penalizes religious beliefs or practices. Governmental action that makes exercise of first amendment rights more difficult or impedes religious observances may also be \u201c \u2018invalid even though the burden may be characterized as being only indirect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sherbert v. Vemer, </em>374 U.S. at 404, 83 S.Ct. at 1794, (quoting <em>Braunfeld v. Brown, </em>366 U.S. 599, 607, 81 S.Ct. 1144, 1148, 6 L.Ed.2d 563 (1961) (plurality opinion)); <em>see Scott v. Rosenberg, </em>702 F.2d 1263, 1273-74 (9th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1078, 104 S.Ct. 1439, 79 L.Ed.2d 760 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">B. Establishment Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">The government does not challenge the sincerity of the Indians\u2019 beliefs nor their religious character. It even concedes that the Indians\u2019 use of the high country for religious purposes is entitled to some first amendment protection. <em>Northwest </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number><em>Indian Cemetery Protection Ass\u2019n. v. Peterson, </em>565 F.Supp. at 594. Indeed, the Forest Service plans to erect buffer zones to protect eleven sites with identified historical and ritual use. It argues that any greater protection of the area requires the government, in effect, to manage and maintain the area as a religious preserve for a single group in violation of the establishment clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The government substantially overstates its case and argues far beyond the reach of the district court\u2019s injunction. The district court\u2019s order permanently enjoins the Forest Service only from completing the G-0 Road and from engaging in commercial timber harvesting and constructing logging roads in the high country. 565 F.Supp. at 606. The Forest Service remains free to administer the high country for all other designated purposes including outdoor recreation, range, watershed, wildlife and fish habitat and wilderness. <em>See </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604(e)(1). The Forest Service would not, by virtue of this injunction, sponsor or become entangled in religious matters in violation of the establishment clause. Nor is the Forest Service being required tp police the conduct of visitors to prevent their interfering with Indian religious observances, a proposal rejected in <em>Badoni v. Higginson, </em>638 F.2d 172, 179 (10th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 954, 101 S.Ct. 3099, 69 L.Ed.2d 965 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Moreover, managing the National Forest so as not to burden genuine Indian religious beliefs and practices is not an endorsement or advancement of that religion but evidences a policy of neutrality. <em>See Walz v. Tax Commission of New York City, </em>397 U.S. 664, 669, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 1411, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970). The Constitution encourages accommodation, not merely tolerance, of all religions and forbids hostility toward any. <em>See Lynch v. Donnelly, </em>465 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 1355, 79 L.Ed.2d 604 (1984). It is in this spirit that Congress passed the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1996, which adopted the policy of protecting and preserving traditional Indian religious beliefs and practices, including access to sites.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Once a violation of the free exercise clause has occurred, as here, an effective remedy must necessarily take the protected religious exercise into account. Such a remedy ought not be condemned as a violation of the establishment clause by too literally applying the \u201csecular purpose\u201d and \u201cprimary effect\u201d tests of <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman, </em>403 U.S. 602, 612-13, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 2111, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971). Accommodating the free exercise of religion is a valid purpose of governmental action, and promotion of that liberty is a permissible primary effect. <em>See Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 234 n. 22, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1542 n. 22, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972); <em>Sherbert v. Verner, </em>374 U.S. 398, 409, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 1796, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963); <em>Zorach v. Clauson, </em>343 U.S. 306, 314, 72 S.Ct. 679, 684, 96 L.Ed. 954 (1952). Therefore, \u201cwhere governmental action violates the Free Exercise Clause, the Establishment Clause ordinarily does not bar judicial relief.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Block, </em>708 F.2d at 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">C. Compelling Government Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">The district court ruled that the interests of the Forest Service in road construction and timber harvesting either would not be served by the proposed projects or \u201cfall far short of constituting the \u2018paramount interests\u2019 necessary to justify infringement of plaintiffs\u2019 freedom of religion.\u201d 565 F.Supp. at 596. The government contends that the district court erred in not deferring to the judgment of the Secretary as to the proper purposes and management of the National Forest in light of the generality of congressional direction over the uses of the Forests.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">The government\u2019s argument, and its entire approach to this issue, fails to take into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>account the free exercises standard that controls this case. The government makes little attempt to demonstrate that compelling governmental interests, on the facts of this case, require the completion of the paved G-0 Road or the logging of the high country. Nor does the government reach the question whether those interests, if compelling, could be served in other ways that would interfere less with the Indians\u2019 religious rights. Instead, the government urges its prerogative to manage its forests in the usual way, within its statutory authority.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">This line of argument yields nothing to the free exercise clause. Admittedly, conventional free exercise analysis undergoes considerable strain when it is applied to site-specific religions centered on public lands. Yet the government does not take issue with those decisions that have adopted a balancing test. Those cases require the Indians first to show that the land in question is central and indispensable to the exercise of their religion and that the proposed governmental operations will interfere with that exercise; if that burden is met, then the government is required to show that its operations serve a compelling interest. <em>See Wilson v. Block, </em>708 F.2d at 742-44; <em>Sequoyah v. TVA, </em>620 F.2d at 1164; <em>Badoni v. Higginson, </em>638 F.2d at 176-77; <em>Crow v. Gullet, </em>541 F.Supp. at 792. In these cited cases, the Indian plaintiffs did not prevail. But inherent in the adoption of a balancing test is the distinct possibility that, on a different record, the Indians may prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">For example, in <em>Badoni, </em>the court found that Glen Canyon Dam, which created Lake Powell, served an overriding governmental interest. 638 F.2d at 177. In light of the magnitude of the project and the difficulty of placing it. elsewhere, that ruling is not surprising. Nothing comparable has been shown by the government here to support its proposed projects. There was testimony that completion of the road and logging in the high country would increase employment in Del Norte County, but that this benefit would simply represent a shift of work from elsewhere in the state. There would be no statewide net gain in employment. There was evidence that forest management functions would be made easier by the road. There was evidence that the road would also provide greater recreational access to the area, but the projected use was not large. In our view, the government has fallen short of demonstrating the compelling interest required to justify its proposed interference with the Indian, plaintiff s\u2019 free exercise rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">II. Adequacy of the Environmental Impact Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">The district court\u2019s review of an EIS is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(D); agency action may be set aside if it was undertaken without observance of procedures required by law. <em>Lathan v. Brinegar, </em>506 F.2d 677, 693 (9th Cir.1974) (en banc). Courts are not to \u201cfly speck\u201d EISs, <em>id., </em>but an EIS should not be upheld if it does not \u201c \u2018reasonably [set] forth sufficient information to enable the decisionmaker to consider the environmental factors and make a reasoned decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adler v. Lewis, </em>675 F.2d 1085, 1096 (9th Cir.1982) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>We review the district court\u2019s conclusion to determine whether it is based upon an erroneous legal standard or upon clearly erroneous findings of fact. <em>Save Lake Washington v. Frank, </em>641 F.2d 1330, 1334 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">B. Project Effects on Water Quality</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The district court found that the Chimney Rock draft and final EISs were inadequate because: (1) they failed sufficiently to disclose the impact of the road construction on water quality; (2) they failed to discuss the cumulative impact of the road construction and implementation of the Management Plan on water quality; and (3) they failed adequately to describe what measures would be taken to mitigate adverse impacts on water quality. In addition, the district court found that the draft, supplemental draft, and final EISs prepared for the Blue Creek Management Plan inadequately described measures to mitigate adverse impacts on water quality in Blue Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">The government does not take issue with the legal standards applied to the EISs by the district court. Rather, it contends that the Chimney Rock draft and final EISs do address erosion and sedimentation problems relative to road construction. The government also argues that cumulative sedimentation effects on the water quality and fishlife are disclosed in the 1975 Blue Creek EIS for both the Chimney Rock Section and the proposed Management Plan and that it was unnecessary to readdress them in the Chimney Rock EISs. Further, it claims that the EISs identify specific mitigation measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">1. Impact of Road Construction on Water Quality</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">The draft and final EISs prepared for the Chimney Rock Section do address erosion and sedimentation effects of road construction on Blue Creek. The EISs state that total increased sedimentation would raise the sedimentation yield in Blue Creek by 5.5 percent, resulting in only a \u201csmall decrease\u201d in water quality. The EISs do not, however, address increased sedimentation contributed by road-caused landslides, because of the difficulty inherent in predicting such slope failures. Thus, the potential risks to water quality stemming from the uncertainty in predicting landslides are ignored in the discussion of sedimentation effects. These risks must be revealed if they appear substantial. <em>See State of Alaska v. Andrus, </em>580 F.2d 465, 473 (D.C.Cir.) <em>vacated in part, </em>439 U.S. 922, 99 S.Ct. 303, 58 L.Ed.2d 315 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">The district court found that landslide risks were substantial and that debris from landslides triggered by the road construction would result in as much as a 500 percent increase in sediment loads in Blue Creek. These findings are not clearly erroneous. The failure to disclose such risks in the EIS renders them inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">2. Cumulative Sedimentation. Effects on Water Quality</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">The district court was correct in finding that the Chimney Rock EISs do not address cumulative sedimentation effects on water quality rising from the proposed road and timber projects. Nor did the district court ignore the 1975 Blue Creek EIS, which the government contends does address cumulative effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-13\">The Blue Creek EIS does not adequately discuss cumulative effects because there the effects were judged as \u201caverage\u201d increases in sediment over a period of years. State water quality standards, however, pertain to individual amounts of turbidity at a particular time and are not written in terms of averages over years. The discussion of cumulative effects in the Blue Creek EIS is therefore inadequate and likely underestimates the actual cumulative effects of both projects on water quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-14\">The district court\u2019s finding that the EISs do not contain an adequate discussion of the cumulative effects of both projects on water quality is consequently not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>3. Mitigation Measures</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">The applicable regulations require that an EIS discuss \u201c[m]eans to mitigate adverse environmental impacts\u201d of the proposed action. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.16(h). The Chimney Rock and Blue Creek EISs discuss mitigation measures in part, but neither EIS analyzes the mitigation measures in detail or explains how effective the measures would be. A mere listing of mitigation measures is insufficient to qualify as the reasoned discussion required by NEPA. <em>See Adler v. Lewis, </em>675 F.2d at 1096. The district court\u2019s conclusion that the EISs are inadequate for this reason is sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">III. Federal Water Pollution Control Act</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The Federal Water Pollution Control Act requires each state to implement its own water quality standards with which federal agencies must comply. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1313, 1323. The North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board in California determines water quality standards for the Blue Creek area. <em>See </em>Water Quality Control Plan for Klamath River Basin 1A (\u201cthe Plan\u201d). This Plan provides that \u201c[t]urbidity shall not be increased more than 20 percent above naturally occurring background levels.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5-13. Further, it provides that \u201c[t]he suspended sediment load and suspended sediment discharge rate of surface waters shall not be altered in such a manner as to cause nuisance or adversely affect beneficial uses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The government challenges the district court\u2019s ruling that implementation of the Management Plan and construction of the Chimney Rock Section of the road would violate FWPCA because either activity would increase turbidity and suspended sediment levels above the 20 percent ceiling level established by the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">The government first argues that the standards established in the Plan are no longer applicable to the Forest Service. It contends that these standards were superseded because California and the EPA accepted the Forest Service Best Management Practices (BMPs). The government claims that these BMPs are the applicable water quality standards for the Forest Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">The BMPs, however, are merely a means to achieve the appropriate state Plan water quality standards. There is no indication in the Plan or in the agreements between the Forest Service and the Water Quality Control Board that the BMPs were to be considered standards in and of themselves. Adherence to the BMPs does not automatically ensure that the applicable state standards are being met. The district court found that the state standards would be violated if the Forest Service projects were implemented as described in the EISs. This finding is not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">IY. Wilderness Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">This appeal originally presented one issue in addition to those already discussed: whether the district court erred in holding that NEPA and the Wilderness Act required the Forest Service to evaluate the impact of the proposed actions on the wilderness potential of the Blue Creek Unit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>considered together with the Eightmile and Siskiyou Planning Units.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">The parties are in agreement that this issue has been rendered moot by the enactment of the California Wilderness Act of 1984, P.L. 98-425. The Act places in wilderness about 19,000 acres of the Eightmile Creek Area and 26,000 acres of the Blue Creek Area.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Accordingly, we must vacate that portion of the district court\u2019s injunction that precludes timber harvesting or the construction of logging roads until the Forest Service prepares an EIS evaluating the wilderness potential of the Blue Creek Area together with the Eightmile and Siskiyou Roadless Areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">We vacate those portions of the district court\u2019s order that enjoin defendants from harvesting timber or constructing logging roads until they have (1) prepared an EIS evaluating the wilderness potential of the Blue Creek Area together with the Eight-mile and Siskiyou Roadless Areas; and (2) completed studies demonstrating that the proposed logging activities would not reduce the supply of anadromous fish in those portions of the Klamath River that flow through the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">In all other respects the decree of the district court is affirmed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-15\">.

The district court found that the adverse impact of either project on water quality and fish habitat in Blue Creek would significantly decrease the quantity of anadromous fish present in those portions of the Klamath River that flow through the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation. 565 F.Supp. at 605. The court held that the government\u2019s countenance of this adverse impact would constitute a breach of its trust responsibility toward those Indians.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Because the Hoopa Valley Tribe was not a party to this action, we do not find this case to be an appropriate vehicle in which to determine the range and extent of the trust responsibility owed to the Tribe. We therefore vacate that part of the district court\u2019s injunction that requires defendants to complete studies demonstrating that the proposed logging activities would not reduce the supply of anadromous fish present in those portions of the Klamath River that flow through the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation. In so doing, we note that the district court clearly viewed the deterioration of water quality in violation of FWPCA as the primary threat to the fish. The surviving portions of the district court's injunction preclude the defendants from logging until they complete and distribute studies demonstrating that such activities will not violate water quality standards of FWPCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b806-11\">.

The Blue Creek Unit consists of 76,500 acres of mountainous land in the northwestern corner of California. The northeastern comer of the Blue Creek Unit, which is referred to as \u201cthe high country,\u201d is considered sacred by several Indian tribes. The district court described the Indian plaintiffs\u2019 use of the high country as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-16\">Ceremonial use of the high country by the Yurok, Karok, and Tolowa tribes dates back to the early nineteenth century and probably much earlier. Members of these tribes currently make regular use of the high country for several religious purposes. Individuals hike into the high country and use \u201cprayer seats\u201d located at Doctor Rock, Chimney Rock, and Peak 8 to seek religious guidance or personal \u201cpower\u201d through \u201cengaging in emotional [and] spiritual exchange with the creator.\u201d Such exchange is made possible by the solitude, quietness, and pristine environment found in the high country. Certain key participants in tribal religious ceremonies such as the White Deerskin and Jump Dances must visit the high country prior to the ceremony to purify themselves and to make \u201cpreparatory medicine.\u201d The religious power these individuals acquire in the high country lends meaning to these tribal ceremonies, thereby enhancing the spiritual welfare of the entire tribal community. Medicine women in the tribes travel to the high country to pray, to obtain spiritual power, and to gather medicines. They then return to the tribe to administer to the sick the healing power gained in the high country through ceremonies such as the Brush and Kick Dances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ar-\">565 F.Supp. 586, 591-92 (N.D.Cal.1983) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-17\">In the early 1970s, the Forest Service began studying various land use management plans for the Blue Creek Unit. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>1981, the Forest Service issued the Blue Creek Unit Implementation Plan (\u201cthe Management Plan\u201d), which proposed to authorize harvesting of 733 million board feet of timber over an eighty year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">Since the 1960s, the Forest Service has been upgrading a seventy-five mile road between Gasquet, California and Orleans, California (\u201cthe G-0 road\u201d). Approximately six miles of the G-0 road lies within the Blue Creek Unit. In 1982, the Forest Service issued an environmental impact statement for the proposed construction of the final six miles, which is referred to as the \u201cChimney Rock Section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The plaintiffs brought this action to enjoin the Forest Service from beginning those projects. On May 24, 1983, the district court entered a permanent injunction against the Forest Service. The relevant portions of the injunction are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-T\">IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that defendants are permanently enjoined from constructing the Chimney Rock Section of the G-0 road and/or any alternative route for that Section which would traverse the high country____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that defendants are permanently enjoined from engaging in commercial timber harvesting and/or from constructing any logging roads in the high country ... pursuant to the 1981 Implementation Plan ... or any other land management plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">565 F.Supp. at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">Applicable Law</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">The Indian plaintiffs are attempting to use the free exercise clause to bar the development of public lands. Such attempts have raised difficult problems for first amendment theory. <em>See </em>Stambor, <em>Manifest Destiny and American Indian Religious Freedom: </em>Sequoyah, Badoni, <em>and the Drowned Gods, </em>10 Am.Ind.L.Rev. 59 (1982); Note, <em>Indian Religious Freedom and Governmental Development of Public Lands, </em>94 Yale L.J. 1447 (1985) [hereinafter cited as Note, <em>Indian Religious </em>Freedom]. These problems have been resolved through the adoption of a two-step analysis. First, the plaintiffs must show that the area at issue is central and indispensable to their religious practices and that the threatened activity would seriously interfere with or impair those practices. <em>See Wilson v. Block, </em>708 F.2d 735, 742-44 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 956, 104 S.Ct. 371, 78 L.Ed.2d 330 (1983). Second, if the plaintiffs meet their burden, the government must show an overriding government interest that cannot be served through less restrictive alternatives. <em>See id. </em>at 740; <em>Badoni v. Higginson, </em>638 F.2d 172, 176-77 (10th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 954, 101 S.Ct. 3099, 69 L.Ed.2d 965 (1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-15\">Four circuits have considered claims similar to those raised by the Indian plaintiffs in this case. In all four cases, the claims were rejected. In <em>Sequoyah v. TVA, </em>620 F.2d 1159 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 953, 101 S.Ct. 357, 66 L.Ed.2d 216 (1980), the Cherokee tribe sought to enjoin the construction of the Tellico Dam in Tennessee. The tribe asserted that the completion of the project would flood their \u201csacred homeland,\u201d destroying sacred sites, medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>cine gathering sites, holy places, and cemeteries and disturbing \u201cthe sacred balance of the land.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1160. The Sixth Circuit rejected the tribe\u2019s claims, holding that the tribe had failed to establish that their use of the lands was central to the practice of their religion. <em>Id. </em>at 1164-65. The court noted that it was \u201cdamage to tribal and family folklore and traditions, more than particular religious observances, which appears to be at stake.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The Tenth Circuit addressed a similar issue in <em>Badoni v. Higginson, </em>638 F.2d 172 (10th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 954, 101 S.Ct. 3099, 69 L.Ed.2d 965 (1981). In <em>Badoni, </em>the tribe challenged the construction of the Glen Canyon Dam in Utah and the management of Rainbow Bridge National Monument by the National Park Service. The dam created Lake Powell, which the tribe claimed had drowned some of their gods and cut off tribal access to a sacred prayer spot and spring. <em>Id. </em>at 176. The lake also provided convenient access to the Monument, thus increasing the number of tourists. <em>Id. </em>at 175. The tribe asserted \u201cthat tourists visiting the Monument desecrate the area by noisy conduct, littering and defacement of the Bridge and that the presence of tourists prevents [the tribe] from holding ceremonies near the Bridge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 177. The Tenth Circuit rejected the tribes\u2019 claims. Initially, the court held that the flooding of the sacred areas was justified by an overriding government interest. <em>Id. </em>Emphasizing establishment clause concerns, the court also refused to order the Park Service to police the actions of tourists visiting the Monument. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-5\">We find no basis in the law for ordering the government to exclude the public from public areas during the exercise of First Amendment rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-6\">... Although Congress has authorized the Park Service to regulate the conduct of tourists in order to promote and preserve the Monument, we do not believe plaintiffs have a constitutional right to have tourists visiting the Bridge act \u201cin a respectful and appreciative manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-7\">... Were it otherwise, the Monument would become a government-managed religious shrine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 179 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">The Eighth Circuit addressed a similar claim in <em>Crow v. Gullet, </em>706 F.2d 856 (8th Cir.1983), <em>aff'g </em>541 F.Supp. 785 (D.S.D.1982), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>464 U.S. 977, 104 S.Ct. 413, 78 L.Ed.2d 351 (1983). In <em>Crow, </em>two tribes challenged South Dakota\u2019s management of a state park containing Bear Butte, an important religious site for the tribes. The tribes argued that (1) the development of the park had increased the number of tourists in the park, reducing the Butte\u2019s spiritual value and impairing religious ceremonies; (2) the development of the park had restricted tribal access to the Butte; (3) their religious practices were impermissibly burdened by registration and permit requirements that restricted entry into the park; and (4) the state had failed to control the tourists, who disrupted the tribe\u2019s religious practices. <em>Id. </em>at 858. Citing <em>Badoni </em>and <em>Sequoyah, </em>the district court rejected each argument. 541 F.Supp. at 791-93. The Eighth Circuit adopted the district court\u2019s opinion. 706 F.2d at 858-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">The District of Columbia Circuit considered this issue in <em>Wilson v. Block, </em>708 F.2d 735 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 956, 104 S.Ct. 371, 78 L.Ed.2d 330 (1983). In <em>Wilson, </em>the Navajo and Hopi tribes sought to enjoin development of ski resorts in the San Francisco Peaks in Arizona. The tribes asserted that development of the Peaks \u201cwould be a profane act, and an affront to the deities, and that, in consequence, the Peaks would lose their healing power and otherwise cease to benefit the tribes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 740. The tribe also asserted that development would impair their ability to pray, to conduct ceremonies, and to gather sacred objects such as fir boughs. <em>Id. </em>The District of Columbia Circuit rejected the tribe\u2019s claims. The court noted that the development of the Peaks would not cause the tribes to be denied access to any sacred areas. <em>Id. </em>at 744. The court also concluded that development would not prevent the tribes from engaging in any religious practices. <em>Id. </em>at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>The district court was aware of the decisions in those circuits. Nevertheless, the district court found that the Forest Service had violated the first amendment. In doing so, the district court became the first federal court to enjoin the development of public lands on free exercise grounds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The Construction of the G-0 Road</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The district court found that the construction of the G-0 Road violated the free exercise clause because it \u201cwould seriously damage the salient visual, aural, and environment qualities of the high country.\u201d 565 F.Supp. at 594-95. The district court did not make specific findings regarding the effects of the construction of the road. Instead, the district court relied exclusively on the conclusions of a study prepared by Dr. Dorothea Theodoratus at the request of the Forest Service. <em>Cultural Resources of the Chimney Rock Section, Gasquet-Orleans Road, Six Rivers National Forest </em>(1979) [hereinafter cited as <em>Theodoratus Report </em>]. The study concluded that \u201cintrusions on the sanctity of the Blue Creek high country are ... potentially destructive of the very core of Northwest [Indian] religious beliefs and practices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420. Although the district court believed that the Theodoratus Report supported the issuance of an injunction, a careful review of the record reveals that the injunction was unsupported,</p>\n<p id=\"A2z\">\n<em>A. The Theodoratus Report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">The Theodoratus Report did not conclude that the mere existence of the G-0 Road would impair the Indian plaintiffs\u2019 religious practices.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, the report focused on five side effects. On careful examination, it is apparent that the side effects did not justify the issuance of an injunction against the construction of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">1. <em>Road Building Activities Off the Right-of-Way</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">The Theodoratus Report concluded that the construction of the G-0 Road threatened damage to archeological sites located off the right-of-way. <em>Id. </em>at 368-69. The report did not suggest that the destruction of any or all of those sites would impair the practice of the Indian plaintiffs\u2019 religion. <em>See Sequoyah, </em>620 F.2d at 1164-65. Most of the sites appear to be exclusively of archeological, rather than religious, significance. <em>See, e.g., Theodoratus Report </em>at 358 (noting that \u201cGO-24,\u201d one of the sites <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>that could be affected, had not been used for rituals since before 1900). Moreover, the Theodoratus Report was prepared prior to the selection of the present proposed route. One of the reasons for the selection of that route was that there would be \u201cno ground disturbing activities on any significant archaeological properties.\u201d Forest Service, <em>Cultural Resources Preliminary Case Report Supplement </em>31 (1981) [hereinafter cited as <em>Case Report </em>].</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">In any event, the Theodoratus Report assumes that the archeological sites would be damaged by negligent construction techniques or vandalism by construction workers. At most, such a threat of damage would justify an order requiring the Forest Service to safeguard against those dangers. The Theodoratus Report did not suggest that damage to the archeological sites could not be prevented by appropriate precautions.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">2. <em>Logging</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The Theodoratus Report correctly concluded that completion of the G-0 Road would open up areas for commercial logging. <em>Theodoratus Report </em>at 369-70. To the extent that logging activities threatened the Indian plaintiffs\u2019 religious practices, however, the appropriate remedy was an injunction against logging. In fact, the district court entered such an injunction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the injunction against logging is upheld, the injunction against construction of the G-0 Road is obviously not necessary to prevent logging. If the injunction against logging is overturned, on the other hand, surely an injunction aimed at stopping logging indirectly cannot be upheld on that ground. Accordingly, logging activities are irrelevant to the present analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">3. <em>Mining</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">The Theodoratus Report also concluded that the completion of the G-0 Road would encourage mining activities in the high country. <em>Id. </em>at 370-71. The appropriate remedy, once again, was an injunction against mining. The injunction against the completion of the G-0 Road cannot be upheld on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-13\">4. <em>Forest Service Activities</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-14\">The Theodoratus Report concluded that the completion of the G-0 Road would increase the volume of Forest Service activities in the high country. <em>Id. </em>at 371. The report also concluded, however, that \u201cthese activities are unlikely to have a serious effect on archaeological resources.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-15\">\n<em>5. Recreational Activities</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b810-16\">The Theodoratus Report concluded that completion of the G-0 Road would increase the number of recreational visitors to the high country. <em>Id. </em>at 371-72. In essence, the report concludes that campers and hikers would invade the Indian plaintiffs\u2019 seclusion and violate the pristine nature of the area. In light of <em>Badoni </em>and <em>Crow, </em>this threat is not of constitutional magnitude. The Indian plaintiffs are not entitled to exclusive use of the high country.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-17\">6. <em>Summary</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-18\">The Theodoratus Report\u2019s conclusion that completion of the G-0 Road threatened the Indian plaintiffs\u2019 free exercise rights was plausible. The district court erred, however, by assuming that the report\u2019s conclusion supported the issuance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>an injunction. Three of the five potential adverse effects cited in the report \u2014 logging, mining, and recreational use \u2014 cannot support issuance of an injunction against road construction. The remaining two potential adverse effects \u2014 road construction activities off the right-of-way and Forest Service activities \u2014 do not pose a serious threat to the practice of the Indian plaintiffs\u2019 religion. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s reliance on the Theodoratus Report was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">\n<em>B. Other Effects</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">In addition to the potential effects discussed in the Theodoratus Report, the Indian plaintiffs claim that the completion of the G-0 Road would cause two additional adverse effects. First, the Indian plaintiffs claim that visibility of the road from religious sites would impair their religious practices. The district court did not make findings regarding this claim. Nevertheless, it is apparent that the claim lacks merit. It is virtually inconceivable that the visibility of the G-0 Road could seriously impair the practice of the Indian plaintiffs\u2019 religion. Moreover, the Forest Service proposed ten measures to mitigate the visual impact of the road:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-6\">1. The clearing limits from the top of the cuts to the bottom of fills will be kept to an absolute minimum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-7\">2. The road would be constructed at the minimum practical width for two lanes; 24 feet travel-way on a 32 feet construction width.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-8\">3. Earthwork will be kept to a minimum by varying the grade and alignment of the road to fit the natural terrain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-9\">4. Vegetation will be planted in cut and fills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-10\">5. In areas of flat terrain (20% or less), clearing edges will be feathered to reduce contrasts and to give a natural appearance for vegetation alongside the road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-11\">6. There will be no retaining walls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-12\">7. Blue Creek will be crossed by in inconspicuous structural-plate metal arch bridge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-13\">8. The asphalted road surface will have a black color which will blend in color with the surroundings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-14\">9. Paving will eliminate dust-clouds associated with vehicle traffic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-15\">10. Signing will be kept to the minimum needed for safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-16\"><em>Case Report </em>at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-17\">Second, the Indian plaintiffs asserted that \u201cincreased aural disturbances from construction and use of the road would ... impair the success of religious and medicinal quests into the high country.\u201d 565 F.Supp. at 592. In <em>Wilson, </em>the District of Columbia Circuit rejected a similar argument. 708 F.2d at 744-45. Like the plaintiffs in <em>Wilson, </em>the Indian plaintiffs in this case have failed to prove that the completion of the road would prevent them from practicing their religion. While it is possible that noise from the road would impair religious and medicinal quests in the area adjoining the road, it is apparent that the high country is a large area. The Indian plaintiffs have not established that their quests can take place only in the area near the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-18\">\n<em>C. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b811-19\">The district court found that the completion of the G-0 Road would seriously impair the practice of the Indian plaintiffs\u2019 religion. The record does not support that finding. Accordingly, I would reverse the order granting a permanent injunction against completion of the G-0 Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-20\">\u00cdV</p>\n<p id=\"b811-21\">The Management Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b811-22\">\n<em>A. The California Wilderness Act of 1984</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b811-23\">On September 28, 1984, President Reagan signed the California Wilderness Act, Pub.L. No. 98-425, 98 Stat. 1619 (1984). The Act designated much of Six Rivers National Forest as wilderness areas. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 101(a)(19), (30), (34), (36), 98 Stat. 1621-24 (codified at 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132 note). Of the land covered by the first amendment in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>junction, only small parcels are not included in the wilderness areas. One such parcel is a narrow strip of land set aside so that the completion of the G-0 Road would not be precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133(c) prohibits commercial activities in wilderness areas. The first amendment issues raised by the proposed development of the newly designated wilderness areas are therefore moot. I would vacate the order granting the injunction against development to the extent that it covers those areas. It is not clear whether the district court would have issued an injunction based upon the development of the remaining small parcels. Accordingly, I would remand to allow the district court to reevaluate its injunction in light of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">\n<em>B. First Amendment Issues Upon Remand</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Upon remand to reconsider its injunction against timber harvesting in the high country, I would ask the district court to reevaluate both the threat of limited development to the Indians\u2019 right to free exercise of religion, and the strength of the government\u2019s interest in developing the high country.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">In light of the Wilderness Act, a serious question is raised as to whether timber harvesting on those few small parcels of land still available for development could pose any serious threat to the Indian plaintiffs\u2019 religious practices involving the larger territory. It may now be more feasible to accommodate the religious concerns of the Indians without foreclosing the limited logging activities that would still be possible in the wake of the wilderness designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Even if the district court were to conclude upon remand that any development would infringe the Indians\u2019 exercise of religion, I would instruct the court also to reexamine whether the government can demonstrate a compelling interest in developing those areas. I am not convinced that the district court has thus far given proper respect to the government\u2019s ownership rights in public lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">In entering its order enjoining timber harvesting in the high country, the district court offered the following analysis regarding the government\u2019s interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-11\">Harvesting of timber from the Blue Creek Unit pursuant to the Management Plan would not serve any compelling <em>public </em>interest. That timber is a small fraction of the timber resources found in the entire Six Rivers National Forest. Its harvesting would not significantly affect timber supplies. Moreover, the regional timber industry will not suffer greatly without access to timber in the Unit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">565 F.Supp. at 596 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-13\">The issue is not whether the public has a compelling interest, but whether the government has a compelling interest. The government\u2019s interest in putting public lands to productive use must be weighed carefully in the balance. While the government has many obligations that are not shared by private landowners, the government retains a substantial, perhaps even compelling, interest in using its land to achieve economic benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-14\">Although it may be appropriate in some limited circumstances to order the preservation of discrete parcels of land to accommodate Indian religious exercises, the courts should guard against the creation of private religious preserves covering vast expanses of our public lands. To do otherwise is to risk violation by judicial order of the establishment clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-15\">These interests and concerns cannot properly be evaluated upon the present record before this court. We should await reconsideration by the district court of these matters in light of the changed circumstances created by the California Wilderness Act. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s injunction against timber harvesting cannot be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-16\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b812-17\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b812-18\">The district court\u2019s order was the first decision restricting the government\u2019s abili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>ty to develop public lands on the basis of the free exercise clause. I would follow the Sixth, Eighth, Tenth, and District of Columbia Circuits and overturn the order granting injunctive relief to the extent that it rests on the first amendment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-11\">. This case presents a mixed question of law and fact. The district court\u2019s findings of historical fact are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. McConney, </em>728 F.2d 1195, 1200-01 (9th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 101, 83 L.Ed.2d 46 (1984) ; <em>see Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985); Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). The district court\u2019s selection of legal principles is reviewed de novo. <em>McConney, </em>728 F.2d at 1200-01. In choosing a standard of review for the district court\u2019s application of law to facts, we refer \"to the sound principles which underlie the settled rules of appellate review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1202. If the inquiry is essentially factual, the clearly erroneous standard is applied. <em>Id. </em>If, on the other hand, we must \"consider legal concepts in the mix of fact and law and ... exercise judgment about the values that animate legal principles,\u201d de novo, review is applied. <em>Id. </em>In this case, de novo review is appropriate. <em>See Fraser v. Bethel School District, </em>755 F.2d 1356, 1359 n. 2 (9th Cir.1985), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 3159, 92 L.Ed.2d 549 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b809-8\">. Because Indian religious concepts often differ substantially from Judeo-Christian concepts, some courts have been hesitant to recognize the first amendment rights of Indians in specific sites. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Indian Religious Freedom, supra, </em>at 1448-57. It is now well settled, however, that Indians have standing to raise first amendment objections to the development of public lands. <em>E.g., Badoni, </em>638 F.2d at 176. The district court properly concluded that the Indian plaintiffs have a first amendment interest in the high country.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">It does not follow, however, that all of the Indian plaintiffs\u2019 uses of the high country are entitled to first amendment protection. To qualify for first amendment protection, the plaintiffs\u2019 use of the high country must be \"religious.\" <em>See </em>Clark, <em>Guidelines for Free Exercise Clause, </em>83 Harv.L.Rev. 327 (1969). The Supreme Court has not adopted a clear definition of \"religion.\u201d <em>See </em>Note, <em>The Sacred and the Profane: A First Amendment Definition of Religion, </em>61 Texas L.Rev. 139, 141-52 (1982). It is apparent, however, that all forms of sociological activity are not entitled to protection under the free exercise clause. \"A way of life, however virtuous and admirable, may not be interposed as a barrier to reasonable state regulation ... if it is based on purely secular considerations; to have the protection of the Religion Clauses, the claims must be rooted in religious belief.\u201d <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 215, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1533, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b809-14\">. It is apparent that Dr. Theodoratus applied an inappropriate definition of \"religion.\" The report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-15\">Because of the particular nature of the Indian perceptual experience, as opposed to the particular nature of the predominant non-Indian, Western perceptual experience, any division into \"religious\" or \"sacred\" is in reality an exercise which forces Indian concepts into non-Indian categories, and distorts the original conceptualization in the process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5c\"><em>Theodoratus Report </em>at 44. The report then suggests that hunting and fishing are religious activities for Indians. <em>Id. </em>While that may be correct in an anthropological sense, the federal Constitution does not recognize such a broad concept of \"religion.\" <em>See supra </em>note 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\">.
