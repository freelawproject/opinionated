We disagree with the Board\u2019s conclusion on the categorical approach because \u00a7 892(a) encompasses some criminal behavior that falls within the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d and some that does not. For that reason, we grant Accardo\u2019s petition and remand to the Board for it to apply the modified categorical approach and determine in the first instance whether Accardo was actually convicted of an aggravated felony under that approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-11\">In February 2007 Accardo pleaded guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 892(a) by making an extortionate extension of credit. The Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings, charging that Accardo was removable pursuant to INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) as an alien who had been convicted of an aggravated felony. Specifically, the Department argued that Accardo had been convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, which constitutes an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(F). The Department argued at a hearing before an Immigration Judge that \u00a7 892(a) was a divisible statute and that Accardo had been convicted of a crime of violence under the modified categorical approach. The IJ applied the modified categorical approach and granted Accardo\u2019s motion to terminate removal proceedings. The IJ determined that Accardo had neither been convicted of, nor had he admitted to committing, a crime of violence even though in his plea colloquy Accardo declared that he and his victim understood that her \u201cfailure to make repayment of all [the] money could result in the use of criminal means to cause harm to her reputation in the community.\u201d Accardo never indicated in the plea colloquy or otherwise that he would have harmed the person or property of his victim, as distinguished from her reputation, if she failed to repay the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-13\">The Department of Homeland Security appealed the IJ\u2019s decision, and the BIA \u201csustained\u201d the appeal and reinstated the removal proceedings. The Board concluded that \u00a7 892(a) was categorically a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a), and it remanded the case to the IJ. Alternatively, the Board held that \u00a7 892(a) was categorically a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). On remand, the IJ issued an order of removal. Accardo again appealed to the Board, which declined to review its earlier decision and dismissed Accardo\u2019s appeal from the order of removal. Accardo contends that the Board erred in finding that a conviction for the extortionate extension of credit under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 892(a), as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 891(6), is a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 and thereby an aggravated felony within the meaning of the INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a conviction qualifies as an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number><em>Obasohan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>479 F.3d 785, 788 (11th Cir.2007), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Nijhawan v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2294, 174 L.Ed.2d 22 (2009); <em>see also Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">The INA provides that \u201c[a]ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The INA specifically defines an \u201caggravated felony\u201d to include a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). A crime of violence is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-7\">(a) an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-8\">(b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1352-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-10\">In order to determine whether the extortionate extension of credit qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, \u201cthe statute directs our focus to the \u2018offense\u2019 of conviction[,] ... [which] requires us to look to the elements and the nature of the offense of conviction, rather than to the particular facts relating to petitioner\u2019s crime.\u201d <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 7, 125 S.Ct. 377, 381, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004); <em>see also Hernandez, </em>513 F.3d at 1339. If the statutory language encompasses some offenses that would constitute aggravated felonies and others that would not, the statute is \u201cdivisible.\u201d <em>See Jaggernauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1354 (11th Cir.2005). In order to determine whether a conviction or guilty plea under a divisible statute constitutes an aggravated felony, the Board should apply the modified categorical approach by looking to \u201cthe record of conviction,\u201d which \u201cincludes the charging document, plea, verdict or judgment, and sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-12\">According to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 892(a), \u201c[whoever makes any extortionate extension of credit, or conspires to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 892(a). An \u201cextortionate extension of credit\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai1\">any extension of credit with respect to which it is the understanding of the creditor and the debtor at the time it is made that delay in making repayment or failure to make repayment could result in the use of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to the person, reputation, or property of any person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq1\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 891(6). Section 892(a) encompasses offenses that would qualify as crimes of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 because it criminalizes the extension of extortionate loans where there is an understanding that failure to make repayment \u201ccould result in the use of violence ... to cause harm to the person ... or property of any person.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 891(6). We agree with Accardo, however, that the statute also covers offenses that do not constitute crimes of violence under either \u00a7 16(a) or \u00a7 16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-14\">Beginning with \u00a7 16(a), the question is whether the \u201cuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another\u201d is an element of the extortionate extension of credit. Our inquiry begins with the plain language of the statute. <em>See Harris v. Garner, </em>216 F.3d 970, 972-73 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc). Section 891(6) provides that one engages in the extortionate extension of credit if there is an understanding between both parties \u201cthat delay in mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>ing repayment or failure to make repayment could result in the use of ... other criminal means to cause harm to the ... <em>reputation </em>... of any person.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 891(6) (emphasis added). The potential that a debtor could suffer harm to her reputation as a result of failing to repay an extortionate loan is, therefore, a \u201crealistic probability, not a theoretical possibility.\u201d <em>Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S. 183, 193, 127 S.Ct. 815, 822, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007). For example, a person could commit the offense by extending a usurious loan with the understanding that he would release embarrassing photographs to the local newspaper if payments were tendered late or not at all. An interpretation that included the attempted, threatened, or actual use of physical force as an element of \u00a7 892(a) in every case would render the word \u201creputation\u201d superfluous, which would of course violate the well-established rule of statutory construction that we must give effect to every word of a statute when possible. <em>See Duncan v. Walker, </em>533 U.S. 167, 174, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 2125, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">Despite Congress\u2019 inclusion of \u201cother criminal means\u201d and the possibility of injury to reputation in the language of the statute, other courts have interpreted \u00a7 891(6) to require violence, the threat of violence, or something akin to violence. <em>See United States v. Madori, </em>419 F.3d 159, 167 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201cProving that both parties knew at the time that the loan was \u2018extortionate\u2019 requires the government to establish that [the victim] understood that a threat of violence existed.\u201d); <em>United States v. Allen, </em>127 F.3d 260, 266 (2d Cir.1997) (\u201cCrucial to conviction under this statute is proof that both the creditor and the debtor understood when the loan was made that force could be used to collect the loan at issue.\u201d); <em>United States v. Spillone, </em>879 F.2d 514, 526 (9th Cir.1989) (\u201cIt is the mutual understanding of the parties to the transaction that failure to repay could lead to violence ... that the statute requires.\u201d); <em>United States v. Pacione, </em>738 F.2d 567, 572 (2d Cir.1984) (\u201c[T]he term \u2018other criminal means\u2019 was meant to supplement the context of \u2018violence\u2019 so as to punish those who forced their non-paying victims into committing crimes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-7\">On one occasion, this Court has made a statement consistent with those decisions from other circuits. <em>Robert Suris Gen. Contractor Corp. v. New Metro. Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>873 F.2d 1401, 1405 (11th Cir.1989) (\u201cBecause neither the conduct here alleged nor that in <em>Pacione </em>involved anything akin to violent collection means, neither falls within the ambit of the Extortionate Credit Transaction Act.\u201d) In <em>Suris </em>we held that the creation of false loan documents that were backed by an implied threat of perjury failed to constitute a predicate violation of \u00a7 892 for a civil RICO claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1405. The reference to <em>Pacione </em>and \u201cviolent collection means\u201d relied on by the Board, however, is dicta. We first observed in <em>Suris </em>that the plaintiff did not even suggest that the defendants committed or threatened to commit perjury. Instead, Suris\u2019 \u201c \u2018extortion\u2019 assertion rest[ed] on a dual speculation (that defendants would sue on the notes and would then commit perjury in court).\u201d <em>Id. </em>From that, we concluded \u201cthat such testimonial and documentary evidence, accepted and given the benefit of all reasonable inferences, shows at most contractual facts that cannot be reasonably construed as a threat of perjury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Without even an allegation that the defendants threatened perjury, there could be no predicate violation of \u00a7 892(a), even by \u201cother criminal means.\u201d As a result, any statement or implication in <em>Suris </em>that \u00a7 892 requires something \u201cakin to violent collection means\u201d is dicta; that decision did not hold that violence was required to violate \u00a7 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>Likewise, the decisions from other circuits construing the phrase \u201cother criminal means\u201d have not involved potential harm to a debtor\u2019s reputation as a consequence of noncompliance; while they have held that violence or the threat of violence is enough to violate \u00a7 892(a), they have not held that it cannot be violated by a non-violent threat to damage reputation. <em>See Madori, </em>419 F.3d at 167 (holding that \u201ca debtor\u2019s belief that a creditor is connected to organized crime may be introduced since it evidences the debtor\u2019s understanding that a threat of violence exists\u201d); <em>Allen, </em>127 F.3d at 266 (holding that a creditor\u2019s recounting of a single previous instance in which he resorted to violence to collect on an extortionate loan was insufficient to support a conviction under \u00a7 892, particularly when the defendant secured sufficient collateral for the loan at issue); <em>Spillone, </em>879 F.2d at 526 (explaining that under \u00a7 892(a) a mutual understanding that violence may result is enough, even without an actual fear of violence); <em>Pacione, </em>738 F.2d at 572 (holding that \u00a7 892(a) did not criminalize the recording of a falsified mortgage as penalty for failure to repay an extortionate loan because Congress did not intend the phrase \u201cother criminal means\u201d to mean \u201cany criminal means\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">Nevertheless, in this case the Board concluded that \u00a7 892(a) was categorically a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(a) because it always involves the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another as an element of the offense. But the decisions interpreting the use of \u201cother criminal means\u201d cited by the Board do not stand for the proposition that one cannot violate \u00a7 892(a) without the attempted, threatened, or actual use of violence. Even the Second Circuit\u2019s <em>Pacione, </em>the progenitor of the line of cases interpreting \u201cother criminal means\u201d to require something \u201cakin to violence,\u201d did not go so far as to read out of the statute the possibility that a creditor and debtor could mutually understand that failure to repay a loan could result in nonviolent, yet criminal, harm to the debtor\u2019s reputation. In fact, the Second Circuit explicitly indicated that its analysis did not \u201cattempt to ascertain the precise limits of the statute.\u201d <em>Pacione, </em>738 F.2d at 572. The fact that the defendant did not resort to or threaten the use of \u201cextra-legal methods\u201d in encouraging his debtor to repay the loan on time was enough for the Second Circuit to uphold the district court\u2019s dismissal of the indictment in that case. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Natale, </em>526 F.2d 1160, 1165 (2d Cir.1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-6\">As the court in <em>Pacione </em>explained, \u201c[a]bsent threats of violence <em>or other extra-legal methods </em>to enforce such loans, Congress did not intend to add the federal proscriptions of the extortionate credit transactions statute to those already existing at the state level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573 (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>at 571-72 (\u201c[C]ongress was concerned <em>primarily </em>with the use of actual and threatened violence by members of organized crime engaged in loan sharking ____\u201d) (emphasis added). Thus, despite the seemingly broad brush courts have used to paint their interpretations of \u00a7 892(a), it is possible to violate that statutory provision by an understanding that failure to comply with the terms of an extortionate loan could result in harm to the reputation of the debtor through non-violent but still extra-legal means. Accordingly, \u00a7 892(a) is not categorically a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(a) because a person may commit the offense even without the attempted, threatened, or actual use of physical force against the person or property of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-10\">The Board concluded that even if \u00a7 892(a) were not categorically a crime of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>violence under \u00a7 16(a), it was one under \u00a7 16(b). We disagree. Section 16(b) further defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d to include \u201cany other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). According to the Supreme Court, \u00a7 16(b) sweeps more broadly than \u00a7 16(a) and covers \u201coffenses that naturally involve a person acting in disregard of the risk that physical force might be used against another in committing an offense.\u201d <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. at 10, 125 S.Ct. at 382-83. While \u00a7 16(b) is broader than \u00a7 16(a), the use of physical force or the substantial risk that physical force will be used is required in both subsections. <em>Id. </em>at 11,125 S.Ct. at 383. \u201cThe reckless disregard in \u00a7 16 relates not to the general conduct or to the possibility that harm will result from a person\u2019s conduct, but to the risk that the use of physical force against another might be required in committing a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, 125 S.Ct. at 383 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">Section 892(a) is not categorically a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b) because it does not invariably \u201cby its nature, involve a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used <em>in the course of committing the offense.\u201d </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b) (emphasis added). An extension of credit is extortionate, and thereby a violation of \u00a7 892(a), when a loan is extended with an understanding between the creditor and debtor that failure to repay it could result in harm to the debtor\u2019s person, property, or reputation through violence <em>or </em>other criminal means. Every violation of the subsection does not involve the risk that the use of physical force against another will be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-7\">\u201cGenerally speaking, a court of appeals should remand a case to an agency for decision of a matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands. This principle has obvious importance in the immigration context.\u201d <em>I.N.S. v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 355, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002). Because the Board erred in finding that \u00a7 892(a) was categorically a crime of violence, we remand so that the Board may apply the modified categorical approach in the first instance. Under the modified categorical approach, the Board \u201cmay determine which statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction by consulting a narrow universe of <em>\u2018Shepard </em>documents\u2019 that includes any charging documents, the written plea agreement, the transcript of the plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1337 (11th Cir.2010). Having not made an inquiry using the modified categorical approach in this case ourselves, we imply no view about what the result of one should be.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-8\">Accordingly, we GRANT the petition and REMAND this case to the BIA in order for it to determine, using the modified categorical approach, whether Accardo\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 892(a) qualifies as a crime of violence and is therefore an aggravated felony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1355-10\">.
