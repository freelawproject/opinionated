On appeal, Brace argues that he may pursue relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is an inadequate or ineffective remedy. Exercising jurisdiction' under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we AFFIRM the dismissal of his petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-17\">In 1995, following an undercover investigation, Brace was charged in a four-count indictment with conspiring to launder and laundering purported proceeds of drug trafficking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was convicted in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas on all counts in 1996 and was subsequently sentenced to 175 months\u2019 imprisonment. A panel of the Fifth Circuit initially reversed Brace\u2019s convictions, concluding that he was entrapped. <em>United States v. Knox, </em>112 F.3d 802, 804 (5th Cir.1997). However, upon rehearing en banc, his convictions were affirmed. <em>Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number><em>ed States v. Brace, </em>145 F.3d 247 (5th Cir. 1998) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">In 1999, Brace filed a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, alleging that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, and the motion was denied. <em>Brace v. United States, </em>No. 99-CV-01248 (W.D.Tex. Aug. 5, 2000). In 2005, he filed a second \u00a7 2255 motion, which was dismissed as an unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Brace v. United States, </em>No. 05-CV-00484 (W.D. Tex. June 23, 2005). He then filed petitions for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, which were also dismissed. <em>Brace v. F.C.I. Warden, Texarkana, Tex., </em>No. 05-CV-00184 (E.D.Tex. Oct. 26, 2005); <em>Brace v. United States, </em>No. 07-CV-03209 (D.Kan. Apr. 16, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">In August 2008, Brace, who was then an inmate in Leavenworth Penitentiary, filed the instant petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. In his petition, he argued that, on June 2, 2008, the Supreme Court held that the federal money laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956, requires proof that a defendant laundered \u201cprofits\u201d rather than \u201cgross receipts.\u201d <em>See United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008). According to Brace, \u201cthe Government did not charge, and the Jury did not find, nor did [he] admit that he laundered <em>profits </em>from the purported drug trafficking.\u201d ROA, Vol. I at 16 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">On May 17, 2010, after ordering Brace to show cause why his action should not be dismissed and then ordering respondents to show cause why the petition should not be granted, the district court ruled that Brace could not challenge his money laundering conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 because he had not established that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was an inadequate or ineffective remedy. The district court then dismissed his petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-10\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition de novo.\u201d <em>Garza v. Davis, </em>596 F.3d 1198, 1203 (10th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Brace is proceeding pro se, we construe his pleadings liberally. <em>See Ledbetter v. City of Topeka, </em>318 F.3d 1183, 1187 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-11\">A petition brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 typically \u201cattacks the execution of a sentence rather than its validity and must be filed in the district where the prisoner is confined.\u201d <em>Bradshaw v. Story, </em>86 F.3d 164, 166 (10th Cir.1996). A \u00a7 2255 motion, on the other hand, is generally the exclusive remedy for a federal prisoner seeking to \u201cattack[] the legality of detention, and must be filed in the district that imposed the sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-12\">A federal prisoner may file a \u00a7 2241 petition to challenge the legality of his conviction under the limited circumstances provided in the so-called \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255. Pursuant to this savings clause, a \u00a7 2241 petition may be appropriate if \u201cthe remedy by [\u00a7 2255] motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>see also Bradshaw, </em>86 F.3d at 166. However, \u00a7 2255 will rarely be an inadequate or ineffective remedy to challenge a conviction. <em>Sines v. Wilner, </em>609 F.3d 1070, 1073 (10th Cir.2010). The petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that the remedy in \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>Prost v. Anderson, </em>636 F.3d 578, at 583-84, 2011 WL 590334 at *4 (10th Cir. Feb.22, 2011); <em>see also Bradshaw, </em>86 F.3d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-13\">Brace contends that \u00a7 2255 is an inadequate or ineffective remedy because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>he is precluded from asserting his <em>Santos </em>based statutory interpretation argument in a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions are \u201crestricted ... to claims involving either newly discovered evidence strongly suggestive of innocence or new rules of constitutional law made retroactive by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Prost, </em>636 F.3d at 581, 2011 WL 590334 at *2 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h)). Because his statutory interpretation argument cannot be brought in a second \u00a7 2255 motion, Brace argues that \u00a7 2255 is an inadequate or ineffective remedy. This argument is foreclosed under <em>Prost, </em>636 F.3d 578, 2011 WL 590334. In <em>Prost, </em>this court held that the fact that \u00a7 2255 bars a defendant from bringing a statutory interpretation argument in a second \u00a7 2255 motion does not render \u00a7 2255 an ineffective or inadequate remedy. <em>Id. </em>at 578-80, at *1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">Brace contends that he satisfies the \u201cactual innocence\u201d savings clause test described in <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893 (5th Cir.2001), rendering the remedy in \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective. However, this court explicitly declined to adopt the <em>Reyes-Requena </em>test in <em>Prost. See Prost, </em>636 F.3d at 592-94, 2011 WL 590334 at *12-13<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. As Brace has not demonstrated that \u00a7 2255 is an inadequate or ineffective remedy, the district court correctly dismissed his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Brace\u2019s petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1184-9\">. After examining the brief and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1184-18\"><em>. </em>While the federal money laundering statute has since been amended, our citations herein are to the version of the statute in effect at the time of Brace's conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">. Even if Brace could raise a <em>Santos </em>argument, he would not prevail because <em>Santos </em>does <em>not </em>hold that \"proceeds\u201d means \"profits\u201d in the context of drug sales. Justice Stevens, the critical fifth vote in <em>Santos, </em>explicitly departed from the plurality\u2019s conclusion that \"proceeds\u201d means \"profits\u201d in the context of drug sales. <em>See Santos, </em>553 U.S. at 525-26, 128 S.Ct. 2020 (Stevens, J., concurring) (\"As Justice ALITO rightly argues, ... Congress intended the term \u2018proceeds\u2019 to include gross revenues from the sale of contraband and the operation of organized crime syndicates involving such sales.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 526 n. 3, 128 S.Ct. 2020 (\"Thus, I cannot agree with the plurality that the rule of lenity must apply to the definition of \u2018proceeds\u2019 for these types of unlawful activities.\u201d). And in the case before us, Brace was charged with and convicted of laundering and conspiring to launder funds that were purportedly \"the proceeds of specified unlawful activity, to wit: the importation, sale and distribution of cocaine, a controlled substance....\u201d ROA, Vol. I at 41. Consequently, Brace cannot rely on <em>Santos </em>to argue that he was convicted of a nonexistent crime. <em>See United States v. Spencer, </em>592 F.3d 866, 879 (8th Cir.2010) <em>(\"Santos </em>does not apply in the drug context.\u201d); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>601 F.3d 530, 544 (6th Cir.2010) (\"As Justice Stevens made clear in his concurring opinion in <em>Santos, </em>the predicate offense of conspiracy to distribute cocaine does not fall within the category of offenses for which \u2018proceeds' means 'profits.' \u201d); <em>United States v. Demarest, </em>570 F.3d 1232, 1242 (11th Cir.2009) (refusing to apply <em>Santos </em>to an offense involving the laundering of funds from drug trafficking).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
