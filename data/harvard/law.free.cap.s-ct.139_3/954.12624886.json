These aliens may secure their release by proving to the satisfaction of a Department of Homeland Security officer\n   or an immigration judge that they would not endanger others and would not flee if released from custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Congress has decided, however, that this procedure is too risky in some instances. Congress therefore adopted a special rule for aliens who have committed certain dangerous crimes and those who have connections to terrorism. Under a statutory provision enacted in 1996,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Stat.%203009\">\n    110 Stat. 3009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -585,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), these aliens must be arrested \"when [they are] released\" from custody on criminal charges and (with one narrow exception not involved in these cases) must be detained without a bond hearing until the question of their removal is resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In these cases, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that this mandatory-detention requirement applies only if a covered alien is arrested by immigration officials as soon as he is released from jail. If the alien evades arrest for some short period of time-according to respondents, even 24 hours is too long-the mandatory-detention requirement is inapplicable, and the alien must have an opportunity to apply for release on bond or parole. Four other Circuits have rejected this interpretation of the statute, and we agree that the Ninth Circuit's interpretation is wrong. We therefore reverse the judgments below and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under federal immigration law, aliens present in this country may be removed if they fall \"within one or more ... classes of deportable aliens.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). In these cases, we focus on two provisions governing the arrest, detention, and release of aliens who are believed to be subject to removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The first provision, \u00a7 1226(a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   applies to most such aliens, and it sets out the general rule regarding their arrest and detention pending a decision on removal. Section 1226(a) contains two sentences, one dealing with taking an alien into custody and one dealing with detention. The first sentence empowers the Secretary of Homeland Security\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to arrest and hold an alien \"pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States.\" The second sentence\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   gives the Secretary the discretion either to detain the alien or to release him on bond or parole. If the alien is detained, he may seek review of his detention by an officer at the Department of Homeland Security and then by an immigration judge (both exercising power\n   delegated by the Secretary), see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20236.1\">\n    8 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 236.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(8) and (d)(1), 1003.19, 1236.1(d)(1) (2018) ; and the alien may secure his release if he can convince the officer or immigration judge that he poses no flight risk and no danger to the community. See \u00a7\u00a7 1003.19(a), 1236.1(d) ;\n   <em>\n    Matter of Guerra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2037\">\n    24 I. &amp; N.

To address this problem, Congress mandated that aliens who were thought to pose a heightened risk be arrested and detained without a chance to apply for release on bond or parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Section 1226(c) consists of two paragraphs, one on the decision to take an alien into \"[c]ustody\" and another on the alien's subsequent \"[r]elease.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first paragraph (on custody) sets out four categories of covered aliens, namely, those who are inadmissible or deportable on specified grounds. It then provides that the Secretary must take any alien falling into one of these categories \"into custody\" \"when the alien is released\" from criminal custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The second paragraph (on release from immigration custody) states that \"an alien described in paragraph (1)\" may be released \"only if [the Secretary] decides\" that release is \"necessary to provide protection\" for witnesses or others cooperating with a criminal investigation, or their relatives or associates. That exception is not implicated in the present cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The categories of predicates for mandatory detention identified in subparagraphs (A)-(D) generally involve the commission of crimes. As will become relevant to our analysis, however, some who satisfy subparagraph (D)-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , close relatives of terrorists and those who are thought likely to engage in terrorist activity, see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(B)(i)(IX) -may never have been charged with any crime in this country.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Still, since the vast majority of mandatory-detention cases do involve convictions, we follow the heading of subsection (c), as well as our cases and the courts below, in referring to aliens who satisfy subparagraphs (A)-(D) collectively as \"criminal aliens.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Board of Immigration Appeals has held that subsection (c)(2), which requires the detention of aliens \"described in\" subsection (c)(1), applies to all aliens who fall within subparagraphs (A)-(D), whether or not they were arrested immediately \"when [they were] released\" from criminal custody.\n   <em>\n    Matter of Rojas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20117\">\n    23 I. &amp; N.

Though all respondents had been convicted of criminal offenses covered in \u00a7\u00a7 1226(c)(1)(A)-(D), none were arrested by immigration officials immediately after their release from criminal custody. Indeed, some were not arrested until several years later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Respondent Mony Preap, the lead plaintiff in the case that bears his name, is a lawful permanent resident with two drug convictions that qualify him for mandatory detention under \u00a7 1226(c). Though he was released from criminal custody in 2006, immigration officials did not detain him until 2013, when he was released from jail after an arrest for another offense. His co-plaintiffs Juan Lozano Magdaleno and Eduardo Vega Padilla were taken into immigration detention, respectively, 5 and 11 years after their release from custody for a \u00a7 1226(c) predicate offense. Preap, Magdaleno, and Padilla filed habeas petitions and a class-action complaint alleging that because they were not arrested \"immediately\" after release from criminal custody, they are exempt from mandatory detention under \u00a7 1226(c) and are entitled to a bond hearing to determine if they should be released pending a decision on their status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Although the named plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Preap\n   </em>\n   were not taken into custody on immigration grounds until years after their release from criminal custody, the District Court certified a broad class comprising all aliens in California \" 'who are or will be subjected to mandatory detention under 8 U.S.C. section 1226(c) and who were not or will not have been taken into custody by the government\n   <em>\n    immediately\n   </em>\n   upon their release from criminal custody for a [s]ection 1226(c)(1) offense.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349884\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/1193/\">\n    831 F.3d at 1198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

The District Court said no, but we need not decide. Whether the\n    <em>\n     Preap\n    </em>\n    court had jurisdiction to enter such an injunction is irrelevant because the District Court had jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs' request for declaratory relief, and for independent reasons given below, we are ordering the dissolution of the injunction that the District Court ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Finally, and again before the\n    <em>\n     Preap\n    </em>\n    District Court, the Government raised a fourth potential snag: mootness. Class actions are \"[n]ormally ... moot if no named class representative with an unexpired claim remain[s] at the time of class certification.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Sanchez-Gomez\n    </em>\n    , 584 U.S. ----, ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611490\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1532/#p1538\">\n     138 S.Ct. 1532\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1538,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611490\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1532/#p1538\">\n     200 L.Ed.2d 792\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2018). But that general norm is no hurdle here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The suggestion of mootness in these cases was based on the fact that by the time of class certification the named plaintiffs had obtained either cancellation of removal or bond hearings. See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349884\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/1193/\">\n     831 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1197-1198 ;\n    <em>\n     Khoury v.

Wash. 2014). But those developments did not make the cases moot because at least one named plaintiff in both cases had obtained release on bond, as opposed to cancellation of removal, and that release had been granted following a preliminary injunction in a separate case. Unless that preliminary injunction was made permanent and was not disturbed on appeal, these individuals faced the threat of re-arrest and mandatory detention. And indeed, we later ordered that that injunction be dissolved. See\n    <em>\n     Jennings\n    </em>\n    , 583 U.S., at ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611490\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1532/#p1538\">\n     138 S.Ct., at 852\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, in both cases, there was at least one named plaintiff with a live claim when the class was certified.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Even if that had not been so, these cases would not be moot because the fact that a class \"was not certified until after the named plaintiffs' claims had become moot does not deprive us of jurisdiction\" when, as in these cases, the harms alleged are transitory enough to elude review.\n    <em>\n     County of Riverside v.

Respondents claim that they would be harmed by detention without a hearing pending a decision on their removal. Because this type of injury ends as soon as the decision on removal is made, it is transitory. So the fact that the named plaintiffs obtained some relief before class certification does not moot their claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    III\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Having assured ourselves of our jurisdiction, we turn to the merits. Respondents contend that they are not properly subject to \u00a7 1226(c)'s mandatory-detention scheme, but instead are entitled to the bond hearings available to those held under the general arrest and release authority provided in \u00a7 1226(a). Respondents' primary textual argument turns on the interaction of paragraphs (1) and (2) of \u00a7 1226(c). Recall that those paragraphs govern, respectively, the \"[c]ustody\" and \"[r]elease\" of criminal aliens guilty of a predicate offense. Paragraph (1) directs the Secretary to arrest any such alien \"when the alien is released,\" and paragraph (2) forbids the Secretary to release any \"alien described in paragraph (1)\" pending a determination on removal (with one exception not relevant here). Because the parties' arguments about the meaning of \u00a7 1226(c) require close attention to the statute's terms and structure, we reproduce the provision in full below. But only the portions of the statute that we have highlighted are directly relevant to respondents' argument. Section 1226(c) provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n    \"(c) Detention of criminal aliens\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n    \"(1) Custody\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n    \"\n    <em>\n     The [Secretary] shall take into custody any alien who-\n    </em>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n    \"(A) is inadmissible by reason of having committed any offense covered in section 1182(a)(2) of this title,\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n    \"(B) is deportable by reason of having committed any offense covered in section 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), (A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D) of this title,\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n    \"(C) is deportable under section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) of this title on the basis of an offense for which the alien has been sentence[d] to a term of imprisonment of at least 1 year, or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n    \"(D) is inadmissible under section 1182(a)(3)(B) of this title or deportable under section 1227(a)(4)(B) of this title,\n    \"\n    <em>\n     when the alien is released\n    </em>\n    , without regard to whether the alien is released on parole, supervised release, or probation, and without regard to whether the alien may be arrested or imprisoned again for the same offense.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n    \"(2) Release\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n    <em>\n     \"The [Secretary] may release an alien described in paragraph (1) only if\n    </em>\n    the [Secretary] decides pursuant to section 3521 of title 18 that release of the alien from custody is necessary to provide protection to a witness, a potential witness, a person cooperating with an investigation into major criminal activity, or an immediate family member or close associate of a witness, potential witness, or person cooperating with such an investigation, and the alien satisfies the [Secretary] that the alien will not pose a danger to the safety of other persons or of property and is likely to appear for any scheduled proceeding. A decision relating to such release shall take place in accordance with a procedure that considers the severity of the offense committed by the alien.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Respondents argue that they are not subject to mandatory detention because they are not \"described in\" \u00a7 1226(c)(1), even though they (and all the other members of the classes they represent) fall into at least one of the categories of aliens covered by subparagraphs (A)-(D) of that provision. An alien covered by these subparagraphs is not \"described in\" \u00a7 1226(c)(1), respondents contend, unless the alien was also arrested \"when [he or she was] released\" from criminal custody. Indeed, respondents insist that the alien must have been arrested\n    <em>\n     immediately\n    </em>\n    after release. Since they and the other class members were not arrested immediately, respondents conclude, they are not \"described in\" \u00a7 1226(c)(1). So to detain them, the Government must rely not on \u00a7 1226(c) but on the general provisions of \u00a7 1226(a). And thus, like others detained under \u00a7 1226(a), they are owed bond hearings in which they can earn their release by proving that they pose no flight risk and no danger to others-or so they claim. But neither the statute's text nor its structure supports this argument. In fact, both cut the other way.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    A\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    First, respondents' position runs aground on the plain text of \u00a7 1226(c). Respondents are right that only an alien \"described in paragraph (1)\" faces mandatory detention, but they are wrong about which aliens are \"described in\" paragraph (1).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Paragraph (1) provides that the Secretary \"shall take\" into custody any \"alien\" having certain characteristics and that the Secretary must do this \"when the alien is released\" from criminal custody. The critical parts of the provision consist of a verb (\"shall take\"), an adverbial clause (\"when ... released\"), a noun (\"alien\"), and a series of adjectival clauses (\"who ... is inadmissible,\" \"who ... is deportable,\" etc.). As an initial matter, no one can deny that the adjectival clauses modify (and in that sense \"describ[e]\") the noun \"alien\" or that the adverbial clause \"when ... released\" modifies the verb \"shall take.\" And since an adverb cannot modify a noun, the \"when released\" clause cannot modify \"alien.\" Again, what modifies (and in that sense \"describe[s]\") the noun \"alien\" are the adjectival clauses that appear in subparagraphs (A)-(D).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Respondents and the dissent contend that this grammatical point is not the end of the matter-that an adverb can \"describe\" a person even though it cannot modify the noun used to denote that person. See\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , at 978 - 979 (opinion of BREYER, J.). But our interpretation is\n    not dependent on a rule of grammar. The preliminary point about grammar merely complements what is critical, and indeed conclusive in these cases: the particular meaning of the term \"described\" as it appears in \u00a7 1226(c)(2). As we noted in\n    <em>\n     Luna Torres v\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Lynch\n    </em>\n    , 578 U.S. ----, ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596710\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1619/#p1625\">\n     136 S.Ct. 1619\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1625,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596710\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1619/#p1625\">\n     194 L.Ed.2d 737\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2016), the term \" 'describe' takes on different meanings in different contexts.\" A leading definition of the term is \"to communicate verbally ... an account of salient\n    <em>\n     identifying\n    </em>\n    features,\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 610 (1976), and that is clearly the meaning of the term used in the phrase \"an alien\n    <em>\n     described\n    </em>\n    in paragraph (1).\" (Emphasis added.) This is clear from the fact that the indisputable job of the \"descri[ption] in paragraph (1)\" is to \"identif[y]\" for the Secretary-to list the \"salient ... features\" by which she can pick out-which aliens she must arrest immediately \"when [they are] released.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    And here is the crucial point: The \"when ... released\" clause could not possibly describe aliens in that sense; it plays no role in identifying for the Secretary\n    <em>\n     which\n    </em>\n    aliens she must immediately arrest. If it did, the directive in \u00a7 1226(c)(1) would be nonsense. It would be ridiculous to read paragraph (1) as saying: \"The Secretary must arrest, upon their release from jail, a particular subset of criminal aliens. Which ones? Only those who are arrested upon their release from jail.\" Since it is the Secretary's action that\n    <em>\n     determines\n    </em>\n    who is arrested upon release, \"being arrested upon release\" cannot be one of her criteria in figuring out whom to arrest. So it cannot \"describe\"-it cannot give the Secretary an \"identifying featur[e]\" of-the relevant class of aliens. On any other reading of paragraph (1), the command that paragraph (1) gives the Secretary would be downright incoherent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Our reading is confirmed by Congress's use of the definite article in \"when the alien is released.\" Because \"[w]ords are to be given the meaning that proper grammar and usage would assign them,\" A.

In particular, the Ninth Circuit reasoned, each subsection's arrest and release provisions must work together. Thus, aliens must be arrested under the general arrest authority in subsection (a) in order to get a bond hearing under subsection (a)'s release provision. And in order to face mandatory detention under subsection (c), criminal aliens must have been arrested under subsection (c). But since subsection (c) authorizes only immediate arrest, the argument continues, those arrested later fall under subsection (a), not (c). Accordingly, the court concluded, those arrested well after release escape subsection (c)'s detention mandate. See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349884\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/1193/\">\n     831 F.3d at 1201-1203\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But this argument misreads the structure of \u00a7 1226 ; and in any event, the Ninth Circuit's conclusion would not follow even if we granted all its premises about statutory structure.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    1\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Although the Ninth Circuit viewed subsections (a) and (c) as establishing separate sources of arrest and release authority, in fact subsection (c) is simply a limit on the authority conferred by subsection (a).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Recall that subsection (a) has two sentences that provide the Secretary with general discretion over the arrest and release of aliens, respectively. We read each of subsection (c)'s two provisions-paragraph (1) on arrest, and paragraph (2) on release-as modifying its counterpart sentence in subsection (a). In particular, subsection (a) creates authority for\n    <em>\n     anyone's\n    </em>\n    arrest or release under \u00a7 1226-and it gives the Secretary broad discretion as to both actions-while subsection (c)'s job is to\n    <em>\n     subtract\n    </em>\n    some of that discretion when it comes to the arrest and release of criminal aliens. Thus, subsection (c)(1) limits subsection (a)'s first sentence by curbing the discretion to arrest: The Secretary\n    <em>\n     must\n    </em>\n    arrest those aliens guilty of a predicate offense. And subsection (c)(2) limits subsection (a)'s second sentence by cutting back the Secretary's discretion over the decision to release: The Secretary may\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    release aliens \"described in\" subsection (c)(1)-that is, those guilty of a predicate offense. Accordingly, all the relevant detainees will have been arrested by authority that springs from subsection (a), and so, contrary to the Court of Appeals' view, that fact alone will not spare them from subsection (c)(2)'s prohibition on release. This reading comports with the Government's practice of applying to the arrests of all criminal aliens certain procedural requirements, such as the need for a warrant, that appear only in subsection (a). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 13-14.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The text of \u00a7 1226 itself contemplates that aliens arrested under subsection (a) may face mandatory detention under subsection (c). The second sentence in subsection (a)-which generally authorizes the Secretary to\n    <em>\n     release\n    </em>\n    an alien pending removal proceedings-features an exception \"as provided in subsection (c).\" But if the Court of Appeals were right that subsection (c)(2)'s prohibition on release applies only to those arrested pursuant to subsection (c)(1), there would have been no need to specify that such aliens are exempt from subsection\n    <em>\n     (a)\n    </em>\n    's release provision. This shows that it is possible for those arrested under subsection (a) to face mandatory detention under subsection (c). We draw a similar inference from the fact that subsection (c)(2), for its part, does not limit mandatory detention to those arrested \"pursuant to\" subsection (c)(1) or \"under authority created by\" subsection (c)(1)-but to anyone so much as \"described in\" subsection (c)(1). This choice of\n    words marks a contrast with Congress's reference-in the immediately preceding subsection-to actions by the Secretary that are \"authorized under\" subsection (a). See \u00a7 1226(b). Cf.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203262\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3262\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b) (referring to \"a person\n    <em>\n     arrested under\n    </em>\n    subsection (a)\" (emphasis added)). These textual cues indicate that even if an alien was not arrested under authority bestowed by subsection (c)(1), he may face mandatory detention under subsection (c)(2).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    2\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    But even if the Court of Appeals were right to reject this reading, the result below would be wrong. To see why, assume with the Court of Appeals that only someone arrested under authority created by \u00a7 1226(c)(1) -rather than the more general \u00a7 1226(a) -may be detained without a bond hearing. And assume that subsection (c)(1) requires\n    <em>\n     immediate\n    </em>\n    arrest. Even then, the Secretary's failure to abide by this time limit would not cut off her power to arrest under subsection (c)(1). That is so because, as we have held time and again, an official's crucial duties are better carried out late than never. See\n    <em>\n     Sylvain v.

From Congress's perspective, after all, it is irrelevant that the Secretary could go on detaining criminal aliens subject to a bond hearing.

To give just one example, state and local officials sometimes rebuff the Government's request that they give notice when a criminal alien will be released. Indeed, over a span of less than three years (from January 2014 to September 2016), the Government recorded \"a total of 21,205 declined [requests] in 567 counties in 48 states including the District of Columbia.\" ICE, Fiscal Year 2016 ICE Enf. and Removal Operations Rep. 9.

(citing the \"cardinal rule of statutory interpretation that no provision should be construed to be entirely redundant\"). Respondents' surplusage argument has two focal points.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    First, respondents claim that if they face mandatory detention even though they were arrested well after their release, then \"when ... released\" adds nothing to paragraph (1). In fact, however, it still has work to do. For one thing, it clarifies when the duty to arrest is triggered: upon release from criminal custody, not before such release or after the completion of noncustodial portions of a criminal sentence (such as a term of \"parole, supervised release, or probation,\" as the paragraph goes on to emphasize). Thus, paragraph (1) does not permit the Secretary to cut short an alien's state prison sentence in order to usher him more easily right into immigration detention-much as another provision prevents officials from actually removing an alien from the country \"until the alien is released from imprisonment.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(4)(A). And from the other end, as paragraph (1)'s language makes clear, the Secretary need not wait for the sentencing court's supervision over the alien to expire.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The \"when ... released\" clause also serves another purpose: exhorting the Secretary to act quickly. And this point answers respondents' second surplusage claim: that the \"Transition Period Custody Rules\" enacted along with \u00a7 1226(c) would have been superfluous if \u00a7 1226(c) did not call for immediate arrests, since those rules authorized delays in \u00a7 1226(c)'s implementation while the Government expanded its capacities. See\n    <em>\n     Matter of Garvin-Noble\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20672\">\n     21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 672\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 675 (BIA 1997). This argument again confuses what the Secretary is obligated to do with the consequences that follow if the Secretary fails (for whatever reason) to fulfill that obligation. The transition rules delayed the onset of the Secretary's obligation to begin making arrests as soon as covered aliens were released from criminal custody, and in that sense they were not superfluous.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    This is so even though, had the transition rules not been adopted, the Secretary's failure to make an arrest immediately upon a covered alien's release would not have exempted the alien from mandatory detention under \u00a7 1226(c).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    B\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The Court of Appeals objected that the Government's reading of \u00a7 1226(c) would have the bizarre result that some aliens whom the Secretary need not arrest at all must nonetheless be detained without a hearing if they\n    <em>\n     are\n    </em>\n    arrested.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349884\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/1193/\">\n     831 F.3d at 1201-1203\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This rather complicated argument, as we understand it, proceeds as follows. Paragraph (2) requires the detention of aliens \"described in paragraph (1).\" While most of the aliens described there have been convicted of a criminal offense, this need not be true of aliens captured by subparagraph (D) in particular-which covers, for example, aliens who are close relatives of terrorists and those who are believed likely to commit a terrorist act. See \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(i)(IX). But if, as the Government maintains,\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    alien who falls under subparagraphs (A)-(D) is thereby ineligible for release from immigration custody, then the Secretary would be forbidden to release even these aliens who were never convicted or perhaps even charged with a crime, once she arrested them. Yet she would be free not to arrest them to begin with (or so the Court of Appeals assumed), since she is obligated to arrest aliens \"when ... released,\" and there was no prior custody for\n    <em>\n     these\n    </em>\n    aliens to be \"released\"\n    <em>\n     from\n    </em>\n    . Therefore, the court concluded, the Government's position has the absurd implication that aliens who were never charged with a crime need not be arrested pending a removal determination, but if they\n    <em>\n     are\n    </em>\n    arrested, they must be detained and cannot be released on bond or parole.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    We agree that it would be very strange for Congress to forbid the release of aliens who need not be arrested in the first place, but the fact is that the Government's reading (and ours) does not have that incongruous result. The real anomalies here would flow instead from the Court of Appeals' interpretation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    To begin with the latter point: Under the Court of Appeals' reading, the mandatory-detention scheme would be gentler on terrorists than it is on garden-variety offenders. To see why, recall first that subparagraphs (A)-(C) cover aliens who are inadmissible or deportable based on the commission of certain criminal offenses, and there is no dispute that the statute authorizes their mandatory detention when they are released from criminal custody. And the crimes covered by these subparagraphs include, for example, any drug offense by an adult punishable by more than one year of imprisonment, see \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(2), 1226(c)(1)(A), as well as a variety of tax offenses, see \u00a7\u00a7 1226(c)(1)(B), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) ;\n    <em>\n     Kawashima v. Holder\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186613\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/478/\">\n     565 U.S. 478\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186613\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/478/\">\n     132 S.Ct. 1166\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186613\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/478/\">\n     182 L.Ed.2d 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2012). But notice that aliens who fall within subparagraph (D), by contrast, may never have been arrested on criminal charges-which according to the court below would exempt them from mandatory detention. Yet this subparagraph covers the very sort of aliens for which Congress was most likely to have wanted to require mandatory detention-including those who are representatives of a terrorist group and those whom the Government has reasonable grounds to believe are likely to engage in terrorist activities. See\n    \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(i)(III), (IV), 1226(c)(1)(D).\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    Thus, by the Court of Appeals' logic, Congress chose to spare terrorist aliens from the rigors of mandatory detention-a mercy withheld from almost all drug offenders and tax cheats. See Brief for National Immigrant Justice Center as\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    7-8.\n    <em>\n     That\n    </em>\n    result would be incongruous.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Along similar lines, note that one \u00a7 1226(c)(1) predicate reaches aliens who necessarily escape conviction: those \"for whom immunity from criminal jurisdiction was exercised.\" \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(E)(ii). See \u00a7 1226(c)(1)(A). And other predicates sweep in aliens whom there is no reason to expect police (as opposed to immigration officials) will have reason to arrest:\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , the \"spouse or child of an alien\" who recently engaged in terrorist activity. \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(i)(IX) ; see \u00a7 1226(c)(1)(D). It would be pointless for Congress to have covered such aliens in subsections (c)(1)(A)-(D) if subsection (c)'s mandates applied only to those emerging from jail.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Thus, contrary to the Court of Appeals' interpretation of the \"when released\" clause as limiting the class of aliens subject to mandatory detention, we read subsection (c)(1) to specify the timing of arrest (\"when the alien is released\") only for the vast majority of cases: those involving criminal aliens who were once in criminal custody. The paragraph simply does not speak to the timeline for arresting the few who had no stint in jail. (And why should it? Presumably they-unlike those serving time-are to be detained as they come across the Government's radar and any relevant evidentiary standards are satisfied.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    In short, we read the \"when released\" directive to apply when there is a release.

That is why Congress specifies any deadlines for executive duties at all; and here it explains why Congress furthermore provided that the deadline it set for this particular duty (to arrest criminal aliens\n     <em>\n      upon their release\n     </em>\n     ) would not take effect right away.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-224\">\n     In fact, if the dissent's argument from the transition rules were sound-\n     <em>\n      i.e.\n     </em>\n     , if textual evidence that Congress\n     <em>\n      expects\n     </em>\n     the Executive to meet a deadline (once it officially takes effect) were proof that Congress wanted the deadline\n     <em>\n      enforced by courts\n     </em>\n     -then every case involving an express statutory deadline would be one in which Congress intended for courts to enforce the deadline.

It is undisputed that Congress may mandate that the Executive Branch detain certain noncitizens during removal proceedings or before removal. Congress has in fact mandated detention of certain noncitizens who have been in criminal custody and who, upon their release, would pose a danger to the community or risk of flight. As relevant here, Congress has mandated detention \"when\" such noncitizens are \"released\" from criminal custody.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(1).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The sole question before us is narrow: whether, under \u00a7 1226, the Executive Branch's mandatory duty to detain a particular noncitizen when the noncitizen is released from criminal custody remains mandatory if the Executive Branch fails to\n    <em>\n     immediately\n    </em>\n    detain the noncitizen when the noncitizen is released from criminal custody-for example, if the Executive Branch fails to immediately detain the noncitizen because of resource constraints or because the Executive Branch cannot immediately locate and apprehend the individual in question. No constitutional issue is presented. The issue before us is entirely statutory and requires our interpretation of the strict 1996 illegal-immigration law passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton. Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Stat.%203009\">\n     110 Stat. 3009\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -546.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    It would be odd, in my view, if the Act (1) mandated detention of particular noncitizens because the noncitizens posed such a serious risk of danger or flight that they\n    <em>\n     must\n    </em>\n    be detained during their removal proceedings, but (2) nonetheless allowed the noncitizens to remain free during their removal proceedings if the Executive Branch failed to\n    <em>\n     immediately\n    </em>\n    detain them upon their release from criminal custody. Not surprisingly, the Act does not require such an odd result. On the contrary, the relevant text of the Act is relatively straightforward, as the Court explains. Interpreting that text, the Court correctly holds that the Executive Branch's detention of the particular noncitizens here remained mandatory even though the Executive Branch did not immediately detain them. I agree with the Court's careful statutory analysis, and I join the Court's opinion in full.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Justice THOMAS, with whom Justice GORSUCH joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    I continue to believe that no court has jurisdiction to decide questions concerning the detention of aliens before final orders of removal have been entered.

At the time of class certification, all six of the named plaintiffs had received bond hearings or cancellation of removal. As I understand the plaintiffs' arguments, that was the full relief that they sought: \"individualized bond hearings where they may attempt to prove that their release would not create a risk of flight or danger to the public.\" Motion for Class Certification in\n    <em>\n     Preap\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Beers\n    </em>\n    , No. 4:13-cv-5754 (ND Cal.), Doc. 8, p. 8; see Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief in\n    <em>\n     Preap\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , Doc. 1, p. 3 (seeking \"immediate individualized bond hearings\"); First Amended Class Action Complaint in\n    <em>\n     Khoury\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Asher\n    </em>\n    , No. 2:13-cv-1367 (WD Wash.), Doc. 19, p. 13 (requesting relief of \"individualized bond hearings to all Plaintiffs\"). The Court concludes that some of the named plaintiffs still faced the threat of rearrest and mandatory detention at the time of class certification because the bond hearings that they received were provided as part of a preliminary injunction in a separate case that was later dissolved. But whether the plaintiffs actually faced that threat has not been addressed by the parties, and I question whether this future contingency was sufficiently imminent to support Article III jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    If the threat of rearrest and mandatory detention was too speculative to support jurisdiction, I disagree with the Court that our jurisdiction would be saved by our precedent on transitory claims.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 962 - 963.

The \"inherently transitory\" exception is measured from the time that the complaint is filed to the court's ruling on the motion for class certification.

In other words, the named plaintiff's standing in a class action need not exist throughout the lifecycle of the entire lawsuit. Here, Members of the Court have recognized that aliens are held, on average, for one year, and sometimes longer.

Because the relevant offenses are listed in four subparagraphs headed by the letters \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C,\" and \"D,\" I shall refer to the relevant aliens as \"ABCD\" aliens. Thus, for present purposes, paragraph (1) says that the Secretary \"shall take into custody any\" ABCD alien \"when the alien is released\" from criminal custody.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    Paragraph (2), entitled \"Release,\" says that the Secretary \"may release\n    <em>\n     an alien described in paragraph (1)\n    </em>\n    only if\" the alien falls within a special category-not relevant here-related to witness protection. \u00a7 1226(c)(2) (emphasis added). We held last Term in\n    <em>\n     Jennings\n    </em>\n    that paragraph (2) forbids a bail hearing for \"an alien described in paragraph (1)\" unless the witness protection exception applies. 583 U.S., at ---- - ----, 138 S.Ct., at 846-847 (majority opinion).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    Here we focus on the meaning of a key phrase in paragraph (2): \"an alien described in paragraph (1).\" This is the phrase that identifies the aliens to whom paragraph (2) (and its \"no-bail-hearing\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    requirement) applies. Does paragraph (1) \"describ[e]\"\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    ABCD aliens, even those whom the Secretary has \"take[n] into custody\" many years after their release from prison? Or does it \"describ[e]\" only those aliens whom the Secretary has \"take[n] into custody ... when the alien [was] released\" from prison?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    B\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    The issue may sound technical. But it is extremely important. That is because the Government's reading of the statute-namely, that paragraph (2) forbids bail hearings for all ABCD aliens regardless of whether they were detained \"when ... released\" from criminal custody-would significantly expand the Secretary's authority to deny bail hearings. Under the Government's view, the aliens subject to detention without a bail hearing may have been released from criminal custody years earlier, and may have established families and put down roots in a community. These aliens may then be detained for months, sometimes years, without the possibility of release; they may have been convicted of only minor crimes-for example, minor drug offenses, or crimes of \"moral turpitude\" such as illegally downloading music or possessing stolen bus transfers; and they sometimes may be innocent spouses or children of a suspect person. Moreover, for a high percentage of them, it will turn out after months of custody that they will not be removed from the country because they are eligible by statute to receive a form of relief from removal such as cancellation of removal. These are not mere hypotheticals. See Appendix B,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    . Thus, in terms of potential consequences and basic American legal traditions, see\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , at 981 - 982, the question before us is not a \"narrow\" one,\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 972 - 973 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    Why would Congress have granted the Secretary such broad authority to deny bail hearings, especially when doing so would run contrary to basic American and common-law traditions?

But the statute does not use the word \"modify.\" It uses the word \"described.\" While the word \"describe\" will in some contexts refer only to the words that directly \"modify\" a noun, normally it has a broader meaning. Compare American Heritage Dictionary 490 (5th ed. 2011) (to \"describe\" is to \"convey an idea or impression of\") and Webster's Third New International Dictionary 610 (1986) (to \"describe\" is to \"convey an image or notion of\") with P.

They demonstrate that a noun often is \"described\" by more than just the adjectives that modify it. Consider the following sentence: \"The well-behaved child was taken by a generous couple to see\n    <em>\n     Hamilton\n    </em>\n    .\" That sentence, written in the passive voice, describes the \"child\" not only as \"well-behaved\" but also as someone \"taken by a generous couple to see\n    <em>\n     Hamilton\n    </em>\n    .\" The description of the child would not differ were we to write the sentence in the active voice: \"The generous couple took the well-behaved child to see\n    <em>\n     Hamilton\n    </em>\n    .\" The action taken by the \"generous couple\" (\"took ... to see\n    <em>\n     Hamilton\n    </em>\n    \") still \"describes\" the \"child,\" even though these words do not \"modify\" the word \"child.\" That is because a person who has been subjected to an action can be described by that action no less than by an adjective. See Peters,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at 386 (describing such a person as someone \"affected by the action\"); B. Garner, The Chicago Guide to Grammar, Usage, and Punctuation 452 (2016) (describing such a person as someone who \"is acted on by or receives the action\"); see also R. Huddleston &amp; G. Pullum, The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language 1436 (2002) (noting the \"large-scale overlap\" between adjectives and certain verb forms).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    An example illustrates how these principles apply to the statute at issue here. Imagine the following cookbook recipe. Instruction (1) says: \"(1) Remove the Angus steak from the grill when the steak is cooked to 120 degrees Fahrenheit.\" Instruction (4) says: \"(4) Let the steak described in Instruction (1) rest for ten minutes and then serve it.\" What would we say of a chef who grilled an Angus steak to 185 degrees Fahrenheit, served it, and then appealed to these instructions-particularly the word \"described\" in Instruction (4)-as a justification? That he was not a good cook? That he had an odd sense of humor? Or simply that he did not understand the instructions? The chef would have no good textual defense: The steak \"described in Instruction (1)\" is not just an \"Angus\" steak, but an \"Angus\" steak that must be \"remove[d] ... when the steak is cooked to 120 degrees Fahrenheit.\" By the same logic, the alien in paragraph (1) is \"described\" not only by the four clauses-A, B, C, and D-that directly modify the word \"alien,\" but\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    by the verb (\"shall take\") and that verb's modifier (\"when the alien is released\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    The majority argues that \"the crucial point\" is that the phrase \"when the alien is released\" plays \"no role in identifying for the Secretary\n    <em>\n     which\n    </em>\n    aliens she must immediately arrest.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 965. That may be so. But why is that a \"crucial point\" in the majority's favor? After all, in the example above, the words \"[r]emove ... from the grill when the steak is cooked to 120 degrees Fahrenheit\" do not tell our chef what kind of steak to cook in the first place. (The word \"Angus\" does that.) Even so, those words still \"describe\" the steak that must be served in Instruction (4). Why? Because by the time our chef gets to Instruction (4), the recipe contemplates that the action in Instruction (1) has been completed. At that point, the \"steak described\n    in Instruction (1)\" is a steak that has been cooked in the manner mandated by Instruction (1).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    The same is true of the two paragraphs before us. The key word \"described\" appears not in paragraph (1), but in paragraph (2). Paragraph (2) refers back to the entirety of paragraph (1). And because paragraph (2) is the\n    <em>\n     release\n    </em>\n    provision, it contemplates that the action mandated by paragraph (1)-namely, detention-has already occurred. Thus, the function of the phrase \"an alien described in paragraph (1)\" is not to describe who must be detained, but instead to describe who must be denied bail.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    In short, the language demonstrates that an alien is \"described in paragraph (1)\"-and therefore subject to paragraph (2)'s bar on bail hearings-only if the alien is \"take[n] into custody ... when the alien is released.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    B\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    The statute's structure and context support this reading of the phrase \"an alien described in paragraph (1).\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    <em>\n     First\n    </em>\n    , \"Congress often drafts statutes with hierarchical schemes-section, subsection, paragraph, and on down the line.\"\n    <em>\n     NLRBv\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     SW General, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , 580 U.S. ----, ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609970\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/929/#p938\">\n     137 S.Ct. 929\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 938-939,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609970\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/929/#p938\">\n     197 L.Ed.2d 263\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2017).

The cross-reference to all of paragraph (1) reinforces that \"an alien described in paragraph (1)\" is not just an ABCD alien, but an ABCD alien whom (in the words of paragraph (1)) the Secretary \"take[s] into custody ... when the alien is released\" from criminal confinement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    <em>\n     Second\n    </em>\n    , consider the structural similarity between subsections (a) and (c). See Appendix A,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    . The first sentence of subsection (a) sets forth a detention rule: An \"alien may be arrested and detained\" pending a decision on the alien's removal.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a). And the second sentence sets forth a release rule that allows for release on bond and parole.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Subsection (c) has a parallel structure. The first sentence (namely, paragraph (1)) says that the Secretary must \"take into custody\" a subset of those aliens \"when the alien is released\" from criminal custody. \u00a7 1226(c)(1). And the second sentence (namely, paragraph (2)) sets forth the rule that \"an alien described in paragraph (1)\" generally may not be released. \u00a7 1226(c)(2).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    It is obvious that the second sentence of (a) applies only to those aliens who are detained following the rule in (a)'s first sentence. Parallel structure suggests that the same is true in (c): The second sentence of (c) applies only to those detained following the rule in (c)'s first sentence. Subsection (a)'s reference to (c) strengthens\n    this structural inference: Subsection (a) says that its release rule applies \"[e]xcept as provided in subsection (c)\"-that is, except as provided in the\n    <em>\n     whole\n    </em>\n    of subsection (c), not simply paragraph (2) or the few lines the majority picks from (c)'s text.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    Thus, the release rule in each subsection (the second sentence) applies only if the Secretary complies with the detention rule in that subsection (the first sentence). In light of \"the parallel structures of these provisions,\" it would \"flou[t] the text\" to find that an alien is subject to (c)'s release rule, which forbids release, without also finding that the alien was detained in accordance with (c)'s detention rule, which requires the alien to be detained \"when ... released.\"\n    <em>\n     Chan v.

But even if (c) were treated as a \"limit\" on the authority granted by (a), the parallel structure of the statute would still point to the same conclusion: The Secretary must comply with the limit on detention in the first sentence of (c) in order to invoke the rule on release in the second sentence of (c).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    <em>\n     Third\n    </em>\n    , Congress' enactment of a special \"transition\" statute strengthens the point. When Congress enacted subsection (c), it recognized that there might be \"insufficient detention space\" and \"personnel\" to carry out subsection (c)'s requirements. IIRIRA, \u00a7 303(b)(2),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Stat.%203009\">\n     110 Stat. 3009\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -586. It therefore authorized the Government to delay implementation of subsection (c)-initially for one year, then for a second year.\n    <em>\n     Ibid\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    If the majority were correct that the \"when ... released\" provision does not set a time limit on the Secretary's authority to deny bail hearings, then a special transition statute delaying implementation for one year would have been unnecessary. To avoid overcrowding, the Government simply could have delayed arresting aliens for 1, 2, 5, or 10 years, as the majority believes it can do, and then deny them bail hearings. What need for a 1-year transition period? The majority responds that the transition statute still served a purpose: to \"dela[y] the onset of the Secretary's obligation to begin making arrests.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 969. But that just raises the question: Why would Congress have needed to \"dela[y] the onset of the Secretary's obligation\" if it thought that the Secretary could detain aliens without a bail hearing after a year-long delay? The majority offers no good answer. The transition statute therefore strongly suggests that Congress viewed the \"when ... released\" provision as a constraint on the Secretary's authority to deny a bail hearing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    The transition statute also supports this conclusion in another respect: It demonstrates that Congress anticipated that subsection (c) would apply only to aliens \"released\" from state or federal prison. As noted, clauses A, B, C, and D in paragraph (1) cover some aliens who have never been in criminal custody.\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    , at 978. Even the majority acknowledges that it would be bizarre if these aliens could be detained without a bail hearing.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 970. The transition statute confirms as much: It indicates that \"the provisions of [subsection (c) ] shall apply to\n    <em>\n     individuals released\n    </em>\n    after\" the transition period concludes. IIRIRA, \u00a7 303(b)(2),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Stat.%203009\">\n     110 Stat. 3009\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -586 (emphasis added). From this it follows that Congress saw paragraph (2) as forbidding bail hearings only for aliens who have been \"released.\" That, however, can be true only if the \"when ... released\" provision limits the class of aliens subject to paragraph\n    (2)'s \"no-bail-hearing\" requirement. The majority's contrary reading, under which paragraph (2) applies \"regardless of ... whether the alien was released from criminal custody,\"\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 971, conflicts with how Congress itself described the scope of subsection (c) when it enacted the statute.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    C\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    Even if statutory text and structure were not enough to resolve these cases, the Government's reading would fail for another reason. A well-established canon of statutory interpretation provides that, \"if fairly possible,\" a statute must be construed \"so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional but also grave doubts upon that score.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.

And it runs counter to common sense: Why would the law grant a bail hearing to a person accused of murder but deny it to a person who many years before committed a crime perhaps no greater than possessing a stolen bus transfer?

I add only the obvious point that a bail hearing does not mean release on bail. It simply permits the person held to demonstrate that, if released, he will neither run away nor pose a threat. It is especially anomalous to take this opportunity away from an alien who committed a crime many years before and has since reformed, living productively in a community.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    The majority's reading also creates other anomalies. As I have said, by permitting the Secretary to hold aliens without a bail hearing even if they were not detained \"when ... released,\" the majority's reading would allow the Secretary to hold indefinitely without bail those who have never been to prison and who received only a fine or probation as punishment.\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    , at 978, 981 - 982.

In that case, subsection (c) will not apply, and the Secretary must fall back on subsection (a), the default detention and release provision. Critically, subsection (a) does not guarantee release. Rather, it leaves much to the Government's judgment: By regulation, aliens who are subject to subsection (a)'s default detention and release rules will simply receive a hearing at which they can attempt to demonstrate that, if released, they will not pose a risk of flight or a threat to the community.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20236.1\">\n     8 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 236.1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(1), 1236.1(d)(1).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    Finally, I have already mentioned the many harms that could befall aliens whom the Secretary does not detain \"when ... released.\" They range from long periods of detention, to detention years or even decades after the alien's release from criminal custody, to the risk of splitting up families that are long established in a community.\n    <em>\n     Supra,\n    </em>\n    at 981. Thus, unlike some of our prior cases, the harm from a missed deadline hardly can be described as \"insignificant.\"\n    <em>\n     Montalvo-Murillo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 719,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634320\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/711/\">\n     110 S.Ct. 2072\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    The plurality objects that \"Congress could not have meant for judges to 'enforce' \" the mandatory detention requirement \"in case of delay by-of all things-forbidding its execution.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 968. But treating the \"when the alien is released\" clause as an enforceable limit does not prohibit the Secretary from detaining the aliens that subsection (c) requires her to detain. Rather, the Secretary's failure to comply with the \"when the alien is released\" clause carries only one consequence: The Secretary cannot deny a bail hearing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    B\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    So what does the phrase \"when the alien is released\" mean? The word \"when\" can, but does not always, mean \"[a]t the time that,\" American Heritage Dictionary, at 1971, or \"just after the moment that,\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary, at 2602. But the word only \"[s]ometimes impl[ies] suddenness.\" 20 Oxford English Dictionary 209 (2d ed. 1989). It often admits of at least some temporal delay. A child who is told to \"mow the lawn, please, when you get home from school\" likely does not have to mow the lawn the second she comes into the house. She can do a few other things first.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    Mindful of \"the greater immigration-related expertise of the Executive Branch\" and \"the serious administrative needs and concerns inherent in the necessarily extensive [Government] efforts to enforce this complex statute,\" I would interpret the word \"when\" in the same manner as we interpreted other parts of this statute in\n    <em>\n     Zadvydas v. Davis\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n     533 U.S. 678\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 700,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n     121 S.Ct. 2491\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n     150 L.Ed.2d 653\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2001). The words \"when the alien is released\" require the Secretary to detain aliens under subsection (c) within a reasonable time after their release from criminal custody-presumptively no more than six months. If the Secretary does not do so, she must grant a bail hearing. This presumptive 6-month limit is consistent with how long the Government can detain certain aliens while they are awaiting removal from the country.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n     at 682, 701\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n     121 S.Ct. 2491\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (interpreting a different provision, \u00a7 1231(a)(6) ). To insist upon similar treatment in this context would give the Government sufficient time to detain aliens following their release from local, state, or federal criminal custody. It would also ensure that the Government does not fall outside the 1-year maximum dictated by the transition statute. See\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at 981, 983 - 984.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    IV\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    To reiterate: The question before us is not \"narrow.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 972 - 973 (KAVANAUGH,\n    J., concurring). See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 978. That is because we cannot interpret the words of this specific statute without also considering basic promises that America's legal system has long made to all persons. In deciphering the intent of the Congress that wrote this statute, we must decide-in the face of what is, at worst, linguistic ambiguity-whether Congress intended that persons who have long since paid their debt to society would be deprived of their liberty for months or years without the possibility of bail. We cannot decide that question without bearing in mind basic American legal values: the Government's duty not to deprive any \"person\" of \"liberty\" without \"due process of law,\" U.S. Const., Amdt. 5; the Nation's original commitment to protect the \"unalienable\" right to \"Liberty\"; and, less abstractly and more directly, the longstanding right of virtually all persons to receive a bail hearing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    I would have thought that Congress meant to adhere to these values and did not intend to allow the Government to apprehend persons years after their release from prison and hold them indefinitely without a bail hearing. In my view, the Court should interpret the words of this statute to reflect Congress' likely intent, an intent that is consistent with our basic values. To speak more technically, I believe that aliens are subject to paragraph (2)'s bar on release only if they are detained \"when ... released\" from criminal custody. To speak less technically, I fear that the Court's contrary interpretation will work serious harm to the principles for which American law has long stood.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    APPENDIXES\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    A\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    <strong>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n      8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </strong>\n    . \"Apprehension and detention of aliens\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    \"(a) Arrest, detention, and release\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-190\">\n    \"On a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an alien may be arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States.
