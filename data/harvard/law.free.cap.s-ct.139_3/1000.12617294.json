The question before us is whether an 1855 treaty between the United States and the Yakama Nation forbids the State of Washington to impose that tax upon fuel importers who are members of the Yakama Nation. We conclude that it does, and we affirm the Washington Supreme Court's similar decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A Washington statute applies to \"motor vehicle fuel importer[s]\" who bring large quantities of fuel into the State by \"ground transportation\" such as a \"railcar, trailer, [or] truck.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2082.36.010\">\n    Wash.

The statute requires each fuel importer to obtain a license, and it says that a fuel tax will be \"levied and imposed upon motor vehicle fuel licensees\" for \"each gallon of motor\n   vehicle fuel\" that the licensee brings into the State. \u00a7\u00a7 82.36.020(1), (2)(c). Licensed fuel importers who import fuel by ground transportation become liable to pay the tax as of the time the \"fuel enters into this [S]tate.\" \u00a7 82.36.020(2)(c) ; see also \u00a7\u00a7 82.38.020(4), (12), (15), (26), 82.38.030(1), (7)(c)(ii) (equivalent regulation of diesel fuel importers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   But\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   those licensed fuel importers who import fuel\n   <em>\n    by ground transportation\n   </em>\n   are liable to pay the tax. \u00a7\u00a7 82.36.026(3), 82.36.020(2)(c). For example, if a licensed fuel importer brings fuel into the State by pipeline, that fuel importer need not pay the tax. \u00a7\u00a7 82.36.026(3), 82.36.020(2)(c)(ii), 82.36.010(3). Similarly, if a licensed fuel importer brings fuel into the State by vessel, that fuel importer need not pay the tax. \u00a7\u00a7 82.36.026(3), 82.36.020(2)(c)(ii), 82.36.010(3). Instead, in each of those instances, the next purchaser or possessor of the fuel will pay the tax. \u00a7\u00a7 82.36.020(2)(a), (b), (d).

The Washington Supreme Court construed the statute that way in the decision below. That court wrote that the statute \"taxes the importation of fuel, which is the transportation of fuel.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=392%20P.3d%201014\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It added that \"travel on public highways is directly at issue because the tax [is] an importation tax.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=392%20P.3d%201014\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 67,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=392%20P.3d%201014\">\n    392 P.3d at 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Nor is there any reason to doubt that the Washington Supreme Court means what it said when it interpreted the Washington statute. We read the statute the same way. In the statute's own words, Washington \"impose[s] upon motor vehicle fuel licensees,\" including \"licensed importer[s],\" a tax for \"each gallon of motor vehicle fuel\" that \"enters into this state,\" but\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   \"if ... entry is\" by means of \"a railcar, trailer, truck, or other equipment suitable for ground transportation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2082.36.010\">\n    Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7\u00a7 82.36.010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4), 82.36.020(1), (2), 82.36.026(3). As is true of most tax laws, the statute is long and complex, and it is easy to stumble over this technical language. But if you are able to walk slowly through its provisions, the statute is easily followed. We need take only five steps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We start our journey at the beginning of the statute which first declares that \"[t]here is hereby levied and imposed upon motor vehicle fuel licensees, other than motor vehicle fuel distributors, a tax at the rate ... provided in [the statute] on each gallon of motor vehicle fuel.\" \u00a7 82.36.020(1). That is simple enough. Washington imposes a tax on a group of persons called \"motor vehicle fuel licensees\" for \"each gallon of motor vehicle fuel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Who are the \"motor vehicle fuel licensees\" that Washington taxes? We take a second step to find out. As the definitions section of the statute explains, the \"motor vehicle fuel licensees\" upon whom the tax is imposed are \"person[s] holding a ... motor vehicle fuel importer, motor vehicle fuel exporter, motor vehicle fuel blender, motor vehicle distributor, or international fuel tax agreement license.\" \u00a7 82.36.010(12). This, too, is easy to grasp. Not everyone who possesses motor vehicle fuel owes the tax. Instead, only motor vehicle fuel importers (and other similar movers and shakers within the motor vehicle fuel industry) who are licensed by the State to deal in fuel, must pay the tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   But must each of these motor vehicle fuel licensees pay the tax, so that the fuel is taxed as it passes from blender, to importer, to exporter, and so on? We take a third step, and learn that the answer is \"no.\" As the statute explains, \"the tax shall be imposed at the time and place of the first taxable event and upon the first taxable person within this state.\" \u00a7 82.36.022. Reading that, we understand that only the first licensee who can be taxed, will be taxed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   So, we ask, who is the first taxable licensee? Who must actually pay this tax?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We take a fourth step to find out. Logic tells us that the first licensee who can be taxed will likely be the licensee who brings fuel into the State. But, the statute tells us that a \"licensed importer\" is \"liable for and [must] pay tax to the department\" when \"[m]otor vehicle fuel enters into this state\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   ... [t]he entry is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   by bulk transfer.\" \u00a7\u00a7 82.36.020(2)(c), 82.36.026(3) (emphasis added). That is, a licensed importer can only be the first taxable licensee (and therefore the licensee that must pay the tax) if the importer brings fuel into the State by a method other than \"bulk transfer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   But what is \"bulk transfer\"? What does it mean to say that licensed fuel importers need only pay the tax if they do not bring in fuel by \"bulk transfer\"? We take a fifth, and final, step to find out. \"[B]ulk transfer,\" the definitions section explains, \"means a transfer of motor vehicle fuel by pipeline or vessel,\" as opposed to \"railcar, trailer, truck, or other equipment suitable for ground transportation.\" \u00a7\u00a7 82.36.010(3), (4). So, we learn that if the licensed fuel importer brings fuel into the State by ground transportation, then the fuel importer owes the tax. But if the licensed fuel importer brings fuel into the State by pipeline or vessel, then the importer will not be the first taxable person to possess the fuel, and he will not owe the tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In sum, Washington taxes travel by ground transportation with fuel. That feature sets the Washington statute apart from other statutes with which we are more familiar. It is not a tax on possession or importation. A statute that taxes possession would ordinarily require all people who own a good to pay the tax. A good example of that would be a State's real estate property tax. That statute would require all homeowners to pay the tax, every year, regardless of the specifics of their situation. And a statute that taxes importation would ordinarily require all people who bring a good into the State to pay a tax. A good example of that would be a federal tax on newly manufactured cars. That statute would ordinarily require all people who bring a new car into the country to pay a tax. But Washington's statute is different because it singles out ground transportation. That is, Washington does not just tax possession of fuel, or even importation of fuel, but instead taxes importation by ground transportation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The facts of this case provide a good example of the tax in operation. Each of the assessment orders that the Department sent to Cougar Den explained that Cougar Den owed the tax because Cougar Den traveled by highway. See App. 10a-26a; App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a. As the director explained, Cougar Den owed the tax because Cougar Den had caused fuel to enter \"into this [S]tate at the Washington-Oregon boundary on the Highway 97 bridge\" by means of a \"tank truck\" destined for \"the Yakama Reservation.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . The director offers this explanation in addition to quoting the quantity of fuel that Cougar Den possessed because the element of travel by ground transportation is a necessary prerequisite to the imposition of the tax. Put another way, the State must prove that Cougar Den\n   <em>\n    traveled by highway\n   </em>\n   in order to apply its tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We are not convinced by the arguments raised to the contrary. The Department claims, and THE CHIEF JUSTICE agrees, that the state tax has little or nothing to do with the treaty because it is not a tax on\n   <em>\n    travel with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    fuel\n   </em>\n   but rather a tax on the\n   <em>\n    possession of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    fuel\n   </em>\n   . See Brief for Petitioner 26-28;\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   , at ---- (dissenting opinion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We cannot accept that characterization of the tax, however, for the Washington Supreme Court has authoritatively held that the statute is a tax on travel. The Washington Supreme Court held that the Washington law at issue here \"taxes the importation of fuel, which is the transportation of fuel.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=188%20Wash.%202d%2055\">\n    188 Wash. 2d, at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=392%20P.3d%201014\">\n    392 P.3d at 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It added that \"travel on public highways is directly at issue because the tax [is] an importation tax.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=392%20P.3d%201014\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 67,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=392%20P.3d%201014\">\n    392 P.3d at 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In so doing, the State Supreme Court heard, considered, and rejected the construction of the fuel tax that the Department advances here. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=392%20P.3d%201014\">\n     ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=392%20P.3d%201014\">\n    392 P.3d at 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The Department argues, and the director agreed, that the taxes are assessed based on incidents of ownership or possession of fuel, and not incident to use of or travel on the roads or highways....

We decline the Department's invitation to overstep the bounds of our authority and construe the tax to mean what the Washington Supreme Court has said it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Nor would it make sense to construe the tax's incidence differently. The Washington Supreme Court's conclusion follows directly from its (and our) interpretation of how the tax operates. See\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at ---- - ----. To be sure, it is generally true that fuel imported into the State by trucks driving the public highways\n   <em>\n    can also\n   </em>\n   be described as fuel that is\n   <em>\n    possessed\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    for the first time\n   </em>\n   in the State. But to call the Washington statute a tax on \"first possession\" would give the law an over-inclusive label. As explained at length above, there are several ways in which a company could be a \"first possessor\" of fuel without incurring the tax. See\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   For example, Cougar Den would not owe the tax had Cougar Den \"first possessed\" fuel by piping fuel from out of State into a Washington refinery. First possession is not taxed if the fuel is brought into the State by pipeline and bound for a refinery. \u00a7\u00a7 82.36.026(3), 82.36.020(2)(c)(ii), 82.36.010(3). Similarly, Cougar Den would not owe the tax had Cougar Den \"first possessed\" fuel by bringing fuel into Washington through its waterways rather than its highways. First possession is not taxed if the fuel is brought into the State by vessel. \u00a7\u00a7 82.36.026(3), 82.36.020(2)(c)(ii), 82.36.010(3). Thus, it seems rather clear that the tax cannot accurately be described as a tax on the\n   <em>\n    first possession of fuel.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   But even if the contrary were true, the tax would still have the practical effect of burdening the Yakamas' travel. Here, the Yakamas' lone off-reservation act within the State is traveling along a public highway with fuel. The tax thus operates on the Yakamas exactly like a tax on transportation would: It falls upon them only because they happened to transport goods on a highway while en route to their reservation. And it is the practical effect of the state law that we have said makes the difference. We held, for instance, that the fishing rights reserved in the treaty pre-empted the State's enforcement of a trespass law against Yakama fishermen crossing private land to access the river. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Winans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1499507\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/198/371/#p381\">\n    198 U.S. 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 381,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1499507\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/198/371/#p381\">\n    25 S.Ct. 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1499507\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/198/371/#p381\">\n    49 L.Ed. 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1905). That was so even though the trespass law was not limited to those who trespass in order to fish but applied more broadly to any trespasser. Put another way, it mattered not that the tax was \"on\" trespassing rather than fishing because\n   the tax operated upon the Yakamas when they were exercising their treaty-protected right.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1499507\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/198/371/#p381\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Tulee v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374819\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/681/#p685\">\n    315 U.S. 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 685,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374819\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/681/#p685\">\n    62 S.Ct. 862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374819\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/681/#p685\">\n    86 L.Ed. 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1942) (holding that the fishing rights reserved in the treaty pre-empted the State's application of a fishing licensing fee to a Yakama fisherman, even though the fee also applied to types of fishing not practiced by the Yakamas). And this approach makes sense. When the Yakamas bargained in the treaty to protect their right to travel, they could only have cared about preventing the State from burdening their exercise of that right. To the Yakamas, it is thus irrelevant whether the State's tax might apply to other activities beyond transportation.

In a word, the treaty negotiations and the United States' representatives' statements to the Yakamas would have led the Yakamas to understand that the treaty's protection of the right to travel on the public highways included the right to travel with goods for purposes of trade.

In\n    <em>\n     Tulee\n    </em>\n    , for example, we held that the fishing right reserved by the Yakamas in the treaty pre-empted the application to the Yakamas of a state law requiring fishermen to buy fishing licenses.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374819\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/681/#p685\">\n     315 U.S. at 684\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374819\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/681/#p685\">\n     62 S.Ct. 862\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

If the cost of a fishing license interferes with the right to fish, so must a tax imposed on travel with goods (here fuel) interfere with the right to travel.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    We consequently conclude that Washington's fuel tax \"acts upon the Indians as a charge for exercising the very right their ancestors intended to reserve.\"\n    <em>\n     Ibid\n    </em>\n    . Washington's fuel tax cannot lawfully be assessed against Cougar Den on the facts here.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE concedes that \"the right to travel with goods is just an application of the Yakamas' right to travel.\"\n    <em>\n     Post\n    </em>\n    , at ---- (dissenting opinion); see also\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10182\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/145/#p148\">\n      ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (\"It ensures that the Yakamas enjoy the same privileges when they travel with goods as when they travel without them.\"). But he nevertheless insists that, because of the way in which the Washington statute taxes fuel, the statute does not interfere with the right to travel reserved by the Yakamas in the treaty.\n    <em>\n     Post\n    </em>\n    , at ----.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    First, THE CHIEF JUSTICE finds it significant that \"[t]he tax is calculated per gallon of fuel; not, like a toll, per vehicle or distance traveled.\"\n    <em>\n     Ibid\n    </em>\n    ., see also\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10182\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/145/#p148\">\n      ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (\"The tax before us does not resemble a blockade or a toll\"). But that argument fails on its own terms. A toll on highway travel is no less a toll when the toll varies based on the number of axles on a vehicle traveling the highway, or on the number of people traveling in the vehicle. We cannot, therefore, see why the number of gallons of fuel that the vehicle carries should make all the difference. Put another way, the fact that a tax on travel varies based on the features of that travel does not mean that the tax is not a tax on travel.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Second, THE CHIEF JUSTICE argues that it \"makes no sense,\" for example, to hold that \"a tax on certain luxury goods\" that is assessed the first time the goods are possessed in Washington cannot apply to a Yakama member \"who buys\" a mink coat \"over the state line in Portland and then drives back to the reservation,\" but the tax can apply to a Yakama member who \"buys a mink coat at an off-reservation store in Washington.\"\n    <em>\n     Post\n    </em>\n    , at ----. The short, conclusive answer to this argument is that there is a treaty that forbids taxing Yakama travel on highways with goods (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , fuel, or even furs) for market; and there is no treaty that forbids taxing Yakama off-reservation purchases of goods. Indeed, if our precedents supported THE CHIEF JUSTICE's rule, then our fishing rights cases would have turned on whether Washington also taxed fish purchased in the grocery store. Compare,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Tulee\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374819\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/681/#p685\">\n     315 U.S. at 682, n. 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374819\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/681/#p685\">\n     62 S.Ct. 862\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that the fishing right reserved by the Yakamas in the treaty pre-empted the application to the Yakamas of a state law which prohibited \" 'catch[ing] ... fish for food' \" without having purchased a license). But in those cases, we did not look to whether fish were taxed elsewhere in Washington. That is because the treaty does not protect the Yakamas from state sales taxes imposed on the off-reservation sale of goods. Instead, the treaty protects the Yakamas' right to travel the public highways without paying state taxes on that activity, much like the treaty protects the Yakamas' right to fish without paying state taxes on that activity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Third, THE CHIEF JUSTICE argues that only a law that \"punished or charged the Yakamas\" for an \"integral feature\" of a treaty right could be pre-empted by the treaty.\n    <em>\n     Post\n    </em>\n    , at 6. But that is true of the Washington statute at issue here. The treaty protects the right to travel with goods, see\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at ---- - ----, and the Washington statute taxes travel with goods, see\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at ---- - ----. Therefore, the statute charges the Yakamas for an \"integral feature\" of a treaty right. But even if the statute indirectly burdened a treaty right, under our precedents, the statute would still be pre-empted. One of the Washington statutes at issue in\n    <em>\n     Winans\n    </em>\n    was not a fishing regulation, but instead a trespassing statute. That trespassing statute indirectly burdened the right to fish by preventing the Yakamas from crossing privately owned\n    land so that the Yakamas could reach their traditional fishing places and camp on that private property during the fishing season. See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1499507\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/198/371/#p381\">\n     198 U.S. at 380-381\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1499507\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/198/371/#p381\">\n     25 S.Ct. 662\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . It cannot be true that a law prohibiting trespassing imposed a burden on the right to fish that is \"integral\" enough to be pre-empted by the treaty, while a law taxing goods carried to the reservation on the public highway imposes a burden on the right to travel that is too attenuated to be pre-empted by the treaty.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    C\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Although we hold that the treaty protects the right to travel on the public highway with goods, we do not say or imply that the treaty grants protection to carry any and all goods. Nor do we hold that the treaty deprives the State of the power to regulate, say, when necessary for conservation. To the contrary, we stated in\n    <em>\n     Tulee\n    </em>\n    that, although the treaty \"forecloses the [S]tate from charging the Indians a fee of the kind in question here,\" the State retained the \"power to impose on Indians, equally with others, such restrictions of a purely regulatory nature ... as are necessary for the conservation of fish.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374819\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/681/#p685\">\n     315 U.S. at 684\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374819\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/681/#p685\">\n     62 S.Ct. 862\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

See\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at ---- - ----. For these three reasons, Washington's fuel tax cannot lawfully be assessed against Cougar Den on the facts here.

In 1855, the United States sought and won a treaty in which the Tribe agreed to surrender 10 million acres, land that today makes up nearly a quarter of the State of Washington. In return, the Yakamas received a reservation and various promises, including a guarantee that they would enjoy \"the right, in common with citizens of the United States, to travel upon all public highways.\" Today, the parties offer dueling interpretations of this language. The State argues that it merely allows the Yakamas to travel on public highways like everyone else. And because everyone else importing gasoline from out of State by highway must pay a tax on that good, so must tribal members. Meanwhile, the Tribe submits that the treaty guarantees tribal members the right to move their goods to and from market freely. So that tribal members may bring goods, including gasoline, from an out-of-state market to sell on the reservation without incurring taxes along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Our job here is a modest one.

After the parties reached agreement, the U.S. negotiators wrote the treaty in English-a language that the Yakamas couldn't read or write.

But that is not how the Yakamas understood the treaty's terms.

As the Washington Supreme Court recognized, the treaty's terms permit regulations that allow the Yakamas and non-Indians to share the road in common and travel along it safely together. But they do not permit encumbrances on the ability of tribal members to bring their goods to and from market. And by everyone's admission, the state tax at issue here isn't about facilitating peaceful coexistence of tribal members and non-Indians on the public highways. It is about taxing a good as it passes to and from market-exactly what the treaty forbids.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    A wealth of historical evidence confirms this understanding.

The Yakamas knew all this and could see the writing on the wall: One way or another, their land would be taken.

Today, we simply recognize that the same language should yield the same result.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    With its primary argument now having failed, the State encourages us to labor through a series of backups. It begins by pointing out that the treaty speaks of allowing the Tribe \"free access\" from local roads to the public highways, but indicates that tribal members are to use those highways \"in common with\" non-Indians. On\n    the State's account, these different linguistic formulations must be given different meanings. And the difference the State proposes? No surprise: It encourages us to read the former language as allowing goods to be moved tax-free along local roads to the highways but the latter language as authorizing taxes on the Yakamas' goods once they arrive there. See also\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , at ---- (KAVANAUGH, J., dissenting).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The trouble is that nothing in the record supports this interpretation. Uncontested factual findings reflect the Yakamas' understanding that the treaty would allow them to use the highways to bring goods to and from market freely. These findings bind us under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, and no one has proposed any lawful basis for ignoring them. Nor, for that matter, has anyone even tried to offer a reason why the Tribe might have bargained for the right to move its goods freely only part of the way to market. Our job in this case is to interpret the treaty as the Yakamas originally understood it in 1855-not in light of new lawyerly glosses conjured up for litigation a continent away and more than 150 years after the fact.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    If that alternative won't work, the State offers another. It admits that the Yakamas personally may have a right to travel the highways free of most restrictions on their movement. See also\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , at ---- (ROBERTS, C.J., dissenting) (acknowledging that the treaty prohibits the State from \"charg[ing] ... a toll\" on Yakamas traveling on the highway). But, the State continues, the law at issue here doesn't offend that right. It doesn't, we are told, because the \"object\" of the State's tax isn't\n    <em>\n     travel\n    </em>\n    but the\n    <em>\n     possession\n    </em>\n    of fuel; the fact that the State happens to assess its tax when fuel is possessed on a public highway rather than someplace else is neither here nor there. And just look, we are told, at the anomalies that might arise if we ruled otherwise. A tribal member who buys a \"mink coat\" in a Washington store would have to pay the State's sales tax, but a tribal member who purchases the same coat at market in Oregon could not be taxed for possessing it on the highway when reentering Washington. See\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , at ---- - ----.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    This argument suffers from much the same problem as its predecessors. Now, at least, the State may acknowledge that the Yakamas personally have a right to travel free of most restrictions. But the State still fails to give full effect to the treaty's terms and the Yakamas' original understanding of them. After all and as we've seen, the treaty doesn't just guarantee tribal members the right to\n    <em>\n     travel\n    </em>\n    on the highways free of most restrictions on their movement; it also guarantees tribal members the right to\n    <em>\n     move goods\n    </em>\n    freely to and from market using those highways. And it's impossible to\n    <em>\n     transport\n    </em>\n    goods without\n    <em>\n     possessing\n    </em>\n    them. So a tax that falls on the Yakamas' possession of goods as they travel to and from market on the highway violates the treaty just as much as a tax on travel alone would.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Consider the alternative. If the State could save the tax here simply by labeling it a fee on the \"possession\" of a good, the State might just as easily revive the fishing license fee\n    <em>\n     Tulee\n    </em>\n    struck down simply by calling it a fee on the \"possession\" of fish. That, of course, would be ridiculous. The Yakamas' right to fish includes the right to\n    <em>\n     possess\n    </em>\n    the fish they catch-just like their right to\n    <em>\n     move\n    </em>\n    goods on the highways embraces the right to\n    <em>\n     possess\n    </em>\n    them there. Nor does the State's reply solve the problem. It accepts, as it must, that possessing fish is \"integral\" to the right to fish.\n    <em>\n     Post\n    </em>\n    , at ----, n. 2 (ROBERTS, C.J., dissenting). But it stands pat on its assertion that the treaty protects nothing more than a personal right to travel, ignoring all\n    of the facts and binding findings before us establishing that the treaty\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    guarantees a right to move (and so possess) goods freely as they travel to and from market.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1499507\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/198/371/#p381\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    What about the supposed \"mink coat\" anomaly? Under the terms of the treaty before us, it's true that a Yakama who buys a mink coat (or perhaps some more likely item) at an off-reservation store in Washington will have to pay sales tax because the treaty is silent there. And it is also true that a Yakama who buys the same coat right over the state line, pays any taxes due at market there, and then drives back to the reservation using the public highways is entitled to move that good tax-free from market back to the reservation. But that is hardly anomalous-\n    <em>\n     that\n    </em>\n    is the treaty right the Yakamas reserved. And it's easy to see why. Imagine the Yakama Reservation reached the Washington/Oregon state line (as it did before the 1855 Treaty). In that case, Washington would have no basis to tax the Yakamas' transportation of goods from Oregon (whether they might be fuel, mink coats, or anything else), as all of the Yakamas' conduct would take place outside of the State or on the reservation. The only question here is whether the result changes because the Tribe must now use Washington's highways to make the trek home. And the answer is no. The Tribe bargained for a right to travel with goods off reservation just as it could on reservation and just as it had for centuries. If the State and federal governments do not like that result, they are free to bargain for more, but they do not get to rewrite the existing bargain in this Court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Alternatively yet, the State warns us about the dire consequences of a ruling against it. Highway speed limits, reckless driving laws, and much more, the State tells us, will be at risk if we rule for the Tribe. See also\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , at ---- - ---- (ROBERTS, C.J., dissenting). But notice. Once you acknowledge (as the State and primary dissent just have) that the Yakamas\n    <em>\n     themselves\n    </em>\n    enjoy a right to travel free of at least some nondiscriminatory state regulations, this \"problem\" inevitably arises. It inevitably arises, too, once you concede that the Yakamas enjoy a right to travel freely at least on local roads. See\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , at ---- (KAVANAUGH, J., dissenting). Whether you read the treaty to afford the Yakamas the further right to bring goods to and from market is beside the point.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    It turns out, too, that the State's parade of horribles isn't really all that horrible. While the treaty supplies the Yakamas with special rights to travel with goods to and from market, we have seen already that its \"in common with\" language\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    indicates that tribal members knew they would have to \"share the use of the road with whites\" and accept regulations designed to allow the two groups' safe coexistence.\n    <em>\n     Yakama Indian Nation\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"841823\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/955/1229/#p1243\">\n     955 F.Supp. at 1265\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Indeed, the Yakamas\n    <em>\n     expected\n    </em>\n    laws designed to \"protec[t]\" their ability to travel safely alongside non-Indians on the highways. See App. to Brief for Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation as\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    21a, 31a. Maybe, too, that expectation goes some way toward explaining why the State's hypothetical parade of horribles has yet to take its first step in the real world. No one before us has identified a single challenge to a state highway speed limit, reckless driving law, or other critical highway safety regulation in the entire life of the Yakama treaty.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Retreating now, the State suggests that the real problem isn't so much about the Yakamas themselves traveling freely as it is with their goods doing so. We are told we should worry, for example, about limiting Washington's ability to regulate the\n    transportation of diseased apples from Oregon. See also\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , at ---- (ROBERTS, C.J., dissenting). But if bad apples prove to be a public menace, Oregon and its localities may regulate them when they are grown or picked at the orchard. Oregon, its localities, and maybe even the federal government may regulate the bad apples when they arrive at market for sale in Oregon. The Tribe and again, perhaps, the federal government may regulate the bad apples when they arrive on the reservation. And if the bad apples somehow pose a threat to safe travel on the highways, even Washington may regulate them as they make their way from Oregon to the reservation-just as the State may require tribal members to abide nondiscriminatory regulations governing the safe transportation of flammable cargo as they drive their gas trucks from Oregon to the reservation along public highways. The only thing that Washington may not do is reverse the promise the United States made to the Yakamas in 1855 by imposing a tax or toll on tribal members or their goods as they pass to and from market.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Finally, some worry that, if we recognize the potential permissibility of state highway safety laws, we might wind up impairing the interests of \"tribal members across the country.\" See\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , at ---- (ROBERTS, C.J., dissenting). But our decision today is based on unchallenged factual findings about how the Yakamas themselves understood this treaty in light of the negotiations that produced it. And the Tribe itself has expressly acknowledged that its treaty, while extending real and valuable rights to tribal members, does not preclude laws that merely facilitate the safe use of the roads by Indians and non-Indians alike. Nor does anything we say here necessarily apply to other tribes and other treaties; each must be taken on its own terms. In the end, then, the only true threat to tribal interests today would come from replacing the meaningful right the Yakamas thought they had reserved with the trivial promise the State suggests.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Really, this case just tells an old and familiar story. The State of Washington includes millions of acres that the Yakamas ceded to the United States under significant pressure. In return, the government supplied a handful of modest promises. The State is now dissatisfied with the consequences of one of those promises. It is a new day, and now it wants more. But today and to its credit, the Court holds the parties to the terms of their deal. It is the least we can do.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Chief Justice ROBERTS, with whom Justice THOMAS, Justice ALITO, and Justice KAVANAUGH join, dissenting.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    In the 1855 treaty in which the Yakamas surrendered most of their lands to the United States, the Tribe sought to protect its way of life by reserving, among other rights, \"the right, in common with citizens of the United States, to travel upon all public highways.\" Treaty Between the United States and the Yakama Nation of Indians, Art. III, June 9, 1855,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Stat.%20953\">\n     12 Stat. 953\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Cougar Den, a Yakama corporation that uses public highways to truck gas into Washington, contends that the treaty exempts it from Washington's fuel tax, which the State assesses upon the importation of fuel into the State. The plurality agrees, concluding that Washington cannot impose the tax on Cougar Den because doing so would \"have the practical effect of burdening\" Cougar Den's exercise of its right to travel on the highways.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at ----. The concurrence reaches the same result, reasoning that, because the Yakamas' right to travel includes the right to travel with goods, the State cannot tax or regulate the Yakamas' goods on the highways.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at ---- - ---- (GORSUCH, J., concurring in judgment).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    But the mere fact that a state law has an effect on the Yakamas\n    <em>\n     while\n    </em>\n    they are exercising a treaty right does not establish that the law impermissibly burdens the right itself. And the right to travel with goods is just an application of the Yakamas' right to travel. It ensures that the Yakamas enjoy the same privileges when they travel with goods as when they travel without them. It is not an additional right to possess whatever goods they wish on the highway, immune from regulation and taxation. Under our precedents, a state law violates a treaty right only if the law imposes liability upon the Yakamas \"for exercising the very right their ancestors intended to reserve.\"\n    <em>\n     Tulee v.

Applying the reasoning of those decisions to the Yakamas' right to travel, it follows that a State could not bar Yakama members from traveling on a public highway, or charge them a toll to do so.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Nothing of the sort is at issue here. The tax before us does not resemble a blockade or a toll. It is a tax on a product imported into the State, not a tax on highway travel. The statute says as much: \"There is hereby levied and imposed ... a tax ...\n    <em>\n     on each gallon of motor vehicle fuel\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2082.36.020\">\n     Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 82.36.020\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1) (2012) (emphasis added). It is difficult to imagine how the legislature could more clearly identify the object of the tax. The tax is calculated per gallon of fuel; not, like a toll, per vehicle or distance traveled. It is imposed on the owner of the fuel, not the driver or owner of the vehicle-separate entities in this case. And it is imposed at the same rate on fuel that enters the State by methods other than a public highway-whether private road, rail, barge, or pipeline. \u00a7\u00a7 82.36.010(4), 020(1), (2). Had Cougar Den filled up its trucks at a refinery or pipeline terminal in Washington, rather than trucking fuel in from Oregon, there would be no dispute that it was subject to the exact same tax. See\n    \u00a7\u00a7 82.36.020(2)(a), (b)(ii). Washington is taxing the fuel that Cougar Den imports, not Cougar Den's travel on the highway; it is not charging the Yakamas \"for exercising the very right their ancestors intended to reserve.\"\n    <em>\n     Tulee\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374819\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/681/#p685\">\n     315 U.S. at 685\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374819\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/681/#p685\">\n     62 S.Ct. 862\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    It makes no difference that Washington happens to impose that charge when Cougar Den's drivers cross into Washington on a public highway. The time and place of the imposition of the tax does not change what is taxed, and thus what activity-possession of goods or travel-is burdened. Say Washington imposes a tax on certain luxury goods, assessed upon first possession of the goods by a retail customer. A Yakama member who buys a mink coat at an off-reservation store in Washington will pay the tax. Yet, as the plurality acknowledges, under its view a tribal member who buys the same coat right over the state line in Portland and then drives back to the reservation will owe no tax-all because of a reserved right to travel on the public highways.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at ----. That makes no sense. The tax charges individuals for possessing expensive furs. It in no way burdens highway travel.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The plurality devotes five pages to planting trees in hopes of obscuring the forest: to delving into irrelevancies about how the tax is assessed or collected, instead of the substance of what is taxed. However assessed or collected, the tax on 10,000 gallons of fuel is the same whether the tanker carrying it travels three miles in Washington or three hundred. The tax varies only with the amount of fuel. Why? Because the tax is on fuel, not travel. If two tankers travel 200 miles together from the same starting point to the same destination-one empty, one full of fuel-the full tanker will pay the fuel tax, the empty tanker will pay nothing. Their travel has been identical, but only the full one pays tax. Why? Because the tax is on fuel, not travel. The tax is on the owner of the fuel, not the owner of the vehicle. Why? You get the point.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The plurality responds that, even though the tax is calculated per gallon of fuel, it remains a tax on travel because it taxes a \"feature\" of travel.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at ----. It is of course true that tanker trucks can be seen from time to time on the highways, but that hardly makes them a regular \"feature\" of travel, like the plurality's examples of axles or passengers. And we know that Washington is not taxing the gas insofar as it is a feature of Cougar Den's travel, because Washington imposes the exact same tax on gas that is not in transit on the highways.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Rather than grappling with the substance of the tax, the plurality fixates on variations in the time and place of its assessment. The plurality thinks it significant that Washington does not impose the tax at the moment of entry on fuel that enters the State by pipeline or by a barge bound for a refinery, but instead when a tanker truck withdraws the fuel from the refinery or pipeline terminal. This may demonstrate that the tax is not on\n    <em>\n     first\n    </em>\n    possession of fuel in the State, as the plurality stresses, but it hardly demonstrates that the tax is not on possession of fuel\n    <em>\n     at all\n    </em>\n    . Regardless of how fuel enters the State, someone will eventually pay a per-gallon charge for possessing it. Washington simply assesses the fuel tax in each case upon the wholesaler. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=188%20Wash.%202d%2055\">\n     188 Wash. 2d 55\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 60,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=392%20P.3d%201014\">\n     392 P.3d 1014\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1016 (2017). This variation does not indicate, as the plurality suggests, that the fuel tax is somehow\n    <em>\n     targeted\n    </em>\n    at highway travel.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    The plurality also says that it is bound by the Washington Supreme Court's references to the tax as an \"importation tax\" and tax on \"the importation of fuel,\"\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at ---- (quoting\n    <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=188%20Wash.%202d%2055\">\n     188 Wash. 2d, at 67, 69\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=392%20P.3d%201014\">\n     392 P.3d at 1019\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1020 ), but these two references to the point at which the tax is\n    <em>\n     assessed\n    </em>\n    are not authoritative constructions of the\n    <em>\n     object\n    </em>\n    of the tax. The state court did not reject Washington's argument that this is a tax on fuel; instead, like the plurality today, it ignored that argument and concluded that the tax was invalid simply because Washington imposed it while Cougar Den was traveling on the highway. In any event, the state court more often referred to the tax as a \"tax on fuels\" or \"fuel tax[ ].\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    ., at 58-61,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=392%20P.3d%201014\">\n     392 P.3d at 1015-1016\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    After the five pages arguing that a tax expressly labeled as on \"motor vehicle fuel\" is actually a tax on something else, the plurality concludes ... it doesn't matter. As the plurality puts it at page nine of its opinion, \"even if \" the tax is on fuel and not travel, it is preempted because it has \"the practical effect of burdening\" the Yakamas' right to travel on the highways. The plurality's rule-that States may not enforce general legislation that has an effect on the Yakamas while they are traveling-has no basis in our precedents, which invalidated laws that punished or charged the Yakamas simply for exercising their reserved rights. The plurality is, of course, correct that the trespass law in\n    <em>\n     Winans\n    </em>\n    did not target fishing, but it effectively made illegal the very act of fishing at a traditional location. Here, it is the possession of commercial quantities of fuel that exposes the Yakamas to liability, not travel itself or any integral feature of travel.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The concurrence reaches the same result as the plurality, but on different grounds. Rather than holding that the treaty preempts any law that burdens the Yakamas while traveling on the highways, the concurrence reasons that the fuel tax is preempted because it regulates the possession of goods, and the Yakamas' right to travel includes the right to travel with goods.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at ---- - ----. But the right to travel with goods is just an application of the right to travel. It means the Yakamas enjoy the same privileges whether they travel with goods or without. It does not provide the Yakamas with an additional right to carry any and all goods on the highways, tax free, in any manner they wish.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    The concurrence purports to find this additional right in the record of the treaty negotiations, but the record shows only that the Yakamas wanted to ensure they could continue to travel to the places where they traded. They did not, and did not intend to, insulate the goods they carried from all regulation and taxation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Nothing in the text of the treaty, the historical record, or our precedents supports the conclusion that the right \"to travel upon all public highways\" transforms the Yakamas' vehicles into mobile reservations, immunizing their contents from any state interference. Before it reaches the reservation, the fuel in Cougar Den's tanker trucks is always susceptible to state regulation-it does not pass in and out of state authority with every exit off or entry onto the road.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Recognizing the potentially broad sweep of its new rule, the plurality cautions that it does not intend to deprive the State of the power to regulate when necessary \"to prevent danger to health or safety occasioned\n    by a tribe member's exercise of treaty rights.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at ----. This escape hatch ensures, the plurality suggests, that the treaty will not preempt essential regulations that burden highway travel.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at ---- - ----. I am not so confident.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    First, by its own terms, the plurality's health and safety exception is limited to laws that regulate dangers \"occasioned by\" a Yakama's travel. That would seem to allow speed limits and other rules of the road. But a law against possession of drugs or illegal firearms-the dangers of which have nothing to do with travel-does not address a health or safety risk \"occasioned by\" highway driving. I do not see how, under the plurality's rule or the concurrence's, a Washington police officer could burden a Yakama's travel by pulling him over on suspicion of carrying such contraband on the highway.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    But the more fundamental problem is that this Court has never recognized a health and safety exception to reserved treaty rights, and the plurality today mentions the exception only in passing. Importantly, our precedents-all of which concern hunting and fishing rights-acknowledge the authority of the States to regulate Indians' exercise of their reserved rights only in the interest of\n    <em>\n     conservation\n    </em>\n    .

Adapted to the travel right, the conservation exception would presumably protect regulations that preserve the subject of the Yakamas' right by maintaining safe and orderly travel on the highways. But many regulations that burden highway travel (such as emissions standards, noise restrictions, or the plurality's hypothetical ban on the importation of plutonium) do not fit that description.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The need for the health and safety exception, of course, follows from the overly expansive interpretation of the treaty right adopted by the plurality and concurrence. Today's decision digs such a deep hole that the future promises a lot of backing and filling. Perhaps there are good reasons to revisit our long-held understanding of reserved treaty rights as the plurality does, and adopt a broad health and safety exception to deal with the inevitable fallout. Hard to say, because no party or\n    <em>\n     amicus\n    </em>\n    has addressed the question.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    The plurality's response to this important issue is the following, portentous sentence: \"The record of the treaty negotiations may not support the contention that the Yakamas expected to use the roads entirely unconstrained by laws related to health or safety.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at ----. A lot of weight on two words, \"may not.\" The plurality cites assurances from the territorial Governor of Washington that the United\n    States would make laws to prevent \"bad white men\" from harming the Yakamas, and that the United States expected the Yakamas to exercise similar restraint in return.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at ----. What this has to do with health and safety regulations affecting the highways (or fishing or hunting) is not clear.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    In the meantime, do not assume today's decision is good news for tribal members across the country. Application of state safety regulations, for example, could prevent Indians from hunting and fishing in their traditional or preferred manner, or in particular \"usual and accustomed places.\" I fear that, by creating the need for this untested exception, the unwarranted expansion of the Yakamas' right to travel may undermine rights that the Yakamas and other tribes really did reserve.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    The concurrence does not mention the plurality's possible health and safety exception, but observes that the Yakamas expected to follow laws that \"facilitate the safe use of the roads by Indians and non-Indians alike.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at ----. The State is therefore wrong, the concurrence says, to contend that a decision exempting Cougar Den's fuel from taxation would call into question speed limits and reckless driving laws. But that is not the State's principal argument. The State acknowledges that laws facilitating safe travel on the highways would fall within the long-recognized conservation exception. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12-13. The problem is that today's ruling for Cougar Den preempts the enforcement of any regulation of\n    <em>\n     goods\n    </em>\n    on the highway that does not concern\n    <em>\n     travel\n    </em>\n    safety-such as a prohibition on the possession of potentially contaminated apples taken from a quarantined area (a matter of vital concern in Washington). See\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    ., at 13; Brief for Petitioner 44.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    The concurrence says not to worry, the apples could be regulated and inspected where they are grown, or when they arrive at a market. Or, if the Yakamas are taking the apples back to the reservation, perhaps the Federal Government or the Tribe itself could address the problem there.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at ----. What the concurrence does not say is that the State could regulate the contraband apples on the highway. And there is no reason offered why other contraband should be treated any differently.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Surely the concurrence does not mean to suggest that the parties to the 1855 treaty intended to confer on the Tribe the right to travel with illegal goods, free of any regulation. But if that is not the logical consequence of the decision today, the plurality and the concurrence should explain why. It is the least they should do.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Justice KAVANAUGH, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, dissenting.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    The text of the 1855 treaty between the United States and the Yakama Tribe affords the Tribe a \"right, in common with citizens of the United States, to travel upon all public highways.\" Treaty Between the United States and the Yakama Nation of Indians, Art. III, June 9, 1855,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Stat.%20953\">\n     12 Stat. 953\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The treaty's \"in common with\" language means what it says. The treaty recognizes tribal members' right to travel on off-reservation public highways on equal terms with other U.S. citizens. Under the text of the treaty, the tribal members, like other U.S. citizens, therefore still remain subject to\n    <em>\n     nondiscriminatory\n    </em>\n    state highway regulations-that is, to regulations that apply equally to tribal members and other U.S. citizens.

That includes, for example, speed limits, truck restrictions, and reckless driving laws.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    The Washington law at issue here imposes a nondiscriminatory fuel tax. THE CHIEF JUSTICE concludes that the fuel tax is not a highway regulation and, for that reason, he says that the fuel tax does not infringe the Tribe's treaty right to travel on the public highways. I agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE and join his dissent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Even if the fuel tax is a highway regulation, it is a\n    <em>\n     nondiscriminatory\n    </em>\n    highway regulation. For that reason as well, the fuel tax does not infringe the Tribe's treaty right to travel on the public highways on equal terms with other U.S. citizens.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The plurality, as well as the concurrence in the judgment, suggests that the treaty, if construed that way, would not have been important to the Yakamas. For that reason, the plurality and the concurrence would not adhere to that textual meaning and would interpret \"in common with\" other U.S. citizens to mean, in essence, \"exempt from regulations that apply to\" other U.S. citizens.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    I respectfully disagree with that analysis. The treaty right to travel on the public highways \"in common with\"-that is, on equal terms with-other U.S. citizens was important to the Yakama tribal members at the time the treaty was signed. That is because, as of 1855, States and the Federal Government sometimes required tribal members to seek permission before leaving their reservations or even prohibited tribal members from leaving their reservations altogether. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Treaty Between the United States of America and the Utah Indians, Art. VII, Dec. 30, 1849, 9 Stat 985; Mo. Rev. Stat., ch. 80, \u00a7 10 (1845). The Yakamas needed to travel to sell their goods and trade for other goods. As a result, those kinds of laws would have devastated the Yakamas' way of life. Importantly, the terms of the 1855 treaty made crystal clear that those kinds of travel restrictions could not be imposed on the Yakamas.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    In particular, the treaty afforded Yakama tribal members two relevant rights. First was \"free access\" on roads from the reservation to \"the nearest public highway.\" Art.

Second was a right to travel \"in common with\" other U.S. citizens on \"all public highways.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Stat.%20953\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The right to free access from the reservation to public highways, combined with the right to travel off reservation on public highways, facilitated the Yakama tribal members' extensive trading network.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    In determining the meaning of the \"in common with\" language, we must recognize that the treaty used different language in defining (1) the right to \"free access,\" which applies only on roads connecting the reservation to the off-reservation public highways, and (2) the right to travel \"in common with\" other U.S. citizens, which applies on those off-reservation public highways. The approach of the plurality and the concurrence would collapse that distinction between the \"free access\" and \"in common with\" language and thereby depart from the text of the treaty. I would stick with the text. The treaty's \"in common with\" language-both at the time the treaty was signed and now-means what it says: the right for Yakama tribal members to travel on public highways on equal terms with other U.S. citizens.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    To be sure, the treaty as negotiated and written may not have turned out to be a particularly good deal for the Yakamas. As a matter of separation of powers, however, courts are bound by the text of the treaty. See\n    <em>\n     Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206037\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/753/#p774\">\n     473 U.S. 753\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 774,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206037\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/753/#p774\">\n     105 S.Ct. 3420\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206037\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/753/#p774\">\n     87 L.Ed.2d 542\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1985). It is for Congress and the President, not the courts, to update a law and provide additional compensation or benefits to tribes\n    beyond those provided by an old law. And since 1855, and especially since 1968, Congress has in fact taken many steps to assist tribes through a variety of significant legislative measures. In short, lament about the terms of the treaty negotiated by the Federal Government and the Tribe in 1855 does not support the Judiciary (as opposed to Congress and the President) rewriting the law in 2019.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    What about precedent? It is true that some of our older precedents interpreted similar \"in common with\" treaty language regarding fishing rights to grant tribal members an exemption from certain fishing regulations, even when the fishing regulations were nondiscriminatory. But as we explained in the most recent of those fishing cases, those nondiscriminatory fishing regulations had the effect of preventing the Tribes from catching a fair share of the fish in the relevant area. In other words, the fishing regulations at issue were discriminatory in effect even though nondiscriminatory on their face. See\n    <em>\n     Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184874\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/658/#p677\">\n     443 U.S. 658\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 676, n. 22,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184874\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/658/#p677\">\n     99 S.Ct. 3055\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184874\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/658/#p677\">\n     61 L.Ed.2d 823\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1979).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    That rationale for departing from the treaty text in the narrow context of the fishing cases does not apply in the highway context. Facially nondiscriminatory highway regulations-such as speed limits, truck restrictions, and reckless driving laws-are also nondiscriminatory in effect, as relevant here. They do not deprive tribal members of use of the public highways or deprive tribal members of a fair share of the public highways.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Washington's facially nondiscriminatory fuel tax is likewise nondiscriminatory in effect. The Washington fuel tax therefore does not violate the key principle articulated in the fishing cases. I would adhere to the text of the treaty and hold that the tribal members, like other citizens of the State of Washington, are subject to the nondiscriminatory fuel tax.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    The Court (via the plurality opinion and the concurrence) disagrees. The Court relies on the fishing cases and fashions a new right for Yakama tribal members to disregard even nondiscriminatory highway regulations, such as the Washington fuel tax and perhaps also Washington's similarly structured cigarette tax. The Court's newly created right will allow Yakama businesses not to pay state taxes that must be paid by other competing businesses, including by businesses run by members of the many other tribes in the State of Washington. As a result, the State of Washington (along with other States) stands to lose millions of dollars annually in tax revenue, which will necessarily mean fewer services or increased taxes for other citizens and tribes in the State.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    In addition, the Court's newly created right-if applied across the board-would seem to afford Yakama tribal members an exemption from all manner of highway regulations, ranging from speed limits to truck restrictions to reckless driving laws. No doubt because of those negative real-world consequences, the Court simultaneously fashions a new health and safety exception.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    But neither the right nor the exception comes from the text of the treaty. As THE CHIEF JUSTICE explains, the Court's \"need for the health and safety exception, of course, follows from the overly expansive interpretation of the treaty right adopted by the plurality and concurrence.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at ----.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    I share THE CHIEF JUSTICE's concern that the Court's new right for tribal\n    members to disregard even nondiscriminatory highway regulations and the Court's new exception to that right for health and safety regulations could generate significant uncertainty and unnecessary litigation for States and tribes. THE CHIEF JUSTICE says it well: The Court \"digs such a deep hole that the future promises a lot of backing and filling.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184874\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/658/#p677\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Instead of judicially creating a new atextual right for tribal members to disregard nondiscriminatory highway regulations and then backfilling by judicially creating a new atextual exception to that right for health and safety regulations, I would adhere to the text of the treaty and leave it to Congress, if it chooses, to provide additional benefits for the Yakamas. In my respectful view, even when we interpret any ambiguities in the treaty in favor of the Tribe, the treaty phrase \"in common with\" cannot properly be read to exempt tribal members from nondiscriminatory highway regulations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    In sum, under the treaty, Washington's nondiscriminatory fuel tax may be imposed on Yakama tribal members just as it may be imposed on other citizens and tribes in the State of Washington. I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-130\">\n     There is something of an optical illusion in this case that may subtly distort analysis. It comes from the fact that the tax here happens to be on motor fuel. There is no claim, however, that the tax inhibits the treaty right to travel because of the link between motor fuel and highway travel. The question presented must be analyzed as if the tax were imposed on goods of any sort.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-131\">\n     The plurality simply assumes that the right to travel with goods is an additional, substantive right when it reasons that the fuel tax is preempted because it taxes an \"integral feature\" of travel with goods.\n     <em>\n      Ante\n     </em>\n     , at ----. The concurrence makes the same assumption when it compares the fuel tax to a tax on \" 'possession' of fish\"\n     <em>\n      Ante\n     </em>\n     , at ----. That tax would be preempted because \"taking possession of fish\" is just another way of describing the act of fishing. But possession of a tanker full of fuel is not an integral feature of travel, which is the relevant activity protected by the treaty.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-132\">\n     I understand both the plurality opinion and the concurrence to approve of a health and safety exception.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
