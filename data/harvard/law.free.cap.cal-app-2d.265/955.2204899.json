J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW_\">This is an appeal from a judgment vacating an alternative writ of mandate and denying a peremptory writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Appellant, a certificated public school teacher, was serving as a probationary teacher of mentally retarded pupils in the Santa Monica Unified School District (District) under the jurisdiction of respondents who, other than Dr. Alfred A. Artuso, were members of its Board of Education, herein \u201cBoard.\u201d Dr. Artuso was Superintendent of Schools of the District and also served as secretary to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">On February 17, 1966, appellant was informed by Frank Taylor, Director of Special Services for District, that he did not meet the standards required. He was told his contract of employment would not be renewed and given a choice of resigning or having dismissal proceedings brought against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">On February 18, 1966, appellant delivered a formal letter of resignation to respondent effective as of June 17, 1966. The record shows that appellant lmew his letter of resignation would be acted upon at the regular meeting of the Board to be held on the evening of May 9,1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">On the afternoon of May 9, 1966, at approximately 3:30 p.m. appellant delivered to one Velma Shay a sealed white envelope bearing the words \u201cBoard of Education,\u201d enclosing a letter in which appellant revoked his resignation. At the time of delivering said envelope to Velma Shay, petitioner did not identify himself. He did not inform her of the contents of the envelope. He did not tell her that the Board should receive the envelope before its meeting that evening. He was told that Dr. Artuso, the superintendent, was not in his office and was not expected to return to the office that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">Velma Shay is an employee of the District. She is one of the secretaries to Dr. Artuso. Shay\u2019s duties as a secretary, however, were limited to the performance of secretarial tasks required by Dr. Artuso. She did not perform secretarial work in connection with Dr. Artuso\u2019s responsibility as secretary to the Board of Education. She did not assist in the preparation of the Board\u2019s agenda, nor did she perform any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>work for the Board. She had no personal knowledge of, mat-; ters presented to the Board, did not regularly attend Board meetings, and was not in attendance at the Board meeting on the night of May 9,1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">The Board met on May 9 and accepted appellant\u2019s resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">It is undisputed that appellant was personally present at the meeting of the Board on May 9, 1966, when the Board: formally accepted his letter of resignation. Appellant did not indicate to the Board at that time his intent to revoke the letter of resignation, nor did he call to the Board\u2019s attention the letter which had been left with Velma Shay that afternoon. The trial court found that at the time of said acceptance no member of the Board had been informed of appellant\u2019s intent to revoke the aforementioned letter of resigna--; tion, nor had the superintendent of respondent school district been so informed.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">By letter of May 12, 1966, John Carter, Director of Personnel Services of the District gave written notice to appellant of the May 9th action of the Board. Subsequent to that time, appellant wrote to the District contesting the Board\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Appellant contends that he was not regularly dismissed for cause pursuant to notice and hearing, as required by section 13444 of the Education Code. The record, of course, admits this. The sole issue before us is whether the offer to resign had been effectively revoked prior to its acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">Although an offer can be revoked at any time before it is accepted, but not afterwards, <em>(Sherman </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>9 Cal.App.2d 262, 266 [49 P.2d 350] ; <em>Shade </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>21 Cal.App.2d 725, 727, 728 [70 P.2d 490]), \u201c\u2018A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. \u2019 \u201d <em>(Drennan </em>v. <em>Star Paving Co., </em>51 Cal.2d 409, 413 [333 P.2d 757].)</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">The trial court found appellant\u2019s attempted revocation was not timely and that even if it were, he was estopped from contending revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">In addition to the facts set out above in respect of the delivery to Shay of the letter of revocation, the uncontra-' dieted affidavit of Frank Taylor avers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-11\">\u201cOn or about February 18, 1966, Mr. French delivered to me such a letter of resignation. ... I explained to Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>French that it was not correct to address his letter of resignation to me, .... Accordingly, I suggested that he rewrite his formal resignation, ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-4\">\u201cThereupon, Mr. French requested that I have the letter typed for his signature, and in doing so, I had included a statement to the effect that his services would no longer be needed because of the return of a permanent teacher who had been on a leave of absence. This reference was made for the sole purpose of protecting Mr. French\u2019s record of employment; it was not inserted as a condition of his resignation, nor as the reason for same. \u2019'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">The uncontradicted affidavit of Dr. Artuso, among other things, avers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-6\">\u201cOn the evening of May 9, 1966, the Board of Education accepted the letter of resignation submitted by Ralph French. At that time Ralph French\u2019s intention to revoke said letter of resignation had not been communicated to the Board of Education or to myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-7\">\u201cThe following day I received Mr. French\u2019s attempt at revocation when same was delivered to me by my secretary, Velma Shay, along with the mail received on May 10, 1966.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">The court made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-9\">\u201cThat Frank Taylor is Director of Special Services at Respondent School District. That on February 17, 1966, said Frank Taylor informed Petitioner that since he did not meet the standards of Respondent School District, the District intended to take the necessary steps to effect Petitioner\u2019s dismissal. That said Frank Taylor indicated at this time that no such dismissal action would be taken by Respondent School District if Petitioner were to resign his position with the District.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-10\">\u201cThat in reasonable reliance on the Petitioner\u2019s letter of resignation, Respondent School District did forbear taking the necessary action for dismissal within the time specified by law; that Petitioner in submitting his resignation intended Respondents to forbear dismissal action; that said time expired on May 15,1966.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-11\">\u201cThat the Board of Education of Respondent School District met on the evening of May 9, 1966, and at that meeting formally accepted Petitioner\u2019s letter of resignation; that at the time of said acceptance, no member of Respondent Board had been informed of Petitioner\u2019s intent to revoke the aforementioned letter of resignation, nor had the Superintendent of Respondent School District been so informed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>\u201cThat Petitioner was present at the meeting of the Respondent Board of Education on May 9, 1966, when the Board formally accepted his letter of resignation. That Petitioner did not indicate to the Board at that time his intent to revoke said letter of resignation, nor did he call to the Board\u2019s attention the letter he had left with Velma Shat that afternoon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-5\">\u201cThat petitioner\u2019s attempt to revoke his resignation was not timely communicated to the respondent Board, and accordingly was invalid as a revocation. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Although we find nothing affirmative in the respondent\u2019s affidavits showing that appellant was present at the Board meeting, his opening brief apparently admits that he was present. He argues, however, that \u201c. . . . oral statements to the Board, . . . would be moot evidence, since the Board operates on a previously-prepared written agenda which calls for oral communications as the very last item to be taken up at its meetings and, therefore, appellant could not have been heard, even if he had so attempted.\u201d It is undoubtedly true that appellant could not have been heard on the facts underlying his resignation. It is difficult to understand, however, since the matter of resignation was on the agenda, why he would not have been heard as to whether he had in fact resigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">In our opinion, the evidence establishes that the resignation was not withdrawn before it was acted upon and in addition sustains the finding of estoppel. <em>(Drennen </em>v. <em>Star Paving Co., supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">Herndon, J., and Fleming, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied October 14, 1968, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied November 20,1968.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
