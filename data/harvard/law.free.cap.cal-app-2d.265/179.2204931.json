A request for reconsideration having been denied, licensees filed petition for writ of mandate in the superior court. Prom the bench Judge Nutter orally indicated he was ruling in favor of licensees but later held in favor of the board, filed his findings and entered judgment denying the peremptory writ <em>\u25a0 </em>subsequently he granted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>motion for new trial. At the conclusion of the second trial, Judge Tante granted the petition but later, on his own motion, placed the matter on calendar and after further hearing reversed his decision, vacated the previous order, denied the petition and discharged the alternative writ. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law were filed and judgment was entered denying the peremptory writ of mandate. From this judgment all licensees appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">On the evidence contained in the administrative record the superior court held that the \u201cweight of the evidence\u201d supports the findings of the board that Arenstein, president of, and while on duty as a pharamcist at North Palos Drug Corporation, a retail pharmacy, and Mrs. Ursem, an employee of, and while on duty as a pharmacist at said corporation refilled prescriptions (Nos. 39213 and 39023) for Dexedrine and Equanil for Chaffee and Leland on June 4,1963, and July 12, 1963, respectively, without authorization of the prescribing doctor, and that Dexedrine and Bquanil are dangerous drugs; and found \u201cas facts the matters related in the Board\u2019s findings of fact.\u201d  The superior court having undertaken an independent review of the evidence, our function on appellate review is solely to decide whether credible, competent evidence supports that court's judgment. <em>(Yakov </em>v. <em>Board of Medical </em>Examiners, 68 Cal.2d 67, 70 [64 Cal.Rptr. 785, 435 P.2d 553].)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Certified copy of federal information, pleas of guilty and other proceedings in the United States District Court (Exh. 2) establish that previously Arenstein had pleaded guilty to count I of an information alleging that prior to June 4, 1963, Dexedrine tablets, a drug within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. 353(b) (1) (B),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were shipped in interstate commerce into California in a bottle labeled \u201cCaution\u2014Federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription\u201d; that on June 4, 1963, while the tablets were being held for sale at the premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>of North Palos Drug Corporation, said corporation and Arenstein, its president, dispensed said Dexedrine tablets to William M. Chaffee, upon his request for refill of a prescription (No. 39213) without obtaining authorization of the preseriber, in a vial displaying the label</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u201cNorth Palos Drug Core.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">26636 So.

Leland without obtaining authorization of the preseriber. Ursem and Arenstein each was placed on probation for four years and the corporation was fined $900. The hearing officer took official notice of Dexedrine and Equanil as dangerous drugs within the meaning of section 4211, Business and Professions Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">In their testimony before the hearing officer Arenstein and Ursem repudiated their pleas of guilty testifying they were innocent of the criminal charges, did not consider themselves guilty and had never refilled a prescription for a dangerous' drug without authorization of the prescribing doctor. Arenstein further testified that he refilled the prescription for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Chaffee but only after calling Dr. Delaplaine for authority; Mrs. Ursem claimed she refilled the prescription for Leland but only after calling Dr. Groveman\u2019s office and obtaining authorization therefor. None of the following was called as a witness\u2014Dr. Delaplaine, Dr. Groveman, William M. Chaffee or John S. Leland. As to why they pleaded guilty each said he did so on the advice of counsel as a result of which other counts against them in the information were dismissed. However, Exhibit 2 establishes that before their pleas of guilty were accepted by the United States District Court, Arenstein and Ursem each filed therein Petition To Enter Plea Of Guilty (Fed. Rules Crim. Proc., rules 10 and 11) wherein each separately declared and represented to the court that he had read the accusations, discussed them with his counsel and understood the same, that he told the facts and circumstances concerning the matters in the information to his counsel who advised him as to the nature of the accusations against him, any possible defenses he might have thereto and the punishment therefor provided by law, that he understood the proceedings against him, and that he \" know [s] the court will not accept a plea of \u2018Guilty\u2019 from any one who claims to be innocent, with that in mind and because I make no claim of innocence, I wish to plead \u2018Guilty\u2019.\u201d Appellants\u2019 attorney also filed for each, Certificate of Counsel declaring that the pleas of guilty were voluntarily and understandingly made by them and recommending to the court that they be accepted and entered on behalf of his clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Appellants raise the following issues\u2014the ruling of Judge Nutter that the motion for new trial was granted \u201con the grounds of insufficiency of the evidence and judgment as against the law\u201d was binding on Judge Tante in the second trial; twice Judge Nutter and once Judge Tante found the evidence to be insufficient to support the board\u2019s decision, thus, the latter erred in denying the writ; their pleas of guilty in the federal court were not admissions of violations of section 4229, Business and Professions Code, but even so, they should have been given no weight; there is no evidence of a corporate violation; there is no evidence that Dexedrine and Equanil are dangerous drugs within the meaning of section 4211, Business and Professions Code; and section 4211 is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\" That the trial court in this case was \u2018authorized by law to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence\u2019 is well established. [Citations.] . . . \u2018Thus, the ultimate power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>of decision rests with the trial court.' \u201d <em>(Moran </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, </em>32 Cal.2d 301, 308 [196 P.2d 20]; <em>Yakov </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, </em>68 Cal.2d 67, 71 [64 Cal.Rptr. 785, 435 P.2d 553].) As to appellate review, the court in <em>Yakov </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, </em>68 Cal.2d 67, said at page 72 [64 Cal.Rptr. 785, 435 P.2d 553] : \u201cAs we stated in <em>Moran, supra, </em>32 Cal.2d 301, 308, quoting from <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co. </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 427, 429 [45 P.2d 183] : \u2018 \u201c \u2018In reviewing the evidence ... all conflicts must be resolved in favor of the respondent, and all legitimate and reasonable inferences indulged in to uphold the verdict if possible. . . . When two or more inferences can be reasonably deduced from the facts, the reviewing court is without power to substitute its deductions for those of the trial court.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u2018The rule quoted is as applicable in reviewing the findings of a judge as it is when considering a jury's verdict.\u2019 <em>(Estate of Bristol </em>(1943) 23 Cal.2d 221, 223 [143 P.2d 689] ; <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, supra, </em>32 Cal.2d 301, 308.) \u201d Thus, pursuant to <em>Moran </em>and <em>Yakov </em>the question before this court turns upon whether the evidence reveals substantial support, contradicted or uncontradicted, for the trial court\u2019s decision that the weight of the evidence shows appellants violated section 4229, Business and Professions Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The ruling of Judge Nutter granting the motion for new trial on specified \u201cgrounds of insufficiency of the evidence and judgment as against the law\u201d (see \u00a7 657, subd. 6, Code Civ. Proc.) was not binding on Judge Tante and did not preclude a subsequent retrial and re-examination of all issues of fact, even though no additional evidence was offered.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The motion was granted for the sole purpose of according appellants a new trial which consists of \u201ca re-examination of [all] issues[s] of fact in the same court. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 656, Code Civ. Proc.) ; and a re-examination of all issues contemplates an independent determination of the cause. However, the record shows that the motion was granted by Judge Nutter primarily because of his doubt that he had properly decided the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>issue whether the hearing officer could take official notice of the dangerous character of the drugs referred to by their trade names, and it follows that if he could not, the evidence would not support the board\u2019s finding that Dexedrine and Equanil are dangerous drugs. Too, this was the basis of Judge Tante\u2019s initial ruling granting the peremptory -writ\u2014\u201cprimarily on the fact that the administrative agency did not have the power to take official notice of the fact that\u201d Dexedrine and/or Equanil were dangerous drugs. Later he concluded he was in error and reversed the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">To demonstrate that there was \u201cno reasonable certainty in the minds of either of the superior court judges that the appellants were guilty of anything,\u201d appellants rely on remarks made by both judges wherein they indulged in \u201cthinking aloud\u201d their tentative conclusions and reasons therefore.  \u201cFortunately for the stability of judgments the findings of the court are those expressed in writing. What the judge said may be useful to explain the findings but it cannot overcome them, and if contradictory, must be disregarded.\u201d <em>Whitlow </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, </em>248 Cal.App.2d 478, 487 [56 Cal.Rptr. 525].)  No significance may be attached to Judge Nutter\u2019s remarks as having any bearing on the final action taken by Judge Tante which is the decision on review before this court; and the latter\u2019s indecisiveness cannot invalidate his ultimate written Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Judgment.  The law \u2022is settled that an appellate court reviews the action taken by the trial judge, not his judicial reasoning or comment. <em>(Kramer </em>v. <em>State Board of Accountancy, </em>200 Cal.App.2d 163, 177 [19 Cal.Rptr.226].)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Appellants claim that \u201cit is obvious that Judge Tante did not fully reweigh the evidence\u201d because he commented that \u201c \u2018the court did not have an opportunity to see the witnesses [as did the Hearing Officer] . . .\u2019 \u201d is supported by neither the record nor the law. The comment was made at the <em>first </em>hearing when Judge Tante <em>granted, </em>appellants\u2019 petition; moreover in context it can only be interpreted as according with the rule that although the superior court reviews the administrative record to see where the weight of the evidence lies, the credibility of witnesses is for the determination of the board. <em>(Kendall </em>v. <em>Board of Osteopathic Examiners, </em>105 Cal.App.2d 239, 245 [233 P.2d 107].) The totality of Judge Tante\u2019s remarlts, the findings of fact, and the recitals in Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the Judgment completely negative the assertion that he did not fully weigh the evidence. <em>(Kramer </em>v. <em>State Board of Accountancy, </em>200 Cal.App.2d 163, 176 [19 Cal.Rptr. 226].) It was the superior court\u2019s duty to undertake an independent review of the evidence and it is clear from the record before us that Judge Tante did just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">As part of their claim that \u201cthe decision of the court below is not supported by the evidence,\u201d appellants contend that their pleas of guilty to violations of 21 U.S.C. 331 (k) in the federal court do not constitute admissions that they refilled prescriptions for dangerous drugs without authority of the prescribers in violation of section 4229, Business and Professions Code. Referring to count I<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to which Arenstein pleaded guilty (the same applies to count VIII to which Ursem pleaded guilty) an analysis of the offense charged therein and a comparison of the elements of that offense with the allegations of the administrative accusation (III, IV) and the provisions of section 4229 convince us of the error of appellants\u2019 position. It is clear from the federal information and the applicable federal statutes that Arenstein\u2019s act of dispensing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Dexedrine, in a vial labeled as described, to <em>Chaffee </em>upon Ms request for refill of a prescription without authority from the preseriber was the means by which he committed the violation of 21 U.S.C. 331 (k), thus an element of the offense; that when he pleaded guilty to the offense charged in count I he admitted committing the specific act alleged therein contrary to the provisions of 21 U.S.C. 353(b) (1) <em>; </em>and that the specific act by which he committed the federal violation of misbranding as alleged in count I contains all of the elements of a violation of section 4229, Business and Professions Code,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as charged in the administrative accusation. Thus, Arenstein and Ursem each by his plea of guilty admitted refilling the same prescription for the same person on the same date for the same drug without authorization from the preseriber as charged in paragraphs III and IY of the administrative accusation.  A voluntary plea of guilty is the equivalent of a conviction of the crime <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>52 Cal.2d 636, 651 [343 P.2d 577]) ; all allegations of the offense are admitted by a defendant when he enters Ms plea. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>137 Cal.App. 385, 387 [30 P.2d 1026].) A plea of guilty in a criminal prosecution is \u201ca conclusive admission of [his] guilt and of every element entering into <em>the offense </em>charged\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Whitton, </em>112 Cal.App.2d 328, 333 [246 P.2d 60]) and \u201cconstitutes no less than a confession of every factor comprising the charge contained in the pleading.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>118 Cal.App.2d 604, 608 [258 P.2d 86].) According to <em>Berg </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1949) 176 F.2d 122, a plea of guilty means guilty \u201cas charged\u201d in the information, and by it \u201call averments of fact are admitted. . . . The effect is the same as if the defendant had been tried before a jury and had been found guilty upon evidence covering all material facts.\u201d (P. 125.)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Appellants\u2019 second argument is that the pleas of guilty were not conclusive and should not be given great weight, professional licenses should not be disciplined solely on the uncorroborated admission of the accused and the pleas may be explained away.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Without question the pleas of guilty (Exh. 2) were competent evidence.  \u201cA plea of guilty in a criminal prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>eution is admissible in a civil action growing out of the same offense as an admission of a party against interest. <em>(Teitelbaum Furs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dominion Ins. Co., Ltd., </em>58 Cal.2d 601, 605 [25 Cal.Rptr. 559, 375 P.2d 439]; <em>Vaughn </em>v. <em>Jonas, </em>31 Cal.2d 586, 595 [191 P.2d 432]; <em>American Fire etc. Service </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>171 Cal.App.2d 397, 402 [340 P.2d 644]; <em>Burbank </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>135 Cal.App. 482, 485-486 [27 P.2d 400].) \u201d <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>219 Cal.App.2d 445, 452 [33 Cal.Rptr. 339]); and admissible \u201cas the deliberate declaration or admission against interest that the fact is so; in other words, a solemn confession of the very matter charged in the civil action.\u2019\u2019 <em>(Langensand </em>v. <em>Obert, </em>129 Cal.App. 214, 218 [18 P.2d 725].)  The rule in <em>Teitelbaum Furs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dominion Ins. Co., Ltd., </em>58 Cal.2d 601 [25 Cal.Rptr. 559, 375 P.2d 439], and <em>Odian </em>v. <em>Habernicht, </em>133 Cal.App.2d 201 [283 P.2d 756], permits a party in a subsequent civil action to contest the truth of the matters admitted by his plea of guilty, present all facts surrounding the same including the nature of the charge and the plea, and explain why he entered such plea. This is exactly what Arenstein and Ursem did. While the credibility of witnesses may have been for the hearing officer, it was the duty of the superior court to independently review the evidence. Thus, the weight and significance of the fact of appellants\u2019 pleas of guilty, as in other cases, were for the court below. <em>(Vaughn </em>v. <em>Jonas, </em>31 Cal.2d 586, 597 [191 P.2d 432] ; <em>Odian </em>v. <em>Habernicht, </em>133 Cal.App.2d 201, 204 [283 P.2d 756].)In addition to the testimony of Arenstein and Ursem, the administrative record contains their pleas of guilty, their written representations (Petitions) to the federal court for its acceptance of their pleas and those (Certificates) of their counsel, the federal information and whatever reasonable inferences can be drawn from the absence of testimony of the doctors. The superior court determined that the weight of the evidence lies in support of the board\u2019s decision and findings that licensees did refill prescriptions for dangerous drugs without authorization from the preseribers; and found \u201cas facts the matters related in the Board\u2019s finding of fact.\u2019\u2019 Following <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, </em>32 Cal.2d 301, 308 [196 P.2d 20], and <em>Yakov </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, </em>68 Cal.2d 67, 75 [64 Cal.Rptr. 785, 435 P.2d 553], it is our view that the record supports the superior court\u2019s decision. (See also <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>108 Cal.App.2d 705, 711 [239 P.2d 688].)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Referring to the absence of a specific finding that the corporation- had refilled any prescription in violation of section 4229, Business and Professions Code, and arguing that there is no evidence that it violated the statute, appellant corporation claims that the court erred in concluding that \u201cThe Board properly disciplined the holder of the pharmacy permit, North Palos Drug Corp., upon evidence of the illegal acts of its officers and employees, Arenstein and Ursem, as the holder of a pharmacy permit is legally responsible to the Board for the illegal acts of its officers and employees done in the course of the licensed business.\u201d (Ill)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The corporation was charged, with Arenstein (Par. Ill) and with Ursem (Par. IV), with being \u201csubject to disciplinary action\u201d for violations of the state pharmacy law because of the acts of Arenstein and Ursem \u201cwhile [each was] on duty as a pharmacist at\u201d the corporation. Arenstein testified he was president of and a pharmacist for the corporation and owned 49 percent of the common stock, and Ursem that she was a pharmacist and an employee of the corporation; both admitted they refilled the prescriptions in question for the corporation. The evidence clearly establishes that Arenstein and Ursem committed the illegal acts charged in the course of the business of the permittee. In addition, Exhibit 2 shows that the federal information specifically named the- corporation as a defendant with Arenstein, its president (count I) and with Ursem, a pharmacist for said corporation (count VIII) to which charges the individuals pleaded guilty; Arenstein admitted that in addition to probation granted to him and Ursem, the corporation was fined $900 by the federal court. Inasmuch as there was no trial in the federal court and the other counts were dismissed both the board and the superior court could reasonably infer that the fine was based on a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">If a licensee elects to operate his business through employees he must be responsible to the licensing authority for their conduct in the exercise of his license and he is responsible for the acts of his agents or employees done in the course of his business in the operation of the license. <em>(Cornell </em>v. <em>Reilly, </em>127 Cal.App.2d 178, 186-187 [273 P.2d 572].)  One permitted to maintain and conduct a pharmacy may be disciplined by the pharmacy board for the unlawful acts of his employees while engaged in the conduct and operation of the pharmacy, although the permittee does not author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ize the unlawful acts and did not have actual knowledge of the activities. <em>(Randle </em>v. <em>California State Board of Pharmacy, </em>240 Cal.App.2d 254, 261 [49 Cal.Rptr. 485].)</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">This would be particularly true of a corporate permit-tee which could act only through its officers, agents or employees. That North Palos Drug Corporation is guilty of the misconduct alleged is implicit in the findings of both the board and the superior court that each licensee committed his illegal act \u201cwhile on duty as a pharmacist\u201d at the corporation; and the court correctly concluded that the board properly disciplined the holder of the pharmacy permit, North Palos Drug Corporation, upon the evidence of the illegal acts of its officers and employees, Arenstein and Ursem.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Likewise without substance is the contention that there is no evidence that Dexedrine and Equanil are dangerous drugs within the meaning of section 4211, Business and Professions Code.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Exhibit 2 shows that Arenstein and Ursem pleaded guilty to counts I and VIII (federal information) which referred to the drugs by their trade names of Dexedrine and Equanil and alleged that both were shipped into this state in a bottle labeled \" Caution\u2014Federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription\u201d and that both were dispensed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>by appellants upon request for refill of a prescription without authority of the prescriber in a vial not containing the legend; and that Dexedrine is a drug within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. 353 (b) (1) (B) and Equanil is a drug within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. 353 (b) (1) (C). A reading of the information and the relevant federal statutes indicates that the drugs were considered not to be safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner. (See also \u00a7 4211, subd. (k), Bus. &amp; Prof. Code.) In addition, counsel for the board requested the hearing officer sitting for the board to, and he did, take official notice under section 11515, Government Code,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that Dexedrine and Equanil are dangerous drugs within the meaning of section 4211, Business and Professions Code. Appellants interposed no objection to this procedure, offered nothing by way of evidence or by oral or written presentation of authority to rebut the matters officially noticed by the hearing officer, as permitted by the statute, and made no assertion that Dexedrine or Equanil are not dangerous drugs within the meaning of the statute; thus, the board properly found them to be dangerous drugs. <em>(Savelli </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, </em>229 Cal.App.2d 124, 139-140 [40 Cal.Rptr. 171].) The superior court did not take \u201cofficial notice\u201d of anything; to the contrary, its finding was based on its review of the evidence adduced on the administrative level part of which resulted from official notice taken by the hearing officer. Further, the superior court properly concluded that \u201cThe procedure followed by the hearing officer in taking official notice of the character of Dexedrine and Equanil as dangerous drugs was authorized by Government Code section 11515.\u201d This section provides a shorthand method of proving facts about which there is not dispute. Further, it can hardly be questioned that the ingredients of a drug referred to by trade name, and whether they constitute it a dangerous drug within the meaning of section 4211, are scientific matters within the special field of the State Board of Pharmacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Finally, in a brief argument without citation of supporting authority, appellants argue that section 4211, subdivision (k) is unconstitutional because, read with section 4229, a private person is permitted to define a crime for it is the manufacturer who decides which drug shall bear the legend. Section 4211 provides that dangerous drugs include: \u201c (k) Any drug which bears the legend: ' Caution: federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription.' \u201d A similar contention was raised in <em>Wilke &amp; Holzheiser, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, </em>65 Cal.2d 349, 369 [55 Cal.Rptr. 23, 420 P.2d 735], and rejected as being without merit.
