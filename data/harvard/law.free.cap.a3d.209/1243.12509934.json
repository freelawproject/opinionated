We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The self-represented defendants, Chaim Schwartz and Rena Gelb,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeal from the judgment of the trial court rendered in favor of the plaintiff, Stamford Hospital. On appeal, the defendants have raised twenty-three claims challenging the underlying factual findings of the attorney trial referee (referee)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the legal conclusions of the trial court. In response, the plaintiff argues that there are only two issues relevant to the appeal: were the defendants indebted to the plaintiff and did they exhibit bad faith in defense of the action. We\n   agree with the plaintiff that the judgment should be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts, as found by the referee, the court's legal conclusions, and the procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the defendants' appeal. The plaintiff commenced the present action against the defendants on January 21, 2015. In count one of its two count complaint, the plaintiff alleged that, at the request of the defendants, it provided medical services to their minor child from March 5 to March 6, 2013. The child resided in the defendants' home, and, therefore, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-37 (b),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the defendants are liable for the cost of the medical services rendered by the plaintiff. The plaintiff billed the defendants for\n   the services it provided to the child, the reasonable value of which was $ 14,051.99. Despite having made demand on the defendants for payment, a balance of $ 8076.25 remained due and owing, which the defendants have refused to pay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In count two, the plaintiff realleged the allegations of count one and that Gelb had signed a patient authorization and agreement (authorization) in which she agreed to pay the plaintiff for the services it rendered to the child plus the costs of collection, including attorney's fees. Despite having made demand on Gelb, she refused to pay the balance of $ 8076.25. In its prayer for relief, the plaintiff sought money damages, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, and statutory prejudgment and postjudgment interest. On May 12, 2015, the defendants filed amended answers denying the material allegations of the complaint, including that the defendants were the child's parents, and each pleaded fourteen identical special defenses, including accord and satisfaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties tried the case to the referee pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-549\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Practice Book \u00a7 23-53.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The referee issued a memorandum of decision on October 5, 2016, in which he found the following facts. On March 5, 2014, Gelb took the child to the hospital with\n   symptoms of a stomach virus and because the child had had a seizure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The child was admitted overnight during which time a series of tests were performed that resulted in costs of which $ 8076.25 remained due. The defendants contend that they are not responsible for the outstanding medical costs on the basis of theories such as accord and satisfaction, lack of notice, lack of need for the services rendered, fair and reasonable\n   value of the services rendered, lack of disclosure of the risks and costs, and the parental liability for the costs of care for a minor child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The referee found the testimony of the plaintiff's witnesses to be overwhelming with detail regarding the services rendered and their cost, including the medical and insurance review of the costs assessed to the defendants. According to Letitia Borras, a pediatrician, the medical treatment provided was necessary and performed as a standard course of action given the symptoms with which the child presented. The procedures were reviewed with Gelb, who did not object to them. According to Cecelia Rasines, the plaintiff's billing rates are audited and determined by the defendants' insurer and are compared with rates charged for similar treatment by other medical institutions. Nurse auditors audited the defendants' bill by comparing the billing rates and services rendered to the medical records and found the billing statement was accurate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendants both testified. When counsel for the plaintiff questioned Gelb about her responsibility to pay for the services rendered to her child, Gelb responded that she was not certain that she was the child's biological mother because, although she had given birth, she was not with the child constantly throughout her maternity stay. She, therefore, could not confirm that the child she took home was, in fact, the child to whom she had given birth. Thereafter, the referee questioned Gelb whether her prior testimony regarding her uncertainty as to whether she was the child's biological mother was truthful. The referee found that \"Gelb admitted lying on the witness stand and committing perjury, stating that the minor child is in fact her biological child and that she only testified of her uncertainty as a method of assisting both of the defendants against the plaintiff's claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As to the child's medical care, Gelb testified that she had not consented to certain procedures before they were performed, but she admitted that the child's pediatrician explained the procedures to her, including the need for a computerized axial tomography scan given the child's seizures. Gelb agreed to the plan and signed an authorization for the medical procedures and agreed to be responsible for costs not paid by insurance. Gelb claimed that she signed the authorization while she was under duress in the plaintiff's emergency department. The plaintiff placed into evidence documents Gelb had signed for the services rendered to the child in the present matter and for the maternity services the plaintiff had provided to her when her children were born. Gelb admitted to having signed each of the documents that evidenced her acceptance of responsibility for the child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following some initial equivocation, Schwartz too admitted that he is the child's biological father and that he had no reason to believe that the child is not his. He recognized his responsibility to pay for the costs associated with the medical services provided to the child. Schwartz personally had applied for the insurance plan that was used to pay the plaintiff. He admitted that he was responsible for paying the insurance deductible and that he was aware of the amount of the deductible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendants did not pay for the medical services rendered to the child because they claimed the services were not necessary. They sent a letter to the plaintiff disputing its bill and to the state Department of Public Health (department). Schwartz received a telephone call from someone at the department advising him that the department had performed a full investigation and \" 'everything was found to be [okay].' \" According to Schwartz, the present case was not the first billing dispute in which he has been involved. In other instances in which he did not pay, the matter remained in collection for a period of time, and then the business \"simply [wrote] it off.\" He did not think that the present matter would result in litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   With respect to their special defense of accord and satisfaction, the defendants put three documents into evidence. The documents demonstrate that they had paid $ 112.48 toward the outstanding balance they owed the plaintiff. They sent the plaintiff a correspondence\n   with the payment, stating that the amount was in full satisfaction of the outstanding balance. The defendants argued that by accepting the payment, the plaintiff forgave the remaining balance due under the law of accord and satisfaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The referee set out the relevant provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-311 titled \"Accord and satisfaction by use of instrument\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and analyzed the evidence. The plaintiff's billing statement indicated that payments were to be mailed to P.O. Box 120048, Stamford, and that correspondence regarding financial options was to be mailed to P.O. Box 9317, Stamford. The defendants mailed both their payment and correspondence regarding accord and satisfaction to the payment address at P.O. Box 120048. Rasines explained that payments mailed to P.O. Box 120048 do not go to the plaintiff, but, instead, go to a lock box at a Wells Fargo bank. None of the plaintiff's personnel, therefore, would have seen the payment or the defendants' correspondence. Furthermore, on May 12, 2015,\n   more than ninety days after they had filed their original answers and special defenses, the defendants amended their answers and added special defenses of accord and satisfaction. According to Schwartz, the defendants purposely waited more than ninety days before amending their answers to include the accord and satisfaction special defenses, presumably to avoid giving the plaintiff notice\n   of the defense and an opportunity to conform to \u00a7 42a-3-311 (c) (2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On the basis of his factual findings, the referee concluded that the plaintiff had established that there was no legitimate basis for the defendants to fail to pay the plaintiff the balance of the moneys owed for the services rendered to the child. The referee recognized that the trier of fact may accept or deny all or part of any testimony from a witness. He found that Gelb's perjured testimony and her subsequent admission of the same, degraded her testimony. The referee was \"strained to accept any testimony provided by either defendant as truthful,\" as both of the defendants admitted to lies and deceitful actions under the guise of trial strategy or their lack of knowledge of trial procedure. As to the defendants' claim regarding the legitimacy and necessity of the medical services rendered to the child, the referee found that the defendants had failed to produce any admissible evidence that contradicted the plaintiff's evidence. The referee, therefore, found the defendants' defenses to be disingenuous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to the referee, the defendants also failed to establish the requirements of accord and satisfaction under \u00a7 42a-3-311. The ninety day requirement of \u00a7 42a-3-311 (c) (2) passed only by virtue of the defendants' purposefully deceitful tactics during the pleading stage of the litigation, and the defendants were perhaps calculated when they made the payment itself. The plaintiff's billing statement set forth two distinct addresses to be used for payments and communications. Because the defendants failed to send their communication to the\n   proper address, the plaintiff never received the alleged accord and satisfaction notice. The referee found that the plaintiff had established that, under \u00a7 46b-37 (b), no legitimate basis existed for the defendants' failure to pay the moneys they owed the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The referee considered the plaintiff's request for statutory prejudgment and postjudgment interest. General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a (b) provides: \"In the case of debt arising out of services provided at a hospital, prejudgment and postjudgment interest shall be no more than five percent per year. The awarding of interest in such cases is discretionary.\" The plaintiff provided the defendants with a billing statement dated June 19, 2014, in the amount of $ 8076.25, and the defendants paid only $ 112.48 of that amount. A net balance of $ 7963.77 remains due and owing the plaintiff. Pursuant to \u00a7 37-3a (b), the balance of $ 7963.77 is subject to statutory prejudgment and postjudgment interest from June 19, 2014, until the balance is paid in full at a rate of 5 percent per year. The referee reserved the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees and costs to be heard by the trial court after a judgment was rendered on the substantive issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The defendants filed an objection to the referee's memorandum of decision, to\n   which the plaintiff responded. The trial court held a hearing on the defendants' objection on January 4, 2017, and issued a memorandum of decision on January 19, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court first addressed the defendants' challenge to the referee's jurisdiction. The defendants argued that when they incurred the debt, it was indefinite as to amount because neither defendant knew the cost of the plaintiff's services, and, therefore, the referee lacked jurisdiction to render a decision. The plaintiff countered that neither \u00a7 52-549n nor Practice Book \u00a7 23-58 requires a definite amount be included within the\n   agreement between the parties; all that is necessary is that the complaint seek a definite sum on the basis of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court explained that referees have jurisdiction over claims for unpaid hospital services. Section 52-549n confers jurisdiction to referees to act in a contract action when the Superior Court refers the matter to the referee pursuant to certain statutory criteria. A claim may be referred to a referee if the claim is predicated on a sum of money that is \"capable of reduction to certainty.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Housing Authority\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Melvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1970935\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/12/711/#p715\">\n    12 Conn.

The court reviewed the record and found that the referee's numerous findings of fact were amply supported by the evidence and were not clearly erroneous, and that the principles of law that the referee applied to those facts were legally and logically correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As to credibility, the court noted the referee's findings with respect to the testimony of the witnesses and that the referee was strained to accept any testimony from the defendants as truthful. The court recognized that a finder of fact is the sole arbiter of the credibility of witnesses and the weight to afford their testimony. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Cadle Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    D'Addario\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8457767\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/268/441/#p462\">\n    268 Conn. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 462,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=844%20A.2d%20836\">\n    844 A.2d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court observed the defendants' exceptional acumen in researching the law and fashioning legal arguments, but found that they had \"overlooked\" Connecticut's presumption of legitimacy rule, which provides\n   that a child born in wedlock is presumed to be the issue of the mother and her husband. See\n   <em>\n    Weidenbacher\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Duclos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"770571\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/234/51/#p63\">\n    234 Conn. 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 63,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=661%20A.2d%20988\">\n    661 A.2d 988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). Through their testimony, the defendants impermissibly had attempted to shift the burden of proof of the child's parentage to the plaintiff. The court, therefore, concluded that the referee had ample grounds to disbelieve the defendants' testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Turning to the defendants' special defenses of accord and satisfaction, the court concluded that the referee correctly determined that the defendants' tender of a check in the amount of $ 112.48 accompanied by a correspondence stating that it was payment in full satisfaction of the plaintiff's invoice of $ 8076.25 was not an\n   accord and satisfaction for two reasons. First, the defendants intentionally sent the check and correspondence to an address that the plaintiff's billing statement specified was for payment, rather than to an address specified for correspondence. As a result, the plaintiff's personnel never saw the correspondence. Second, the defendants acted deceitfully when, during the pleading stage of the litigation, they waited more than ninety days as specified in \u00a7 42a-3-311 (c) (2) to raise the special defense of accord and satisfaction in their amended answers dated May 11, 2015. See footnote 11 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Given the referee's characterization of the defendants' conduct as deceitful, the court identified additional support for the referee's rejection of the defendants' accord and satisfaction defense. The threshold requirement of \u00a7 42a-3-311 is that the tender of the check must be made in good faith. Uniform Commercial Code comment (4) to the statute states: \"Good faith in subsection (a) (i) is defined as not only honesty in fact, but also the observance of reasonable commercial standards and fair dealing.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) General Statutes Annotated \u00a7 42a-3-311, comment (4) (West 2009).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The amount the defendants tendered, $ 112.48, represents 1.39 percent of the debt they owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The court made the following observations regarding bad faith. In Connecticut bad faith is defined as the\n   absence of good faith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Bad faith in general implies both actual or constructive fraud, or a design to mislead or deceive another, or a neglect or refusal to fulfill some duty or some contractual obligation, and not prompted by an honest mistake as to one's rights or duties, but by some interest or sinister motive.... Bad faith means more than mere negligence, it involves a dishonest purpose.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Habetz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Condon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"549792\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/224/231/#p237\">\n    224 Conn. 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 237,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=618%20A.2d%20501\">\n    618 A.2d 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). \"It is the burden of the party asserting the lack of good faith to establish its existence and whether that burden has been satisfied in a particular case is a question of fact.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Kronberg Bros., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2219079\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/72/53/#p63\">\n    72 Conn.

The rates that the plaintiff may have charged the defendants for the services rendered to their child were, thus, available for public inspection. General Statutes \u00a7 19a-681 (c) imposes a severe penalty on a hospital for deviation from the \"pricemaster.\" The court concluded that, although it is arguable whether the authorization Gelb signed is procedurally unconscionable, the element of unfair surprise was not present because the pricemaster was publicly available. The pricemaster rates are based on a national database, and there are severe consequences for a hospital if it exceeds those rates. The defendants offered no evidence of comparable rates for the same services rendered at other hospitals. The court concluded, therefore, that there was no basis on which to find that the authorization was substantively unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   With respect to Schwartz' special defense that he was not a signatory to the authorization, the court next determined that Schwartz was liable under the authorization pursuant to \u00a7 46b-37, regardless of whether he signed the authorization. Section 46b-37 provides in relevant part: \"(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, it shall be the joint duty of each spouse to support his or her family, and both shall be liable for: (1) The reasonable and necessary services of a physician or dentist; (2) hospital expenses rendered the husband or wife or minor child while residing in the family of his or her parents ....\" Accordingly, the court found that the plaintiff had proved that the defendants had breached the authorization as alleged in count two of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In summary, the court stated that it had addressed the remainder of the defendants' fourteen special defenses implicitly in its foregoing analysis or the defenses were otherwise unmeritorious. It rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $ 7963.77. The court thereafter found that it was fair and equitable to award the plaintiff prejudgment and postjudgment interest at the rate of 5 percent from June 19, 2014, the date the plaintiff provided the defendants with a billing statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   With respect to attorney's fees, the court issued an order permitting the plaintiff to file an itemized affidavit of attorney's fees and the defendants to object, if they wished. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion for a special finding that the denials and defenses pleaded by the defendants were without merit and not brought or asserted in good faith. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-226 (a). It also filed a motion for double costs and reasonable counsel fees pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-245\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a motion for attorney's fees on the basis of\n   the defendants' bad faith. It submitted the affidavit of Vimala B. Ruszkowski, its trial counsel, attesting to attorney's fees of $ 34,082.20 and costs of $ 2059.64. The defendants objected to each of the plaintiff's motions and request for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The court responded to the plaintiff's motion seeking a finding of bad faith, on April 13, 2017, stating that it had found bad faith as a matter of law in its decision regarding the defendants' special defenses of accord and satisfaction, and remanded the case to the referee for a finding of whether any other acts of either or both defendants were made in bad faith and, if so, to identify those acts with particularity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 30, 2017, the referee submitted a supplemental memorandum of decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The referee identified the special defenses asserted by the defendants and found that all of them were pleaded in bad faith. The referee iterated his findings regarding the defendants' credibility, which alone gave rise to an overall finding of bad faith. Nonetheless, the referee found that specific evidence of bad faith regarding the special defenses was more than abundant at trial so as to affirm his overall finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   With respect to special defenses one, three, four, five, seven, nine, ten, and eleven,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   the referee found that prior to the\n   onset of the litigation, the plaintiff took\n   considerable measures to assist the defendants with their concerns regarding the bill, explaining how medical billing is calculated, and describing state oversight and regulations. The defendants were advised that the department had investigated the matter and found the bill to be accurate. The defendants presented no contrary evidence. The referee, therefore, concluded that the special defenses lacked merit and were not pleaded in good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Special defenses two and six alleged, respectively, that the plaintiff's agents rendered one or more unnecessary and/or harmful services to the child for which the defendants should not be billed and that there was no proof that the plaintiff's agents performed the service for which it had billed. The referee found that there was abundant evidence that Gelb met with the child's pediatrician and discussed the treatment being provided. Gelb trusted the child's pediatrician and no physician has ever told Gelb that the care and treatment rendered to the child were unnecessary. Gelb never complained about the treatment prior to receiving the plaintiff's bill. The defendants, therefore, had no good faith basis to plead special defenses two and six, and as such, the referee found that the defenses were pursued in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The referee further found that special defenses twelve, thirteen, and fourteen\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   were raised and pursued without any good faith basis. Both defendants were\n   aware of their financial responsibilities for the child. Gelb identified her signature on the authorization. Schwartz made the arrangements for his family's medical insurance and knew what portion of the bill insurance would pay and what portion he would have to pay. The defendants' testimony was in sharp contrast to the special defenses. The referee, therefore, decided that it was logical to conclude that the defendants had pursued the special defenses in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   According to the referee, there was no basis for the defendants to defend the plaintiff's claims, and they used the judicial system as a means to avoid, or at least to delay, paying their financial obligation. Schwartz audaciously testified that he never expected the plaintiff to pursue the matter in litigation, because he had avoided financial responsibilities in the past by using similar methods. The defendants went so far as to at least raise doubt about their biological relationship to the child in a failed attempt to avoid their financial responsibility. The referee concluded that such evidence made the determination of bad faith effortless and conclusive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The defendants objected to the referee's supplemental memorandum of decision. The plaintiff replied, asking the court to overrule the defendants' objection and to order the defendants to pay attorney's fees. The court ruled on the defendants' objection on September 6, 2017, noting the referee's findings that the defendants had acted in bad faith, that they denied being the child's biological parents, and that they lacked credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In adjudicating the plaintiff's \u00a7 52-226a motion, the court noted its inherent\n   power to regulate the conduct of litigants whether they are members of the bar; see\n   <em>\n    State Bar Assn.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1559922\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/145/222/#p231\">\n    145 Conn. 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 231,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=140%20A.2d%20863\">\n    140 A.2d 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1958), or laypersons.

The first special defense, therefore, was colorable. The defendants, however, failed to prove their defense that the plaintiff's charges were unreasonable. Reasonableness is a question of fact for the trier of fact. The court found that the plaintiff proved the reasonableness of its bill. See\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gorby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1200357\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/237/12/#p23\">\n    237 Conn. 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 23,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=675%20A.2d%20449\">\n    675 A.2d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996) (reasonableness of compensation requested proved by preponderance of evidence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In their second special defenses, the defendants pleaded that the services rendered by the plaintiff were unnecessary and/or harmful. The court concluded that there was no basis for the defendants to have pleaded such a special defense because there were no facts to support it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In their fourth special defenses, the defendants pleaded that the plaintiff provided false or misleading information. The court found no facts to support the pleading or credible evidence to support the defendants' claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The defendants' fifth special defenses alleged that the plaintiff failed to disclose the amount it would charge for the services rendered to the child. Other than the statutory obligation to post its charges pursuant to \u00a7 19a-681 (a) as a \"pricemaster\" where it is available for public inspection at the Office of Health Care Access, the plaintiff was under no statutory or common-law duty to advise the defendants in advance of the amount of its charges. Under the circumstances, the court found that\n   there was no way that nondisclosure of unit prices or a lack of informed consent to the charges had any basis in fact and, therefore, could not have been established.\n   The court found the sixth special defenses, which alleged that the plaintiff had no proof that it performed the services for which it billed to the defendants, to be altogether implausible. Gelb testified that after the services were performed, she discussed the very services with the child's pediatrician, who reassured her that such services were appropriate under the circumstances. The defendants knew full well before the litigation began that the services billed had been rendered. The court concluded that such a defense would have been effective if it were true, but that in the present case it had no basis in fact and was not colorable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The seventh special defenses asserted that the services rendered by the plaintiff could not be identified because the bill was \"not written in plain English.\" The court found no factual support for such a defense, and the defendants presented no evidence of a statutory or regulatory requirement to that effect. Section 19a-681 governs the posting of hospital charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff's billing statement identifies each service performed in language that an ordinary person with no medical training can understand. The court found it inconceivable given the extent of the defendants' formal educations that they were unable to identify the services rendered. The defense, therefore, was frivolous and without color.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The court previously had addressed the special defenses of accord and satisfaction but added that it is a well recognized defense. The defendants' use of it,\n   however, solely as an artifice of avoidance, was deceitful and without color when considered with the defendants' other meritless defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The twelfth special defenses alleged that Gelb had never received a bill for the services the plaintiff rendered to the child. The court found the special defense to be a falsehood. The defendants testified that they not only received the bill but also took affirmative action calculated to avoid paying all but a miniscule amount of the debt. The falsehood was perpetrated for no other purpose than to avoid paying the bill. The defense, therefore, was without color.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   With regard to the defendants' fourteenth special defenses that Schwartz did not sign the authorization and, therefore, could not be held liable, the court concluded that it lacked any indicia of color. In view of the defendants' extraordinarily thorough research, the court found it incredible that they missed the most basic principle governing a parent's financial responsibility for a child. Section 46b-37 (2) imposes a legal obligation on a parent of a minor child while the child is residing in the family of its parents. See\n   <em>\n    Yale Diagnostic Radiology\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Fountain\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2630200\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/267/351/#p359\">\n    267 Conn. at 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=838%20A.2d%20179\">\n    838 A.2d 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, it is immaterial to Schwartz' liability whether he signed the authorization. Gelb testified that she recognized her responsibility to pay for the medical services rendered to the child because she is the child's parent. This defense becomes disingenuous when Schwartz asserts that he has no concomitant responsibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Having concluded that the referee's findings as to whether the defendants' special defenses were colorable were amply supported by the evidence, the court moved to the second prong of the test set\n   out in\n   <em>\n    Maris\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McGrath\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458934\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/269/834/\">\n    269 Conn. at 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=850%20A.2d%20133\">\n    850 A.2d 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , i.e., whether the defendants acted in bad faith.\n   \"Bad faith in general implies both actual or constructive fraud, or a design to mislead or deceive another, or a neglect or refusal to fulfill some duty or some contractual obligation, not prompted by an honest mistake as to one's rights or duties, but by some interested or sinister motive....

The definition of bad faith in\n   <em>\n    Maris\n   </em>\n   is somewhat different: \"To determine whether the bad faith exception applies, the court must assess whether there has been substantive bad faith as exhibited by, for example, a party's use of oppressive tactics or its wilful violations or court orders; [t]he appropriate focus for the court ... is the conduct of the party in instigating or maintaining the litigation.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Maris\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McGrath\n   </em>\n   , supra, 269 Conn. at 847,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=850%20A.2d%20133\">\n    850 A.2d 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In cases involving debt collection avoidance, a bankruptcy court looks to the totality of the circumstances and may consider a wide range of factors, including \"the nature of the debt ... the timing of the [bankruptcy] petition; how the debt arose; the debtor's motive in filing the petition; how the debtor's actions affected creditors; the debtor's treatment of creditors both before and after the petition was filed; and whether the debtor has been forthcoming with the bankruptcy court and the creditors.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    In re Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3469734,5867759\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/491/120/\">\n    491 F.3d 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 152 (3d Cir. 2007). The court determined that most of the factors applied to the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The court concluded that, under any definition, the defendants had acted in bad faith. Under the\n   <em>\n    De La Concha of Hartford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Inc.\n   </em>\n   , definition, the defendants' refusal to fulfill their contractual obligation was not prompted by an honest mistake as to their rights or duties. Rather, they carefully contrived a scheme\n   prompted by the dishonest purpose to avoid a financial obligation by lying under oath and asserting defenses that bear no indicia of color. The court agreed with the referee that the \"defendants' prevarications and obfuscation permeated the entire trial and infiltrated their pleadings.\" The court, therefore, specifically found that the special defenses identified in its memorandum of decision were without merit and that they were not prompted by an honest mistake as to either the defendants' rights or duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The court turned to the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees. The defendants argued that the total attorney's fees that may be awarded to the plaintiff could not exceed 15 percent of the judgment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42-150aa (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court disagreed, concluding that the plaintiff's claim was not limited by statute, but was controlled by the common-law rule that the court may award attorney's fees for bad faith. The court reasoned that whenever there is an attorney's fee provision in a consumer party's contract, that provision is subject to \u00a7 42-150aa unless it is coupled with a distinctly different cause of action such as a breach of contract claim. A rule of statutory construction provides\n   that \"[n]o statute is to be construed as altering the common law, farther than its words import [and ... a statute] is not to be construed as making any innovation upon the common law which it does not fairly express.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Luzietti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"763488\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/230/427/#p433\">\n    230 Conn. 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   433,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=646%20A.2d%2085\">\n    646 A.2d 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Rizzo Pool Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Del Grosso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1613224\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/240/58/#p69\">\n    240 Conn. 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 69-72,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=689%20A.2d%201097\">\n    689 A.2d 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997), our Supreme Court construed the\n   scope of General Statutes \u00a7 42-150bb,\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   the sister statute of \u00a7 42-150aa, in determining that the statute did not limit a successful defendant in a consumer contract case to the 15 percent allowed in \u00a7 42-150aa. The court looked to the plain language of the statute and was persuaded that the phrase \" 'the terms governing the size of the fee for the commercial party,' relates to the parties' contract, and not to \u00a7 42-150aa. Had the legislature intended to limit consumer awards of attorney's fees to 15 percent, it would have incorporated the provisions of \u00a7 42-150aa by expressly providing 'as provided in \u00a7 42-150aa.' Moreover, reading \u00a7 42-150bb in context, as we must, it is clear that the phrase, 'the terms governing the size of the fee for the commercial party,' relates to 'the contract or lease' as provided in the immediately preceding sentence in the statute.\" Id., at 74,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=689%20A.2d%201097\">\n    689 A.2d 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The court in the present case, relying on its discussion of\n   <em>\n    Rizzo\n   </em>\n   , stated \"from the language of subsection (b) of \u00a7 42-150aa, it is clear that the fee limitation was intended to apply to a consumer contract, which by our decisional law is imported into that contract, and not to bad faith conduct of a party which is an actionable wrong [that] exists independently of the contract.\" The court, therefore, concluded that it was free to award attorney's fees for bad faith conduct independent of the authorization and that it had a proper basis for extending the award to Schwartz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The plaintiff's counsel filed an affidavit for attorney's fees seeking a total of $ 34,082.20. The affidavit is itemized, identifies each attorney who performed a service,\n   provides the attorney's respective hourly rate, describes the service, and assigns a time factor in hours and minutes, and the corresponding cost. The hourly rate for each attorney ranged from $ 175 to $ 265 per hour, with most entries at $ 185. The defendants objected to the fees on several grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Schwartz disclaimed liability because (1) he was not contractually obligated to pay and (2) there is no statute that requires a spouse to pay another spouse's attorney's fees. The court referred to its prior explanation as to why Schwartz is responsible to pay for the child's medical care pursuant to the authorization signed by Gelb. As to the second reason, the court found it to be an attempt to distinguish Schwartz' statutory liability for the child's medical care from interspousal liability for attorney's fees for which there is no liability in the present context. The court found the argument to be disingenuous, as it purposefully overlooks parental responsibility fixed by statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The defendants also challenged the reasonableness of the attorney's fees requested. The court held an evidentiary hearing\n   to permit the defendants to cross-examine the plaintiff's counsel and to offer evidence of their own that the attorney's fees were unreasonable. The defendants claimed that the attorney's fees exceeded the amount prayed for in the complaint, i.e., $ 15,000. The court explained that the plaintiff's classification of the case in its complaint as seeking less than $ 15,000 is designed for administrative purposes only and does not limit the amount of damages that can be recovered. See\n   <em>\n    Southington '84 Associates\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Silver Dollar Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1200313\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/237/758/#p765\">\n    237 Conn. 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 765,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20A.2d%20968\">\n    678 A.2d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996).

The court acknowledged that disproportionality of legal fees is one of the many factors that a court is required to consider in assessing whether an attorney's fee is reasonable. See Rules of Professional Conduct 1.5. Cases discussing the propriety of awarding disproportionate fees focus on the amount recovered in comparison to the amount claimed for fees. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Simms\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chaisson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5749949\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/277/319/#p332\">\n    277 Conn. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332-34,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=890%20A.2d%20548\">\n    890 A.2d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). In the present case, the plaintiff recovered the entire amount claimed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The court found the 241.6 hours of time the plaintiff's attorneys devoted to the present case to be disproportionate to the amount recovered by any ordinary assessment. Although the trial itself took less than two days, there were 248 entries in the docket, which was greatly disproportionate to the average activity in a similar case. The defendants complained that the plaintiff was represented by two attorneys at trial. The court stated that this was no ordinary collection matter, but one that was overburdened with \"creative\" defenses and objections, as well as excessive pleading, and that the self-represented defendants transformed a relatively straightforward collection case into a \"pitched legal battle.\" See\n   <em>\n    Rana\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Terdjanian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778329\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/136/99/#p117\">\n    136 Conn.

This is the rare case in which the arguments put forth are so preposterous,\n   audacious, and transparent, and the attempt to avoid payment so obvious, that a finding of bad faith is compelled. Above all else, credibility determinations are to be made by the finder of fact who may accept all, some, or none of the testimony of a witness.

The defendants testified that they were uncertain of the child's parentage despite the overwhelming contrary circumstantial evidence. Their behavior in predicating their defense on such a denial is deeply offensive to the norms of civil society. Accordingly, because the record supports the findings of the referee and the court that the defendants acted in bad faith, the court's decision to award attorney's fees is legally and logically correct.
