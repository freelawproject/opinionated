On November 2, 2018, the plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the appeal as frivolous. On February 14, 2019, the plaintiff filed a second motion to dismiss this appeal as moot and the amended appeal as moot and frivolous. That motion followed this court's order of February 4, 2019, in which we raised the question of whether the trial court's order resetting the law days should be summarily reversed as being in contravention of the appellate stay. After considering the parties' written submissions on that question and hearing oral argument on the matter, we conclude that, under binding authority from our Supreme Court, the trial court acted in contravention of the appellate stay when it reset the law days. We, therefore, deny the plaintiff's motion to dismiss the appeal and reverse the court's judgment granting the plaintiff's motion to reset the law days and setting the law days. We agree, however, that the defendant's amended appeal is frivolous and, therefore,\n   grant the plaintiff's motion to dismiss the amended appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following procedural history is relevant to our analysis. In November, 2008, the original plaintiff, Wachovia Mortgage, FSB, filed this action seeking to foreclose a mortgage on real property located at 15 Kenilworth Drive West in Stamford. In February, 2014, the court,\n   <em>\n    Mintz, J.,\n   </em>\n   rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure. The defendant appealed to this court, which dismissed her appeal for lack of diligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court then reentered the judgment of strict foreclosure in February,\n   2015. On appeal, this court affirmed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for the purpose of setting new law days.\n   <em>\n    Wachovia Bank, FSB\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Toczek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489046,12489238,12489047\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/170/904/\">\n    170 Conn.

The plaintiff filed a motion for order to reset the law days in accordance with this court's remand order, which the court,\n   <em>\n    Genuario, J.,\n   </em>\n   granted, setting the first law day for July 24, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 18, 2018, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (d) and (e), the plaintiff filed a motion to terminate the automatic appellate stay in \u00a7 61-11 (a) prospectively for any subsequent appeals filed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which the court granted. On July 10, 2018, the defendant filed a third appeal from the court's resetting the law days. On July 16, 2018, the defendant filed a timely motion for review of the order of the trial court terminating the appellate stay. The plaintiff thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the third appeal as frivolous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 6, 2018, a panel of this court granted the plaintiff's motion to dismiss the third appeal as frivolous and granted the defendant's motion for review but denied the relief requested therein. On Monday, September 17, 2018, the defendant filed timely motions for reconsideration en banc of the September 6, 2018 decisions dismissing the third appeal as frivolous and denying relief from the termination of the appellate stay. On October 31, 2018, this court en banc denied the defendant's motions for reconsideration of the dismissal of the third appeal and the defendant's motion for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 14, 2018, before the period for seeking reconsideration under Practice Book \u00a7 71-5 had expired, the plaintiff filed in the trial court a motion to reset the law days following this court's dismissal of the third appeal as frivolous. The defendant filed an objection, arguing that the trial court could not reset the law days during the pendency of her motions for reconsideration en banc of the dismissal of the third appeal and the prospective termination of the appellate stay. On October 15, 2018, while the defendant's motions for reconsideration en banc were still pending before this court, the trial court granted the plaintiff's motion to reset the law days and set the first law day for December 4, 2018. The defendant filed the present, and fourth, appeal on October 25, 2018, challenging the October 15, 2018 order of the trial court resetting the law days, and, thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the appeal as frivolous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 26, 2018, the defendant filed a motion to open the judgment of strict foreclosure and extend the law days, which the trial court denied. The defendant filed a motion to reargue, which the court denied. The defendant amended her fourth appeal to add the trial court's denial of her motions to open and to reargue. The plaintiff then filed a motion to dismiss the\n   original fourth appeal and the amended appeal as moot and the amended appeal as frivolous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 4, 2019, this court issued the following order: \"[T]he parties are hereby ordered, sua sponte, to file memoranda not to exceed ten pages, on or before February 14, 2019, to give reasons, if any, why the trial court's October 15, 2018\n   order resetting the law days should not be summarily reversed and the matter remanded to the trial court to set new law days, as the trial court's order was in contravention of the appellate stay in effect while the defendant Aleksandra Toczek's September 17, 2018 timely motion to reconsider the motion for review of the termination of stay was pending.

An actual controversy must exist not only at the time the appeal is taken, but also throughout the pendency of the appeal.... When, during the pendency of an appeal, events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of the merits, a case has become moot....

Thus, unless the running of the law day was stayed, title to the property has passed to the plaintiff and the defendant's appeal from the judgment granting the motion to reset the law days is moot. There also is no question that an appellate stay was in effect on October 15, 2018, when the trial court set the new law day of December 4, 2018. Although the trial court granted the plaintiff's motion to terminate the appellate stay, the defendant filed a timely motion for review on July 16, 2018, which continued the appellate stay. See Practice Book \u00a7 61-14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following this court's denial of the relief requested in that motion, the defendant filed, on September 17, 2018, a timely motion for reconsideration en banc of the denial of the relief requested in her motion for review, and, therefore, an appellate stay was in effect when the trial court reset the law days on October 15, 2018. See Practice Book \u00a7 71-6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This court\n   denied the motion for reconsideration en banc on October 31, 2018, and notice issued that same day. The stay remained in effect for twenty days, until November 20, 2018. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 63-2 and 71-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The question, therefore, is whether the trial court's order resetting the law days violated the appellate stay. On the basis of our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    RAL Management, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Valley View Associates\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3666818\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/278/672/#p682\">\n    278 Conn. at 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=899%20A.2d%20586\">\n    899 A.2d 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we conclude that it did. In\n   <em>\n    RAL Management, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the court addressed whether the opening of a judgment of strict foreclosure to reset the law days violated the appellate stay that was in effect. In particular, the court stated that the threshold issue in the case was \"whether the trial court properly opened the judgment while the appellate stay was in effect merely to change the law days\" and concluded \"that such an action was improper ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=899%20A.2d%20586\">\n    Id., at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=899%20A.2d%20586\">\n    899 A.2d 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court reasoned that \"the law days are ineffective pending the stay because to treat them otherwise would carry out the judgment in violation of the stay. It necessarily follows, therefore, that if the law days have no legal effect and necessarily will lapse pending the appeal ... any change to those dates pending the appeal similarly\n   has no effect. Indeed, the rules of practice anticipate such a circumstance by providing specific authority for the trial court to set new law days if the court's judgment is affirmed on appeal. See Practice Book \u00a7 17-10.\" (Citation omitted; footnotes omitted.)\n   <em>\n    RAL Management, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Valley View Associates\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 683-84,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=899%20A.2d%20586\">\n    899 A.2d 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiff argues that\n   <em>\n    RAL Management, Inc.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable to this case for two reasons. First, the plaintiff correctly notes that in\n   <em>\n    RAL Management, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , this court granted the defendants' motion for reconsideration and vacated the trial court's order terminating the appellate stay. Thus, the law days set by the trial court\n   in\n   <em>\n    RAL Management\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Inc.\n   </em>\n   , could not have any effect because of this court's order reimposing the stay. In fact, our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    RAL Management, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , noted that the trial court's order resetting the law days \"could not be given effect, however, because the Appellate Court's order vacated that order, thus reviving the stay. Therefore, the trial court's action must be viewed as either a legal nullity or an action in contravention to the appellate stay barring actions to carry out or to enforce the judgment pending appeal.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=899%20A.2d%20586\">\n    Id., at 684-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=899%20A.2d%20586\">\n    899 A.2d 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to the plaintiff, this language should be read to mean that, had this court denied the motion for reconsideration, which happened in the present case, the action of the trial court resetting the law days would have been proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We disagree with the plaintiff's reading of\n   <em>\n    RAL Management, Inc\n   </em>\n   . This court's decision in that case vacating the trial court's termination of the appellate stay provided an additional reason why the law days set by the trial court were ineffective. The language used by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    RAL Management, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , makes clear, however, that the court viewed the resetting of the law days itself, which occurred well before this court ruled on the motion for reconsideration, as violative of the appellate stay. The court reinforced this conclusion in a footnote that immediately follows the language relied on by the plaintiff in the present case. Regarding the actions of the trial court in resetting the law days, the court stated: \"We surmise that the trial court did not act knowingly in violation of the stay. The record indicates that the defendants filed their motion for reconsideration of the Appellate Court's denial of their motion for review of the trial court's decision terminating the stay on the last day permitted for filing that motion. The plaintiff represented to this court that it had received a copy of the motion for reconsideration the following\n   business day, after the trial court had held the hearing on the motion to open the judgment, the same day the court granted the motion.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=899%20A.2d%20586\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 685 n.12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=899%20A.2d%20586\">\n    899 A.2d 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the trial court violated the stay when it opened the judgment and reset the law days during the period of time when the defendants could still seek reconsideration of this court's denial of the motion for review. That is the exact scenario that confronts us in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Second, the plaintiff argues that by stating in\n   <em>\n    RAL Management, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , that this court's decision vacating the trial court's termination of the stay had the effect of \"reviving\" the stay, our Supreme Court necessarily implied that the stay ceased to exist until this court brought it back to life. Consequently, the plaintiff argues that because in this case we denied the defendant's motion for reconsideration, we never revived or brought back to life the stay that terminated when we initially denied the relief requested in the defendant's motion for review. We are not persuaded. First, this argument ignores the plain language of Practice Book \u00a7 71-6, which provides that any stay of proceedings remains\n   in effect during the period of time for filing a motion for reconsideration, and, if such a motion is filed, until it is denied. See footnote 5 of this opinion. Second, the plaintiff's reliance on this one word in the Supreme Court's opinion ignores all of the other language noted previously in this opinion, which clearly provides that resetting the law days while the stay was in effect was in contravention of the stay, regardless of whether this court ultimately granted the motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We agree that the actions that are prohibited during the appellate stay are only those that in some way execute or effectuate the judgment. See\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Victory Properties, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12496013\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/184/1254/#p832\">\n    180 Conn.

Consequently, our Supreme Court repeatedly has held that the law days set in a judgment of strict foreclosure cannot be given any legal effect while the appellate stay is in effect. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Farmers &amp; Mechanics Savings Bank\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"520770\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/216/341/#p347\">\n    216 Conn. 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 347-48,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=579%20A.2d%201054\">\n    579 A.2d 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990), and cases cited therein. In\n   <em>\n    RAL Management, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the court extended this principle to resetting law days while the appellate stay is in effect because doing so is an action to carry out or to enforce the judgment pending appeal.\n   <em>\n    RAL Management, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , v.\n   <em>\n    Valley View Associates\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3666818\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/278/672/#p682\">\n    278 Conn. at 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=899%20A.2d%20586\">\n    899 A.2d 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying this holding to the facts of this case, we conclude that the trial court's October 15, 2018 order resetting the law days was in contravention of the appellate stay then in place. Consequently, the judgment of the trial court is reversed. Furthermore, because we conclude that the trial court erred in resetting the law days while the appellate stay was in effect, we also deny the plaintiff's motion to dismiss this appeal but grant the motion to dismiss the amended appeal as frivolous. The case is remanded to the trial court for the setting of new law days now that (1) the defendant's third appeal has been finally disposed of, and (2) we have denied the defendant's motion for reconsideration en banc of our denial of relief on her motion to review the trial court's order prospectively terminating any future appellate stays in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The motion to dismiss the appeal is denied, the motion to dismiss the amended appeal as frivolous is granted and the judgment granting the plaintiff's motion to set new law days is reversed and the case is remanded for the purpose of setting new law days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The complaint named Pawel Toczek and National City Bank as the defendants.

We refer in this opinion to Wells Fargo as the plaintiff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    \"It is axiomatic that, with limited exceptions, an appellate stay of execution arises from the time a judgment is rendered until the time to file an appeal has expired.

Execution of an order of the court terminating a stay of execution shall be stayed for ten days from the issuance of notice of the order, and if a motion for review is filed within that period, the order shall be stayed pending decision of the motion, unless the court having appellate jurisdiction rules otherwise....\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    The plaintiff argues that pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-14, any appellate stay ended when the court denied the defendant's motion for review. According to the plaintiff, because \u00a7 61-14 provides that a motion for review is a party's\n    <em>\n     sole\n    </em>\n    remedy from a trial court's decision terminating an appellate stay, a motion for reconsideration pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 71-5, does not extend the stay. The plaintiff's argument is without merit. Practice Book \u00a7 71-6 expressly provides in relevant part that \"[u]nless the chief justice or chief judge shall otherwise direct\n    <em>\n     , any\n    </em>\n    stay of proceedings which was in effect during the pendency of the appeal shall continue until the time for filing a motion for reconsideration has expired, and, if a motion is filed, until twenty days after its disposition, and, if it is granted, until the appeal is finally determined....\" (Emphasis added.) Because \u00a7 71-6 applies to any stay of proceedings, it necessarily applies to a stay under \u00a7 61-14.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
