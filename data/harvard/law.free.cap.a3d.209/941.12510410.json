Absent tortious activity, the Superior Court concluded that the wrongful death claim brought by Decedent's heir could not succeed as a matter of law because the Wrongful Death Act premises recovery upon \"the wrongful act or neglect or unlawful violence or negligence of another.\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8301. Accordingly, the Superior Court affirmed the trial court's order granting summary judgment in favor of Triathlon. For the reasons set forth herein, we would affirm the judgment of the Superior Court and adopt its astute legal analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Preliminarily and as explained in more detail\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , we respectfully note that the Opinions in Support of Reversal (both hereinafter collectively referred to as \"OISR\") ignore the issue for which we granted allocatur and, instead, attempt to reverse the judgment of the Superior Court on grounds not encompassed by this appeal. Specifically, the OISR would\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   hold that express assumption of the risk agreements are void and unenforceable in violation of public policy in cases involving claims brought pursuant to the Wrongful Death Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8301. The OISR reaches this conclusion notwithstanding that no party to this appeal challenges the validity of the agreement on public policy grounds or otherwise. We decline to engage in this judicial overreaching and proceed to address the merits of the issue before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We begin with a brief recitation of the facts. In 2010, Triathlon organized a multi-sport-event, comprised of swimming in the Schuylkill River, cycling for more than fifteen miles, and running for more than three miles. To compete in the event, each participant was required to register, pay a fee, and execute electronically a liability waiver agreement that included an assumption of the risk provision (\"Agreement\"). On January 24, 2010, Decedent complied with these requisites by electronically registering as a participant in the triathlon and executing the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The executed Agreement stated that Decedent understood \"the physical and mental rigors associated with triathlon,\" and \"that running, bicycling, [and] swimming\n   ... are inherently dangerous and represent an extreme test of a person's physical and mental limits.\" Appellee's Motion for Summary Judgment Ex. G, dated Aug. 5, 2013. The Agreement further acknowledged Decedent's understanding that \"participation involves risks and dangers which include, without limitation, the potential for serious bodily injury, permanent disability, paralysis and death ... and other undefined harm or damage which may not be readily foreseeable[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Agreement provided that Decedent was aware \"that these Risks may be caused in whole or in part by [his] own actions or inactions, the actions or inactions of others participating in the Event, or the acts, inaction or negligence of [the Triathlon].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Germane to this appeal, the Agreement stated that Decedent \"\n   <strong>\n    expressly assume[d] all such Risks and responsibility for any damages, liabilities, losses or expenses\n   </strong>\n   \" resulting from his participation in the event.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The Agreement also included a provision stating that Decedent further agreed that if he or anyone on his behalf \"makes a claim of Liability against any of the Released Parties, [Decedent] will indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Released Parties from any such Liability which any [sic] may be incurred as the result of such claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The triathlon took place on June 26, 2010. At approximately 8:30 a.m., Decedent entered the Schuylkill River to begin the first segment of the race. Tragically, Decedent never completed the swimming portion of the competition. Divers retrieved Decedent's body from the river the next day after he presumably drowned while participating in the triathlon. On April 12, 2012, Decedent's widow, Michele Valentino, both in her own right and as administratrix of her husband's estate (referred to as \"Appellant\" herein), asserted wrongful death and survival claims against various defendants, including Triathlon. Only the wrongful death claim is at issue in this appeal. Appellant subsequently amended her complaint and the defendants filed preliminary objections. On July 27, 2012, the trial court sustained the defendants' preliminary objections and struck all references in the complaint that referred to outrageous acts, gross negligence, recklessness, and punitive damages, holding that these averments were legally insufficient as the facts alleged demonstrated only ordinary negligence. The trial court further struck particular paragraphs of the amended complaint on grounds that they lacked specificity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In December of 2012, following the various defendants' filing of an answer and new matter, the defendants moved for summary judgment, asserting the Agreement as an affirmative defense. The trial court denied summary judgment, finding that questions of material fact remained regarding the existence of the Agreement. Appellant thereafter stipulated to the dismissal of all defendants except Triathlon. Once discovery was completed, Triathlon again moved for summary judgment. Concluding that the evidence at that point in the proceedings demonstrated that the Agreement was among Decedent's possessions and was valid and enforceable, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Triathlon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Prior to the trial court issuing its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion explaining its rationale for granting summary judgment in favor of Triathlon, the Superior Court, in an unrelated matter, decided the case of\n   <em>\n    Pisano v. Extendicare Homes, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7304147\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/77/651/\">\n    77 A.3d 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Super. 2013), which held that a non-signatory wrongful death claimant was not bound by an arbitration agreement signed by a decedent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7304147\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/77/651/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7304147\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/77/651/\">\n    at 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On April 14, 2012, shortly after\n   <em>\n    Pisano\n   </em>\n   was decided, the trial court issued its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion in this matter and urged the Superior Court to vacate its order granting summary judgment in favor of Triathlon based on that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Relying upon\n   <em>\n    Pisano\n   </em>\n   , Appellant argued to the Superior Court that Decedent's Agreement with Triathlon does not apply to her as a non-signatory and, thus, has no preclusive effect upon her wrongful death claims asserted against Triathlon. In response, Triathlon contended that Decedent's assumption of the risks inherent in participation in the event relieved its duty of care, thereby rendering Triathlon's conduct non-tortious as a matter of law. The Triathlon maintained that, absent tortious activity, a wrongful death claim could not succeed because the Wrongful Death Act premises recovery upon \"the wrongful act or neglect or unlawful violence or negligence of another.\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8301.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Initially, on December 30, 2015, a divided panel of the Superior Court reversed the trial court's order in part, holding that under\n   <em>\n    Pisano,\n   </em>\n   Decedent's Agreement was not applicable to Appellant because she was not a signatory to the contract. The Superior Court thereafter granted\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   argument and withdrew its panel decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 15, 2016, an\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   Superior Court affirmed the trial court's order granting Triathlon summary judgment in a published decision.\n   <em>\n    Valentino v. Phila. Triathlon, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190060\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/483/\">\n    150 A.3d 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Super. 2016). Preliminarily, the Superior Court acknowledged that because a wrongful death claim is not derivative of a decedent's cause of action, \"a decedent may not compromise or diminish a wrongful death claimant's right of action without consent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190060\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/483/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190060\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/483/\">\n    at 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nevertheless, the Superior Court went on to hold that \"a third-party wrongful death claimant is subject to substantive defenses supported by the decedent's actions or agreements where offered to relieve the defendant, either wholly or partially, from liability by showing that the defendant's actions were not tortious.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190060\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/483/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Superior Court found that the available substantive defense here was Decedent's contractual assumption of the risks inherent in participation in the triathlon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The assumption of the risk doctrine, set forth in Section 496A of the Restatement Second of Torts, provides that \"[a] plaintiff who voluntarily assumes a risk of harm arising from the negligent or reckless conduct of the defendant cannot recover for such harm.\" Restatement Second of Torts, \u00a7 496A. Comment c(1) to Section 496A provides that the express assumption of the risk \"means that the plaintiff has given his express consent to relieve the defendant of an obligation to exercise care for his protection, and agrees to take his chances as to injury from a known or possible risk.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190060\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/483/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at cmt. c(1). Notably, the Comment goes on to state that \"[t]he result is that the defendant, who would otherwise be under a duty to exercise such care, is relieved of that responsibility, and is no longer under any duty to protect the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190060\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/483/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Pennsylvania case law illustrates that one's assumption of the risks inherent in a particular activity eliminates the defendant's duty of care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hughes v.

Acknowledging\n   <em>\n    Pisano's\n   </em>\n   principle that a third party's right of action in a wrongful death claim is an independent statutory claim of a decedent's heirs and is not derivative of a decedent's right of action, the Superior Court emphasized that \"a wrongful death claim still requires a tortious injury to succeed.\"\n   <em>\n    Valentino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190060\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/483/\">\n    150 A.3d at 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Superior Court cogently explained that\n   <em>\n    Pisano\n   </em>\n   does not undermine the fundamental principle that a statutory claimant in a wrongful death action has the burden of proving that the defendant's tortious conduct caused the decedent's death. It opined that this cannot occur where the\n   decedent assumed all risks inherent in participating in the activity and thereby abrogated any duty the putative tortfeasor may have had.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190060\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/483/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Similarly, the Superior Court distinguished this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Buttermore v. Aliquippa Hospital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1818940\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/522/325/\">\n    522 Pa. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1818940\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/522/325/\">\n    561 A.2d 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), upon which Appellant had relied.\n   <em>\n    Valentino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190060\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/483/\">\n    150 A.3d at 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, James Buttermore was injured in an automobile accident and signed a release in settlement of his claim against the tortfeasors for the sum of $25,000, agreeing to release all persons from liability.\n   <em>\n    Buttermore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1818940\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/522/325/\">\n    561 A.2d at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The issue on appeal to this Court was whether Buttermore's wife, who was not a signatory to the settlement agreement, had an independent right to sue the tortfeasors for loss of consortium.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 735. Acknowledging that the release applied to all tortfeasors, including the defendants, this Court held that one could not bargain away the rights of others who were not a party to the contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because Buttermore's wife was not a party to her husband's settlement agreement and because she sought to sue in her own right for loss of consortium, we held that she had an independent cause of action, unaffected by her husband's settlement agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 736.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Superior Court below distinguished\n   <em>\n    Buttermore\n   </em>\n   , finding that unlike the express assumption of the risk agreement here, the settlement agreement in\n   <em>\n    Buttermore\n   </em>\n   did not extinguish a requisite element of the wife's loss of consortium claim.\n   <em>\n    Valentino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190060\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/483/\">\n    150 A.3d at 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Stated differently, unlike the express assumption of the risk agreement in the instant case, nothing in the settlement agreement in\n   <em>\n    Buttermore\n   </em>\n   precluded the finding that the defendants acted tortiously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We agree with the Superior Court's application of well-settled tort law and its conclusion that the assumption of the risk agreement entered into between Decedent and the Triathlon operates much differently than the settlement agreement in\n   <em>\n    Buttermore\n   </em>\n   and the arbitration agreement in\n   <em>\n    Pisano\n   </em>\n   , as the latter agreements do not preclude a finding that the defendant acted tortiously. We further agree with the intermediate appellate court that a decedent's valid assumption of the risk agreement does not negate his heir's right to commence a wrongful death lawsuit, but it \"can support a defense asserting that the alleged tortfeasor owed no duty to the decedent.\"\n   <em>\n    Valentino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190060\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/483/\">\n    150 A.3d at 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Accordingly, once Decedent extinguished Triathlon's duty of care by expressly assuming all risks in the inherently dangerous sporting event, his heir could not resurrect that duty of care after his death. To do so would afford a decedent's heirs more rights than those possessed by a decedent while alive. Such a result not only defies logic, but also the statutory requisites for a wrongful death claim. As there is no genuine issue of material fact and it is clear that Triathlon is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we would affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, which affirmed the trial court order granting summary judgment in Triathlon's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pa.R.C.P. 1035.2 (providing that summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact or when a party which will bear the burden of proof has failed to present evidence sufficient to present the issue to the jury).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As noted, regarding the OISR's\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   public policy declaration, our primary objection is that the issue of whether the express assumption of the risk agreement violates public policy is not properly before the Court; thus, the grant of relief on this claim cannot serve as a means to disturb the judgment of the Superior Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steiner v. Markel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193446,4193375\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/600/515/\">\n    600 Pa. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7338337,7338378,4193446,4193375\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/968/1253/\">\n    968 A.2d 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1256 (2009) (holding that an appellate court may not reverse a judgment on a basis that was not properly raised and preserved by the parties).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Additionally, we observe that the OISR declares the express assumption of the risk agreement violative of the public policy set forth in the Wrongful Death Act,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to compensate family members of victims of tortious conduct, without any explanation as to how tortious conduct can exist in the absence of a duty of care. Further, the OISR seeks to invalidate not all express assumption of the risk contracts, but only those relating to wrongful death claims, based upon the public policy set forth in the Wrongful Death Act. Accordingly, under the OISR's reasoning, express assumption of the risk agreements would generally be valid to preclude a participant's ordinary negligence claims against the purveyor of an inherently dangerous sport or activity, but would be invalid where a participant's injuries were fatal and his heirs sought recovery for wrongful death. Thus, a participant who suffered grievous non-fatal injury would have no redress, but his family would have redress if the participant succumbed to his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This result is untenable as there is no evidence to suggest that it is the public policy of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to elevate the rights of victims' heirs over those of the victims themselves or to immunize wrongful death claims from ordinary and readily available defenses. In fact, not only did the General Assembly premise recovery in wrongful death on the precise tortious conduct that caused the decedent's fatal injuries, but directed expressly that a wrongful death action \"may be brought, under procedures prescribed by general rules.\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8301(a). There is simply no provision in the Wrongful Death Act that renders an heir's entitlement to relief absolute. Had the Legislature intended that mandate, it would have so directed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Moreover, it is not the role of this Court to create the public policy of this Commonwealth.

The Triathlon consisted of three events: (1) a 0.5 mile swim; (2) a 15.7 mile bicycle race; and (3) a 3.1 mile run. The swim portion of the Triathlon took place in the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As a participant in the Triathlon, Decedent, Derek Valentino, registered as a participant for the Triathlon and executed a Waiver and Release of Liability (the Waiver) by affixing his electronic signature to an online registration form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On race day, at approximately 8:30 a.m., Decedent entered the Schuylkill River for the swim portion of the Triathlon, but he did not complete the swim and, on the following day, his body was recovered from the Schuylkill River.

Here, Appellant does not challenge the validity or the enforceability of the contractual assumption of risk in the survival action she brought (as administratrix) on behalf of Decedent's estate. Therefore, for purposes of this appeal, the liability waiver is valid and enforceable as a complete defense to the survival action. As between the Triathlon and Decedent, there is a knowing and voluntary agreement to extinguish Decedent's ability to recover for claims of ordinary negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   I believe that we must, however, decline to allow the liability waiver to defeat a wrongful death action brought by heirs who never agreed, expressly or otherwise, to eliminate their statutory right to recover for their pecuniary loss resulting from the death of their loved one that, as alleged, was tortious but for the liability waiver. Allowing the liability waiver to defeat the wrongful death action, as the Superior Court did, gives the waiver the broadest possible reading, contrary to our mandate to narrowly construe such provisions. The tenet of strict construction requires that we limit this liability waiver to its narrowest effect: a bar to recovery under the survival action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Moreover, as noted by Justice Dougherty, for an exculpatory waiver to be valid, it must meet three conditions: it must not contravene public policy, the contract must be between persons relating entirely to their own private affairs, and each party must be a free bargaining agent to the agreement so that the contract is not one of adhesion.

Analogously, the General Assembly has for centuries prohibited spousal disinheritance by will in order to ensure the surviving spouse's financial security after the decedent's death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Houston's Estate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1237105\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/371/396/\">\n    371 Pa. 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20A.2d%20525\">\n    89 A.2d 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 526 (1952) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2203 (authorizing a surviving spouse to take against the will an elective share of one-third of the deceased's property, subject to certain exceptions, thereby ensuring the surviving spouse's right to some inheritance). Thus, a married individual cannot eliminate his spouse's statutory entitlement, even through an attempted disinheritance in a last will and testament. In my view, it is impossible to reconcile allowing a sporting event participant to eradicate a statutory claim for wrongful death damages when he could not accomplish a disinheritance by virtue of a will. For this reason, and because liability waivers are disfavored, I join Justice Dougherty in narrowly construing the liability waiver so that it is enforceable only in the survival action brought on behalf of Decedent's estate, where it was not challenged.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tayar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314141,4210167\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/47/1190/\">\n    47 A.3d at 1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (curtailing purported effect of waiver on public policy grounds). So construed, it has no effect on the wrongful death action. Like Justice Dougherty, I would decline to give any effect to the Decedent's contractual waiver of the Triathlon's duty of care in the wrongful death action because doing so would implicate public, not merely private, affairs and would contravene the policy set forth by our legislature in the Wrongful Death Act which we must liberally construe.

Although the question granted on appeal did not include the term \"public policy,\" we must surely consider public policy when determining whether an exculpatory agreement is valid and enforceable under the given circumstances.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The OISA accurately observes an exculpatory agreement would \"generally be valid to preclude a participant's ordinary negligence claims against the purveyor of an inherently dangerous sport or activity,\" but nevertheless rejects our view that the same waiver could be ineffective as a defense in a wrongful death claim while providing a viable defense in a survival action.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    OISA at 947. We consider the disparate treatment of the Waiver in the two causes of action to be the direct result of the different goals and purposes served by the relevant statutes.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at 942, n.2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Importantly, our holding would not render appellee defenseless in that litigation, despite the OISA statement our reading means appellant's right to relief is \"absolute\".\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    OISA at 947. We recognize a wrongful death action is a tort claim arising from the alleged \"wrongful act or neglect or unlawful violence or negligence of another.\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8301. Appellant must still prove the elements of her case, including causation, before any recovery would be assured.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Phillips v. Cricket Lighters\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"16773\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/576/644/\">\n     576 Pa. 644\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"16773,9286806\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/841/1000/\">\n     841 A.2d 1000\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1008 (2003) (to maintain negligence action, plaintiff must show defendant had duty to conform to standard of conduct, breach of duty, the breach caused the injury, and the injury resulted in damages).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
