Battaglia (Senior Judge, Specially Assigned), JJ.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   Nazarian, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Baltimore is home to over a thousand brick-and-mortar restaurants and about seventy licensed food trucks, including Pizza di Joey and Madame BBQ (collectively \"the Food Trucks\"). Baltimore City Code, Article 15, \u00a7 17-33, known colloquially as the \"300-foot rule,\" prohibits mobile food vendors from conducting business within 300 feet of brick-and-mortar establishments that sell primarily the same kind of food.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In October 2016, the Food Trucks sued the City in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. They asked the court to declare that the 300-foot rule functionally prohibited them from operating in Baltimore City and, therefore, violated their rights under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The City countered that the rule did not prevent food trucks from thriving in Baltimore City and that the rule's location restrictions furthered the City's legitimate interest in supporting local brick-and-mortar businesses that had invested in Baltimore's commercial neighborhoods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After a trial, the circuit court found (using what it called \"heightened rational basis review\") that the 300-foot rule did not violate the Food Trucks' rights under Article 24, but that the ambiguities in the statutory language rendered it unconstitutionally vague. We hold that the ordinance should have been\n   measured for rational\n   basis, that it does not violate Article 24, and that it is not unconstitutionally vague. We affirm the circuit court's rulings on Article 24 and reverse the judgment enjoining the City from enforcing the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The 300-Foot Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Baltimore City Code regulates the places mobile food vendors can operate. One restriction, known as the \"300-foot rule,\" has been around since the 1970s, but in its most recent form, which took effect on February 28, 2015, prohibits mobile vendors\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   from operating within 300 feet of a business that sells primarily the same food, merchandise, or service:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   A mobile vendor may not park a vendor truck within 300 feet of any retail business establishment that is primarily engaged in selling the same type of food product, other merchandise, or service as that offered by the mobile vendor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Baltimore City Code, Art. 15, \u00a7 17-33.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A food truck that violates the 300-foot rule commits a misdemeanor. Baltimore City Code, Article 15, \u00a7 17-42. Violators must pay a fine of $ 500,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and may also have their mobile vending licenses suspended or revoked. Baltimore City Code, Art. 15 \u00a7 17-44(a). If a licensee commits three violations\n   within a one-year period, revocation is mandatory. Baltimore City Code Art. 15 \u00a7 17-44(b). And once a mobile vendor's license has been revoked, \"the former licensee may not apply for a new license until at least 1 year from the date of revocation.\" Baltimore City Code, Art. 15, \u00a7 17-44(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A number of City agencies, including the Department of Transportation, the Department of General Services, the Baltimore City Police Department, and the University of Maryland Police, enforce the 300-foot rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Aside from the text of the rule itself, no guidelines elaborate on how the rule should be enforced or define the phrases \"primarily engaged in\" or \"same type of food product\" with any further precision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although these penalties have been on the books since 2015, no vendor has received a citation or had a license suspended for violating the 300-foot rule. Instead, when mobile vendors violate the rule, the City's enforcement authorities ask them to relocate or to alter their menus according to what brick-and-mortar establishments are nearby. Enforcement authorities initiate these measures only in response to a complaint that a food truck is parked too close to a brick-and-mortar business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Food Trucks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pizza di Joey is a Maryland-based limited liability company and a mobile vendor\n   licensed in Baltimore City.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Baltimore City Code, Art. 15, \u00a7 17-1. Pizza di Joey is an Italian kitchen on wheels, complete with 4000-pound brick pizza oven, and has sold \"authentic New York style brick oven pizza, as well as some Italian pastas and salad\" since 2014. The \"Joey\" of Pizza di Joey is its owner and founder, Joseph Salek-Nejad, known professionally as Joey Vanoni.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pizza di Joey is open for business several afternoons per week. Although Mr. Vanoni had intended his \"center for business operation\" to be Baltimore\n   City, he now operates in Anne Arundel County the vast majority of the time, purportedly as a result of the prohibitive nature of the 300-foot rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Pizza di Joey has never been cited for violating the 300-foot rule, but was approached once by law enforcement in 2015 in response to a brick-and-mortar restaurant's complaint. Pizza di Joey was setting up for lunch service on the 800 block of West Baltimore Street when a University of Maryland Police officer approached and told Mr. Vanoni that a nearby deli had complained that he was parked too close. Mr. Vanoni explained to the officer that because the deli did not serve pizza, he understood that he was permitted to park his truck nearby without violating the 300-foot rule. The officer was not familiar with the particulars of the rule, so Mr. Vanoni pulled up the text of \u00a7 17-33 on his laptop and showed it to him. The officer agreed after reviewing the rule that there was no violation and went on his way. Beyond selling the same officer a slice of pizza later that day, that one encounter represented all of Pizza di Joey's interactions with enforcement authorities relating to the 300-foot rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Madame BBQ is a Maryland-based limited liability company founded in the summer of 2014. In 2016, Madame BBQ rebranded its food truck as MindGrub Caf\u00e9 and shifted from selling barbeque to more health-conscious cuisine, self-described as \"brain food for knowledge workers.\" Madame BBQ is owned by Nicole McGowan, who has worked in the food service industry since she was fifteen. When Ms. McGowan began operating Madame BBQ in 2014, she conducted most of her business in Howard County. At that time, she was not a licensed mobile vendor in Baltimore City and only took her truck there occasionally through one-day permits for block parties and special events. At the time of trial, Ms. McGowan was in the process of relocating \"the focus of [her] operations\" to Baltimore City, where she would ideally like to sell lunch from her truck on weekday afternoons. She is now licensed in Baltimore City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Madame BBQ has never been cited for violating the 300-foot rule and has never had any encounter with enforcement agencies. But the rule is so prohibitive, Ms. McGowan claims, that she does not take her truck out in Baltimore City because there is nowhere she feels she can serve lunch that doesn't \"make [her] afraid to get a citation or lose [her] license.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Pizza di Joey and Madame BBQ filed this action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on May 11, 2016. They alleged that the 300-foot rule violated their rights to equal protection and due process under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, both on its face and as applied. The Food Trucks sought a declaratory judgment stating the 300-foot rule was unconstitutional and a permanent injunction against its enforcement. The City filed a Motion to Dismiss the complaint, which was denied. The parties' cross-motions for\n   summary judgment were also denied and the case was set for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial lasted two days and included testimony from Mr. Vanoni, Ms. McGowan, and Anirban Basu, an expert witness offered by the City who testified about the impact of food trucks on brick-and-mortar businesses and the economic viability of commercial neighborhoods. The Food Trucks' owners' depositions also were admitted into evidence, along with the depositions of two City employees deposed as its representatives-Gia Montgomery of the Department of Transportation, who testified that she was the person most qualified to speak authoritatively on mobile vending licensure and regulation enforcement, and Babila Lima of the Department of General Services (\"DGS\"), who drafted both the 300-foot rule and the materials posted to the DGS website offering guidance on the mechanics of mobile vending regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mr. Vanoni testified that the 300-foot rule has essentially driven him out of Baltimore City, contrary to his original intention to make Baltimore the center of his business. He explained that the rule is \"extremely limiting on my business'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ability to successfully operate.... I've been compelled to operate outside the City which is not what I intended. I'd like to operate [in Baltimore].\" He claimed that the 300-foot rule prohibited him from operating in the Baltimore neighborhoods where his business was most likely to succeed, such as Hampden:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   MR. VANONI: It's a great area. It's [an] up and coming neighborhood here in Baltimore. I've got some friends that live up there. They bought some homes there and it's kind of like a culinary incubator.... It's upbeat. It's fun. And it's a cool place to hang out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   PIZZA DI JOEY'S COUNSEL: What steps did you take to analyze the effect of the 300-foot rule and your ability to operate in the Hampden area?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   MR. VANONI: I got a list of all the restaurants in the area and I took evaluation of their menus and compared their menus trying to look for any conflicts with regards to this 300-foot rule. Then I shortened my list, went to Hampden and walked the streets verifying their locations with a map I had and the list I created.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   PIZZA DI JOEY'S COUNSEL: And about how many restaurants did you identify that concerned you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   MR. VANONI: Hampden, it was 12.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   PIZZA DI JOEY'S COUNSEL: And in identifying those 12 what conclusions did you draw about your ability to operate in Hampden?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   MR. VANONI: I couldn't operate there successfully.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In addition to Hampden, Mr. Vanoni expressed concern about taking his truck to Federal Hill, Harbor East, Canton, and Fells Point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mr. Vanoni also testified about his encounter with the University of Maryland Police, and explained that it caused him to reevaluate and ultimately change his business plan:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   PIZZA DI JOEY'S COUNSEL: What were the lessons you drew from your experience with the University of Maryland police officer?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   MR. VANONI: That this law's enforced, that on any given day I could be approached and, you know, I don't want to sound like I'm so important, but I operate my business and I'm on the truck. So when somebody's occupying my time I can't prep. It gave me great pause and concern for operating because I can go here and, you know, even though I could be completely in the right I have to sit here and argue my case every day with\n   an enforcement officer whatever uniform they're wearing or out of uniform and that takes up time from operating. I start off the day normally by myself until my staff arrives, so it's kind of precious time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   PIZZA DI JOEY'S COUNSEL: Were you more concerned about the 300-foot rule after this incident?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   MR. VANONI: Absolutely. I realized it wasn't[,] not that I took it lightly[,] but it definitely wasn't a law to take lightly or an order to take lightly not that I really do take laws lightly, but I realize that it was enforced and kind of like, you know, just kind of reiterating what I said before on any given day I could go out there and try to operate and potentially be approached by somebody who is trying to just call on a complaint. They're doing their job. I get that. I'm not in the habit of, you know, getting into argument with law enforcement officers. So yeah, it definitely raised my level of concern.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Ms. McGowan expressed similar concerns in her testimony. She said that the 300-foot rule placed entire neighborhoods off limits to MindGrub Cafe, particularly Federal Hill, Hampden, Harbor East, Downtown, Locust Point, and Woodberry. She also shared Mr. Vanoni's concerns about profits she lost as result of time spent justifying her truck's presence to law enforcement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   MADAME BBQ'S COUNSEL: [D]oes your concern about the 300 foot rule influence where you decide to set up?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   MS. MCGOWAN: Yes, it does.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   MADAME BBQ'S COUNSEL: How so?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   MS. MCGOWAN: I definitely don't take my truck out very often, because I'm fearful of where I can park. I haven't found any places that are not--that don't make me afraid to get a citation or lose my license.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [A]s we heard from Joey, you know, all of this takes time. And to try to have to, you know, prove your case, you know, whenever you go out, and the fear of having to prove your case - you know, if someone comes up and says, \"[y]ou need to prove you are not in violation.\" That all takes time. I mean, lunch service is not very long.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The City's expert, Anirban Basu, testified at length about the problems food trucks present to brick-and-mortar eateries and how the 300-foot rule might address those concerns. Mr. Basu is CEO of an economic and policy consultancy that has represented many Baltimore businesses, developers, and agencies. He co-authored an economic development strategy for Baltimore City, and was consultant for the developers of Harbor East, Harbor Point, and Port Covington. Mr. Basu testified that vacancies in commercial neighborhoods affect both public safety and the commercial viability of Baltimore neighborhoods:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   MR. BASU: I really believe that commercial vacancies are very injurious in terms of creating an environment not conducive to public safety.... If [people] see a lot of vacant space they see a lot of hopelessness. Often vacant space associated with deteriorating physical conditions of buildings. That also sends out signals to people. And people often respond with their behaviors to those signals. So what you want is very vibrant commercial districts ... low vacancy rate....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   CITY'S COUNSEL: And based on your economic knowledge ... do vacancies make it more difficult to attract new businesses to those areas?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   MR. BASU: Oh yes, they do. And [ ] that's because again it sends a signal to potential tenants that this may not be the place for them.... [O]ne of the things you tend to see in\n   commercial real estate is that an area that has suffered high vacancy often continues to suffer high vacancy.... So vacancy breeds vacancy. And it's very difficult once a commercial area stops being vibrant to bring that vibrancy back. And we see that throughout Baltimore.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Mr. Basu described the different contributions that brick-and-mortar restaurants and food trucks make to the City:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   CITY'S COUNSEL: How are [food trucks'] contributions to a commercial district different from the contributions that you testified that restaurants contribute to a commercial district?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   MR. BASU: Restaurants are semi-permanent members of their community.... Food trucks by definition are mobile. They're not affixed to a particular community. They're not necessarily pillars of their community. And of course they're not in brick and mortar context. And so they're not generating property taxes, directly or indirectly, the way that a restaurant would.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   He also addressed the disparity in financial investment, and the corresponding disparity in risk, between brick-and-mortar restaurants and food trucks:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   MR. BASU: ... based on the parameters I found from various industry publications, [ ] it's reasonable to conclude that a typical restaurant entrepreneur is investing and, therefore, risking about four times as much money as is a food truck entrepreneur. Both are taking risks. Both are to be respected for taking those risks. It's wonderful. But the restaurateur on average is making a much larger gamble financially than is a typical food truck entrepreneur.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   He explained that in addition to the greater financial investment and corresponding impact on the local economy, brick-and-mortar entrepreneurs make a long-term commitment to the communities in which they operate. They provide tenancy, which increases property values, enter long-term leases, provide employment in greater numbers, and, most importantly, cannot pack up and leave easily. Food trucks, conversely, are able to \"cherry pick\" hours and locations to optimize profits\n   without committing to any particular neighborhood. If a neighborhood they frequent experiences crime or heavy construction, or anything else that might deter customers from returning, food trucks can drive their business to a more desirable location. And by setting up directly beside a brick-and-mortar competitor, food trucks take advantage of the environment created by the restauranteurs' investments while siphoning off a portion of the business that their competitors have worked to generate. Mr. Basu testified that these dynamics did not \"strike [him] as fair competition and it very much [struck him] as a free rider problem.\" Mr. Basu opined that the 300-foot rule addressed the problem of unfair competition between the two business types \"very strongly\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   My conclusion is very firmly that [the 300-foot] rule enures to the benefit of the people of Baltimore and to the benefit of the level of commercial transactions that will take place in this city over the long term that it supports entrepreneurship and that it supports street-level vitality.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   After the trial concluded, the court took the case under advisement, then issued a written Memorandum and Order on December 20, 2017. After finding that the 300-foot rule was not unconstitutional\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , the court considered the appropriate standard for measuring the Food Trucks'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Article 24 claims. The court applied \"heightened rational basis\" scrutiny and found that the rule was not unconstitutional under that standard:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Applying the heightened rational standard of review to the 300 foot rule this Court concludes that this provision is not unconstitutional because it (1) protects the contributions brick-and-mortar retail establishments make to the City's commercial districts; (2) promotes entrepreneurial investments and opportunity by eliminating the potential risks of food trucks; and (3) diversifies the marketplace to maximize positive economic effect by creating meaningful choices for the consumer. The 300-foot rule promotes brick-and-mortar establishments throughout the City by eliminating the threat of mobile vendors, and ensuring brick-and-mortar establishments become a permanent fixture in the City.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Promoting brick-and-mortar restaurants provides jobs, property tax revenues, and prevents a growing number of vacant properties. The commercial district of this City is dependent on these brick-and-mortar establishments' long-term real estate investments. The City's economic vitality is dependent upon the flourishment of its commercial district.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   As stated in [\n   <em>\n    Attorney General v.\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    Waldron\n   </em>\n   , [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2093698\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/289/683/\">\n    289 Md. 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=426%20A.2d%20929\">\n    426 A.2d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981) ], a State may enact regulations that may be burdensome on an individual's right to engage in their choice of occupation, as long as that regulation is required for the protection of the public health, safety, and morals. This Court agrees that the vitality of commercial districts is dependent upon the success of brick-and-mortar establishments, which promotes a successful economy. The 300-foot rule serves the legitimate purpose of promoting the City's general welfare by establishing a 300-foot distance between brick-and-mortar establishments and mobile vendors. The City is entitled to protect the general welfare by ensuring the vibrancy of commercial districts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Thus, this Court declares that Baltimore City Code, Article 15, Section 17,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , is constitutional and does not infringe on the [Food Trucks'] Due Process and Equal Protection rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Although there was some uncertainty about whether the Food Trucks had challenged the rule on vagueness grounds-as we detail later, their complaint didn't include a vagueness claim, and they alternately disclaimed and embraced the theory at different times during the trial and closing arguments-the court determined that they had raised both a facial and as-applied vagueness challenge and concluded that the 300-foot rule was unconstitutionally vague in two ways.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the court found that the phrases \"primarily engaged in\" and \"same type of food product\" left the parties without fair notice of the rule's scope and how the City would enforce it.\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the court found that \"the entities enforcing this ordinance do not have guidance as to how to measure the 300-foot distance between bricks-and-mortar establishments and food trucks.\" As a result, the court granted the Food Trucks' request for\n   injunctive relief and enjoined the City from enforcing the 300-foot rule. The order stayed the injunction for sixty days, but the stay expired on February 19, 2018, and the injunction went into effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The circuit court denied motions to reconsider and to stay, and this Court denied a motion to stay the injunction as well. The Food Trucks, notwithstanding their victory, appealed the circuit court's decision finding no violation of their due process or equal protection rights, and the City cross-appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   At the threshold, we consider, and reject, the City's contention that the Food\n   Trucks have not presented a justiciable controversy under the Declaratory Judgment Act. From there, we move to the merits: we hold that rational basis is the appropriate level of constitutional scrutiny to apply in reviewing the 300-foot rule, we find that standard met, and we hold that the circuit court erred in finding the rule void for vagueness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Food Trucks Presented A Justiciable Controversy Under The Declaratory Judgment Act.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Mayor and City Council argue that the Food Trucks \"failed to present an action that was ripe under the meaning of the declaratory judgments act.\" Because neither of the Food Trucks has been cited for violating the 300-foot rule, and because there is no guarantee that they ever will be, the City reasons that the Food Trucks \"have merely presented an issue that exists in the abstract,\" and the circuit court should have dismissed the case. We disagree and find that the Food Trucks have alleged a justiciable controversy under the declaratory judgment act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The declaratory judgment act provides that \"a court may grant a declaratory judgment or decree in a civil case, if\n   it will serve to terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceedings, and if an actual controversy exists between contending parties.\" Md. Code (1974, 2013 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 3-409(a)(1) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\"CJ\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   But a court cannot consider a declaratory judgment action unless the underlying controversy is justiciable.\n   <em>\n    State Center, LLC v.

The City enacted the 300-foot rule to address \"the potential for pecuniary harm arising from food trucks acting as 'free-riders' on the economic investments that brick-and-mortar restaurants make in their specific and fixed locations.\" According to the Food Trucks' own business plans, they wish to park and sell in neighborhoods with vibrant streets populated by brick-and-mortar restaurants. The character of those neighborhoods is inseparable from the presence of the resident\n   businesses. It is, in fact,\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   brick-and-mortar businesses that Pizza di Joey and Madame BBQ wish to park and sell in neighborhoods like Hampden, Mt. Vernon, Harbor East, and Federal Hill. And requiring mobile vendors to keep a 300-foot distance rationally addresses the City's concerns that their business will harm their brick-and-mortar counterparts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   It overstates the impact of the 300-foot rule to say, as the Food Trucks do, that it \"effectively prohibited them from operating in viable commercial corridors.\" To the contrary, the severity of the rule's limitations depends on the restaurants in each neighborhood and the type of food a mobile vendor sells. The Food Trucks themselves illustrate the point-Pizza di Joey will undoubtedly be restricted more than MindGrub Caf\u00e9 because the ubiquity of brick-and-mortar pizzerias means there is less area in which a mobile pizzeria can operate outside of the 300-foot zone surrounding each one. In a neighborhood like Hampden, with at least five pizza-focused restaurants on its busiest commercial street, Pizza di Joey may well be unable to operate altogether on the most popular blocks. But MindGrub Caf\u00e9 has fewer competitors and, therefore, fewer blocks that are off-limits. And that makes sense, given the rule's aim to protect brick-and-mortars from direct competition. The varying effects track the 300-foot rule's legitimate purpose directly, and those effects are neither arbitrary nor irrational.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tyler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694170\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/415/475/#p499\">\n    415 Md. at 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694170\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/415/475/#p499\">\n    3 A.3d 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[w]e will uphold a statute subject to rational basis review against an equal protection challenge unless the varying treatment\n   of different groups or persons is so unrelated to the achievement ... of [a] legitimate purpose[ ] that the court may conclude only that the governmental actions were arbitrary or irrational.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   We offer no views on the wisdom or the economic efficacy of the 300-foot rule.

Through discovery and trial, though, they seemed often to be arguing vagueness indirectly. For example, when they deposed Ms. Montgomery and Mr. Lima, the Food Trucks made much of the witnesses' inconsistent and subjective interpretations of the rule, and especially of the language \"primarily engaged in\" and \"same type of food product.\" And in their arguments in the trial court, the Food Trucks frequently mentioned that the inconsistencies in interpretation created a problem with arbitrary enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The trial court picked up on this, and during closing arguments, interrupted counsel for the Food Trucks to clarify the contours of their arguments:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   THE COURT: So am I hearing you say that--that it's really it's a two fold argument? That on the one hand it's an argument that the regulation ... in general is unconstitutional? ...

And I think you summarized it pretty accurately there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   After the Food Trucks appeared to embrace a void for vagueness argument, the City responded that a vagueness challenge would not be appropriate in this case because (a) a facial challenge is impermissible (more on that below), and (b) there are no acts of enforcement against Pizza di Joey or Madame BBQ through which to measure the fairness of the rule as applied. The Food Trucks replied in no uncertain terms that \"\n   <em>\n    we didn't raise a void for vagueness challenge\n   </em>\n   .\" So the total absence of vagueness allegations in their complaint and the Food Trucks' unambiguous waiver of the claim during closing arguments should have ended the inquiry, and the circuit court erred by invalidating the 300-foot rule on a theory that the Food Trucks never raised and then disavowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Preservation aside, the fact that the 300-foot rule has never been enforced against the Food Trucks deprived the circuit court of a record on which to assess the 300-foot rule's vagueness as applied.\n   <em>\n    Bowers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2081615\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/283/115/#p122\">\n    283 Md. at 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=389%20A.2d%20341\">\n    389 A.2d 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he constitutionality of a statutory provision under attack on void-for-vagueness\n   grounds must be determined strictly on the basis of the statute's application to the particular facts at hand.\");\n   <em>\n    Galloway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"672408\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/365/599/#p611\">\n    365 Md. at 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"672408\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/365/599/#p611\">\n    781 A.2d 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up) (Except in the First Amendment context, it is \"immaterial that the statute is of questionable applicability in foreseeable marginal situations ....\").

There is no dispute that the Food Trucks have not alleged a violation of any fundamental constitutional right, and for that reason their claims should not have been analyzed as a facial challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   There may well be close questions about the scope of the 300-foot rule as food trucks grow and spread in Baltimore. We can imagine, for example, that a hot dog truck might dispute that a brick-and-mortar deli is \"primarily engaged in\" selling the \"same type of food product,\" while the deli might claim that it is.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the City need not resolve the hot dog/sandwich\n   conundrum to the satisfaction of all in order to avoid a vagueness challenge. The City could reduce the possibility of confusion or vagueness by promulgating regulations or providing guidance about how it plans to enforce the rule-perhaps by adopting the Cube Rule of Food Identification\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   or\n   some other set of guidelines. But even without a formal food taxonomy in hand, City enforcement authorities are allowed to exercise reasonable discretion in applying the 300-foot rule. And the absence of any enforcement activity against Pizza di Joey or Madame BBQ left the parties and the circuit court only to speculate about where those margins might be. Courts can only evaluate the as-applied vagueness of a statute in context, against a record in which the City has, in fact, exercised its discretion. Courts cannot evaluate the application of a statute in a vacuum, though, and the circuit court erred in evaluating this statute for vagueness on this record, even if the Food Trucks had postured a vagueness claim in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2081615\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/283/115/#p122\">\n    283 Md. at 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=389%20A.2d%20341\">\n    389 A.2d 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.
