In November 2016, the DRP ruled in favor of Endo Surgi that the claim was reimbursable.

Endo Surgi contended it was entitled to reimbursement under N.J.A.C. 11:3-29.4(g) because the procedure was reimbursable under Medicare rules. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment.

The fact that, subsequent to the promulgation of the fee schedule rule, [Medicare] may have authorized additional procedures to be performed in an ASC does not permit an ASC to be reimbursed for those services unless there is an amount listed in the ASC Fee Column of Appendix, Exhibit 1 for the corresponding CPT code. However, certain codes that do not have fees in the ASC facility fee column have \"N1\" in the payment indicator column.\n   <em>\n    The \"N1\" payment indicator means that the service can be performed in an ASC but a facility fee is not separately reimbursable because the service is included in another procedure.\n   </em>\n   N.J.A.C. 11:3-29.5(a) and 29.4(e)3 apply only to facility fees and do not apply to physician services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [ (Emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Law Division judge granted reimbursement because after January 1, 2014, Medicare allowed reimbursement to ASCs that performed this CPT Code. The court did not consider it fair that the Department's PIP medical fee schedule did not allow reimbursement to an ASC \"once Medicare indicated that this particular discography performed at a[n] [ASC] facility is reimbursable.\" The court referenced another regulation, N.J.A.C. 11:3-29.4(g), which provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [e]xcept as specifically stated to the contrary in this subchapter [that is, Subchapter 29], the fee schedules shall be interpreted in accordance with the following, incorporated herein by reference, as amended and supplemented: the relevant chapters of the Medicare Claims Processing Manual, updated periodically by [Medicare], that were in effect at the time the service was provided.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [ N.J.A.C. 11:3-29.4(g).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court stated that the ... whole point of ... the language contained in 11:3-29.4(g) and the spirit of that, [is] that the ... fee should be ... reimbursable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, NJM argues the trial court's order should be vacated because CPT Code 62290 is not reimbursable to ASCs under the Department's PIP Medical Fee Schedule when performed separately.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It contends the trial court did not have the\n   legal authority to amend the Fee Schedule to conform it with Medicare's reimbursement\n   rules.
