Appellant, Joan Floyd, has challenged the legislation under the Open Meetings Act, Md. Code Ann. (2014, 2018 Supp.), General Provisions (\"GP\") \u00a7\u00a7 3-301\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (the \"Act\"), alleging that the Baltimore City Council (the \"Council\") and the Land Use and Transportation Committee (the \"Committee\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , had violated the Act with respect to several meetings conducted near the time of the bill's passage. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City, finding no\n   actionable violations of the Act, entered judgment in favor of the appellees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In her timely appeal, appellant presents five questions\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , which we have consolidated and reordered as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1. Did the trial court err in granting the City's Motion to Quash Subpoenas based on legislative privilege?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2. Did the trial court err in not considering online audio-visual recordings of certain Committee and Council meetings?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   3. Did the trial court err in determining that there was no violation of the minutes requirement of the Act in the Committee's October 20, 2016 meeting?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   4. Did the trial court err in determining that there was no violation of the notice or minutes requirements of the Act in the Council luncheon meeting on October 24, 2016?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For reasons that follow, we answer the first three questions in the negative and the fourth in the affirmative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Bill 12-0152, the legislation known as \"Transform Baltimore,\" was introduced in the Baltimore City Council on October 22, 2012, and assigned to the Land Use and Transportation Committee. Over the next four years, the Committee conducted over 80 public hearings and considered hundreds of amendments to its text and zoning map in open session. On October 19 and 20, 2016, the Committee met in open session, and, on October 20, voted to recommend Bill 12-0152 \"favorable with\n   amendments.\" The online-posted minutes of that meeting reflected the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   A motion was made by Councilmember Kraft, seconded by Councilmember Middleton, that Bill 12-0152 be recommended Favorable with Amendments. The motion for carried by the following vote:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Yes: 6 - Reisinger, Kraft, Branch, Clarke, Henry, and Middleton Absent: 1 - Mosby\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On the evening of October 24, 2016, the full Council convened in open session to consider Bill 12-0152.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Some proposed amendments were adopted by the Council; some were not. Ultimately, the Council voted favorably on Bill 12-0152 with amendments. The official minutes reflecting the Council's votes on amendments and the final vote were recorded in the Council's Journal and posted online on the Council's Legistar website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Earlier on October 24, there was a \"luncheon meeting\" of the Council hosted by Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake in the\n   Mayor's executive conference room. No minutes of that \"luncheon meeting\" were recorded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 2, 2016, appellant, along with others, filed a \"Petition for Enforcement of the Open Meetings Act\" against the Council and Committee. The petition alleged that the Council and Committee violated the Act's provisions with respect to the Committee meetings of October 19 and 20, 2016 and the Council's luncheon meeting of October 24, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Council passed Bill 12-0152 on December 5, 2016, and the Mayor signed it into law that same night.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The new zoning code and accompanying zoning map took effect on June 5, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The circuit court denied the City's motion to dismiss on February 22, 2017, and trial was set for June 9, 2017. On June 2, 2017, appellant served the City with subpoenas to compel testimony of Council President Bernard C. \"Jack\" Young, Council member and Committee Chairman Edward Reisinger, and the Director of Legislative Affairs for the Council President, Kara Kunst. The City moved to quash the subpoenas for the Council members on the grounds of legislative privilege, and it moved in limine to limit the testimony of Ms. Kunst to only those matters related to the Council's compliance with the requirements of the Act. The circuit court, finding that \"legislative privilege applies,\" granted both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At trial, appellant and Ms. Kunst both testified. When the proceedings closed, the court stated that it had \"some reviewing to do\" and would issue a written ruling. On June 30, 2017, the court entered judgment in favor of the City. It found that appellant\n   had \"failed to produce any evidence to support the[ ] claim that [the City] committed any actionable violation of the Open Meetings Act,\" and that \"[w]hile the process was not\n   perfect ... there is no indication that the errors were the result of anything more than human error ... [that] does not give rise to a cause of action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When a cause of action is based on a violation of the Open Meetings Act, there is a statutory presumption that the public body did not violate the Act, and the complainant has the burden of proving the violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GP \u00a7 3-401(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In our review of an action tried without a jury, we:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   must consider evidence produced at the trial in a light most favorable to the prevailing party and if substantial evidence was presented to support the trial court's determination, it is not clearly erroneous and cannot be disturbed. Questions of law, however, require our non-deferential review. When the trial court's decision involves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, [we] must determine whether the lower court's conclusions are legally correct. Where a case involves both issues of fact and questions of law, [we] will apply the appropriate standard to each issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Clickner v.

The trial court, finding that \"legislative privilege applies,\" granted the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Contentions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Because the Act expressly authorizes a court to determine whether a public body's violation of the Act was willful, appellant contends that direct examination of the members of a public body is required. And, for that reason, \"legislative privilege\" has\n   no place in an Open Meetings case, because it would allow \"[a]ny public body composed of legislators ... [to] effectively violate the Act with impunity.\" It is her position that legislative privilege is \"anathema to enforcement of the Act.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   More specifically, she argues that Council President Young and Committee Chairman Reisinger were \"uniquely positioned and qualified to elucidate the proceedings of these two public bodies\" over which they presided. By restricting her ability to elicit testimony from the Council members, the trial court prevented her from obtaining information from competent\n   witnesses, which severely prejudiced her efforts to succeed on her claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Citing\n   <em>\n    Community and Labor United For Baltimore Charter Committee v.

In addition, their involvement, in what she characterizes as a prior willful violation of the Act in\n   <em>\n    CLUB\n   </em>\n   , would be circumstantial evidence of a willful violation in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   She further argues that she needed the testimony of Mr. Young and Mr. Reisinger because Ms. Kunst, a staff member, was not competent to testify on matters relating to the Act. Even if she was qualified to \"support and possibly to implement the policy of the [Council] and [Committee] regarding the [Act],\" she was not qualified \"to make or explain that policy.\" Nor was she competent to testify \"as to what [Council] and Committee members themselves discussed, and with whom, during the 'recess' between the evening meetings of October 20 and 24, 2016.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The City responds that the court correctly quashed the subpoenas based on the well-developed doctrine of legislative privilege, which protected Mr. Young and Mr. Reisinger from having to testify about actions taken within the sphere of legitimate legislative activity. It asserts that Maryland law does not recognize an Open Meetings Act exception to legislative privilege, and that the\n   <em>\n    CLUB\n   </em>\n   Court did not discuss legislative privilege at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Judge Wilner, writing as the Chief Judge of this Court, has expounded on the doctrine of legislative privilege:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Members of Congress and members of the Maryland General Assembly have a separate Constitutional immunity from being called upon, in any official non-legislative forum, to defend their conduct in legislative proceedings. Article I, \u00a7 6 of the U.S. Constitution provides that \"for any Speech or Debate in either House [Senators and Representatives] shall not be questioned in any other Place.\" A similar provision, applicable to members of the General Assembly, has appeared in the Maryland Constitution since 1776. Article 10 of the current Maryland Declaration of Rights states that \"freedom of speech and debate, or proceedings in the Legislature, ought not to be impeached in any Court of Judicature.\" Article III, \u00a7 18 of the State Constitution adds that \"[n]o Senator or Delegate shall be liable in any civil action, or criminal prosecution, whatever, for words spoken in debate.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   These Constitutional clauses trace their immediate history to the English Bill of Rights of 1689, although there is evidence of a much earlier origin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion in\n   <em>\n    Holmes v.

By providing no notice and closing the meeting when the press and the public arrived, the Council \"willfully\" intended to \"prevent[ ] members of the public from observing most of the deliberations on the issue, in direct contravention to the expressly stated policy of the Open Meetings Act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"362156\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/377/183/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That is a far cry from what happened in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The trial court found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   the only credible evidence presented at the time of trial on the issue of whether [Bill 12-0152] was addressed at the meeting shows that members of the City Council engaged in no discussion of the Bill at [the] October 24, 2016 luncheon. Thus, [appellant's] allegation that the deliberative process was a part of the lunch meeting is simply unsubstantiated by the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Appellant, who did not attend the luncheon, provided no evidence that Bill 12-0152 was discussed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Kunst testified that she was at the October 24 luncheon and that \"there was not any discussion of Transform Baltimore.\" She explained that during such luncheons, \"there's generally some presentation and group discussions,\" but \"there was no official or formal conversation among the group of Council members or members of the public about Transform Baltimore that day.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   When asked if there could have been informal discussions, she conceded, \"I would suppose so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The circuit court found that \"the only credible evidence presented\" at trial showed that \"members of the City Council engaged in no discussion of [Bill 12-0152]\" at the October 24, 2016 luncheon. That finding is not clearly erroneous. The court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   [Appellant] failed to produce any evidence to support [her] claim that [the City] committed any actionable violation of the Open Meetings Act. While the process was not perfect in that errors in the process necessitated corrective legislation, there is no indication that the errors were the result of anything more than human error. That there may have been error in the zoning map that led to a need for corrective action does not give rise to a cause of action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   We understand this to mean that there was no willful violation of the Act. And, we agree that the violations related to the luncheon do not rise to the level of a willful violation that would permit voiding the legislation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GP \u00a7 3-401(d)(4). But that does not mean that some \"other appropriate relief\" cannot be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GP \u00a7 3-401(d)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   On appeal, appellant has requested a remand to the circuit court for it to consider other appropriate relief. In her petition for enforcement of the Act, she requested, among other things, that the circuit court award her reasonable counsel fees and other litigation expenses. The record indicates that the issue of counsel fees and litigation expenses was not addressed by the circuit court, presumably because it found no \"actionable violation.\" To the extent that the trial court may have considered only a \"willful\" violation to be actionable, a finding of willfulness would not be necessary to an award of counsel fees and litigation expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   GP \u00a7 3-401(d)(5) provides that, as part of its judgment, a court may \"assess against any party reasonable counsel fees and other litigation expenses that the party who prevails in the action incurred.\" To be sure, appellant's primary goal was to have Bill 12-0152 declared void based on a\n   willful violation of the Act, but that is not the sole measure of success in litigating a violation of the Act. As the Court of Appeals, interpreting an earlier version of the statute, has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   In light of the Act's goals and purpose ... we interpret the qualifier \"prevails\" as being determinable according to the parties' respective success litigating the seminal Open Meetings Act violation claim, regardless of the specific remedies sought, or whether any or all of those remedies are achieved. To conclude otherwise that the non-governmental party qualifies as a \"prevailing\" party only if that party obtains an injunction, a declaration of invalidity of the legislative act, or achieves other remedies following establishment of the merits of its foundational claim seems to us to run counter to the intent of the Act[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <em>\n    Armstrong v.

A quorum is \"a majority of the members of a public body; or the number of members that the law requires.\" GP \u00a7 3-101(k). At these luncheons, a quorum of the Council may be present, and, even if not intended, \"public business\" may be \"consider[ed] or transact[ed].\" Whether or not the Council considered these luncheons to be meetings under the Open Meetings Act (the\n    <em>\n     CLUB\n    </em>\n    Court did, and the City does not argue that they are not subject to the Act; for the purposes of this opinion, we will assume that they are), they present concerns. The City Solicitor, at oral argument, indicated-wisely in our view-that these luncheons are no longer held. Whether this case played a part in that decision was not stated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-232\">\n    Based on Ms. Kunst's testimony, the October 24 luncheon was not held in the Reeves Conference Room, but rather in the Mayor's executive conference room on the second floor of City Hall.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-233\">\n    On appeal, the City does not expressly address appellant's argument that the notice did not satisfy the notice requirements of GP \u00a7 3-302(b).
