Patrowicz and Deborah Patrowicz.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the defendant challenges the court's (1) denial of his request for a continuance following the close of the plaintiffs' case-in-chief and (2) determinations with respect to his statute of frauds defense. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court found the following relevant facts. The plaintiffs are husband and wife, who jointly own a twenty-six acre parcel of land in Thompson. After retiring from a career as a millwright, Richard began operating a small forestry business on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2012 or 2013, a mutual friend introduced the plaintiffs to the defendant. At that time, the defendant resided in the town of Pomfret, where zoning regulations prohibited the defendant from parking log trucks and other equipment on his residential property. The plaintiffs met with the defendant, and the parties subsequently reached an agreement, under which the defendant was permitted to store his commercial logging equipment on the plaintiffs' property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As the court found, the plaintiffs learned \"[i]n short order ... that zoning compliance was not the defendant's only problem. His equipment was in need of repairs or replacement, and at times his cash flow was insufficient to afford payment of his monthly home mortgage and other bills. [The defendant] turned to the plaintiffs for assistance.\" The court further found that the plaintiffs subsequently made a series of loans to the defendant, all with the expectation of repayment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As Richard testified at trial, the plaintiffs entered into\n   a \"verbal agreement\" with the defendant on the basis of his \"guarantee\" that he would fully repay those loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When the defendant failed to repay those loans, the plaintiffs commenced this breach of contract action in December, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his answer, the defendant denied the material allegations of the plaintiffs' complaint, including the allegation that he had promised to repay the loans in question. The defendant also asserted five special defenses, only one of which is relevant to this appeal. In his second special defense, the defendant alleged that the breach of contract count was barred by the statute of frauds set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-550.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant filed numerous motions with the trial court over the next thirteen months, including\n   a motion to dismiss, a motion for summary judgment, a motion for a default judgment, an \"emergency motion for discovery,\" a motion to remove the plaintiffs' legal counsel, and a motion in limine, all of which were denied by the court.\n   A court trial was held on March 10, 2017. In their case-in-chief, the plaintiffs offered the testimony of Richard, who was subject to lengthy cross and recross-examination by the self-represented defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the plaintiffs introduced, and the court admitted, into evidence various financial documents, including purchase receipts, credit card statements, and copies of cancelled checks from the plaintiffs made payable to and signed by the defendant. Also admitted into evidence was a promissory note executed on October 7, 2013, regarding the defendant's purchase of a log truck for $ 8000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant's case-in-chief consisted of additional testimony from Richard and six documents that were admitted into evidence as full exhibits. In his cross-examination of Richard during the plaintiffs' case-in-chief and his direct examination of Richard as part of his defense, the defendant repeatedly attempted to offer contrasting statements of fact in response to Richard's\n   testimony. Each time, the court advised the defendant that such statements were improper and clarified that the defendant was free to offer such evidence during his own testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant nonetheless declined to testify as a witness at trial. For that reason, when the defendant attempted to introduce his own affidavit into evidence during his case-in-chief, the court denied that request. As the court stated, \"I'm not [going to] allow ... your affidavit when you don't want to testify and be subject to cross-examination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In its subsequent memorandum of decision, the court found the defendant in breach of contract, stating: \"Although the defendant, who represented himself, denied virtually all the essential allegations of the complaint, he declined to testify. When he attempted (frequently) to offer evidence in his role as counsel, and not under oath, the court directed him to hold that information until he was sworn. At that time he could have expounded at length upon his version of the facts. He expressly declined to take advantage of that opportunity. Even to the extent that his arguments and objections could be credited, however, they did not undercut [Richard's] narrative of steady cash transfers\n   to [the defendant] in varying amounts over a considerable period, without repayment. At best, they reflect a hazy suggestion on their recipient's part that all these transfers were a gift. In support of this contention [the defendant] offered no evidence whatsoever.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"This court had the opportunity to observe [Richard] throughout approximately five hours of testimony and\n   cross-examination. While he cannot be described as razor-sharp in his recollection, he is generally credible and, in the details to which he testified, there was substantial correspondence between his testimony and the [documents that the plaintiffs] submitted [into evidence]. The court finds that the plaintiffs have proven by a preponderance of the evidence that they made loans to the defendant totaling $ 48,518.66, of which he has repaid a mere $ 350. That leaves $ 48,168.66 due and owing.\" The court also rejected all five special defenses raised by the defendant. The court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in the amount of $ 48,168.66, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendant first claims that the court abused its discretion in denying his request for a continuance following the close of the plaintiffs' case-in-chief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to the defendant's claim. Trial commenced on March 10, 2017, with the presentation of the plaintiffs' case-in-chief. Early in Richard's testimony on direct examination, the defendant objected; in so doing, he sought to offer evidence to rebut Richard's testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the court over-ruled that objection, a brief colloquy ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"The Defendant: Excuse me? Did you just say-swear at me?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"[Deborah]: Yeah, I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"The Court: All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"[Deborah]: I'm sorry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"The Court: I'm going to-okay. [Deborah] is leaving the courtroom. That's probably going to solve the problem. I'll put on the record [that] there was an exchange of words between her and the defendant, but I think her leaving has resolved it.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The plaintiffs' counsel then continued his direct examination of Richard, followed by cross-examination by the defendant. There is no indication in the record before us that Deborah ever reentered the courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When Richard's testimony concluded, the plaintiffs rested their case-in-chief. The court at that time informed the defendant that \"now it's your opportunity to testify or to call any other witnesses on your behalf.\" The defendant then stated that he wanted to call Deborah as his first witness. Noting that Deborah was not present in the courtroom, the court asked the defendant if he had served a subpoena on her. The defendant did not answer that query and instead argued that he was not required to do so under Connecticut law because Deborah was a party to the proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, the court explained that \"she's a plaintiff, but she's not present so she's not required to be here unless you've\n   subpoenaed her.... [Y]ou have the right ... to have her under subpoena. But if you haven't issued a subpoena to her, she's not required to be here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The defendant then requested a continuance to subpoena Deborah, which the court denied. The defendant nonetheless proceeded to argue that her testimony was \"key to [his] case,\" without making any detailed proffer as to the nature of Deborah's expected testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Contra\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gauthier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6767211\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/140/69/#p73\">\n    140 Conn. App. 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 73,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20A.3d%20849\">\n    57 A.3d 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%20907\">\n    308 Conn. 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20A.3d%201097\">\n    61 A.3d 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). The court again reminded the defendant that \"[Deborah is] not here and you don't have any ... way of compelling her to be here yet and I'm not recessing the trial to allow a subpoena to be sent out.... [M]aybe you've been taken by surprise, but it's not an unfair or illegal surprise. It's the kind of thing that attorneys would anticipate that if they want to have a person here who's a hostile witness, that they might have them under subpoena.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Undaunted, the defendant asked the court to explain why it would not permit him to seek a trial subpoena at that time. The court at that time reminded the defendant that the case had been scheduled for one day. When the defendant asked why the court was insistent on \"holding [him] to one day,\" the court explained that it had \"other business [that is] scheduled. Courts always have other business [that is] scheduled.... You don't make the schedule up at your convenience.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The court asked the defendant if any of the other witnesses named in his trial management report were present and ready to testify. When the defendant conceded that they were not, the court asked why they were\n   not present, noting that \"[i]t's trial day.\" The defendant responded: \"Because I knew that [the plaintiffs' counsel] was going to put his trial on first-his case on first.... And I didn't think that we would get that far at this point to be honest with you.\" The court then asked the defendant if he could procure any of those witnesses in the next twenty minutes, and the following colloquy transpired:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"The Defendant: They weren't asked to answer to the complaint, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"The Court: So you're-you're trifling with me. You've listed them as witnesses, today is the trial date, it's 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and you're telling me none-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"The Defendant: Is there a point of law that I'm-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"The Court: -of them are available?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"The Defendant: -missing tremendously here?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"The Court: Pardon me?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"The Defendant: Is there a point of law that I'm just missing?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \"The Court: [Yes.] The point of law is that when you have a trial, you come to court prepared to put the case on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"The Defendant: I am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"The Court: Oh, no, you're not. You've listed nine witnesses. One of them is present; the other eight are not. Are you ready to proceed? Can you get any of these people here in the next twenty minutes?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"The Defendant: I don't think so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"The Court: Then I don't think you're ready to proceed.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The defendant then opined that it was unfair that the court was \"prohibiting [him] from examining somebody that showed up earlier today ....\" In response, the court stated: \"I'm not prohibiting you. I'm telling ... you [that] you haven't done what it takes to get that person here\" by way of subpoena. To that, the defendant replied: \"That's none of the court's business. That's not my problem.\" The court then stated: \"It absolutely is my business when [she is] not present and you want to call her. [There is] no subpoena. I cannot force her to be here absent a subpoena that you've served on her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The court again reminded the defendant that he was free to testify on his own behalf to contradict Richard's testimony, to which the defendant replied, \"I'm not going to take the witness stand ... if that's what you're asking.\" The defendant then called Richard as a witness, who was questioned for an additional two hours. When Richard's testimony concluded, the defendant rested his case. The plaintiffs' counsel then indicated that he had no rebuttal to present, and the evidence was closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly denied his request for a continuance of the trial in order to subpoena Deborah. \"[T]he determination of whether to grant a request for a continuance is within the discretion of the trial court, and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.... A reviewing court is bound by the principle that [e]very reasonable presumption in favor of the proper exercise of the trial court's discretion will be made.... To prove an abuse of discretion, an appellant must show that the trial court's denial of a request for a continuance was arbitrary.... There are no mechanical tests for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process. The answer must be found in the circumstances present in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time\n   the request is denied.... In addition, we consistently have acknowledged that [o]ur role as an appellate court is not to substitute our judgment for that of a trial court that has chosen one of many reasonable alternatives.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8457463\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/268/351/#p378\">\n    268 Conn. 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 378,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=844%20A.2d%20191\">\n    844 A.2d 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) ; accord\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12493560\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/180/882/#p473\">\n    328 Conn. 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 473,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12493560\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/180/882/#p473\">\n    180 A.3d 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) (reviewing court must determine whether trial court's denial of continuance request was arbitrary or unreasonable).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In the present case, the defendant did not raise his request for a continuance of the trial in order to subpoena Deborah until after the plaintiffs had concluded their case-in-chief. It is well established that \"[o]nce a trial has begun ... a defendant's right to due process [does not entitle] him to a continuance upon demand.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1325892\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/228/234/#p239\">\n    228 Conn. 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=636%20A.2d%20760\">\n    636 A.2d 760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). Rather, the appellate courts of this state are \"especially hesitant to find an abuse of discretion\n   where the court has denied a motion for continuance made on the day of trial\";\n   <em>\n    Thode\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Thode\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"679030\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/190/694/#p697\">\n    190 Conn. 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 697,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=462%20A.2d%204\">\n    462 A.2d 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983) ; and \"where the request for continuance comes after the plaintiff has rested his case.\"\n   <em>\n    Burke\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ruggerio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"751334\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/24/700/#p706\">\n    24 Conn.

The belated nature of the defendant's continuance request militates against a conclusion that the court abused its discretion in denying that request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Furthermore, the aforementioned colloquy indicates that the court was mindful of its obligation to manage its caseflow when it denied the defendant's midtrial continuance request. As our Supreme Court has emphasized, \"[i]n order to fulfill our responsibility of dispensing justice we in the judiciary must adopt an effective system of caseflow management.... [I]t is the responsibility of the court ... when necessary, to enforce compliance with such standards. Our judicial\n   system cannot be controlled by the litigants ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Appellate Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20759\">\n    320 Conn. 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 773,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.3d%201198\">\n    136 A.3d 1198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).

The court expressly adhered to that maxim in denying the defendant's continuance request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   It also is significant that the case had been scheduled for one day of trial. At the outset of his case-in-chief, the defendant nonetheless acknowledged that he had no other witnesses available to testify and candidly confessed that he \"didn't think that we would get that far at this point to be honest with you.\" On that basis, the court reasonably could have construed the defendant's continuance request as dilatory in nature. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Great Country Bank\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pastore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"72606\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/241/423/#p437\">\n    241 Conn. 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 437,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=696%20A.2d%201254\">\n    696 A.2d 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997) (because \"the motion for a continuance was merely a dilatory tactic ... the trial court acted well within its discretionary authority to deny the motion\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In this regard, we note that the defendant, although self-represented, previously had filed an application for the issuance of a subpoena in this very case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   yet did not do so with respect to Deborah despite listing her as a witness on his trial management report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant's failure to subpoena Deborah in a timely manner\n   further informs our consideration of whether the court abused its discretion in denying his continuance request.

On the particular circumstances of this case, we cannot say that the court's denial of the defendant's midtrial request for a continuance in order to subpoena Deborah was either arbitrary or unreasonable.
