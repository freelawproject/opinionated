Town of Cape Elizabeth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12322776\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/169/396/\">\n    2017 ME 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12322776\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/169/396/\">\n    169 A.3d 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b63] Cape Shore owns a parcel of land that abuts a parcel owned by Alan and Mara DeGeorge. In May of 2017, the DeGeorges applied to the Cape Elizabeth Zoning Board of Appeals for permission to raze an existing house located on their property and to build a new one. The house they wanted to remove was a nonconforming structure,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Cape Elizabeth, Me., Zoning Ordinance \u00a7 19-1-3 (Nov. 5, 2016) (defining nonconforming building), and was located within Cape Elizabeth's Shoreland Performance Overlay District (SPOD),\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12322776\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/169/396/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19-6-11(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b64] Later that month, the ZBA conducted a hearing on the DeGeorges' application. At the hearing, the DeGeorges presented evidence that the replacement house would be within the footprint of the existing building but would include a new, partial third story that would increase the existing building's elevation by seven feet, to approximately thirty feet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Testifying at the hearing as an abutting property owner, Cape Shore asserted that because the DeGeorges sought to replace a nonconforming building located within the SPOD with a new structure that was larger in some respects, the ZBA was required to consider the effect that the proposed construction would have on views,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12322776\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/169/396/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19-4-4(B)(1) to (3). On that basis, Cape Shore opposed the DeGeorges' application because, it contended, the increased height\n   of the proposed structure would \"greatly affect\" its views, including its view of the water. At the conclusion of the hearing, the ZBA unanimously approved the DeGeorges' application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b65] Following the issuance of the ZBA's decision, Cape Shore filed what became a three-count complaint against the Town of Cape Elizabeth and the DeGeorges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Count 1 was a request for judicial review of the ZBA's approval of the DeGeorges' application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R Civ. P. 80B. In Count 2, Cape Shore asserted an independent claim for a declaratory judgment that section 19-6-11(E)(2) of the Cape Elizabeth Zoning Ordinance, which provides a thirty-five-foot height restriction for expansions of nonconforming buildings within the SPOD, is preempted by a provision of the state's Mandatory Shoreland Zoning Act (MSZA), 38 M.R.S. \u00a7 439-A(4)(C)(1) (2018), which, Cape Shore contends, restricts the expansion of nonconforming structures within seventy-five feet of the shore to twenty-feet high or the height of the existing building. Count 3 of Cape Shore's complaint asserted a tort claim against the DeGeorges for trespass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b66] The DeGeorges filed a motion to dismiss the claim for a declaratory judgment in Count 2 as duplicative of the Rule 80B appeal in Count 1 because the relief sought in Count 2 \"would be available as part of the direct review under 80B, ... [and therefore] 80B provides the exclusive method of review.\" The DeGeorges also moved for the court to dismiss Count 3, arguing that a claim for trespass is not an independent claim that may be joined with a Rule 80B appeal,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   M.R. Civ. P. 80B(i). Over Cape Shore's objection, the court granted the DeGeorges' motion and dismissed Count 2 as duplicative of Count 1. The court also granted the DeGeorges' motion to dismiss Count 3, leaving only Cape Shore's Rule 80B appeal of the ZBA's decision to be adjudicated. In a separate order issued later, the court affirmed the ZBA's decision to approve the DeGeorges' application and entered judgment against Cape Shore on Count 1. Cape Shore filed a timely notice of appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   14 M.R.S. \u00a7 1851 (2018) ; M.R. Civ. P. 80B(n) ; M.R. App. P. 2B(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b67] Cape Shore appeals only the court's dismissal of its independent claim for declaratory judgment in Count 2, where the court acted in its capacity as a trial court and not in an intermediate appellate capacity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker's Table, Inc. v.

Civ. P. 80B(i).

That claim, however, was not anticipatory. Rather, it was presented in the same factual context as the Rule 80B aspect of the complaint, namely, the DeGeorges' application with supporting documents and the record already created at\n   the ZBA hearing. Further, in the claim for a declaratory judgment, Cape Shore sought action by the court to \"invalidate[ ] the DeGeorges' ZBA approval\" on the basis of state law, which in effect was the same relief that Cape Shore requested in its Rule 80B appeal. Consequently, because Cape Shore's claim for declaratory relief was not independent from its Rule 80B appeal, the court's dismissal of Cape Shore's claim for declaratory judgment as duplicative was not an abuse of its discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8199645\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/960/1196/\">\n    2008 ME 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8199645\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/960/1196/\">\n    960 A.2d 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The entry is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Judgment affirmed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The minutes of the hearing on the DeGeorges' application show that a representative of the DeGeorges told the ZBA that \"the height ... increases seven feet for the middle third\" of the proposed structure and that he \"believed the elevation [of the proposed structure] to be 30 feet.\" The ZBA found that the height of the new house would be more than thirty feet but less than the thirty-five-foot maximum height allowed by the ordinance.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Cape Elizabeth, Me., Zoning Ordinance \u00a7 19-6-11(E)(2) (Nov. 5, 2016).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Cape Shore's original complaint contained a single count, which alleged that the decision of the ZBA to approve the DeGeorges' application was \"arbitrary and capricious, was erroneous as a matter of law, was not based on substantial evidence in the record, [and] constitutes an abuse of discretion\"-in other words, grounds typically associated with a Rule 80B appeal.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Wolfram v.

Cape Shore subsequently filed a brief pursuant to Rule 80B(g) in which it contended that the ZBA's factual findings were inadequate for judicial review and that the ZBA abused its discretion by approving the DeGeorges' proposal \"despite the significant impact on views.\" On the Town's unopposed motion, the court remanded the case to the ZBA for more explicit findings of fact. After the ZBA issued additional factual findings, Cape Shore filed an amended complaint containing the three separate counts described in the text.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Cape Shore has waived any claim of error as to the judgment on its Rule 80B appeal in Count 1 of the amended complaint.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dragomir v.

Any such failure to raise that issue, however, was not the reason why the court dismissed Count 2; the court made clear that the basis for its order was the duplicative nature of Count 2. The failure to preserve that statutory challenge during the municipal proceeding would bear only on whether, based on the record and arguments presented to the ZBA, the ZBA's decision to grant the DeGeorges' application was erroneous. As we note in the text,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 7, Cape Shore has not argued here that the court erred by affirming the ZBA's decision to grant the application, and, in any event, based on the record before us, any such challenge would be unavailing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wolfram\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12319041\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/835/\">\n     2017 ME 114\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 7,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12319041\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/835/\">\n     163 A.3d 835\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (stating the standard of review for an appeal brought pursuant to M.R.
