We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On February 17, 2006, a jury convicted Appellant of the murder of Fernando Rodriguez and related charges. During trial, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of two identification witnesses, Alexis Gomez and Marilyn Colon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gomez identified Appellant as the shooter of Rodriguez. Trial Court Opinion, filed October 30, 2006, at 12 (citing N.T., 10/12/2005, at 193-94).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gomez noted Appellant's \"work gloves.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (citing N.T., 10/12/2005, at 198-99).

Colon explained that she had a clear view of Appellant's uncovered face for about five minutes and that a light shined directly onto Appellant, with a second light coming from a nearby building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In addition to these two identification witnesses, the Commonwealth also presented the testimony of April Velez, who testified that, prior to the killing, she heard Appellant planning to murder the victim and accompanied him to Home Depot \"to purchase gloves,\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 22 (citing N.T., 10/11/2005, at 175), and of Rashaan Washington, who testified that, after the killing, he heard Appellant admit to the murder.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 20 (citing N.T., 10/12/2005, at 109). Sergeant Matthew Stash of the Wilkes-Barre Police Department testified that, when Appellant was arrested, the murder weapon was in his possession. N.T., 10/14/2005, at 135. No character witnesses were called on behalf of Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant was convicted of murder of the first degree and related charges and sentenced to life imprisonment, and this Court affirmed his judgment of sentence. On March 25, 2009, Appellant,\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , timely filed a PCRA petition. Appellant's appointed PCRA counsel then filed an amended PCRA petition contending that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to file a petition for allowance of appeal to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and requesting that his right to file\n   such a petition be reinstated\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   . The PCRA court dismissed Appellant's PCRA petition without a hearing. PCRA Court Opinion, filed July 28, 2010, at 1.

Appellant argued that he suffered prejudice due to trial counsel's failure to call character witnesses, because calling such witnesses \"would have been consistent with trial counsel's strategy\" and \"would have made his defense of mistaken identity more believable, by portraying [Appellant] as a non-violent man.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 4, 2017, the PCRA court dismissed Appellant's petition.

According to Pa.R.E. 404(a)(2)(A), \"a defendant may offer evidence of the defendant's pertinent trait[.]\" The official comment to Pa.R.E. 404 further clarifies that subsection (a)(2)(A) \"allows the defendant to 'put his character in issue,' usually by calling character witnesses to testify to his good reputation for a law-abiding disposition, or other pertinent trait of character.\" Cmt. to Pa.R.E. 404. Pursuant to Pa.R.E. 405(a) : \"When evidence of a person's character or character trait is admissible, it may be proved by testimony about the person's reputation. Testimony about the witness's opinion as to the character or character trait of the person is not admissible.\" This Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Evidence of good character offered by a defendant in a criminal prosecution must be limited to his general reputation for the particular trait or traits of character involved in the commission of the crime charged. Such evidence must relate to a period at or about the time the offense was committed and must be established by testimony of witnesses as to the community opinion of the individual in question, not through specific acts or mere rumor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Amended PCRA Petition, 4/16/2016, App. A. Therefore, the proposed testimony\n   would not comply with the requirement of Pa.R.E. 404(a)(2)(A) that only evidence of a \"defendant's pertinent trait\" may be admitted as character evidence. Additionally, none of the affidavits refer to the potential character witnesses' ability to testify to Appellant's \"reputation,\" Amended PCRA Petition, 4/16/2016, App. A; only reputation evidence may be used to prove character, not the individual's opinion of the Appellant's character.

In his brief to this Court, Appellant contends that the testimony of character witnesses would have undermined the credibility of Gomez, Colon, Washington, and Velez and that he hence was prejudiced by trial counsel's failure to call character witnesses. Appellant's Brief at 28-36. However, in his pleading before the PCRA court, Appellant only argued that character witnesses would have aided his defense of mistaken identification. Objection, 2/16/2017, at 5, 9. \"Issues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\" Pa.R.A.P. 302(a). We will therefore only consider the claim raised in the PCRA court -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether character witnesses could have undermined Gomez's and Colon's identification testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Pursuant to our review of the record, we conclude that both Gomez's and Colon's identifications of Appellant were so strong that character witness testimony would have been insufficient to cast doubt on their credibility and veracity. Both Gomez and Colon testified that they had clear, well-lighted views of Appellant and that they observed him for about five minutes. Trial Court Opinion, filed October 30, 2006, at 10-13, 15. Colon also testified that she had looked down on Appellant from a second-story, large bay window and that Appellant's face was uncovered. The inclusion of character witness testimony would not have altered the jury's credibility determination and, thus, the outcome of the trial; hence, Appellant was not prejudiced by trial counsel's failure to call character witnesses at trial. Accordingly, trial counsel cannot be considered ineffective for this reason.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Treiber\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847009,12173996\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/121/435/\">\n    121 A.3d at 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The current matter can therefore be distinguished from the two cases,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Carter\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Luther\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , relied upon by Appellant in his brief, Appellant's Brief at 23, because, based upon the facts in both those cases, this Court concluded that there was a likelihood that, had character witnesses been introduced, the outcome of trial may have been different.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Carter\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"901230\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/409/184/\">\n    597 A.2d at 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (character evidence \"would not have been inconsistent with the trial strategy of alibi which counsel pursued at trial and, indeed, may have bolstered appellant's alibi defense\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; \"trial counsel's failure to inform appellant of that option may have deprived appellant of an available defense having substantial potential for success\");\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Luther\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89522\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/317/41/\">\n    463 A.2d at 1080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In a case where virtually the only issue is the credibility of the witness for the Commonwealth versus that of the defendant, failure to explore all available alternatives to assure that the jury heard the testimony of a known witness who might be capable of casting doubt upon the truthfulness of the Commonwealth witness is ineffective assistance of counsel.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As Appellant is not entitled to PCRA relief on his second challenge, he is likewise\n   not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on that claim.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Trial Court Opinion, filed October 30, 2006, at 10-13, 15, 22.
