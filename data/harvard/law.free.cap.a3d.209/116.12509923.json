Underlying Federal Case-\n   <em>\n    Packgen v. Covalence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b64] In 2008, Packgen retained Bernstein Shur to prosecute a defective-products claim against Covalence Specialty Coatings, LLC, and Berry Plastics Corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b65] On May 29, 2008, Bernstein Shur sent a letter to Covalence \"to provide notice of [Packgen's] claim against Covalence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the letter was signed by a Bernstein Shur attorney, it did not set forth the cause of action\n   <em>\n    under oath\n   </em>\n   as is required by 14 M.R.S. \u00a7 1602-B(5) (2018). Bernstein Shur did not notice the missing oath, nor did it inform Packgen that a \"proper notice of claim [was required] to start the accrual of prejudgment interest\" or warn Packgen of \"the adverse consequences of failing to serve such a notice\" or the need to \"promptly file suit ... in order to protect Packgen's prejudgment interest rights.\" In the three years that followed, Bernstein Shur \"made no attempt to serve a valid notice of claim that complied with section 1602-B,\" \"failed to file suit or otherwise diligently pursue the case,\" and \"failed to keep Packgen adequately informed about the status of its case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b66] In 2011, Packgen retained new counsel and sued Covalence and Berry Plastics in the United States District Court for the District of Maine. On November 13, 2015, a jury rendered a verdict in favor of Packgen in the amount of $ 7,206,646.30, plus interest as allowed by law. Packgen filed an amended motion to alter or amend the judgment to allow post-judgment interest to accrue from May 29, 2008, the date that Covalence purportedly received Bernstein Shur's letter on behalf of Packgen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b67] On December 11, 2015, while the parties were awaiting the court's decision on the amended motion, Packgen and Bernstein Shur \"entered into a tolling agreement pursuant to which any and all legal defenses based on the passage of time and any limitations periods applicable to any claim or cause of action Packgen may possess against [Bernstein Shur] arising out of [Bernstein Shur's] representation of Packgen on claims against [Covalence] and other responsible parties ... were tolled and would be deemed suspended from running as of December 11, 2015.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b68] On March 7, 2016, the federal court (\n   <em>\n    Torresen, J.\n   </em>\n   ) denied Packgen's motion to alter or amend the judgment because Bernstein Shur's letter to Covalence failed to comply with the oath requirement in 14 M.R.S. \u00a7 1602-B(5) and therefore did not constitute a valid notice of claim. As a result, Packgen was permitted to recover prejudgment interest dating only from the filing of the complaint in 2011 rather than from May 29, 2008, the date on which Bernstein Shur served the unsworn notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B. Packgen's Claim Against Bernstein Shur\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b69] On May 23, 2017, Packgen filed a complaint against Bernstein Shur in the Superior Court alleging that the law firm's failure to send a notice that complied with the requirements of section 1602-B caused Packgen to sustain an economic loss in the amount of $ 2,510,293.84-the difference between the prejudgment interest actually awarded by the federal court and the prejudgment interest that would have been awarded but for Bernstein Shur's negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b610] Bernstein Shur responded with a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that Packgen's claims were barred by the six-year statutes of limitations for civil actions, 14 M.R.S. \u00a7 752, and attorney malpractice actions, 14 M.R.S. \u00a7 753-B. Bernstein Shur argued that the act giving rise to Packgen's alleged injury-the basis for Packgen's cause of action against it-occurred on May 29, 2008, the date the defective notice was sent to Covalence, and therefore the statute of limitations expired on May 29, 2014, three years before Packgen filed its complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b611] Packgen then filed an amended complaint, asserting that the December 2015 tolling agreement suspended the statute of limitations. Bernstein Shur countered in an amended motion to dismiss that the tolling agreement only saved claims that had not already expired. Bernstein Shur argued that, because the letter was sent on May 29, 2008, the suit alleging negligence in that letter was barred by the statute of limitations regardless of the tolling agreement, which only preserved claims accruing after December 11, 2009, six years prior to the signing of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b612] The court concluded that section 753-B(1) barred Packgen's claim and granted Bernstein Shur's motion to dismiss the amended complaint \"as to any claim for loss of prejudgment interest prior to the filing of [Packgen's] federal complaint.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b613] The court noted that Packgen \"appear[ed] to argue that its claim is not limited to the loss of prejudgment interest because of [Bernstein Shur's] failure to diligently pursue the case and keep Packgen informed of its status constituted legal malpractice 'which caused additional damage to Packgen.' Packgen's amended complaint, however, in no way specifies what additional damage or losses were allegedly caused by [Bernstein Shur's] lack of diligence.\" (Citation omitted.) The court granted Packgen leave to file a motion to file an amended complaint if it alleged that Bernstein Shur committed professional negligence on or after December 11, 2009, that caused Packgen to incur financial losses other than the loss of prejudgment interest. Packgen did not file such a motion, and the court entered its final judgment dismissing the action on January 24, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b614] The court rejected Packgen's assertions that the doctrines of continuing representation and continuing negligence operate to save its claim from Bernstein Shur's statute of limitations defense because it determined that such a result would contravene the Legislature's intent in rejecting the discovery rule and adopting the six year statute of limitations in 14 M.R.S. \u00a7 753-B(1). Packgen timely appealed. M.R. App. P. 2B(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b615] Packgen argues that the court erred when it dismissed its claim as untimely because the court limited its analysis to Bernstein Shur's act of sending the defective notice of claim to Covalence on May 29, 2008. It is Packgen's position that Bernstein Shur committed actionable, negligent\n   omissions each day that it failed to send a valid notice or take other action in the case after December 11, 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A.

In\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   , we examined the plain language of 24 M.R.S. \u00a7 2902 (2018)-the medical malpractice statute of limitations-and relied, in part, on the rule of statutory construction in 1 M.R.S. \u00a7 71(9) (2018),\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   to determine that it was consonant with the plain meaning of the statute \"to define the term 'act or omission'\n   <em>\n    as used in section 2902\n   </em>\n   as referring to either a single act or omission, or a series of related acts or omissions that proximately cause a harm.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7279921\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/26/806/\">\n    2011 ME 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 27-28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7279921\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/26/806/\">\n    26 A.3d 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). As a result, we held,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   pursuant to section 2902, a plaintiff may bring a single action alleging continuing negligent treatment that arises from two or more related acts or omissions by a single health care provider or practitioner where each act or omission deviated from the applicable standard of care and, to at least some demonstrable degree, proximately caused the harm complained of, as long as at least one of the alleged negligent acts or omissions occurred within three years of the notice of claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   [\u00b631] Packgen urges that this reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   should also be applied to claims\n   of legal malpractice under section 753-B because Bernstein Shur's ongoing failure to send a proper notice of claim, in combination with its failure to file suit and adequately advise Packgen up to the date of the termination of its representation in 2011, proximately caused the loss of the full amount of prejudgment interest to which Packgen was entitled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.

Here, the negligent action was singular-an isolated mistake severable from the remainder of Bernstein Shur's representation of Packgen-and substantially dissimilar from the ongoing treatment and annual testing in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   . We understand Packgen's argument that Bernstein Shur committed a new negligent omission each day it failed to provide a proper notice of claim or seek another remedy after May 29, 2008; however, we were clear in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   that where it is \"reasonably probable that one act or omission in a series of acts or omissions was the\n   <em>\n    sole\n   </em>\n   proximate cause of the injury complained of, a cause of action would accrue from the date of that act or omission, and not from the dates of any subsequent acts or omissions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. In this case, it is reasonably probable that the harm Packgen complains of occurred as a result of Bernstein Shur's alleged failure to meet the oath requirements for the notice of claim on May 29, 2008. As such, the continuing negligence doctrine is inappropriate in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   [\u00b634] Moreover, the applicability of the continuing negligence doctrine to the medical malpractice statute of limitations was based firmly \"on the language and authority of the Health Security Act,\" to which there are no analogous provisions in the attorney malpractice context.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. In\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   , we anchored our holding on two definitions particular to the Health Security Act: \"action for professional negligence\" and \"professional negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22 (citing 24 M.R.S. \u00a7 2502(6)-(7) (2018) ). These definitions provided the basis for our holding that the act or omission that triggers the statute of limitations could be a combination of several related acts or omissions, including acts or omissions outside the statute of limitations. The definitions relevant to title 24 specifically authorize the use of multiple acts or omissions to make out a claim of professional negligence; therefore, it was logical for us to conclude in the medical malpractice context that the precipitating event for a medical malpractice claim could be a series of related\n   events, the combination of which proximately caused the patient's injury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   24 M.R.S. \u00a7 2502(6)-(7).

Without similar authorizing language on which to draw, we are unable to conclude that the continuing negligence doctrine is applicable to claims for legal malpractice. Moreover, considering the particular language and history of section 753-B, it is clear that the application of the continuing negligence doctrine is foreclosed by the Legislature's intent to provide timely repose to claims against attorneys, as discussed above.\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11426865\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/809/622/\">\n    2002 ME 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11426865\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/809/622/\">\n    809 A.2d 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While it can be said that section 753-B, like any statute of limitations, provides an arbitrary cutoff after which a client's claim against his attorney is no longer viable, this was a deliberate choice the Legislature made, and we must defer to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   [\u00b636] Given the legislative history underpinning the adoption of the occurrence rule in section 752, the plain language of section 753-B regarding actions against attorneys, and the strict construction we apply to statutes of limitations, we conclude that the Legislature intended to limit the accrual of a cause of action for attorney negligence or malpractice to the \"act or omission giving rise to the injury\"-that is, the attorney's singular act or omission that proximately caused the harm to the client, 14 M.R.S. \u00a7 753-B, and not to the attorney's ongoing failure to correct that singular act or omission. In this case, the act giving rise to Packgen's alleged injury occurred on May 29, 2008, and Packgen's claim expired on May 29, 2014, six years after the service of the defective notice letter, and it is now time barred, 14 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 752, 753-B. We must effectuate the Legislature's language and we may not hold otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Myrick v.

First, in my view, the complaint sufficiently alleges that some negligent omissions occurred within the period of limitations, and so that part of Packgen's claim should survive for that reason alone. Second, the doctrine of continuing negligence, which we have adopted in cases involving medical negligence, should be applied to claims of legal malpractice and, at this very early phase of the case, entitles Packgen to pursue the entirety of its negligence claim. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   [\u00b638] The narrow issue presented here is the legal viability of Packgen's claim as pleaded in its amended complaint. The criterion for assessing the adequacy of a pleading is familiar and generous.

Packgen retained Bernstein Shur in 2008 \"to prosecute its legal claims\" arising from a commercial dispute. In late May of 2008, Bernstein Shur sent the prospective defendant a notice of claim, but the form of the notice was insufficient to trigger the accrual of prejudgment interest,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   14 M.R.S. \u00a7 1602-B(5) (2018). Then, over the course of the next three years, Bernstein Shur continuously \"failed to file suit,\" failed to serve the prospective defendant with a proper notice of claim, and failed to \"otherwise diligently pursue the case[,] which caused additional damage to Packgen.\" In 2011, Packgen terminated its relationship with Bernstein Shur and \"retained new counsel[,] who promptly brought suit on Packgen's behalf,\" resulting in a substantial money judgment for Packgen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   [\u00b640] Packgen and Bernstein Shur entered into a tolling agreement, which, as of December 11, 2015, stopped the clock that would determine the timeliness of any claim that Packgen might later assert against Bernstein Shur. And, in fact, in May of 2017, Packgen commenced this action. Because, as the parties agree, Packgen's claim against Bernstein Shur is subject to a six-year period of limitations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   14 M.R.S. \u00a7 752 (2018), the tolling agreement renders as timely any part of Packgen's claim that accrued on or after December 11, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   [\u00b641] The interpretation and application of two interrelated statutes are integral to this appeal. The first statute, 14 M.R.S. \u00a7 752, applies broadly and provides,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   All civil actions shall be commenced within 6 years after the cause of action accrues and not afterwards, except actions on a judgment or decree of any court of record of the United States, or of any state, or of a justice of the peace in this State, and except as otherwise specially provided.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The second, 14 M.R.S. \u00a7 753-B (2018), applies specifically to actions commenced against attorneys and states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   In actions alleging professional negligence, malpractice or breach of contract for legal service by a licensed attorney, the statute of limitations starts to run from the date of the act or omission giving rise to the injury, not from the discovery of the malpractice, negligence or breach of contract, except as provided in this section or as the statute of limitations may be suspended by other laws.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   [\u00b642] The facial reach of the six-year limitation period created by section 752 covers some, but not all, of the time that Bernstein Shur represented Packgen, which was from 2008 into 2011. Thus, in examining the timeliness of Packgen's claims, there are two different periods to be considered: (1) the period beginning December 11, 2009, which is the six-year period that ended with the effective date of the parties' tolling agreement; and (2) the period that predates December 11, 2009. Because the legal considerations differ as between these two timeframes, I address them separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   A. Allegations of Negligence Occurring On and After December 11, 2009\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   [\u00b643] As I note above, Packgen alleges that throughout the entire course of Bernstein Shur's representation of its interests, which extended until sometime in 2011-and includes more than one year within the period of limitations prescribed in section 752 -the firm was negligent in several different ways. Packgen's claim includes allegations, not only that Bernstein Shur was negligent by issuing the statutorily defective notice of claim, but also that the firm negligently failed to file suit on Packgen's underlying commercial claim, which also would have triggered the accrual of prejudgment interest arising from that claim. Thus, although the Court focuses exclusively on the Bernstein Shur's allegedly negligent act of issuing a deficient notice of claim in May of 2008, there is more to Packgen's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   [\u00b644] Although Bernstein Shur's issuance of the defective notice of claim is a single allegedly negligent\n   <em>\n    act\n   </em>\n   with an ascertainable date,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   the failure to commence an action altogether is an allegedly negligent\n   <em>\n    omission\n   </em>\n   -something that never happened at all. And from the allegations contained in the amended complaint, it is not possible to assign a date certain to an event that did not occur; that omission is temporally indeterminate within the period when Bernstein Shur represented Packgen. In other words, for purposes of determining whether the amended complaint is time-barred on its face, Packgen's allegation that Bernstein Shur committed legal malpractice by not filing suit does not inevitably lead to the conclusion that the alleged negligence associated with that omission necessarily falls entirely outside the period of limitations. The bones of Packgen's amended complaint are sufficient to encompass an assertion, which could only be fleshed out during the evidentiary phases of the case, that Bernstein Shur, in the exercise of due care, should have commenced the action in the commercial case on or after December 11, 2009. Based on this aspect of Packgen's claim alone, its amended complaint was not facially untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   [\u00b645] I also note that the trial court's order dismissing the complaint was actually provisional. While concluding that Packgen's claim was outside of the period of limitations, the court gave Packgen an opportunity to seek leave to further amend its amended complaint to allege damages other than those allegedly caused by the defective notice of claim sent in 2008. Although Packgen did not file any such motion, the absence of any supplemental filing by Packgen is inconsequential. In its amended complaint, Packgen had\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   alleged a sufficient basis-the failure to file suit, for example-on which Bernstein Shur could be determined liable based on negligent acts or omissions occurring directly within the six-year limitations period. Therefore, the court erred by requiring Packgen to do something more than it had\n   already done in order to avoid dismissal of its complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   [\u00b646] Because Packgen's amended complaint alleges negligence that occurred within the limitations period, which runs forward from December 11, 2009, I conclude that the court erred by dismissing that portion of Packgen's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   B. Allegations of Negligence Occurring Before December 11, 2009\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   [\u00b647] In contrast to Packgen's claim for negligence that occurred on or after December 11, 2009, its claim for negligent acts or omissions occurring before that date is time-barred pursuant to section 752\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   an appropriate legal mechanism brings that part of Packgen's claim back within the period of limitations. Packgen asserts that two such legal theories preclude the dismissal of those older aspects of its claim against Bernstein Shur: continuing representation and continuing negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   [\u00b648] I agree with the Court's conclusion that the mere continuation of an attorney's representation of a client on an ongoing matter extending into the limitations period does not preclude the statute of limitations from barring a claim based on a negligent act or omission that occurred outside of the limitation period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Court's Opinion at \u00b6\u00b6 25-29. We have reached that conclusion in the context of a medical malpractice claim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dickey v. Vermette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8199470\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/960/1178/\">\n    2008 ME 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 4-8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8199470\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/960/1178/\">\n    960 A.2d 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

In\n   <em>\n    Dickey\n   </em>\n   , we explained that the \"act or omission\" phraseology contained in 24 M.R.S. \u00a7 2902 (2018),\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   which is the statute of limitations for actions against health care providers and practitioners, does not permit time-barred claims to become timely simply because of an ongoing professional relationship between the medical provider and the patient.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8199470\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/960/1178/\">\n    2008 ME 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 7-8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8199470\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/960/1178/\">\n    960 A.2d 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That statutory language is identical to the \"act or omission\" language contained in section 753-B, which applies here. Therefore, our analysis in\n   <em>\n    Dickey\n   </em>\n   is fatal to Packgen's argument that Bernstein Shur's representation of its interests in the underlying matter within six years of the commencement of this action, by itself, precludes dismissal of the action as untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   [\u00b649] I part ways with the Court, however, when it concludes that this case does not allow for the application of a doctrine that is, in effect, a subsidiary of the continuing representation theory-namely, the continuing negligence doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   [\u00b650] As the Court correctly describes, the continuing negligence doctrine prevents the limitations clock from beginning to tick until the date of the last negligent occurrence that proximately causes injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Court's Opinion \u00b6 2 n.4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7279921\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/26/806/\">\n    2011 ME 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7279921\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/26/806/\">\n    26 A.3d 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The doctrine is a framework for viewing a series of actionable acts or omissions as an integrated whole that may be pursued in a single cause of action.

In other words, where at least one negligent act or omission that demonstrably and proximately contributed to the harm occurred within the period of limitations, but other related acts or omissions occurred outside the period of limitations, the entirety of the claim may be prosecuted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   [\u00b652] Our adoption of the continuing negligence doctrine in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   resulted from two separate analytical strands. The first draws on an examination of statutes that are specific to medical negligence claims. In particular, we noted that 24 M.R.S. \u00a7 2902 -the statute of limitations for \"actions for professional negligence\" against medical providers and practitioners-identifies the event giving rise to the claim as an \"act or omission\" but that the Health Security Act, of which section 2902 is a part, does not define the term.\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7279921\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/26/806/\">\n    2011 ME 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7279921\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/26/806/\">\n    26 A.3d 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Elsewhere, however, the Act defines \"professional negligence\" as encompassing the pluralized \"acts or omissions.\" 24 M.R.S. \u00a7 2502(7)(A)-(B) (2018). Partly on that basis, we concluded that these statutes reflect a legislative recognition that a single cause of action can arise from multiple acts or omissions that contribute to an overall harm.\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7279921\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/26/806/\">\n    2011 ME 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 23, 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7279921\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/26/806/\">\n    26 A.3d 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This recognition in turn supports the application of the continuing negligence\n   doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-24. But, because this portion of the discussion in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   rests on statutory provisions that do not extend to or have analogous counterparts in the statutes that govern legal malpractice claims, Packgen does not benefit from it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   [\u00b653] That is not true with respect to the second reason why we adopted the principle of continuing negligence in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   . Our second line of reasoning draws on both rules of statutory construction and on jurisprudential principles that are of more universal application and persuasively extend to this action for legal malpractice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   [\u00b654] The construction of the phrase \"act or omission\" was at issue in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   , just as it is here. As we discussed in that case, the Legislature has explicitly stated that \"[w]ords of the singular number may include the plural,\" 1 M.R.S. \u00a7 71(9) (2018), so the use of \"act or omission\"-presented in the singular-in section 2902 cannot properly be limited to each individual act or omission.\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7279921\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/26/806/\">\n    2011 ME 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 27-28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7279921\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/26/806/\">\n    26 A.3d 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, as we concluded, section 2902's \"plain meaning\"-the gold standard of statutory construction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schwartz v. Unemployment Ins. Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8436529\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/895/965/\">\n    2006 ME 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8436529\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/895/965/\">\n    895 A.2d 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   encompasses multiple acts and omissions.\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7279921\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/26/806/\">\n    2011 ME 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7279921\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/26/806/\">\n    26 A.3d 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This construction accommodates the legal principle that \"a single cause of action may arise from multiple acts or omissions even if each independent act or omission, viewed in isolation from the other acts or omissions, constitutes an independent deviation from the applicable standard of care.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Correspondingly, this construction avoids creating a separate cause of action based on each and every negligent act or omission arising from an ongoing professional relationship, which could be-or would need to be-pursued through splintered claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   [\u00b655] This part of\n   <em>\n    Baker's\n   </em>\n   analysis, which is sufficient to support its holding,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   carries over seamlessly to Packgen's legal malpractice claim against Bernstein Shur and the statutes that apply here. This is true with both the close examination in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   of the words in the phrase \"act or omission\" and our broader discussion in that case of principles governing the way causes of action are properly framed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   [\u00b656] First, as to the statutory language itself, Title 14, section 753-B contains language defining the event giving rise to Packgen's claim-an \"act or omission\"-that is identical to the language in 24 M.R.S. \u00a7 2902, which we analyzed in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   . There, we applied the rule of statutory construction providing that a word in a statute presented in the singular also includes\n   the plural, 1 M.R.S. \u00a7 71(9), a principle of construction that spans the entirety of Maine's statutory code and informs our construction of section 753-B just as much as it did our construction of 24 M.R.S. \u00a7 2902. Therefore, section 753-B must be read to encompass multiple acts or omissions to the extent that such multiple related occurrences may give rise to a single cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   [\u00b657] Second, and more broadly, the conceptual observations we made in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   apply with equal force in the present context. As a substantive legal principle, multiple acts or omissions that comprise individual deviations from the standard of care can combine to proximately cause a discrete harm and give rise to a single cause of action.\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7279921\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/26/806/\">\n    2011 ME 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7279921\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/26/806/\">\n    26 A.3d 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Relatedly, a plaintiff should not be required to litigate those separate negligent acts or omissions in a piecemeal manner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. These principles apply directly to claims for legal malpractice every bit as much as they do to claims for medical negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   [\u00b658] All of this-the dry process of statutory interpretation and a conceptual consideration of the nature of a professional negligence claim-demonstrates that, for many of the same reasons we stated in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   , the principle of continuing negligence is readily accommodated by sections 752 and 753-B in this legal malpractice action. I would therefore apply\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   's conclusion to this case and-to paraphrase the language in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   -hold that, when a single cause of action arises from an attorney's multiple acts or omissions while representing a client, and when the combination of those multiple acts or omissions proximately causes the alleged injury, the single resulting cause of action accrues on the date of the last act or omission that contributed to the alleged injury, because that is when the alleged negligence is complete.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7279921\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/26/806/\">\n    2011 ME 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7279921\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/26/806/\">\n    26 A.3d 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   [\u00b659] This statement of the continuing negligence doctrine also illuminates its limiting principle-that the claim will be time-barred if the last of the negligent acts or omissions that demonstrably and proximately contributed to the injury occurred outside of the period of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, if the case were to proceed on remand, as I believe it should, in order for Packgen to recover for negligent acts or omissions that occurred before December 11, 2009, Packgen would be required to demonstrate that at least one negligent act or omission that occurred on or\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   December 11, 2009, demonstrably and proximately contributed to the harm also caused by those earlier related acts or omissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   [\u00b660] Based on the amended complaint alone and without the benefit of a record, the Court is willing to jump to the conclusion that Packgen will be unable to present any evidence sufficient to meet this requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Court's Opinion \u00b6 33. There, the Court states that Packgen's claim arose from a single act, namely, the defective notice of claim sent in 2008, and that it is \"reasonably probable\" that Packgen's injury is attributable entirely to that act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. This is an inappropriately narrow reading of the amended complaint,\n   which alleges negligence that continued throughout the period of representation, from 2008 into 2011. As is demonstrated by the use of the phrase \"reasonably probable,\" the Court's assertion embodies a factual assessment that is wholly out of place in the procedural context where this case now stands.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Packgen's ability to present evidence to defeat Bernstein Shur's limitations defense remains to be seen-it is something that is impossible to determine until after Packgen has the opportunity to present evidence that will put substance on the bones of its amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   C. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   [\u00b661] For now, the only question before us is whether the allegations in Packgen's amended complaint make clear that the claim is time-barred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7363674\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/627/1010/#p1013\">\n    627 A.2d at 1013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In my view, the amended complaint withstands that facial review, particularly given the \"forgiving\" notice-pleading standard by which the sufficiency of a complaint is reviewed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Howe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6929419\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/95/79/\">\n    2014 ME 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6929419\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/95/79/\">\n    95 A.3d 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Packgen has alleged negligence within the period of limitations itself, through sometime in 2011 when Packgen terminated its relationship with the firm. Further, for purposes of the present pleading stage of the case, pursuant to the continuing negligence doctrine the allegations of Bernstein Shur's negligent acts or omissions occurring before December 11, 2009, can properly be treated as an integrated part of a claim that did not accrue until on or after December 11, 2009-within the period of limitations.

But even if-as the Court holds today-the doctrine of continuing negligence is unavailable, the amended complaint is still not untimely on its face because, as I explain in the text, it is impossible to assign a date outside of the period of limitations to a negligent omission in the form of failing to file suit.
