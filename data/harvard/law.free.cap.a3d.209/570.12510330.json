A hearing panel of the Professional Responsibility Board concluded that respondent, Glenn Robinson, Esq., violated several of the Vermont Rules of Professional Conduct-Rules 1.7, 4.3, 8.4(d), and 8.4(g)-based on his relationships with two former clients. The panel imposed a sanction suspending respondent from the practice of law for two years and placed several conditions on respondent's ability to resume practice. This Court ordered review of the hearing panel's decision, pursuant to Administrative Order 9, designating the Office of Disciplinary Counsel as appellant. A.O. 9 \u00a7 11(E). Disciplinary counsel argues that the panel erred in applying the presumptive standards for attorney discipline and asks this Court to modify the panel's sanction and disbar respondent. While accepting the recommended sanction, respondent argues that several of the panel's findings of fact were clearly erroneous, the panel incorrectly determined respondent acted knowingly in violating Rule 1.7, and the panel erred in concluding that respondent violated Rules 4.3, 8.4(d), and 8.4(g) and applying the standards for attorney discipline. We adopt the hearing panel's conclusions that respondent violated Rules 1.7, 4.3, and 8.4(g) of the Vermont Rules of Professional Conduct; reverse the panel's conclusion that respondent violated Rule 8.4(d); and conclude that respondent's actions warrant disbarment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Hearing Panel's Findings of Fact\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. The relevant facts as found by the hearing panel are as follows. Respondent was admitted to the Vermont bar and has practiced as a licensed attorney in Vermont since 1999. In 2005, respondent began\n   business as a solo practitioner in Newport, Vermont. Most of respondent's practice related to family, criminal, and probate law. During the time period at issue, from December 2010 until approximately April 2013, respondent provided legal services for several female clients relevant to this appeal-C.M., P.B., and A.P. Respondent later employed and engaged in sexual behavior with these former clients. The hearing panel concluded that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct based on his interactions with two of these individuals, C.M. and P.B. The hearing panel found no violations related to respondent's conduct with A.P. On appeal, we address whether the panel correctly concluded that respondent's conduct with C.M. and P.B. violated the Rules of Professional Conduct and, if so, what sanctions are appropriate. We do not consider the allegations with respect to A.P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A. Respondent's Conduct with C.M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3. Respondent represented C.M. in her divorce proceedings from December 2010 until June 2012. At the time, C.M. was a thirty-nine-year-old mother of five children who had recently separated from her husband of sixteen years. She had left the family farm and was living in a trailer in Newport Center, Vermont. Respondent engaged in a sexual relationship with C.M. from February 2011 until June 2012, while he was representing her in the divorce action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4. Prior to entering the sexual relationship with C.M., respondent discussed with C.M. whether he could ethically enter a sexual relationship with her while representing her in the divorce action, and he told her he believed he could do so. However, respondent did not request or receive a signed written waiver from C.M. acknowledging that she was aware of the risks of engaging in a sexual relationship with respondent while he represented her or authorizing him to do so. Respondent also took steps not to be seen with C.M. in the area of the state where he practiced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5. During the pendency of the divorce action, C.M. was under considerable financial strain; she struggled to make her monthly car and rent payments. C.M. paid respondent an initial \"retainer\" of approximately $ 2000 by cashing in a retirement account, but she stopped making monthly payments to respondent at some point over the course of his representation of her in the divorce proceedings. To alleviate C.M.'s financial burden, respondent made several offers to C.M. that she could stay with him at his condominium and hired C.M. as an employee of a tanning salon business that he owned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6. Respondent ended the relationship with C.M. very shortly after the final merits hearing in her divorce proceedings in June 2012. They had sexual relations on one occasion during the week following the divorce settlement and one final time in the fall of 2012. The panel found that C.M.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   believes-rightly or wrongly-that [r]espondent failed to devote sufficient time to representing her interests in the divorce proceedings; that he did not take sufficient actions to protect and advance her financial interests in the proceeding; that he misled her into agreeing to the final settlement; and that he abandoned her after convincing her to agree to a settlement in the divorce proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The panel further noted that C.M. \"felt that she was being abandoned by [r]espondent both personally and in connection with her expectations as to receiving ongoing support from [r]espondent on divorce-related issues going forward.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B. Respondent's Conduct with P.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7. In December 2011, P.B. contacted respondent's office seeking legal advice. Respondent assisted her in connection with several matters, including a pending criminal proceeding in which respondent helped P.B. obtain temporary relief from the conditions of release imposed at her arraignment. He did not charge P.B. for his legal services. In January 2012, respondent contacted P.B. and offered her a job as an administrative assistant at his law firm. At the time, P.B. was twenty-nine years old, living with her parents, and aspiring to gain admission to a training program to work as a border-patrol agent. Because P.B. did not have a college degree, she needed to demonstrate law-related employment for a minimum of one year to qualify for admission to the training program-employment with respondent appealed to her to satisfy that requirement, and she had an incentive to remain employed with respondent for at least one year. P.B. had no experience or training as an administrative assistant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8. P.B. suffers from mental-health issues. In 2005, P.B. was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Over the course of her treatment for these disorders, P.B. utilized a variety of coping mechanisms in response to exacerbation of her PTSD, which included, at times, self-harm via cutting behaviors, avoidance of social engagements, agoraphobia, withdrawal, and counterphobia-engaging in behavior that makes the individual feel threatened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9. P.B. began working for respondent in January 2012 and received her last paycheck in January 2013. Over the course of her employment, P.B. experienced various difficulties relating to respondent. Relevant to the panel's analysis and the issues on appeal are incidents where respondent tossed paperclips at P.B.'s cleavage, masturbated in her presence, and requested that she sign a contract in September 2012 indicating their relationship was \"mutually welcome\" and waiving any future claims against respondent. The panel's findings regarding these events are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10. The panel found that respondent encouraged a \"relaxed atmosphere\" at the office and often engaged in verbal banter, teasing, and flirtatious conduct with P.B. In April or May 2012, respondent's common practice of \"joking\" with P.B. escalated when he-on more than one occasion-threw paperclips at her in a manner that intentionally \"targeted her breasts and cleavage\" so that the paperclips would slip down her shirt and between her breasts. The panel found that, at various times throughout April and July 2012, P.B. told her psychiatrist \"that her boss was making unwanted advances towards her or otherwise causing her stress.\" The psychiatrist noted that P.B.'s PTSD symptoms \"surfaced\" and were \"being exacerbated\" due to the \"unwanted sexual advances from [respondent].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11. The panel made further findings that, in late July 2012, while respondent\n   and P.B. were together in the law office, an incident occurred during which, at respondent's request, P.B. unbuttoned her shirt, exposed her bra, and lowered her bra strap while respondent proceeded to masturbate to ejaculation in his pants. Respondent asked her to pull on his tie while he masturbated; P.B. did so. That evening, after the incident, P.B. went home and \"broke down\" in front of her mother while explaining what had happened with respondent. On August 7, 2012, P.B. sent an email to respondent stating that she felt disrespected and planned to stop coming to work due to respondent's actions. Respondent replied that he never intended to make P.B. uncomfortable and that he would be happy to speak with her about her concerns. Following this exchange, P.B. and respondent revisited signing a contract to outline the boundaries of their personal and professional relationships-an issue that had been developing for several months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12. The panel made the following findings regarding the contract agreement between P.B. and respondent. In May or early June 2012, respondent told his step-father about his interest in pursuing a romantic relationship with P.B. and was encouraged to \"get something in writing\" indicating that the relationship was consensual. Soon thereafter, respondent and P.B. participated in a conference call with respondent's step-brother, who is also an attorney. During the call, respondent asked his step-brother to draft an agreement reflecting that the relationship was \"mutual and welcoming\" and containing a release of any sexual-harassment or gender-discrimination claim, preventing P.B. from alleging either claim in the future. Respondent's stepbrother drafted the agreement entitled \"Notice of Intent to Engage in Mutually Welcomed Romantic Relationship and Waiver of Claims\" and provided it to respondent, who gave a copy of the agreement to P.B. Notably, the contract provided a waiver by P.B. of \"any and all\" state and federal law claims of sexual harassment or gender discrimination against respondent-apparently including future as well as past claims. The panel found that P.B. \"was confused and intimidated by the conference call, had a hard time following the discussion and understanding the issues, and did not understand the need for a written agreement.\" Neither party signed the agreement at this point; no further action was taken regarding the agreement until the fall of 2012, following the masturbation incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13. After the masturbation incident and email exchange between respondent and P.B., respondent asked his step-brother to revise the contract. In September 2012, respondent and P.B. discussed and signed the contract. No witnesses were present, and P.B. did not have an attorney. The panel found that P.B. \"believed from her discussion with respondent that they needed to sign the agreement to satisfy [r]espondent's father and that it was required of her to continue working for [r]espondent.\" The panel further found that \"[r]espondent did not advise [P.B.] to obtain independent legal advice with respect to the agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14. Other relevant facts found by the panel regarding the relationship between respondent and P.B. include the following. At some point during the fall of 2012, respondent began counseling, which P.B. perceived to have a positive effect on respondent. In December 2012 or January 2013, respondent began to indicate that he was displeased with P.B.'s absences from work due to her agoraphobia and informed her that he wanted to hire another former client, A.P., as his new assistant and to have P.B. help train her for the position. P.B. and respondent were still engaged in a sexual relationship at this point. In January\n   2013, P.B. ceased working for respondent-it is unclear whether P.B. quit or she was fired-and A.P. began working in his office. From the time P.B. stopped working with respondent in January 2013 until the panel's hearing, P.B. was unemployed, lived at home with her parents, and continued to suffer from agoraphobia and other symptoms related to her PTSD and ADHD conditions. In the spring of 2013, P.B. sought legal help from an attorney regarding respondent's behavior toward her, but she did not initiate a claim against respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15. In May 2013, P.B. was interviewed by a state police officer because of a complaint of sexual harassment filed against respondent by A.P. This complaint ultimately led to the disciplinary hearing at issue here. When interviewed, P.B. made allegations of sexual harassment against respondent. Although the relationship between P.B. and respondent was complicated, and the parties gave conflicting testimony, the hearing panel ultimately found that respondent's sexual attentions toward P.B. involving the paperclip incident and the masturbation incident were \"unwanted\" by P.B. and caused her harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II. Disciplinary Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16. As noted above, in April 2013, A.P. filed a sexual-harassment claim against respondent. This claim triggered an investigation into respondent's behavior with C.M., P.B., and A.P. and led to the disciplinary hearing at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17. Following the investigation, no criminal charges were filed against respondent, and the matter was referred to the Professional Responsibility Program in 2013. The panel held a hearing over a five-day period in November 2017 and January 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In March 2018, the panel issued an order setting forth the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and sanctions. Based on the facts outlined above, the panel concluded that respondent violated Rules 1.7, 4.3, 8.4(d), and 8.4(g) due to his misconduct with C.M. and P.B.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The panel further\n   determined that respondent acted \"knowingly\" regarding each violation; that each of the violations resulted in harm (potential or actual) to C.M., P.B., or the public's perception of the legal profession; and that the presumptive sanction for each violation should be suspension. The panel's consideration of the aggravating and mitigating factors did not alter the presumptive sanction, and the panel ultimately suspended respondent from the practice of law for two years. The panel also ordered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   In the event that [r]espondent files a motion seeking permission to resume the practice of law, ... he shall be required to submit as part of his application (1) an independent ... evaluation of his mental health ... to be performed no earlier than 90 days prior to the filing of any motion; and (2) a certificate of his participation in and completion of a sexual harassment education program that meets with the prior approval of Bar Counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 18. On appeal, disciplinary counsel asks this Court to adopt the factual findings and conclusions of law as set forth in the hearing panel's order, but to modify the sanction and disbar respondent from the practice of law. Respondent does not contest the imposition of a two-year suspension but challenges several of the hearing panel's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   III. Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 19. We review \"a disciplinary hearing panel's findings of fact under a clearly erroneous standard.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Strouse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n    2011 VT 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n    190 Vt. 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n    34 A.3d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (per curiam).

We review the panel's legal conclusions, including its violations determinations, de novo.

Our standard of review regarding the level of deference we afford the panel's sanction recommendation has been unclear; we clarify that standard here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20. In the past, we have stated that the Court defers to the disciplinary panel's recommendations on the issue of sanctions, yet retains discretion to determine which sanctions are appropriate for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.\n   <em>\n    Strouse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n    2011 VT 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n    190 Vt. 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n    34 A.3d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We give deference to the recommendations of a disciplinary panel but use our own discretion and make our own determination as to which sanctions are appropriate for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.\"); see also\n   <em>\n    In re Fink\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n    2011 VT 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n    189 Vt. 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n    22 A.3d 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"As to sanctions, we accord the panel's recommendation deference, but this Court renders the ultimate decision.\" (quotation omitted) ). This standard is contradictory-it suggests that we simultaneously defer and, yet, do not defer to the disciplinary panel's exercise of discretion. As explained below, there is no basis for this Court to defer to the panel's sanction recommendation. To the extent that our caselaw has indicated such deference is appropriate, we reject that proposition now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 21. Under the Vermont Constitution, the Supreme Court exercises \"administrative control of all the courts of the state, and disciplinary authority concerning\n   all judicial officers and attorneys at law in the State.\" Vt. Const. ch. II, \u00a7 30. Pursuant to that authority, this Court has promulgated the Vermont Rules of Professional Conduct, setting forth the ethical rules and responsibilities governing attorneys in the state, and has established a program to enforce the Rules of Professional Conduct and provide for attorney discipline, known as the Permanent Rules Governing Establishment and Operation of the Professional Responsibility Program, which are set forth in Administrative Order 9. The disciplinary program is administered by the Professional Responsibility Board. Notably, \"[t]he [Board] acts on behalf of this Court and pursuant to rules adopted by this Court.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Berk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4823823\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/157/524/#p527\">\n    157 Vt. 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4823823\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/157/524/#p527\">\n    602 A.2d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 948 (1991) (per curiam); see A.O. 9 Preamble to Permanent Rules (explaining Board was created by this Court pursuant to its \"constitutional authority... to structure and administer the lawyer discipline and disability system\").

Const. ch. II, \u00a7 30 (stating Supreme Court has \"disciplinary authority concerning all ... attorneys at law in the State\"). Decisions by hearing panels of the Board are appealable to this Court under Rule 11(E) of the Permanent Rules. Although these decisions come to this Court on appeal, we have stated that \"this Court does not 'review' [Board] recommendations on sanctions; rather, it makes its own ultimate decisions on discipline.\"\n   <em>\n    Berk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4823823\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/157/524/#p527\">\n    157 Vt. at 527-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4823823\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/157/524/#p527\">\n    602 A.2d at 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the rules provide that the Board's findings of fact \"shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous,\" A.O. 9 \u00a7 11(E), the rules do not provide standards of review for the Board's conclusions in mixed findings of fact and law or its recommendations on sanctions. As such, the rules provide no basis for this Court's deference to the Board's sanction recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 22. When this Court gives deference to another body's decisions, such as in the context of deference to agency determinations within the agency's area of expertise, such \"[d]ecisions ... are presumed correct, valid, and reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Korrow Real Estate, LLC Act 250 Permit Amendment Application\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20VT%2039\">\n    2018 VT 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=207%20Vt.%20274\">\n    207 Vt. 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12497510\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/187/1125/\">\n    187 A.3d 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted).

Our disciplinary-hearing caselaw supports this version of our standard.

Thus, the standard of review that we will apply upon review of a disciplinary proceeding will be as follows: we review the panel's findings of fact for clear error and review de novo its conclusions of law, including the panel's violation determinations and sanction recommendations. In doing so, we will give consideration to the panel's sanction recommendation, but we will treat it as just that-a recommendation. If our analysis comports with the recommendation of the panel, we will affirm it; if it does not, we will exercise our plenary authority to reach the appropriate conclusions and sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   IV. Contested Findings of Fact\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 28. We first review the panel's findings of fact, which respondent contests. As explained above, we will defer to the panel's findings so long as they are \"clearly and reasonably supported by the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Strouse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n    2011 VT 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n    190 Vt. 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n    34 A.3d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). Here, the panel conducted a five-day hearing riddled with contradictory testimony and competing narratives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 29. First, respondent contends that this Court should apply his version of certain essential facts to its analysis. Most notably, respondent asserts that the panel's findings regarding: (1) the details of the paperclip incident, (2) whether respondent's sexual conduct was \"unwelcome\" by P.B. during the paperclip and masturbation incidents, and (3) whether P.B.'s mental-health conditions were \"exacerbated\" by her relationship with respondent and his conduct were clearly erroneous. In support of this argument, respondent attacks P.B.'s credibility because \"[P.B.'s] testimony was contradicted on material points by undisputed evidence\" and \"[P.B.] was mentally unstable.\" Our deference to the panel's\n   factual findings clearly extends to the panel's credibility determinations-the credibility of witnesses and resolution of disputed or contradictory testimony is for the finder of fact. See\n   <em>\n    In re Elgin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8327953\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/918/362/#p373\">\n    918 A.2d 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 373 (D.C. 2007) (explaining that court defers to findings of fact and credibility determinations made by Board of Professional Responsibility). We conclude that the panel's findings on all three issues are supported by the evidence-including P.B.'s testimony, her psychiatrist's testimony and records, and her mother's testimony regarding P.B.'s description of the masturbation incident and her deteriorating enthusiasm for working at respondent's office-and that the panel's findings were not in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 30. Next, respondent contests two specific findings by the panel: (1) that \"[r]espondent presented no evidence that he ever provided [C.M.] with a description of the types of risks\" associated with respondent representing her in her divorce proceedings while the two were engaged in a sexual relationship; and (2) that P.B. believed she needed to sign the September 2012 agreement to continue working for respondent or else she would be fired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 31. Regarding the first assertion, we agree with respondent that the panel's finding disregards respondent's testimony that he verbally discussed the potential risks of engaging in a sexual relationship with C.M. It is unclear whether the panel overlooked this testimony or whether it found the statement unpersuasive. However, the panel's error on this point is harmless. The panel's ultimate conclusion that respondent violated Rule 1.7 was based on its finding that C.M. did not give informed consent,\n   <em>\n    confirmed in writing\n   </em>\n   , waiving the conflict, as required by the rule. Although respondent contends that he provided C.M. with verbal disclosures, respondent does not contest the finding that he did not secure written confirmation of C.M.'s informed consent; the panel's factual error, if error at all, does not impact its conclusion that respondent violated Rule 1.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 32. Second, respondent argues that the evidence does not support the finding that P.B. believed she would be fired if she did not sign the September 2012 agreement. At the hearing, P.B. explained that she believed she and respondent would be \"in trouble\" if they did not sign the agreement before respondent's step-father came to the office, but there is no direct evidence that P.B. believed she would be fired if she did not sign. However, the panel explained that, even if P.B. \"voluntarily signed the agreement because she wanted to have a consensual relationship with [r]espondent,\" respondent still engaged in quid pro quo sexual harassment merely by presenting and entering into the agreement. The panel articulated that \"[a]lthough the waiver provision did not\n   <em>\n    explicitly\n   </em>\n   make the submission to unwanted sexual advances a term of employment, it\n   <em>\n    implicitly\n   </em>\n   did so by placing [P.B.] in a position where she could not as a practical matter assert a claim of discrimination or harassment against her employer going forward.\" Thus, any error in the panel's findings regarding P.B.'s motive in signing the contract does not impact the panel's conclusion that respondent violated Rule 8.4(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   V. Contested Conclusions of Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 33. Next, we address whether respondent violated Rules 1.7, 4.3, 8.4(d), and 8.4(g) based on his conduct with C.M. and P.B. and the presumptive sanctions that should correlate with each violation. The American Bar Association's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions guide our sanctions determinations.\n   <em>\n    Fink\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n    2011 VT 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 35,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n    189 Vt. 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n    22 A.3d 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Ctr. for Prof'l Responsibility, Am.

The standards provide a presumptive sanction \"[d]epending on the importance of the duty violated, the level of the attorney's culpability, and the extent of the harm caused.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the presumptive sanction may be altered \"depending on the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Notably, \"the purpose of sanctions is not to punish attorneys, but rather to protect the public from harm and to maintain confidence in our legal institutions by deterring future misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation omitted). In this case, we concur with the panel's conclusions regarding respondent's violations of Rules 1.7, 4.3, and 8.4(g) and the corresponding presumptive sanction assigned by the panel regarding the violation of Rule 1.7. However, we disagree with the panel's sua sponte conclusion that respondent violated Rule 8.4(d). We also disagree with the panel's determination that the presumptive sanction for respondent's violations of Rules 4.3 and 8.4(g) should be suspension; we conclude that disbarment is the presumptive sanction for respondent's violations of these rules. We consider each violation and sanction determination in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   A. Rule 1.7 (Conflict of Interest: Current Clients)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 34. First, we consider whether respondent violated Rule 1.7 by engaging in a sexual relationship with C.M. while representing her in her divorce proceedings and failing to obtain her consent to the representation in writing. Rule 1.7 prohibits an attorney from representing a client where there is a concurrent conflict of interest. Specifically, the rule provides, \"a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest. A concurrent conflict of interest exists if ... there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited ... by a personal interest of the lawyer.\" V.R.Pr.C. 1.7(a)(2). Rule 1.7 provides for limited exceptions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Notwithstanding the existence of a concurrent conflict of interest ... a lawyer may represent a client if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   (1) the lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (2) the representation is not prohibited by law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (3) the representation does not involve the assertion of a claim by one client against another client represented by the lawyer in the same litigation or other proceeding before a tribunal;\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (4)\n   <em>\n    each affected client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Rule 1.7(b) (emphasis added). Here, the panel determined that respondent violated his duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and did not qualify for an exception, under Rule 1.7 when he engaged in a sexual relationship with his client, C.M., without obtaining her \"informed consent\" in writing. Based on the facts found by the panel, we agree that respondent violated Rule 1.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 35. Next, we must determine respondent's mental state in committing the violation. \"The lawyer's mental state may be one of intent, knowledge, or negligence.\" ABA Standards \u00a7 3.0, cmt. The standards define these mental states as follows. Intent, the most culpable mental\n   state, is defined as acting with \"the conscious objective or purpose to accomplish a particular result.\" ABA Standards, Definitions. Knowledge, the next most culpable mental state, is \"the conscious awareness of the nature or attendant circumstances of the conduct but without the conscious objective or purpose to accomplish a particular result.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, negligence, the least culpable mental state, exists when a lawyer fails \"to heed a substantial risk that circumstances exist or that a result will follow, which failure is a deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable lawyer would exercise in the situation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 36. In\n   <em>\n    Fink\n   </em>\n   , we explained that the distinction between negligent and knowing conduct\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   is whether a lawyer had a conscious awareness of the conduct underlying the violation or whether he failed to heed a substantial risk that a violation would result from his conduct. In other words, was the lawyer aware of the circumstances that formed the basis for the violation? If so, the conduct was done knowingly. If the lawyer instead acted without awareness, but below the accepted standard of care, then he acted negligently.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n    2011 VT 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 38,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n    189 Vt. 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n    22 A.3d 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notably, \"[a]pplication of these definitions is fact-dependent,\" and as such \"we give deference to the panel's assessment of an attorney's mental state.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 37. Regarding respondent's mental state in this case, the panel concluded that respondent knowingly violated Rule 1.7 because he \"\n   <em>\n    knowingly\n   </em>\n   entered into a sexual relationship with [C.M.] while he was representing her in the divorce action.\" (Emphasis added.) Respondent argues that, while \"his judgment was mistaken, ... his failure to recognize a significant risk of conflict was negligent, not knowing\" when he reviewed comment 17 of the Rules of Professional Conduct with C.M. and believed he could avoid a conflict. However, the panel concluded that respondent did not act negligently because his failure to conduct adequate legal research on conflicts of interest did not diminish his state of mind. We agree with the panel's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 38. Next, the ABA Standards ask us to consider \"the actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct.\" ABA Standards \u00a7 3.0(c). Under the ABA Standards, injury is defined as \"harm to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession which results from a lawyer's misconduct. The level of injury can range from 'serious' injury to 'little or no' injury.\" ABA Standards, Definitions. \"Potential injury\" refers to harm \"that is reasonably foreseeable at the time of the lawyer's misconduct, and which, but for some intervening factor or event, would probably have resulted from the lawyer's misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"The extent of the injury is defined by the type of duty violated and the extent of actual or potential harm.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Theoretical Framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 39. Here, the panel concluded that, although there is no evidence that C.M. suffered actual harm from respondent's representation in her divorce proceedings, respondent's actions presented a \"serious potential injury\" to C.M. by placing her at risk of conflicted representation and resulted in a \"serious actual injury to the public perception of the legal profession.\" Again, we agree with the panel; a conflict-of-interest violation of this type \"feed[s] public distrust of lawyers and decrease[s] public confidence in the profession.\"\n   <em>\n    Fink\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n    2011 VT 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 36,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n    189 Vt. 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699695\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/470/\">\n    22 A.3d 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding respondent caused \"injury to the public at large and the legal profession\" by failing to put contingent fee in writing and to charge reasonable fee for services).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 40. Based on respondent's breach of duty, corresponding mental state, and the harm resulting from respondent's actions, the ABA Standards assign a presumptive sanction for the attorney's misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. While these sanctions are not binding on this Court, they provide a helpful guide in assigning an appropriate sanction.\n   <em>\n    In re McCarty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"385994\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/164/604/#p605\">\n    164 Vt. 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 605,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"385994\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/164/604/#p605\">\n    665 A.2d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 887 (1995) (mem.) (electing not to adhere to ABA Standards' recommendation for minimum length of suspension). Here, the panel determined that respondent knowingly violated Rule 1.7, resulting in serious potential harm to C.M. and serious actual injury to the legal profession; therefore the panel determined suspension was the correct presumptive sanction under ABA Standard 4.32. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 41. Standard 4.0 applies to \"Violations of Duties Owed to Clients.\" ABA Standards \u00a7 4.0. The introduction to Standard 4.0 expressly states that it applies to violations of Rule 1.7.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"385994\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/164/604/#p605\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Standard 4.32 provides for suspension \"when a lawyer knows of a conflict of interest and does not fully disclose to a client the possible effect of that conflict, and causes injury or potential injury to a client.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"385994\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/164/604/#p605\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.32. Respondent argues that we should apply Standard 4.34, which suggests that \"[a]dmonition is generally appropriate when a lawyer engages in an isolated instance of negligence in determining whether the representation of a client may be materially affected by the lawyer's own interests ... and causes little or no actual or potential injury to the client.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"385994\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/164/604/#p605\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.34. Here, respondent knowingly entered a relationship with C.M.; he was aware of potential conflicts inherent in his relationship with a client, yet he did not obtain signed consent to the conflict from C.M., in violation of Rule 1.7; and his actions caused potential injury to C.M. in her divorce proceedings. Therefore, we conclude that suspension under Standard 4.32 is the appropriate sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   B. Rule 4.3 (Dealing with Unrepresented Person)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 42. Next, the panel concluded that respondent committed two distinct violations of Rule 4.3 when he: (1) failed to take reasonable steps to correct P.B.'s misunderstanding about his role in the September 2012 agreement-namely, that he was acting in his own interest and not representing P.B. in any way; and (2) failed to advise P.B. that she should consult an independent attorney before signing the waiver. Rule 4.3 states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   In dealing on behalf of a client with a person who is not represented by counsel, a lawyer shall not state or imply that the lawyer is disinterested. When the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the unrepresented person misunderstands the lawyer's role in the matter, the lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to correct the misunderstanding. The lawyer shall not give legal advice to an unrepresented person, other than the advice to secure counsel, if the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the interests of such a person are or have a reasonable possibility of being in conflict with the interests of the client.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   V.R.Pr.C. 4.3. We agree with the panel's conclusion that respondent's conduct with P.B. violated Rule 4.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 43. Regarding respondent's mental state, the panel concluded that respondent acted knowingly when he \"presented a document to [P.B.] that included the clause waiving her right to assert future claims of gender discrimination and sexual harassment and language representing that the terms of the agreement protected both of their interests.\" We agree with the panel that, while a case\n   could be made that respondent acted negligently in failing to make reasonable efforts to clarify his role in connection with the agreement, the facts demonstrate that respondent knowingly prepared the final version of the agreement with his step-brother's assistance with the intent to secure a waiver clause to prevent P.B. from bringing \"any and all\" claims against him. In addition, respondent-an attorney-knew that P.B. was unsophisticated in legal matters, that P.B. was a highly vulnerable individual struggling with various mental-health issues, and that there were conflicting interests at stake in the September 2012 agreement. P.B. was also a former client and, as such, it would be reasonable for her to assume that respondent was acting on her behalf. Considering these factors, respondent's failure to clarify that he was in no way representing P.B.'s interests when asking her to sign the agreement or to advise her to seek legal counsel of her own constitutes a knowing violation of Rule 4.3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 44. Regarding the harm caused by respondent's actions, the panel concluded that signing the agreement resulted in potential injury to P.B. because the waiver clause may have discouraged P.B. from filing any gender-discrimination or sexual-harassment claims against respondent and, even if she had overcome this hurdle and filed such a claim, the waiver may have barred the claim if a court found the agreement to be valid. The panel further concluded that the agreement, standing alone, caused \"substantial injury to the legal system and the profession.\" The panel stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Respondent's effort, through the waiver clause, to shield himself from liability for discrimination in connection with conduct that had not yet occurred ... was fundamentally inconsistent with the expectation that lawyers should seek justice at all times.... Such an agreement could only decrease confidence in the legal profession.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   We agree with the panel that respondent's request that P.B. sign the September 2012 agreement presented potential injury to P.B. and caused serious injury to the legal profession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 45. The panel applied Standard 7.2, which carries a presumptive sanction of suspension, to respondent's violation of Rule 4.3. Standard 7.2 provides: \"[s]uspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional, and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, or the legal system.\" ABA Standards \u00a7 7.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 46. However, the final sanction determination for respondent's conduct rests with this Court. As noted above, we are not required to defer to the panel's conclusion that suspension is the appropriate presumptive sanction under Standard 7.2. See\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Part III. While we give the panel's recommendation consideration, we conduct our own analysis to determine the appropriate sanction. Disciplinary counsel advocates that Standard 7.1, which carries a presumptive sanction of disbarment, rather than Standard 7.2, is applicable to respondent's violations of Rules 4.3 and 8.4(g). See\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , Part V(D). We agree with disciplinary counsel's assessment and determine that Standard 7.1 is more appropriate than Standard 7.2 in this instance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 47. Standard 7.0 applies to \"Violations of Other Duties Owed as a Professional.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the umbrella of Standard 7.0, there are four standards, Standards 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4, which provide for a presumptive sanction depending on the severity of respondent's misconduct. See ABA Standards \u00a7\u00a7 7.1 (disbarment), 7.2 (suspension), 7.3 (reprimand), 7.4 (admonition). Standard 7.2, applied by the panel, and Standard 7.1, advocated by disciplinary counsel here, are nearly identical. Standard 7.2 provides for suspension \"when a lawyer knowingly engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional, and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, or the legal system.\" ABA Standards \u00a7 7.2. Standard 7.1 provides for disbarment \"when a lawyer\n   knowingly engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional\n   <em>\n    with the intent to obtain a benefit for the lawyer\n   </em>\n   or another, and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client, the public, or the legal system.\" ABA Standards \u00a7 7.1 (emphasis added). Here, we conclude that Standard 7.1 is the presumptive sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 48. As explained above, respondent knowingly presented the 2012 contract to P.B. and asked her, an unrepresented individual unsophisticated in legal matters, to sign the contract and waive\n   <em>\n    any and all\n   </em>\n   sexual harassment or discrimination claims against him-past or future. Respondent never clarified that he was not representing P.B.'s interests in the transaction, but was, in fact, representing his own, and he did not advise her to seek counsel to protect her interests. While respondent's failure to suggest that P.B. obtain independent counsel could be couched as a careless omission, respondent's request that P.B. formally waive any claims against him by signing the 2012 contract was most certainly presented and executed \"with the intent to obtain a benefit\" for respondent-protection from future suit or liability. ABA Standards \u00a7 7.1. Although a court may not have enforced the waiver if called upon to construe it, there is no assurance that P.B. would realize the potential to file suit still existed despite her signing the waiver. The intent behind the document was to provide protection for respondent, for acts that had already occurred and potential future acts, and the document on its face appeared to make him immune from sexual-harassment and gender-discrimination suits. These actions resulted in \"potentially serious injury\" to P.B. by discouraging her from filing a complaint against respondent and, if the agreement had been found enforceable, waiving her claims against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 49. The severity of a presumptive sanction increases with the \"seriousness of the reflection [of the violation] on the lawyer's fitness to practice [law].\"\n   <em>\n    Strouse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n    2011 VT 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n    190 Vt. 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n    34 A.3d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, respondent's misconduct took advantage of a vulnerable and unrepresented party who was also a former client to advance his own interests-a gross dereliction of the duties respondent owed as a professional with the potential for serious impact on the integrity of our system of justice. As such, Standard 7.1 is more applicable to this case than Standard 7.2, and the presumptive sanction for respondent's violation of Rule 4.3 is disbarment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   C. Rule 8.4(d) (Misconduct-Prejudicial to Administration of Justice)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 50. The panel concluded, sua sponte, that respondent violated Rule 8.4(d), which provides that \"[i]t is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice,\" when he proposed and executed the September agreement that was intended to absolve respondent of liability for past and future gender-discrimination and sexual-harassment claims. V.R.Pr.C. 8.4(d). The parties were given the opportunity to brief: (1) whether the panel was barred from considering, on\n   its own initiative, whether respondent violated Rule 8.4(d); and (2) whether respondent's misconduct, in fact, violated Rule 8.4(d). On appeal, respondent asserts that the panel's action, disciplining him for violating an uncharged rule, violated the procedural protections of Administrative Order 9. We conclude that the panel's actions ran afoul of Administrative Order 9's procedural rules because, even if the panel had the authority to sua sponte consider an uncharged rule violation, the panel failed to provide respondent with the opportunity to contest and provide evidence regarding the alleged violation at the evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 51. Administrative Order 9 clearly outlines procedures for screening misconduct allegations for probable cause prior to submitting formal charges and conducting a hearing in response to a petition of misconduct. A.O. 9 \u00a7 11. Section 11(A) provides that disciplinary counsel must give a respondent notice in writing \"of the substance of the matter under investigation.\" A.O. 9 \u00a7 11(A). Section 11(C) explains that \"[d]isciplinary counsel's decision to proceed with a petition of misconduct shall be reviewed for probable cause by a hearing panel assigned by the chair of the Board .... If the panel finds probable cause to believe that a violation has occurred, disciplinary counsel shall present formal charges to a different hearing panel assigned by the chair of the Board, unless a stipulation to misconduct is earlier submitted.\" A.O. 9 \u00a7 11(C). Following the probable cause determination, disciplinary counsel may initiate formal proceedings against the respondent \"by filing with the Board and serving upon respondent a petition of misconduct which is sufficiently clear to inform respondent of the alleged misconduct\n   <em>\n    and the rules alleged to have been violated\n   </em>\n   .\" A.O. 9 \u00a7 11(D)(1) (emphasis added). Administrative Order 9 further requires that \"[t]he notice of hearing on a petition of misconduct\n   <em>\n    shall state that the respondent is entitled\n   </em>\n   to be represented by a lawyer, to cross-examine witnesses, and\n   <em>\n    to present evidence\n   </em>\n   .\" A.O. 9 \u00a7 11(D)(4) (emphases added). Failure to comport with this procedure carries due process implications that run counter to our requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 52. Here, the petition did not notify respondent that he would be charged with violating Rule 8.4(d), as such respondent was not on notice that he should present evidence during the hearing to contest such a charge. Respondent did not learn of the additional Rule 8.4(d) allegation until after the close of the evidentiary hearing-when it was too late to provide additional evidence or testimony on the matter. Although respondent was given the opportunity to provide supplemental briefing in response to the late addition of the Rule 8.4(d) violation, Administrative Order 9 clearly states that respondent is entitled to know the rules alleged to have been violated and to present evidence at the hearing. See A.O. 9 \u00a7 11(D). Because the panel elected to sua sponte consider the Rule 8.4(d) violation after the close of the evidentiary hearing and provided no accommodation for the parties, particularly respondent, to present evidence in response, we conclude that the panel was precluded from considering whether respondent violated this rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we reverse on\n   this issue. However, we agree with the panel's conclusions that respondent violated Rules 1.7, 4.3, and 8.4(g), each of which carries a presumptive sanction of suspension or disbarment in this case. Therefore, our reversal of the panel on the Rule 8.4(d) violation does not impact our ultimate sanction determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   D. Rule 8.4(g) (Misconduct-Discrimination)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 53. Finally, the panel concluded that respondent violated Rule 8.4(g), which states, \"[i]t is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... discriminate against any individual because of his or her ... sex ... in hiring, promoting or otherwise determining the conditions of employment.\" V.R.Pr.C. 8.4(g).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In so concluding, the panel determined that: (1) respondent's conduct toward P.B.-including the paperclip incident and the masturbation incident-created a hostile work environment tantamount to sexual harassment; and (2) the waiver clause in the September 2012 agreement constituted quid pro quo sexual harassment because it implicitly conditioned P.B.'s employment upon submitting to unwanted sexual advances \"by placing [P.B.] in a position where she could not as a practical matter assert a claim of discrimination or harassment against her employer going forward.\" We agree that respondent's actions violated Rule 8.4(g) by creating a hostile work environment for P.B. and implicitly conditioning P.B.'s future employment on her agreement not to file future discrimination and sexual-harassment claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 54. The panel concluded that respondent knowingly and intentionally engaged in sexual conduct with P.B. that was \"unwelcome\" by her and engendered a hostile work environment. The panel stated, \"[h]e was fully aware of his conduct and he was engaging in that conduct to achieve a particular result-his own gratification.... The fact that [r]espondent may not have intended to harm [P.B.] by his conduct is not the issue.\" We agree; the facts support the panel's conclusion that respondent knowingly engaged in sexual conduct with P.B., that his sexual advances were \"unwelcome,\" and that they resulted in a hostile work environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 55. The panel also concluded that respondent knowingly entered into the September 2012 agreement with the intention of shielding himself from potential discrimination or sexual-harassment claims from P.B. There was little, if any, benefit to P.B. from entering the agreement, which appeared to leave her without recourse regarding any unwelcome sexual conduct in the workplace. As explained in our analysis of respondent's mental state pertaining to the agreement in the context of the Rule 4.3 violation, we agree with the panel that respondent acted knowingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 56. The panel found that \"[w]ith respect to [r]espondent's unwelcome sexual conduct involving [P.B.], there was serious emotional harm to her.\" Based on the comments that P.B. made to her mother and her psychiatrist, as well as the email P.B. sent to respondent notifying him that she felt uncomfortable in the workplace, we agree that the evidence demonstrates P.B. suffered direct harm from respondent's actions during the paperclip and masturbation incidents. As noted above, we also concur that entering into the September 2012 agreement with P.B. and implicitly conditioning her continued employment on her waiver of future claims against respondent caused potential harm to P.B. and substantial injury to the legal profession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 57. The panel applied Standard 7.2 to respondent's violations of Rule 8.4(g), resulting in suspension as the presumptive sanction. See ABA Standards \u00a7 7.2. However, due to respondent's intent to benefit himself through his actions and the seriousness of the reflection of respondent's Rule 8.4(g) violation on his fitness to practice law,\n   <em>\n    Strouse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n    2011 VT 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n    190 Vt. 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n    34 A.3d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we conclude that Standard 7.1, which provides for disbarment, is more appropriate in this situation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 58. As explained above, Standard 7.1 provides for disbarment \"when a lawyer knowingly engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional\n   <em>\n    with the intent to obtain a benefit for the lawyer\n   </em>\n   or another, and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client, the public, or the legal system.\" ABA Standards \u00a7 7.1 (emphasis added). Here, respondent knowingly engaged in unwanted sexual conduct with P.B. \"to achieve a particular result-his own gratification.\" Respondent violated his duties owed as a professional with the intent to benefit himself, resulting in serious harm to P.B. and the legal profession. Accordingly, disbarment under Standard 7.1 is the appropriate presumptive sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 59. Based on the conclusions listed above, the presumptive sanction for respondent's\n   violation of Rule 1.7 is suspension; the presumptive sanction for respondent's violations of Rules 4.3 and 8.4(g) is disbarment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   VI. Aggravating and Mitigating Factors\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 60. Next, the ABA Standards direct us to consider any aggravating and/or mitigating factors present in this case and to determine whether these factors justify a lesser or greater sanction than presumed-here, disbarment. See ABA Standards \u00a7 9.1 (\"After misconduct has been established, aggravating and mitigating circumstances may be considered in deciding what sanction to impose.\"). Aggravating or mitigating circumstances are considerations or factors that may justify an increase or decrease in the degree of discipline to be imposed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 9.21, 9.31. Nonexclusive lists of potential aggravating and mitigating factors recognized by the ABA Standards are included under Standards 9.22 and 9.32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 61. In weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors, the panel determined that the aggravating factors significantly outweighed the mitigating factors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on these considerations, the panel applied a presumptive sanction of suspension, but only suspended respondent from practice for two years. Respondent argues that the mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating ones, including the delay in these proceedings and respondent's remorse. Upon weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors, we not only depart from the panel's assigned sanction, but we also conclude that the aggravating factors present are so serious as to justify the presumptive sanction of disbarment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 62. Here, particular consideration of two of the aggravating factors-Standard 9.22(c) pattern of misconduct and Standard 9.22(h) vulnerability of victims-leads us to the conclusion that disbarment is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 63. First, relevant to Standard 9.22(h) (vulnerability of victims), both C.M. and P.B. were in vulnerable positions during their interactions with respondent. According to the facts as found by the panel, respondent began a relationship with C.M. after she retained him to represent her in her divorce proceedings-she had just separated from her husband of sixteen years and had limited financial means. Despite the potential conflict of interest, respondent did not have C.M. sign a waiver acknowledging that she knew, understood, and consented to the risks associated with a sexual relationship between attorney and client. Additionally, respondent knew that C.M., who was involved in a contentious divorce proceeding that included contested parent-child contact issues, was struggling financially and was concerned with the monetary outcome of the divorce proceedings. In entering a relationship with C.M. at that time, he offered that she could stay at his home and provided her work at his tanning salon business to alleviate her financial burden. These actions demonstrate that respondent encouraged C.M.'s dependence on him, yet failed to properly inform her and gain her written consent to the\n   potential conflicts inherent in their relationship. Respondent's actions in seeking to keep his relationship with C.M. a secret in the area of the state where he practiced, is, as the panel determined, evidence that he \"harbor[ed] concerns or uncertainty about whether the relationship was ethically acceptable.\" Respondent then ended his relationship with C.M. at virtually the same time he concluded her divorce proceedings, predictably leaving her feeling abandoned, misled, and poorly represented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 64. Similarly, P.B. came to respondent for legal advice. At the time she was dealing with criminal charges, living at home with her parents, and receiving treatment for mental-health issues. As with C.M., respondent offered P.B. a job, which she believed would help her demonstrate employment in the legal field. Respondent entered into a sexual relationship with P.B. while she was his employee at his law office. Respondent engaged in unwanted sexual conduct with P.B. at his law office and continued the sexual relationship even after P.B. sent him an email stating that his behavior was making her uncomfortable at work. Importantly, respondent raised the issue of signing the waiver absolving him of any potential liability for workplace harassment once again very shortly after he received the email from P.B. complaining about the conditions at work. Even though respondent knew that P.B. had mental-health issues and was unsophisticated in legal matters, he asked her to sign an agreement waiving any potential future legal claims against him for discrimination or sexual harassment. Respondent further disadvantaged P.B. by failing to inform her that, even though he had served as her legal counsel in the past, he was not acting on her behalf in the contractual proceedings and that she should seek her own legal counsel. In sum, respondent repeatedly used a vulnerable individual for his own sexual gratification despite her discomfort, which she made known to respondent, and then protected himself from the ramifications of these actions by misleading her, an unrepresented individual, into signing a contract waiving her rights to bring legal claims against him for discriminatory and harassing conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b6 65. These findings demonstrate that, on more than one occasion, respondent targeted vulnerable individuals and engaged in activity contrary to our Rules of Professional Conduct; we weigh this heavily in our sanction determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 66. Although we have no caselaw on point in Vermont, caselaw from other jurisdictions supports our position on this issue. See\n   <em>\n    In re Berg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1360777\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/264/254/\">\n    264 Kan. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1360777\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/264/254/\">\n    955 P.2d 1240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1257 (1998) (finding aggravating circumstances when attorney committed \"flagrant violations of his fiduciary duty to women who placed their rights and trust in his hands\" by engaging \"in inappropriate sexual behavior with numerous clients who were very vulnerable\");\n   <em>\n    In re Vogel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6819962\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/482/520/#p539\">\n    482 S.W.3d 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 539 (Tenn. 2016) (finding aggravating circumstances when attorney engaged in sexual relationship with \"vulnerable\" female client-she was young, lacked financial resources, and viewed attorney as \"authority figure\"-who he later employed at his law office);\n   <em>\n    Lawyer Disciplinary Bd. v.

Respondent's actions also represent a pattern of misconduct under Standard 9.22(h). He demonstrated a pattern of sexual behavior-some consensual and some unwanted-toward female clients in vulnerable positions whom he encountered because they sought him out for his legal\n   services. As noted above, both C.M. and P.B. were struggling with difficult life circumstances (divorce, criminal charges, financial instability, and/or mental-health issues) when they began their respective relationships with respondent and at the time respondent's misconduct occurred. During these relationships, respondent strategically omitted to inform C.M. and P.B. about essential legal safeguards to secure his own interests: he failed to obtain signed consent from C.M. acknowledging that she understood the risks associated with a client-attorney relationship and the conflicts of interest that may arise; and he asked P.B. to sign the September 2012 agreement waiving her rights to bring future and past legal claims against him without informing her that he was not representing her interests and that she should seek independent counsel. Looking solely at respondent's behavior with C.M. and P.B.-the behavior giving rise to the violations of professional misconduct at issue here-there is evidence of a disturbing pattern of misconduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondent's argument that these were different types of misconduct-conflict of interest, misconduct with an unrepresented person, and discrimination-and therefore cannot constitute a \"pattern of misconduct\" is unpersuasive in light of the factual similarities and context of the misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 68. Respondent further contends that the panel incorrectly considered his behavior with P.B. to be illegal conduct and an aggravating factor under Standard 9.22(k). The panel determined that \"Vermont law prohibits discrimination in the form of sexual harassment\"; that respondent sexually harassed P.B. through his misconduct; and that \"[r]espondent's sexual harassment of [P.B.] constituted illegal conduct.\" The panel supported this conclusion by referencing\n   <em>\n    In re Tenenbaum\n   </em>\n   , in which the court found, under similar circumstances, that an attorney's sexual harassment of his female clients and employees constituted illegal conduct and an aggravating factor under Standard 9.22(k).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8940958\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/880/1025/#p1035\">\n    880 A.2d 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1035 (Del. 2005). The panel further noted that \"[s]exual harassment is prohibited under [the Fair Employment Practices Act]. It may not be criminal conduct, but it is illegal nonetheless.\" We find the panel's analysis persuasive and consider respondent's illegal conduct to be an aggravating factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 69. To the extent that mitigating factors are present, we agree with the panel that, generally, a lack of prior disciplinary history is persuasive in favor of leniency. See\n   <em>\n    In re Pope\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347346\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/197/638/\">\n    2014 VT 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347346\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/197/638/\">\n    197 Vt. 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347346\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/197/638/\">\n    101 A.3d 1284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (mem.)

In this case we conclude that, although respondent has no prior history of misconduct, the fact that respondent committed multiple violations spanning several years with different and vulnerable victims tempers the force of this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 70. Respondent argues that the delay in proceedings should be considered a substantial mitigating factor. The initial investigation into respondent's misconduct occurred in early 2013, the charges against respondent were not brought to a hearing until November 2017, and the panel did not issue an order until March 2018. We have recognized that delay in disciplinary proceedings may carry weight as a mitigating factor, particularly when a respondent\n   has not violated the rules in the interim, see\n   <em>\n    In re McCarty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4046963\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/194/109/\">\n    2013 VT 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 33-34,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4046963\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/194/109/\">\n    194 Vt. 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4046963\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/194/109/\">\n    75 A.3d 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing \"some weight in mitigation to the delay\" when matter was delayed for approximately ten years \"and, in the interim, respondent [had] not had other violations brought against him\" (quotation omitted) ), and we acknowledge that delay in proceedings is a mitigating factor in this case. However, the panel found that the parties' attempt to achieve resolution of the matter on the basis of stipulated facts significantly contributed to the delay. The panel rejected the stipulation in March 2017, after which disciplinary counsel proceeded to bring charges before the panel. Respondent was permitted to maintain his law license and continue practicing throughout the disciplinary proceedings. Thus, we conclude that the delay in proceedings does not outweigh the aggravating circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b6 71. Finally, respondent takes issue with the panel's failure to credit respondent's remorse as a mitigating factor under Standard 9.32(1). On this issue, the panel determined that it could not \"find that [r]espondent has shown remorse for his conduct\" because \"he denied any wrongdoing throughout the proceeding\" and \"rel[ied] on post-hearing statements by his therapist in her letter to the effect that he has expressed remorse for 'how he understands he hurt these ... women' and has accepted responsibility for his conduct.\" We consider respondent's indications of remorse to his therapist to be a mitigating factor. While we do not agree with the panel's categorical statement that respondent cannot speak through a third person, the mitigating weight of this factor is diminished, as the panel accurately observed, by the respondent's failure to personally indicate remorse throughout the proceedings beyond his observation that \"he might have made a different choice.\" See\n   <em>\n    Strouse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n    2011 VT 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n    190 Vt. 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n    34 A.3d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding respondent showed remorse when, despite prior denials of misconduct, respondent personally testified, \"these aren't things that I'm very proud of, ...

Sanction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 73. In determining the appropriate sanction to apply in this case, we reiterate that \"the purpose of sanctions is to protect the public from persons unfit to serve as attorneys and to maintain public confidence in the bar, as well as to deter other attorneys from engaging in misconduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <em>\n    Neisner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700594\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/145/\">\n    2010 VT 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700594\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/145/\">\n    189 Vt. 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700594\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/145/\">\n    16 A.3d 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). In our sanction determination, we adhere to the Vermont Rules of Professional Conduct and look to the ABA Standards for guidance. Based on our analysis, the presumptive sanction under the ABA Standards is disbarment, and our analysis of the aggravating and mitigating factors give us no reason to depart from that presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b6 74.

See\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , \u00b640. Here, we find Standard 6.3 to be inapplicable to the facts at issue. Standard 6.3 provides that \"the following sanctions are generally appropriate in cases involving attempts to influence\n    <em>\n     a judge, juror, prospective juror or other official\n    </em>\n    by means prohibited by law\"-P.B. does not fit into any of these categories. ABA Standards \u00a7 6.3 (emphasis added). Based on the introduction and commentary to Standard 6.3, as well as the language of the standard subparts, we conclude that this standard is not applicable to this violation. Considering that the ABA Standards' recommended standard is not applicable, we agree with disciplinary counsel that Standard 7.0 (Violations of Other Duties Owed as a Professional) is most applicable in this case. Cf. ABA Standards \u00a7\u00a7 4.0 (Violations of Duties Owed to Clients); 5.0 (Violations of Duties Owed to the Public); 6.0 (Violations of Duties Owed to the Legal System).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    The introduction to Standard 7.0 explains that the Rules of Professional conduct \"include many ethical standards that are not fundamental to the professional relationship but which define certain standards of conduct.\" ABA Standards \u00a7 7.0, Intro. Standard 7.0 provides a nonexclusive list of cases in which the Standard 7.0 sanctions \"are generally appropriate,\" including \"cases involving false or misleading communication about the lawyer or the lawyer's services, improper communication of fields of practice, improper solicitation of professional employment from a prospective client, unreasonable or improper fees, unauthorized practice of law, improper withdrawal from representation, or failure to report professional misconduct.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    In the past, we have refused to apply Standard 7.0 as the presumptive sanction when \"[n]one of these behaviors [stated in the introduction to Standard 7.0] matche[d] respondent's conduct\" and another standard \"clearly appl[ied].\"\n    <em>\n     Strouse\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n     2011 VT 77\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 22, 24,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n     190 Vt. 170\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701610\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/170/\">\n     34 A.3d 329\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (concluding Standard 5.1, not Standard 7.0, was applicable to attorney's violation of 8.4(c) when she failed to disclose to her supervising attorney her continuing romantic relationship with husband of firm's divorce client). However, we have also recognized that multiple interpretations of the ABA Standards are \"plausible because the language used in the ABA Standards is relatively broad and subjective,\" and our application of the standards requires a fact-intensive inquiry.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 20, 22 (attempting to \"match\" respondent's conduct to broad and subjective categories of behaviors outlined in ABA standards).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Here, unlike\n    <em>\n     Strouse\n    </em>\n    , there is not another \"clearly applicable\" standard for respondent's grossly deceitful conduct toward a vulnerable and unrepresented individual, which resulted in serious potential injury to P.B., the public, and the legal system. We conclude that Standard 7.0 is the most appropriate standard for respondent's actions in this case, which violated his duties owed as a professional. The commentary to Standards 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 elaborate that Standard 7.0 is applicable in situations involving \"falsehoods and omissions,\" such as intentionally making false material statements on a bar application, charging excessive or improper fees, or neglecting to properly instruct employees regarding what constitutes solicitation. ABA Standards \u00a7\u00a7 7.1-7.3, cmt. Thus, we conclude that Standard 7.0 is the most applicable ABA Standard for this rule violation-whether the respondent's conduct was expressly included in the Standard 7.0 categories is not dispositive.

However, the introduction also recognizes that \"[w]hile it will as a rule be inappropriate to impose a sanction of disbarment ... there are situations when a more severe sanction should be imposed.\" This is such a case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    The panel determined that respondent violated Rule 8.4(d) based on the facts before it-that respondent presented to P.B. and executed the 2012 agreement purporting to waive any claims against him-and that no additional evidence could alter the outcome of the Rule 8.4(d) determination. Even if the panel's assertion is true and no evidence could alter its ultimate conclusion, the ends do not justify the means-the panel cannot propose and conclude that respondent committed an uncharged rule violation while at the same time circumventing the procedural protections guaranteed to him.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    Because we conclude that the panel's addition of the Rule 8.4(d) violation after the close of the hearing failed to provide the parties with the opportunity to present evidence, running afoul of the procedural protections outlined in Administrative Order 9, we do not address whether a disciplinary panel may sua sponte consider rule violations not outlined in the initial petition of misconduct under other circumstances.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    Rule 8.4(g) was amended, effective September 18, 2017.

However, in this case, there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to support the inference that P.B. reasonably believed that signing the agreement, and submitting to respondent's unwanted sexual advances without recourse, was a condition of her employment. First, the 2012 contract not only acknowledged that respondent and P.B. were in a sexual relationship, but also provided respondent with a prospective exculpatory release from any past or future impropriety. Second, although P.B. refused to sign the agreement in June, later explaining that she was \"intimidated\" and \"uncomfortable,\" P.B. stated that she signed the 2012 agreement in the fall because she believed that she and respondent would \"be in trouble\" if they did not sign the agreement. It is reasonable to infer that P.B. believed that rejecting the agreement a second time and \"be[ing] in trouble\" with respondent's step-father would have negative ramifications on her employment. Finally, terms within the contract indicate the quid pro quo nature of the agreement. For example, the agreement recites: \"[w]hereas, both parties wish to continue their working relationship and set forth terms that protect both Employer and Employee,\" and includes as apparent consideration respondent's agreement to remain flexible about P.B.'s hours in light of her mental-health issues. The fact that respondent placed P.B., who he knew to have significant mental-health issues, in a situation where she was pressured to admit to the \"mutual welcomeness\" of their relationship and waive any prospective claims against respondent (or else she would be in trouble), and that she also received assurances that respondent would accommodate her mental-health issues, demonstrates the exploitative nature of the agreement in light of the power differential between respondent and P.B. And, finally, the fact that respondent did not advise P.B. to consult with counsel of her own before signing supports an inference that submitting to unwelcome sexual attention was an implicit requirement for her continued employment. Thus, we agree with the panel that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that asking P.B. to sign the agreement constituted quid pro quo sexual harassment under these limited circumstances.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    The ABA Standards do not provide a recommended standard for violations of Rule 8.4(g).

See\n    <em>\n     In re Blais\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"240836\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/174/628/#p628\">\n     174 Vt. 628\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 628,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"240836\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/174/628/#p628\">\n     817 A.2d 1266\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1267 (2002) (mem.) (finding multiple offenses when respondent engaged in \"misconduct consisting of five instances of neglecting client matters and three instances of misrepresentation\");\n    <em>\n     In re Bucknam\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4849650\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/160/355/#p366\">\n     160 Vt. 355\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 366,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4849650\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/160/355/#p366\">\n     628 A.2d 932\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 938 (1993) (holding that multiple violations against single client constituted multiple offenses, but not pattern of misconduct). Regarding respondent's assertions that his substantial experience in the practice of law should not be considered an aggravating factor, ABA Standards \u00a7 9.22(i), and that the imposition of other penalties and sanctions should be a mitigating factor,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4849650\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/160/355/#p366\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 9.32(k), we adopt the panel's conclusions. See\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 61 n.13.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Pope\n    </em>\n    , the victim was an elderly friend, but not a client, and there were no findings that the attorney's misconduct-committing identity theft-was related to her practice of law. Similarly, in\n    <em>\n     Neisner\n    </em>\n    , the respondent was convicted of four criminal charges after committing a hit-and-run and implicating his wife as the driver. The victims in that case, the motorcycle driver and potentially the respondent's wife, were not \"vulnerable victims\" in the manner that C.M. and P.B. are here. The respondent's misconduct in\n    <em>\n     Neisner\n    </em>\n    was not related to his practice of law or his relationships with his clients. Moreover, neither\n    <em>\n     Pope\n    </em>\n    nor\n    <em>\n     Neisner\n    </em>\n    involved a pattern of misconduct, as in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
