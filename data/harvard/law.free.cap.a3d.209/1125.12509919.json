(Circleville) appeals from the July 30, 2018 order of the Court of Common Pleas of Centre County (trial court) denying its procedural challenge to the validity of Ordinance No. 1034, which amended Chapter 27 Part 7 of the Ferguson Township, Pa., Zoning Ordinance (2015) (Zoning Ordinance) relating to the Traditional Town Development (TTD), a mixed use zoning district.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In so concluding, the trial court found that Ordinance No. 1034-2017 (Ordinance No. 1034)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   was a text amendment and rejected Circleville's assertion that Ordinance No. 1034 involved a zoning map change requiring Township of Ferguson (Township) to follow the additional notice requirements of Section 609(b) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC), 53 P.S. \u00a7 10609(b), pertaining to zoning map changes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon review, we conclude that the trial court did not err as a matter of law or abuse its discretion when it held that Ordinance No. 1034 made textual amendments to the Zoning Ordinance. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Residential Housing Land, LLC and Residential Housing Development, LLC (together, Developer) own an equitable interest in property located in the Township at the intersection of Blue Course Drive and Old Gatesburg Road. Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 150a. In 2010, Developer received approval to develop the property into a TTD known as Pine Hall Traditional Town Development (Pine Hall).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Township approved Developer's plan for Pine Hall subject to certain conditions and modifications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Circleville also owns property in the Township, which abuts the Developer's property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3a. In 2011, Circleville received approval to develop its property named \"Turnberry\" as a TTD subject to compliance with conditions of approval and modifications granted under the Zoning Ordinance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 16, 2017, Developer submitted an application with the Township seeking to amend the Zoning Ordinance and attached thereto a draft ordinance. R.R. at 149a. In the application, Developer explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The Pine Hall TTD Master Plan provided for the development of the property over a period of 20 years, including a commercial town center, office uses, and 692 residential units. However, due to changing market conditions, only two phases of the approved Pine Hall TTD Master Plan were ever submitted and approved for development through the Specific Implementation Plan process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [Developer] is interested in resuming development of the Pine Hall TTD Master Plan. However, due to the changes in market conditions affecting the development potential of the Property, and to several inherent conflicts and contradictions within the current ... Zoning Ordinance ... proposed changes to the approved TTD Master Plan are necessary. The changes will facilitate the construction and development of the site as\n   a cohesive and economically sustainable [TTD]. As a prerequisite to formal revision of the Pine Hall Master Plan, the [Developer] has been working closely with the Township staff over the past 2 years to develop a \"Concept Plan\" that would achieve the core design objectives of the Township while still addressing the changing market conditions that necessitate revisions to the TTD Master Plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 150a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 20, 2017, the Township Board of Supervisors (Board) accepted Developer's application and forwarded it to the Township Planning Commission for review and recommendation. R.R. at 721a. On May 8, 2017 and June 26, 2017, the Planning Commission reviewed the application and draft application with presentation and comments provided by Developer, Circleville and the public.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 766a-75a &amp; 784a-90a. On June 26, 2017, the Planning Commission recommended that the Board grant Developer's application by enacting the draft ordinance as a text amendment to the existing Zoning Ordinance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 790a. The Township provided public notice of the hearing on the application adhering to the provisions for a text amendment but admits that it did not follow the notice requirements for a zoning map change as provided in Section 609(b) of the MPC, 53 P.S. \u00a7 10609(b). Township's Brief at 11. After public notice, on September 5, 2017, the Board held a public hearing on the application and draft ordinance. R.R. at 741a-42a. The Board continued the public hearing to September 18, 2017, and on that day, the Board adopted the draft ordinance as Ordinance No. 1034.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 742a &amp; 751a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 13, 2017, Circleville filed a notice of appeal with the trial court, wherein it asserted that the changes made by Ordinance No. 1034 to the Zoning Ordinance have the \"overall effect of comprehensively changing the nature of the zoning scheme\" in the mixed use district for the \"benefit of a single tract of land being developed by a single developer to the detriment of [Circleville] and the Township as a whole.\" 10/13/17 Notice of Appeal \u00b69. Circleville further asserted that the \"changes to the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance governing TTDs result in a substantial and comprehensive change to the manner in which the Developer's Property is zoned in comparison to the adjacent tract of land, [Circleville's] [p]roperty, such that [Ordinance No. 1034] effectively constitutes a map change by the Township\" without complying with Section 609(b) of the MPC's notice requirements, 53 P.S. \u00a7 10609(b). 10/13/17 Notice of Appeal \u00b610. Circleville argued that due to the Township's failure to comply with the notice requirements applicable to a zoning map change, Ordinance No. 1034 is \"void from inception.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b620.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Developer filed a notice of intervention, R.R. at 135a, and the Township submitted to the trial court a copy of the certified record of this matter, which included the application, the Zoning Ordinance, the meeting minutes of the Board and Planning Commission, and Ordinance No. 1034.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 143a-46a. The trial court did not take additional evidence on the matter, and after briefing by the parties and oral argument, the trial court issued an order denying Circleville's appeal. Trial Court Opinion and Order dated 7/30/18 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In rendering its decision, the trial court reviewed three decisions of this Court, upon which the parties relied, that addressed text amendments and zoning map changes to guide its disposition of this matter:\n   <em>\n    Embreeville Redevelopment, L.P. v. Board of Supervisors of West Bradford Township\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6816191\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/1122/6816191/\">\n    134 A.3d 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.

Cmwlth. 2010). Trial Court Opinion and Order dated 7/30/18 at 2-3. After summarizing these decisions, the trial court concluded that Ordinance No. 1034 is a text amendment because it is \"most similar to the\n   <em>\n    Takacs\n   </em>\n   decision,\" where this Court held that the ordinance at issue was a text amendment and not a zoning map change requiring notice per Section 609(b) of the MPC, as was present with the ordinances in\n   <em>\n    Embreeville\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court found that the changes in Ordinance No. 1034 to the Zoning Ordinance \"are not entirely new, are compatible with the current ordinance's zoning, [ (unlike the ordinance in\n   <em>\n    Embreeville\n   </em>\n   ) ] and does not essentially create a new zoning scheme as in\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   .\" Trial Court Opinion and Order dated 7/30/18 at 4. To support its finding, the trial court explained that Ordinance No. 1034 did not establish a \"discrete area,\" that is, Ordinance No. 1034 did not change the zoning of any particular property or provide for special uses or regulations that apply to a limited area in relation to the surrounding properties as was present in\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Although the new uses at issue may make the mixed use district \"more suburban or urban aesthetically,\" the trial court explained that \"[p]ermitting additional uses in the zone or uses that change the aesthetical character of the zone\" are not considered zoning map changes per\n   <em>\n    Takacs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7286536\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/11/587/\">\n    11 A.3d at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Trial Court Opinion and Order dated 7/30/18 at 4. The trial court further noted that \"many of the issues that [Circleville] has with the amendment are changes in the allowable sizes of aspects of the properties in the original ordinance and not necessarily even new uses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7286536\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/11/587/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Circleville brought the instant appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On appeal, Circleville asserts that the trial court erred as a matter of law and abused its discretion when it concluded that Ordinance No. 1034 was a text amendment because the trial court \"failed to take the changes as a whole and consider the 'overall effect of the changes' \" to the Zoning Ordinance. Circleville's Brief at 24. Circleville argues that Ordinance No. 1034 made changes to the Zoning Ordinance solely for the benefit of Developer and \"comprehensively rezones\" Developer's property by eradicating the \"zoning standards and procedures upon which [Circleville] previously relied to create its traditional neighborhood development,\" Turnberry, and continues to rely for development of its remaining phases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Circleville further asserts that the changes imposed by Ordinance No. 1034 \"are so dissimilar to what was previously permitted\" in the mixed use district that it effectively rezoned the district \"to whatever Developer requested, without following the necessary notice requirements for a zoning map change\" pursuant to Section 609(b) of the MPC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Prior to addressing Circleville's arguments, a review of the tests and factors used by this Court to analyze the ordinances in\n   <em>\n    Embreeville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Takacs\n   </em>\n   is warranted to aid in our evaluation of Ordinance No. 1034.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To ascertain whether an ordinance is a text amendment or map change, we are to evaluate the \"overall effect of the changes\" that the ordinance imposes on the existing zoning ordinance.\n   <em>\n    Embreeville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6816191\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/1122/6816191/\">\n    134 A.3d at 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the ordinance adds\n   new uses that change \"\n   <em>\n    the entire nature\n   </em>\n   \" of the existing zoning district such that it, in essence, creates a new land use category, then the ordinance represents a comprehensive zoning scheme, that is, a zoning map change.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6816191\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/1122/6816191/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6816191\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/1122/6816191/\">\n    at 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    Embreeville\n   </em>\n   , this Court examined the language of the ordinance and evidence in the record, and held that the effect of the changes imposed by the ordinance \"effectuated comprehensive change to [the township's] I-Industrial Zoning District because it effectively created a new residential zoning district within that zoning district.\"\n   <em>\n    Embreeville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6816191\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/1122/6816191/\">\n    134 A.3d at 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court explained that the ordinance made substantial changes to the township code to allow medium and high-density residential uses (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , garden apartments, multi-family dwellings, quadraplexes, townhomes, twins and duplexes) in the township's I-Industrial Zoning District.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6816191\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/1122/6816191/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1125 &amp; 1127.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Specifically, the ordinance in\n   <em>\n    Embreeville\n   </em>\n   amended the township's code to \"revise the purpose of the I-Industrial District\" to include a \"variety of higher-density housing options ... within close proximity to nearby commercial centers[,]\" increased conditional uses, and amended sections IV through X of the township's code to accommodate the new uses.\n   <em>\n    Embreeville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6816191\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/1122/6816191/\">\n    134 A.3d at 1128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To accomplish these changes, the ordinance consisted of six pages, five of which imposed new area, bulk and design standards, to enable this new use to fit within the existing zoning.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6816191\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/1122/6816191/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6816191\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/1122/6816191/\">\n    at 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically,\n   <em>\n    if an ordinance contains changes that are so comprehensive in nature as to result in a substantial change to the manner in which the tract of land is zoned in comparison to the surrounding tracts of land that were similarly zoned\n   </em>\n   , then that ordinance will constitute a map change.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7307718\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/71/1103/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   , this Court held that the ordinance constituted a map change because the municipality, through the ordinance, created a \"comprehensive zoning scheme\" that applied to a specific property owned by developer, a 140,000 square-foot office building, within the existing special business district.\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7307718\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/71/1103/\">\n    71 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1105 &amp; 1109. In so concluding, this Court in\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   examined the language of the ordinance and made two observations.

Here, the trial court concluded that the new uses imposed by Ordinance No. 1034 at issue are \"not entirely new and incompatible to the current previous zones' uses.\" Trial Court Opinion and Order dated 7/30/18 at 3. Ordinance No. 1034 provides four categories of changes: (1) it allows for dwelling units in a TTD to be used by a family or up to four unrelated persons; (2) it allows for drive-through facilities; (3) it provides that the\n   Board may grant modifications from the design standards applicable to a TTD as provided therein; and (4) it amends certain design and dimension criteria set forth in the Zoning Ordinance. R.R. at 700a. Upon review, we conclude that these changes do not alter the nature of the TTD, a mixed use district, and therefore, the trial court did not err as a matter of law or abuse its discretion in so concluding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First, Ordinance No. 1034 adjusted the composition of residential uses by adding the following provision to the Zoning Ordinance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   When 100 or more such dwelling units in a [TTD] are under common management, each such dwelling unit under such common management may be used\n   <em>\n    by one family or up to four unrelated persons\n   </em>\n   , subject to the permitted occupancy of the dwelling as determined by the Centre Region Code Office in accordance with the provisions of the [Township] Housing Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   R.R. at 700a (emphasis added). Although Circleville asserts that this amendment changed the definition of family,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Circleville's Brief at 30, this is not correct. As provided above, the language expands the use of residential units to include \"one family\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   up to four unrelated persons.\" R.R. at 700a (emphasis added). \"When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\" 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8427521\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/896/659/#p669\">\n    896 A.2d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 669 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2006) (providing that \"[t]he rules of statutory construction are applicable to statutes and ordinances alike\"). Though the effect of this change may increase the density of the TTD by expanding an existing permitted residential use, a purpose of the TTD is to minimize suburban sprawl and facilitate the development of \"fully integrated mixed use\" neighborhoods in areas of the Township where appropriate. Zoning Ordinance \u00a7 27-701(1)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Expanding the residential use to allow more persons to reside in a dwelling, as defined therein, within the TTD minimizes sprawl and furthers a goal of integrating mixed uses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Takacs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7286536\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/11/587/\">\n    11 A.3d at 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that changes imposed by ordinance \"make[ ] sense\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, Ordinance No. 1034 permits drive-through services for a \"maximum of two commercial uses\" and removes the existing prohibition of \"drive-through or drive-in establishments\" in a TTD. R.R. at 351a &amp; 705a. Although this change added a new use to the mixed use district, it\n   did not \"change the entire nature\" of the district to create a new land use category.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Embreeville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6816191\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/1122/6816191/\">\n    134 A.3d at 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ordinance No. 1034 provided the following conditions to the new use: it cannot directly access a road on the periphery of the development; it cannot be located on adjacent lots; the layout \"must be approved by Township staff, and may be required to deviate from standard franchise footprints\"; and \"[a]ll layout and design shall consider and shall not compromise pedestrian convenience, safety, or detract from the overall walkability of the [TTD].\" R.R. at 705a. Adding drive-through services as a permitted use with the aforementioned conditions is not inconsistent with the overall intent of a TTD, which is, in part, to \"diversify and integrate land uses within close proximity to each other.\" Zoning Ordinance \u00a7 27-701(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Third, Ordinance No. 1034 adds provisions to the Zoning Ordinance defining the standards used by the Board to grant modifications from the design elements of a TTD. Ordinance No. 1034 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The Board of Supervisors\n   <em>\n    may allow\n   </em>\n   for modification of the design standards applicable to a [TTD] provided for in this Section 27-701, including,\n   <em>\n    but not limited to compactness, pedestrian orientation, street geometry or other related design features, in accordance with the standards\n   </em>\n   applicable to the grant of modifications under Chapter 22, Subdivision and Land Development, \u00a7 22-105.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   R.R. at 701a (emphasis added). Section 22-105 provides for modifications, in part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   An applicant may request the Board of Supervisors to grant a modification of the requirements of one or more provisions of this Chapter\n   <em>\n    if the literal enforcement will exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions to the land in question; provided, that such modification will not be contrary to the public interest and that the purpose of the intent of this Chapter is observed\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Township of Ferguson Subdivision and Land Development Regulations, Pa.

Though Circleville contends that Ordinance No. 1034 altered the Board's authority to grant modifications and \"strips the Township of its discretion,\" Circleville's Brief at 27, this is not entirely accurate as Ordinance No. 1034 expressly provides that the Board \"may allow for modification of the design standards and criteria applicable to a [TTD]\" in accordance with the standards provided therein. R.R. at 701a. The standards provided therein are consistent with the standards in the MPC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Specifically, Section 708.1-A of the MPC provides that the municipality may enact ordinance provisions applying to a traditional neighborhood development to address the design standards appropriate for this type of development. Added by Section 3 of the Act of November 23, 2010, P.L. 1101, 53 P.S. \u00a7 10708.1-A. These standards may include, but are not limited to, \"\n   <em>\n    compactness, pedestrian orientation, street geometry or other related design features\n   </em>\n   \" subject to modification similar to Section 512.1.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6816191\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/1122/6816191/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).

Specifically, Section 4 removed the prohibition that townhouses cannot be accessed from the front and allows townhouses to have, in some instances, front entry garages, but limits front entry garages to \"no more than 50%\" of the overall number. R.R. at 341a-42a &amp; 701a.

Though the changes were proposed to the Township by Developer, the changes apply to any property owner implementing a TTD in a mixed use district. Ordinance No. 1034 amended several sections of the Zoning Ordinance but, upon review of the sections, the changes adjusted existing provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. Taken as a whole, Ordinance No. 1034 did not substantially change the nature of the district as a mixed use district.
