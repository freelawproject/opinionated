It is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FURTHER ORDERED that Melinda Maldonado is hereby disbarred from the practice of law in the District of Columbia,\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   to May 14, 2019.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Shephard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6767187,6767206\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/128/644/\">\n    128 A.3d 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. 2015) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Barneys\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9192561\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/861/1270/#p1273\">\n    861 A.2d 1270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1273 (D.C. 2004) (supporting the imposition of disbarment as reciprocal discipline where the state of Maryland found that the actions of a non-barred attorney in that state justified disbarment and excluded the attorney from exercising the privilege of practicing law in that state). To the extent respondent attempts to challenge the imposition of reciprocal discipline by requesting\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review by this court of the underlying factual findings and discipline imposed by the State of Maryland, such a challenge is improper in reciprocal disciplinary proceedings. Further, as we do not review the evidence de novo or accept additional information in reciprocal disciplinary cases, we decline to review evidence or exhibits that respondent has annotated and submitted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Zdravkovich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9090555\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/831/964/#p969\">\n    831 A.2d 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 969 (D.C. 2003) (\"Put simply, reciprocal discipline proceedings are not a forum to reargue the foreign discipline.\"). Therefore, because respondent failed to rebut the presumption that reciprocal discipline should be imposed, we impose reciprocal discipline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Sibley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7289674\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/990/483/\">\n    990 A.2d 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. 2010), and\n   <em>\n    In re Fuller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8347738\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/930/194/#p198\">\n    930 A.2d 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 198 (D.C. 2007) (rebuttable presumption of identical reciprocal discipline applies unless one of the exceptions is established).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
