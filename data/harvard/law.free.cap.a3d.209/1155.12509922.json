PSP contends that OAG erred when it ordered PSP to amend its database to reflect that Sama was not prohibited from carrying or possessing firearms, based solely on a Delaware pardon for his prior narcotics conviction, when the Pennsylvania Uniform Firearms Act of 1995 (UFA)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   requires an order from the court of common pleas relieving the firearms disability, in addition to the pardon. We are also presented with Sama's request for attorney fees and costs. Upon review, we affirm OAG's order and deny, without prejudice, Sama's request for attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In June 2017, Sama submitted an application for a license to carry a firearm. PSP denied the application when a Pennsylvania Instant Check System (PICS) report indicated that Sama had a disqualifying conviction. Sama challenged the denial. By letter dated August 23, 2017, PSP notified Sama that the denial was confirmed pursuant to Section 6109(e) of UFA, 18 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6109(e), based on the disqualifying conviction for a 1998 delivery of a narcotic substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   From this decision, Sama timely filed an appeal with OAG, pursuant to Section 6111.1(e) of UFA, 18 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6111.1(e). An administrative law judge (ALJ) of OAG held a hearing on January 8, 2018. The parties stipulated to two PSP exhibits (PICS Challenge Packet and Superior Court Criminal Docket) and to the following facts. Sama was convicted on April 27, 1998 in Delaware of delivery of a narcotic schedule II controlled substance. Sama received a pardon from the then-Governor of Delaware on August 11, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The ALJ determined that Sama was convicted under a Delaware statute, which is equivalent to an offense under The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act (Drug Act).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Had Sama not been pardoned, he would not be able to possess a firearm pursuant to Section 6105(c)(2) of UFA and would not be able to obtain a license to carry a firearm pursuant to Section 6109(e)(1)(iii), (viii) of UFA. However, as the parties stipulated, the then-Governor of Delaware pardoned Sama on August 11, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The ALJ opined that, under Delaware law, a pardon removes all legal punishments and disabilities attached to a conviction. Thus, under Delaware law, an unconditional\n   pardon restores the right to possess firearms and hold a license to carry. Further, the ALJ determined that this Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania State Police v. McCaffrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9366629\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/816/374/\">\n    816 A.2d 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.

Accordingly, the ALJ granted Sama the relief requested and ordered PSP to amend the PICS database within 30 days so as to remove, as it pertains to Sama, the disability imposed by Sections 6105(c)(2) and 6109(e) of UFA. From this decision, PSP timely petitioned for review with this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   PSP contends the ALJ committed an error of law when it ordered PSP to amend its database to reflect that Sama was not prohibited from possessing or carrying firearms, based solely on a Delaware pardon for his prior narcotics conviction. According to PSP, UFA requires an order from the court of common pleas relieving the firearms disability, in addition to the pardon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Sama counters that, because his Delaware offense was fully pardoned, he was no longer \"convicted,\" as defined by Section 6102 of UFA, of an offense, and, therefore, the ALJ's determination must be affirmed. Sama requests attorney fees pursuant to Section 9183(b) of the Criminal History Records Information Act (CHRIA), 18 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 9183(b) ; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925a ; and\n   <em>\n    Haron v.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Firearm Disability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   PSP contends that the ALJ erred by ordering PSP to amend its database to reflect that Sama was not prohibited from possessing firearms. Sama was convicted of a narcotics offense in the state of Delaware, for which he was later pardoned by the then-Governor of Delaware. PSP maintains that Sama's felony narcotics conviction resulted in a prohibition from possessing firearms under Section 6105(c)(2) of UFA, as well as a prohibition from being issued a license to carry under 6109(e)(1). Even though Sama received a full pardon for his offense, PSP argues that Section 6123 of UFA makes it clear that a pardon, in and of itself, does not lift a firearm disability. Rather, relief is also required under Section 6105(d)(2), which provides for relief from the court of common pleas from such a prohibition if one has received a full pardon. The decision of the ALJ that the pardon alone removes all disabilities under UFA is contrary to the rules of statutory construction because it effectively renders Sections 6105(d)(2) and 6123 of UFA mere surplusage by failing to give all parts of the law full effect. PSP claims that only its interpretation gives full effect to all parts of the statute and is logically consistent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Section 6109(e)(1) of UFA, governing the issuance of a firearm license, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (e) Issuance of license.-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (1) A license to carry a firearm shall be for the purpose of carrying a firearm concealed on or about one's person or in a vehicle and shall be issued if, after an investigation not to exceed 45 days, it appears that the applicant is an individual\n   concerning whom no good cause exists to deny the license.

C.S. \u00a7 6105(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Section 6105(d) creates an exemption to the prohibition to possess a firearm. 18 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6105(d). \"A person who has been convicted of a crime\" under subsection (c)(2), \"may make application to the court of common pleas of the county where the principal residence of the applicant is situated for relief from disability imposed by this section upon the possession, transfer or control of a firearm\" if the \"conviction has been the subject of a full pardon by the Governor.\" 18 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6105(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Section 6102 of UFA defines \"conviction\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A conviction, a finding of guilty or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, whether or not judgment of sentence has been imposed,\n   <em>\n    as determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the prosecution was held.

C.S. \u00a7 6123.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The parties present differing interpretations of the statutes. PSP argues that Sama remains \"[a] person who has been convicted\" of a disabling offense under UFA even though his \"conviction has been the subject of a full pardon by the Governor.\" 18 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6105(d). Therefore, PSP asserts that, pursuant to Sections 6105(d) and 6123 of UFA, in order for Sama to obtain relief from the prohibition to possess, transfer or control a firearm, he must \"make an application to the court of common pleas ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Conversely, Sama maintains that, because he received a full pardon from the Governor, with no prohibition on his ability to possess or transport firearms, he is not a person \"convicted of a crime\" for purposes of Section 6105(d), and his pardoned \"conviction\" no longer constitutes a disabling offense under UFA. Therefore, he is not required to \"make an application to the\n   court of common pleas ... \" in order to have the disability removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   When interpreting a statute, we turn to the Statutory Construction Act of 1972 (Statutory Construction Act)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   for guidance.\n   <em>\n    Bayada Nurses, Inc. v.

The petitioner appealed and the ALJ ruled that the New York certificate relieved the petitioner of firearms disability in Pennsylvania and directed PSP to amend the petitioner's criminal history to afford him relief from firearms disability. PSP appealed. PSP similarly argued that the petitioner was barred from obtaining a license by the prohibition contained in Section 6109(e)(1)(viii) of UFA having been convicted of a disabling crime and the New York certificate did not satisfy the criteria of Section 6123 of UFA. We disagreed.

This Court issued a decision in his favor, but denied his request for actual and punitive damages. On appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that \"CHRIA provides for the possibility of actual and real damages, and reasonable costs of litigation and counsel fees, where a person was found to have been aggrieved by a violation of CHRIA.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196057,7292755\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/983/627/\">\n    983 A.2d at 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This Court concluded that PSP maintained an incorrect criminal history record with respect to the petitioner in violation of Section 9111 of CHRIA, 18 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 9111, which resulted\n   in the wrongful denial of his constitutional right to purchase a firearm for a period of several months and required him to ultimately obtain counsel to correct.
