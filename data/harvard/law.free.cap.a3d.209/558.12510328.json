(Xpress Sweeping) (collectively defendants). This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on March 5, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After carefully reviewing the record, we are satisfied that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgments of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In the light most favorable to plaintiff, the facts, as set forth in the record, are as follows. At approximately 7 a.m. on March 1, 2013, plaintiff parked her car in the parking lot of a Stop &amp; Shop supermarket located in Smithfield, Rhode Island.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As she was walking from her car to the entrance of the Stop &amp; Shop, plaintiff slipped and fell on what she characterizes as black ice, and suffered injuries to her right hand and wrist. The plaintiff filed suit against Stop &amp; Shop on December 10, 2015, alleging negligence on the part of Stop &amp; Shop for her resulting injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stop &amp; Shop answered plaintiff's complaint and also filed a third-party complaint against Xpress Sweeping to defend, indemnify, and hold Stop &amp; Shop harmless for any claims arising out of Xpress Sweeping's duty under defendants' snow services agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Both Stop &amp; Shop and Xpress Sweeping filed motions for summary judgment in accordance with Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Essentially, defendants argued that plaintiff failed to assert sufficient facts necessary to satisfy the elements of her negligence claim\n   because plaintiff testified at her deposition that she did not see, feel, or in any manner observe ice at or near the location of her fall. The defendants therefore argued that plaintiff could only \"speculate\" that her fall was caused by black ice. The plaintiff objected to defendants' motions and claimed that her deposition testimony \"was based on a sound inference clearly supported by scientific fact.\" She thus argued that summary judgment was not proper because this testimony, coupled with meteorologist Steven Cascione's affidavit and meteorological report, gave rise to a disputed issue of material fact as to whether there was black ice in the parking lot of the Stop &amp; Shop where she fell. The defendants' motions were heard and decided together on September 20, 2017. After hearing the arguments of counsel, the trial justice granted both motions, and separate Rule 54(b) final judgments were entered in favor of defendants. The plaintiff filed notices of appeal from both, and her appeals were consolidated in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"This Court reviews a grant of summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Long v.

In turn, defendants argue that this Court should affirm the judgments because plaintiff failed to produce sufficient evidence, beyond mere speculation and conjecture, that there was a dangerous condition in the parking lot of Stop &amp; Shop on March 1, 2013. We disagree with defendants' contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   It is well settled that \"to prevail on a claim of negligence 'a plaintiff must establish a legally cognizable duty owed by a defendant to a plaintiff, a breach of that duty, proximate causation between the conduct and the resulting injury, and the actual loss or damage.' \"\n   <em>\n    Habershaw v.

One of the threshold inquiries in a slip-and-fall case is the existence of a dangerous condition on the premises, and, so, at the summary-judgment hearing, plaintiff was required to present evidence that her fall was the result of an unseen danger, such as black ice. The plaintiff submitted an affidavit prepared by meteorologist Steven Cascione that analyzed the weather conditions the day before the incident, as well as the morning of plaintiff's fall. Mr. Cascione's affidavit and attached report explained that the temperature fluctuation on March 1, 2013, with a drop from 33.8 degrees at 4:15 a.m. to 30.2 degrees at 5:55 a.m., and then back up to 33.8 degrees at 7:15 a.m., along with little wind and partly cloudy skies, was an ideal condition for radiational cooling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Cascione expounded further upon the temperature fluctuation and stated that, on February 28, 2013, the day before plaintiff's fall, the temperature reached a high of 42 degrees, which would allow for melting of any snow or ice on ground surfaces. Mr. Cascione then reviewed two photographs taken in April 2016 that depicted a snow pile similar to that which was near the area where plaintiff fell on March 1, 2013. He stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"After reviewing the pictures that you presented to me of a snow pile in the Stop and Shop parking lot, it is through my Meteorological expertise, that melting would occur from the snow pile in question producing runoff on February 28th into the early morning hours of March 1, 2013 before the temperature fell below freezing. If the melting snow or runoff was not treated with a deicing chemical, then ice would form from the below freezing temperatures in the time frame stated earlier on the morning of March 1, 2013. Also with the low sun angle around 7 AM on March 1[,] 2013, it may have been hard to see the formation of ice as it can often blend in with the asphalt. That is where the term Black Ice comes from.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Cascione's affidavit concluded with the following: \"It is my opinion that the cause of the slip and fall suffered by [plaintiff] was a direct and proximate result of black ice o[n] the surface of the asphalt that she had walked on, while traversing from her parked vehicle to the entrance of Stop and Shop[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In addition to Mr. Cascione's affidavit, plaintiff also offered a transcript of her deposition testimony in support of her opposition to defendants' motions for summary judgment. She testified that, at approximately 7 a.m. on March 1, 2013, it was neither raining nor snowing; however, it was a cold day with no sun because it was still early morning. When she got out of her car, she testified, the parking lot was \"generally clean and dry[,]\" except for a pile of snow that was piled on and around a parking lot median between her car and the entrance to Stop &amp; Shop. She\n   testified that, as she was walking to the entrance, she did not notice any ice on the ground; however, when she fell it \"felt like somebody pulled the rug out from under [her] and [she] just went down and landed on [her] wrist[.]\" When asked if she observed any ice on the ground where she fell, plaintiff testified that she \"did not notice ice or [she] would have avoided it.\" She also testified that, although she did not see any ice before or after her fall, she knew there was black ice where she fell because otherwise she \"wouldn't have fallen the way [she] did.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At her deposition, plaintiff also presented two photographs taken approximately three years after the incident that depicted how the area looked to her on the day she fell. The photographs show a pile of snow adjacent to a handicapped parking spot on and around a parking lot median directly across from the entrance to Stop &amp; Shop. The plaintiff testified that, on the day she fell, the snow pile was smaller than what was shown in the two photographs and that she was not sure of the height of the pile on the day she fell, but that it was not \"spread out this way. I think it was just a pile.\" She further testified: \"[T]he reason I took the pictures is I wanted to show that this was where the snow was piled\n   <em>\n    every storm\n   </em>\n   . Since 2013, I have seen snow piled there\n   <em>\n    every time\n   </em>\n   there's a storm. It's never cleared away.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Under our well-established summary-judgment standard, and viewing the evidence and inferences to be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, we conclude that plaintiff satisfied her burden of \"produc[ing] competent evidence that proves the existence of a disputed issue of material fact\" such that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the cause of plaintiff's fall was, in fact, black ice.\n   <em>\n    Wyso v. Full Moon Tide, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7303843\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/78/747/#p750\">\n    78 A.3d 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 750 (R.I. 2013) (brackets omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sullo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7308108\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/68/404/#p406\">\n    68 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   407 ). This is a fact that is capable of proof by direct evidence or proof by inference. The defendants are free to challenge plaintiff's assertions and argue that there was no black ice present in the area of plaintiff's fall, and that plaintiff's version of facts is incorrect. However, at the summary-judgment stage, a trial justice must not weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations. Rather, a trial justice must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and determine if that party has submitted sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact. We hold that plaintiff has done so and that the trial justice erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The sole issue before the trial justice was whether there were genuine issues of material fact as to the dangerous condition that caused plaintiff's fall that would preclude summary judgment. In determining whether an issue is genuine for purposes of summary judgment, a trial justice cannot consider the merits, make credibility determinations, evaluate testimony, or weigh the evidence. Instead, the trial justice \"must review the pleadings, affidavits, admissions, answers to interrogatories, and other appropriate evidence from a perspective most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Gliottone v.

However, in the case at bar, the trial justice undertook a factual determination and weighed expert testimony when she stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"[W]hat the [c]ourt is stuck with is this idea that what he looked at, those pictures-and it's interesting. As counsel points out, not only can I say they're not similar to the snowbanks that were present on that day, your own client actually stated they're not; that the ones that\n   were there that day were much smaller. I don't know how much value, or whether or not that rises to the level, I should say, of the competent evidence that plaintiff needs to produce because I don't know that it is competent.

With that information, the expert opined in his affidavit that the decedent was struck in the head by sheet metal that had been pushed forward by the lift arm of the snowplow, given that the blow to the head was the same size, shape, and rigidity, there had been no other objects of the like near the decedent's head, and, thus, the defendant's product had caused the injury.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10506113\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/8/88/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10506113\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/8/88/\">\n     at 93\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Nevertheless, the court disregarded the expert's affidavit, reasoning that his \"bald assertion that no other part of the car or truck had that particular shape is difficult to accept, given that [the expert] never had the opportunity to examine the [car] after the accident.\"\n    <em>\n     Hayes\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10506113\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/8/88/\">\n     8 F.3d at 93\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Cascione founded his opinion on photographs of a snowbank taken three years after Voccola's fall, and no testimony was provided as to the size or shape of the snowbank on the day of the accident-the pictures merely indicated the same general area where the snowbank was formed. Moreover, he based his opinion in part on Voccola's deposition; and, in that deposition, when asked about the size and shape of the snowbank, Voccola merely stated that \"[i]t must have been in my line of view but I didn't really notice it * * *.\" Furthermore, Cascione never went to the scene of the accident; as such, he could not determine whether any slopes, elevations, or divots in the pavement could have prevented the alleged black ice from forming in the area where Voccola fell. Finally, Cascione stated that there may have been a shadow, making it difficult to see any ice formation in the Stop &amp; Shop parking lot; however, Voccola directly contradicted that fact in her deposition, when she testified that she did not observe any shadows on the day of her accident.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Based on the above factors, the hearing justice determined that the Cascione affidavit was not competent evidence, thus rendering it inadmissible. As such, she did not consider the affidavit when ruling on the defendants' motion for summary judgment. Because the Superior Court, in the Rule 56 context, views only\n    <em>\n     admissible\n    </em>\n    evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, there was nothing for the hearing justice to weigh when she granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12505157\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/200/153/#p156\">\n     200 A.3d at 156\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . From my review of the record in the instant matter, I cannot say that the hearing justice erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants, as neither Voccola's deposition testimony, nor the Cascione affidavit, was competent on the issue of the existence of black ice on the day that Voccola fell.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    For the above-stated reasons, I must respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
