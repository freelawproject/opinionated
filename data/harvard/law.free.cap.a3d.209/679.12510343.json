Irizarry, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered\n   against him following a jury trial on one count each of assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (1) and (2), and one count each of breach of the peace in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) and (2). On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of second degree assault in violation of \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (1), and (2) prosecutorial improprieties during closing argument resulted in the violation of his right to a fair trial. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury was presented with the following evidence on which to base its verdict. On March 22, 2014, the victim, David\n   Bennett, was standing in front of a neighborhood market in New Britain when he encountered the defendant exiting the market. After a short verbal exchange between them, the defendant retrieved a golf club from a vehicle parked on the opposite side of the street and began to chase the victim. During the course of his pursuit, the defendant struck the victim several times with the golf club, including once in the arm and once in the face, which resulted in the victim being knocked to the ground. While the victim was on the ground, the defendant continued to strike him with the club, hitting him at least once in the chest. An eyewitness called 911 and reported the incident. The defendant was later arrested when a truck matching the description of the vehicle that fled the scene of the assault was stopped by New Britain police. The defendant was found crouching in the rear cargo hold of the vehicle. A golf club was also found in the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In a four count information, the defendant was charged with assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   assault in the second degree in\n   violation of \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   breach of the peace in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1), and breach of the peace in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the five day trial, the jury heard testimony with respect to the assault and the victim's injuries, which included an admission by the defendant that he struck the victim with a golf club. As a result of the assault, the victim experienced a momentary loss of consciousness and suffered a fractured jaw. Emergency medical responders found that the victim was bleeding from his left ear when they arrived at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The victim's treating physician, Paul Edward Russo, Jr., testified at trial that the victim sustained injuries to his left cheek, left jaw, right forearm and chest wall. Russo further testified that when the victim presented at the hospital emergency department, his arm was tender and swollen, with a visible contusion and skin avulsion, in addition to a contusion on the left side of the face. A computerized axial tomography scan revealed a nondisplaced fracture of the victim's lower jaw. Three sutures were necessary to close the wound on the victim's face. The victim was discharged from the hospital\n   after he was treated with antibiotics and analgesics, with instructions that he restrict his diet to liquid puree. He was further instructed to follow-up at a maxillofacial clinic regarding his jaw injury. The victim testified that, as of the date of trial, his jaw still was not fully healed.\n   As part of his trial strategy, the defendant chose to testify in his own defense. Specifically, he testified that, although he did, in fact, strike the defendant, he did so in self-defense. Despite the defendant's testimony, the jury found the defendant guilty on all charges. On May 26, 2016, the defendant was sentenced to seven years of incarceration, followed by three years of special parole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant raises two claims on appeal. The defendant first claims that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of assault in the second degree under \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (1), in that the state did not establish that he caused \"serious physical injury\" to the victim, as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the defendant claims that he was deprived of a fair trial because of prosecutorial improprieties during closing argument, in particular, the prosecutor's reference to and reliance on facts not in the record. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant first claims that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he caused \"serious physical injury\" to the victim, as defined by \u00a7 53a-3 (4).

We believe that these cases are instructive with respect to the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Here, the defendant struck the victim with the head of a golf club at least three times: once in the arm; once in the face, causing the fracture of the lower jaw and thereby affecting his consciousness; and once in the chest, after he had fallen to the ground. These blows caused the victim to suffer contusions, abrasions, and bleeding from his ear. Furthermore, almost two years after the attack, the victim testified that his jaw was still fractured. Although permanency is not a requirement of \"serious physical injury,\" under the present circumstances, the lasting effects of the injuries on the victim are certainly relevant when considering the defendant's claim. Moreover, testimony and medical records admitted into evidence also established that the victim's injuries had a lasting effect on the functioning of his jaw and resulted in a material modification to his diet for a period after the attack. On the basis of the evidence in the record and the inferences that reasonably could\n   be drawn therefrom, construed in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, the jury reasonably could have concluded that victim suffered physical injury that caused \"serious impairment of health,\" such that he suffered \"serious physical injury\" under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-3 (4) and 53a-60 (a) (1). See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415605\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/146/589/#p608\">\n    146 Conn.

Accordingly, the defendant's claim must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Next, the defendant claims that he was deprived of his constitutional right to a fair trial because the prosecutor committed certain acts of impropriety during closing argument by arguing facts not in evidence. Specifically, the defendant claims that the prosecutor's argument regarding Russo's testimony, which addressed whether the kind of blunt force trauma experienced by the victim\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   cause a serious brain injury, was improper.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We\n   agree with the defendant that the prosecutor's argument with respect to Russo's testimony was improper. We agree with the state, however, that it did not deprive the defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The following standard of review informs our resolution of the defendant's claim. \"In analyzing claims of prosecutorial impropriety, we engage in a two step analytical process .... The two steps are separate and distinct .... We first examine whether prosecutorial\n   impropriety occurred .... Second, if an impropriety exists, we then examine whether it deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial .... In other words, an impropriety is an impropriety, regardless of its ultimate effect on the fairness of the trial.

The question was,\n   <em>\n    could it\n   </em>\n   -the previous question was\n   <em>\n    could it\n   </em>\n   .... [M]edical testimony has to be more certain than that.\" (Emphasis added.) The court sustained the objection, stating: \"The area of examination is appropriate. The form of the question is not.\" After additional unsuccessful attempts at properly framing the question, the state ceased the line of inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Despite the foregoing, during the state's closing argument as to count two, the prosecutor argued: \"Now, ask yourself, is a golf club a dangerous instrument? ... [Is it] capable of causing death or serious physical injury? ... The state submits to you that when you look at all the evidence, the injuries that the defendant caused [the victim] when he struck him with the golf club; [t]he fact that [the victim] had to get stitches to\n   his jaw, and the testimony of Dr. Russo that a force blunt blow to the head like the one that [the victim] received with the golf club\n   <em>\n    could cause a concussion or brain damage\n   </em>\n   ... you could find beyond a reasonable doubt that ... the defendant used ...\n   <em>\n    a dangerous instrument\n   </em>\n   ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In response to the prosecutor's argument, defense counsel emphasized in his closing argument that \"[t]he evidence that the state referred to is not in this case. The evidence that this injury could have led to a concussion or brain damage, I suggest to you ... [is] not in this case. I suggest to you that Dr. Russo gave you\n   <em>\n    no evidence\n   </em>\n   from which you could find\n   <em>\n    serious physical injury\n   </em>\n   in this case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After the conclusion of closing argument and after the jury had been excused for a short recess, defense counsel raised the following objection with the court: \"[T]he state's argument that ... the jaw fracture could have led to a concussion and then brain damage, [which] was the subject of my objections during the case ... I do not believe ... is evidence in [the record].\" The court explained that it would address defense counsel's objection in the following way: \"In my instructions, I stress in the first part that the ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   arguments of the attorneys are not evidence. If the evidence is different from what they believe the evidence is, they are to follow their own [recollection] .... So, your comments are noted, but you will see that I've addressed that situation.\" Thereafter, during the jury charge, the court provided a general charge explaining that argument is not evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The state contends that the prosecutor's argument simply urged the jury, on the basis of Russo's testimony, to draw a reasonable inference that a golf club, when swung at a person's head, could be considered a dangerous instrument that could cause serious injury. We find this claim unpersuasive under the present circumstances. It is true that, ordinarily or absent some compelling reason to the contrary, this may be a reasonable inference to draw. It is also true that, \"[w]hile the privilege of counsel in addressing the jury should not be too closely narrowed or unduly hampered, it must never be used as a license to state, or to comment [on], or to suggest an inference from, facts not in evidence, or to present matters which the jury ha[s] no right to consider.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maguire\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20535\">\n    310 Conn. at 553-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20828\">\n    78 A.3d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Here, the state's argument went beyond merely encouraging the jury to draw an inference-it argued the very evidence that the court had excluded from the record. Although a prosecutor is free to advance conclusions reasonably supported by the evidence, he or she may not use closing argument to argue evidence that has been excluded by the court.

We conclude, however, that the improper argument was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In considering the defendant's claim that the prosecutor's improper argument deprived him of the constitutional right to a fair trial, we begin by noting that, during the court's charge to the jury, the court made the following statement: \"[T]he defendant has been charged in an information. The information has been read to you at the beginning of the trial and will be with you during your deliberations .... Each count alleges a separate crime. It will be your duty to consider each count separately in deciding the guilt or not guilty of the defendant.\" The court continued by providing the jury with a description of each charge, as provided in the amended long form information. The court stated in relevant part: \"Count one, assault in the [second] degree ... [the defendant], with intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, caused such injury to such person, to wit,\n   <em>\n    fractured the mandible of\n   </em>\n   [the victim], in violation of \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (1) of the Connecticut General Statutes.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We further note that the court, by focusing its instruction as to count one on the specific conduct alleged in the long form information, namely, that the defendant had violated \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (1) because he \"fractured the mandible of [the victim],\" in effect, isolated and, rendered irrelevant, the prosecutor's improper argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although an alternative theory of \"serious physical injury\" relating to the victim's consciousness was advanced by the prosecutor, the subsequent instruction\n   focusing on the charge as presented in the long form information was material with respect to the defendant's claim. As discussed previously in this opinion, our review of the record indicates that there\n   was sufficient evidence presented at trial to support the conclusion that, as a result of the fractured mandible, the victim suffered a \"serious physical injury.\" Here, because the court's instruction re-oriented the jury's focus to the issue of whether the victim's broken jaw constituted a \"serious physical injury,\" and because the prosecutor's reference to the excluded testimony did not relate to whether the victim's broken jaw constituted a \"serious physical injury,\" the state's improper argument was too remote, in the context of the present appeal, to be considered harmful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Furthermore, the prosecutor's reference to Russo's testimony was an isolated instance that did not conform to a pattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial. Although the court declined to provide the jury with a specific instruction addressing the improper argument, the court did provide a general instruction emphasizing that argument is not evidence and that statements made during closing argument by the attorneys are not to be considered as evidence. Given the underlying facts of this case, the isolated nature of the prosecutor's argument, and the fact that the improper argument was not germane to the issue of whether the victim's broken jaw constituted a \"serious physical injury,\" we conclude that the court's general instruction was sufficiently curative and eliminated any danger that the prosecutor's improper comment might mislead the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we conclude that, despite the prosecutor's\n   improper statement during closing argument, the impropriety was not so egregious that it deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (1) provides that a person is guilty of assault in the second degree when, \"[w]ith intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, the actor causes such injury to such person or to a third person ....\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Count one of the substitute long form information provides: \"[The defendant], with intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, caused such injury to such person (to wit: fractured the mandible of [the victim] ) in violation of [\u00a7] 53a-60 (a) (1) ....\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2) provides that a person is guilty of assault in the second degree when, \"with intent to cause physical injury to another person, the actor causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument other than by means of the discharge of a firearm ....\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Count two of the substitute long form information provides: \"[The defendant], with intent to cause physical injury to another person, caused such injury to such person by means of a dangerous instrument (to wit: [the defendant] struck [the victim] with a golf club) in violation of [\u00a7] 53a-60 (a) (2) ....\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    On appeal, the defendant does not challenge his conviction under \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2) or under \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) or (2).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    As to count one, the defendant was sentenced to seven years of incarceration, followed by three years of special parole.

In its discussion of the issue, the court noted that \"[despite] the difficulty of drawing a precise line as to where physical injury leaves off and serious physical injury begins ... we remain mindful that [w]e do not sit as a [seventh] juror who may cast a vote against the verdict based upon our feeling that some doubt of guilt is shown by the cold printed record ... and that we must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., at 546-47,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=975%20A.2d%201\">\n     975 A.2d 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The emergency medical services responder who attended to the victim at the scene of the incident testified that \"[the victim] sustained injury to his right forearm and injuries to the left side of his face,\" and that the victim \"had a laceration to his right arm ... and he had some blood coming from his left ear.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The defendant also claims that the prosecutor was guilty of certain improprieties during her rebuttal argument. Specifically, the defendant claims that the prosecutor argued that the victim had a permanent scar on his arm, as a result of being struck with the golf club, a fact that he claims was not in evidence. The record indicates that the victim testified at trial to the following: \"[The defendant] hit me several times .... [O]nce in the jaw, once in the rib cage, took a divot out of my wrist.\n    <em>\n     I still have the mark there\n    </em>\n    and I still have the fractured jaw ....\" (Emphasis added.) Given the nature of the foregoing testimony, namely, that the victim had a lasting mark on his arm almost two years after the altercation, we conclude that this statement during rebuttal argument was within the bounds of reasonable conduct.
