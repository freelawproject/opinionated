She appeals from an August 23, 2017 order granting summary judgment and dismissing her claims against defendants, who were her school, the school board, and a teacher. We affirm because the undisputed facts establish that defendants did not breach a duty of care to plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We take the facts from the summary judgment record and view them in the light most favorable to plaintiff. In June 2013, plaintiff was fourteen years old, in eighth grade, and a member of her school basketball team.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 11, 2013, plaintiff participated in a basketball game in which a team of teachers played against a team of students. The game was an annual fundraising\n   event, and student participation was voluntary. Approximately fifteen teachers and school safety officials and seventeen students participated in the game. The game was officiated by at least one referee. There were also five\n   other teachers who did not play in the game, but attended to provide supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the game, plaintiff went up for a rebound, and made contact with defendant Garry Martin, who was a teacher. Plaintiff landed awkwardly, fell, and injured her knee. At her deposition, plaintiff described how her injury occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Everyone swarm[ed] in, but the teacher [came] running down, like, I guess, because he wanted to get the ball, and it was offensive rebound I was going for. And he went up, I went up. But he shoved me, like, to get me out of the way so that he could get the rebound. And when I came down I had to stop myself from falling. And I couldn't plant right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defense counsel questioned plaintiff further as to the details of the events that preceded her injury. Specifically, counsel asked and plaintiff answered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [Counsel] [I]f I understood your testimony, when you went up, everybody close to the basket went up also?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [Plaintiff] Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [Counsel] So you are going up for the rebound, and contact is made?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [Plaintiff] Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [Counsel] And do you know who made contact with you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [Plaintiff] Mr. Martin.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [Counsel] And where was Mr. Martin when he made contact with you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [Plaintiff] On my left side.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [Counsel] Mr. Martin is to your left.

Thereafter, she amended her complaint. In her amended complaint, plaintiff asserted claims for negligence and intentional conduct and she and her guardian ad litem sought damages related to plaintiff's knee injury. The parties engaged in and completed discovery. Thereafter, defendants moved for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The trial court heard oral arguments and, on August 23, 2017, the court issued a written opinion and entered an order granting summary judgment to defendants. The court first determined that plaintiff had failed to present evidence that defendants had engaged in negligent supervision. In that regard, the court found that the game was officiated by a referee and there were approximately five teachers, who did not participate in the game, but who attended to provide supervision. The court went on to reason that there was no showing that plaintiff's injury, which occurred when the players jumped for a rebound, could have been prevented by further supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The court next held that a participant in recreational sport activity cannot assert a claim of negligence against a co-participant\n   who causes her injury. Instead, such a plaintiff must show that the co-participant engaged in reckless or intentional conduct that caused the injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crawn v.

Accepting plaintiff's description of the incident, the court found that there were no facts showing that Martin had acted recklessly or intentionally. Plaintiff now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On appeal, plaintiff makes two arguments. First, she contends that Martin, as a teacher, and her school and the school board, as Martin's employers, owed her a duty of supervisory care, which they breached. Second, she argues that there was a material fact issue concerning whether Martin acted recklessly during the basketball game. We disagree. There are no facts showing defendants breached their duty to provide supervision to plaintiff as a student participating in a basketball game. Moreover, accepting plaintiff's description of the incident, the material undisputed facts do not show that Martin acted recklessly or intentionally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We conduct a de novo review of an order granting summary judgment, and apply the same standard employed by the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

The heightened standard will more likely result in affixing liability for conduct that is clearly unreasonable and unacceptable from the perspective of those engaged in the sport yet leaving free from the supervision of the law the risk-laden conduct that is inherent in sports and more often than not assumed to be \"part of the game.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Crawn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"712174\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/136/494/#p497\">\n    136 N.J. at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"712174\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/136/494/#p497\">\n    643 A.2d 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Here, plaintiff has conceded that Martin \"was not intentionally trying to injure [her].\" Indeed, the record contains no facts that would support a finding that Martin acted intentionally to injure plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Consequently, the question here is whether plaintiff has presented facts showing that Martin acted recklessly when he jumped for a rebound. According to plaintiff's own testimony, Martin was on an angle in front of her. Martin then pushed his body backward to create more space between himself and the basketball rim while jumping for the ball. The contact occurred when plaintiff leaned and jumped forward to try to get the ball and her upper body came into contact with Martin's upper body. Such facts, even when viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff, do not establish reckless conduct in a basketball game. Instead, those facts describe normal activity that occurs when players attempt to make rebounds during a basketball game.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff did not describe any conduct by Martin that could be found to be excessively harmful conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"712174\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/136/494/#p497\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"The heightened recklessness standard recognizes a commonsense distinction between excessively harmful conduct and the more routine rough-and-tumble of sports that should occur freely on the playing fields and should not be second-guessed in courtrooms.\"). Moreover, plaintiff's testimony provides no evidence that Martin disregarded a known or obvious risk that was so great as to make it highly probable that harm would follow. Indeed, there was no evidence that Martin was aware that plaintiff was angled behind him and was jumping forward as he was pushing backwards and jumping for the rebound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   To the extent that plaintiff argues that a negligence standard should apply because Martin was a teacher, we find no support for such a change in the law. Martin and plaintiff participated in the game as players. As already pointed out, the school provided appropriate supervision by a referee and other teachers. In her candid testimony, plaintiff described Martin's actions as the\n   actions typical of any basketball player. There are no facts in the record to demonstrate that Martin used his position as a teacher to conduct himself differently than a normal player. Accordingly, there is no basis to impose a greater duty on Martin than any other participant in a recreational sporting activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
