(Association) appeals from the February 7, 2018 order of the trial court vacating an arbitration award in favor of its member. Although this matter began with an arbitration award entered pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between the Association and plaintiff The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (Port Authority), our focus is whether the Port Authority, as a bi-state public corporate instrumentality, is subject to New Jersey arbitration law. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the order of the trial court and reinstate the arbitration award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We discern the following facts from the record. The Association and Port Authority are parties to a collective bargaining agreement known as the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), which provides for a multi-step grievance procedure concluding with binding arbitration. The MOA distinguishes between member benefits for sick and line-of-duty injury leave. In 2011, Officer Roy Biederman was working the night shift at John F. Kennedy International Airport when, during a scheduled break, he slipped and fell in the shower. Biederman sustained a back injury that kept him out of work for several weeks. The Port Authority classified Biederman's absence from work as sick leave rather\n   than injury in the line of duty. He filed a grievance, pursuant to the MOA, and the matter was referred to an arbitrator. The arbitrator decided in Biederman's favor and, on July 6, 2017, the arbitrator e-mailed the award to the parties.\n   On November 3, 2017, the Port Authority filed a complaint and order to show cause seeking to vacate the arbitrator's decision. The Port Authority cited N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-23, which provides the statutory basis upon which an arbitration award may be vacated, as a basis for the Superior Court to vacate the award. The Association answered by arguing, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:24-7, the Port Authority's order to show cause was time barred because it was not filed within three months after the award was served. In reply, the Port Authority argued it was not bound by New Jersey arbitration law because bi-state entities, like the Port Authority, are not subject to unilateral state legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At oral argument before the trial judge, the Port Authority argued New Jersey statutory arbitration law did not apply in actions brought by the Port Authority and instead sought vacatur under the common law. The trial judge issued a written decision that addressed the merits of and reversed the arbitrator's award. At the conclusion of the opinion, the trial judge explained, \"[t]he time bar in the New Jersey Arbitration Act does not apply to the arbitration award at issue.\" The trial court cited\n   <em>\n    Hess v.

The bill's original draft specifically repealed the 1923 arbitration act, N.J.S.A. 2A:24-1 to -11, and intended for all arbitrations to be governed by the modernized arbitration act.\n   <em>\n    S. 514\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    A. 2847\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 34 (2002). However, then-Governor James McGreevy vetoed the bill on the condition that N.J.S.A. 2A:24-1 to -11 be preserved as it applied to arbitrations arising from collective bargaining agreements.\n   <em>\n    Governor's Veto Statement to S. 514\n   </em>\n   1-3 (Mar. 10, 2003). The governor expressed concern that the updated arbitration regime would disrupt labor relations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6792883\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/445/162/#p172\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In response, the Legislature passed a new bill, codified at N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-1 to -32, that explicitly preserved N.J.S.A. 2A:24-1 to -11 as it applies to disputes\n   arising from collective bargaining agreements.\n   <em>\n    L.\n   </em>\n   2003,\n   <em>\n    c.\n   </em>\n   95, \u00a7 34;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2A:24-1.1 (\" N.J.S.[A.] 2A:24-1 through N.J.S.[A.] 2A:24-11 shall only apply to an arbitration or dispute arising from a collective bargaining agreement or a collectively negotiated agreement.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As a result, N.J.S.A. 2A:24-1 to -11 applies to all arbitrations arising from collective bargaining agreements; whereas, N.J.S.A. 2A:23A-1 to -19 applies to all other arbitrations, unless the parties' contract states otherwise. Here, because the dispute over the classification of Biederman's injury arose under a collective bargaining agreement, we now must determine whether N.J.S.A. 2A:24-1 to -11 is complimentary and parallel to New York's arbitration rules. This distinction matters because the arbitration rules at issue were not modeled, as the Port Authority argues, on the Uniform Arbitration Act. Moreover, we consider it relevant that the rules the Port Authority seeks to exempt itself from have been consistently applied to collective bargaining agreements for nearly a century.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Neither the 1921 Port Authority Compact, which created the Port Authority, nor the 1951 amendments to the compact expressly provide for application of the 1923 arbitration act against the Port Authority. Nevertheless, we must consider whether New Jersey's arbitration rules are substantially similar to New York's so as to alter the compact and allow application of the arbitration rules against the Port Authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489395,12300925\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/449/276/\">\n    449 N.J.

In so concluding, the Port Authority's order to show cause is time barred, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:24-7, because it was filed more than three months after the arbitrator served his award. Even if, as the Port Authority suggests, the common law governs our analysis, the Port Authority's complaint was still filed out of time. Indeed, our Supreme Court has held, unless a contract provides otherwise, \"the prevailing party retains the common-law right to seek confirmation in a plenary proceeding within the six-year statute of limitations applicable to contracts. Although the losing party may not institute an action to vacate an award after the expiration of three months ....\"\n   <em>\n    Policeman's Benevolent Ass'n, Local 292 v. Borough of N.

The Port Authority lost the arbitration but did not seek vacatur within the three months after the arbitrator e-mailed the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We also reject the Port Authority's argument that we should relax the time bar because the arbitrator e-mailed rather than served the award consistent with N.J.S.A. 2A:24-7. The statute provides, \"[t]he award must be in writing and acknowledged or proved in like manner as a deed for the conveyance of real estate\n   and delivered to one of the parties or\n   his [or her] attorney.\" N.J.S.A. 2A:24-7. Awards issued pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-19 need only be signed by the arbitrator and given to the parties, which was the case here. Neither the 1923 nor the 2003 laws require that an arbitrator serve an award on the parties consistent with\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:5-1, and we decline to read such a requirement into N.J.S.A. 2A:24-7. Moreover, the Port Authority does not dispute it received the award on July 6, 2017, and fails to identify the date on which it considers the three-month filing period to have begun. As a result, we consider this argument meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Because it was error for the trial court to address the Port Authority's complaint on its merits, it is unnecessary for us review the trial court's decision to vacate the arbitration award. Instead, we reverse the trial court's order and reinstate the arbitration award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We do not address the remaining arguments as they lack sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:11-3(e)(1)(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Reversed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    In one instance, the Third Circuit applied the complimentary and parallel principle, but it was only because the parties to the federal case were in privity with the parties in a case that was resolved in the New Jersey courts, and the Third Circuit gave preclusive effect to the decision.\n    <em>\n     Del.
