Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and denied a pre-trial motion to suppress defendant\u2019s statements during the interrogation; (2) violated Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) when it permitted the government to introduce witnesses\u2019 statements regarding defendant\u2019s uncharged prior criminal conduct; and (3) at sentencing incorrectly attributed a co-conspirator\u2019s restraint of a witness to defendant for purposes of increasing defendant\u2019s base offense level pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 3A1.3 and lB1.3(a)(l)(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-16\">The District Court properly found that defendant waived his right to counsel when he was informed of his rights at the time of his arrest and prior to the interrogation. We conclude that the Court did not err, much less clearly err, when it found that defendant answered questions voluntarily; that he did not refuse to answer questions; and that he did not request an attorney prior to answering questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) was not violated when testimony regarding defendant\u2019s uncharged criminal acts was admitted because defendant\u2019s statements regarding those acts arose out of the same occurrence as the charged offense. <em>See United States v. Carboni, </em>204 F.3d 39, 44 (2d Cir.2000) (finding defendant\u2019s uncharged criminal acts were admissible because they were inextricably intertwined with the charged offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Finally, defendant\u2019s offense level was properly increased because co-defendant Dale Stewart\u2019s restraint of a victim was reasonably foreseeable and therefore properly imputed to defendant pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). <em>See United States v. Mulder, </em>273 F.3d 91, 119 (2d Cir.2001) (remanding for particularized findings by the District Court that the acts of a co-defendant were in furtherance of the agreed upon criminal activity and were reasonably foreseeable to defendant), <em>cert, denied, Johnson v. United States, </em>535 U.S. 949, 122 S.Ct. 1344, 152 L.Ed.2d 247 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-11\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 states: \"Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b99-12\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i) provides that a person who used a firearm in furtherance of or in relation to a drug trafficking crime shall \"be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years[.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b99-13\">.
