Gonzalez-Espinoza was indicted for being an alien found in the United States after previously being deported and without the Attorney General\u2019s express permission in violation of \u00a7 1326(a). After Gonzalez-Espinoza was indicted, the Government disclosed its intention to use 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) to ensure a higher criminal penalty because Gonzalez-Espinoza\u2019s prior removal occurred after he was convicted of an aggravated felony. After pleading guilty to the sole count in the indictment. Gonzalez-Espinoza received an enhanced sentence pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b)(2) based on his prior burglary conviction. Gonzalez-Espinoza asserts that the Government violated his due process rights because the prior conviction must have been alleged in his indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt before the prosecution could use it to enhance his sentence. For the reasons discussed below, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-14\">Gonzalez-Espinoza, a Mexican national, was arrested after he admitted in an interview with Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) officers that he was illegally in the United States. A federal grand jury in Knoxville, Tennessee returned a one-count indictment, charging Gonzalez-Espinoza with being an alien illegally found in the United States after deportation and without the express consent of the Attorney General, in violation of \u00a7 1326(a). Thereafter, the Government filed a Notice of Sentence Enhancement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>which disclosed its intention to use \u00a7 1326(b) to enhance Gonzalez-Espinoza\u2019s sentence based on his prior burglary conviction. After Gonzalez-Espinoza pleaded guilty to the sole count in the indictment, the probation officer prepared a Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) which recommended a sixteen-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) (2000) and \u00a7 1326(b)(2), because of Gonzalez-Espinoza\u2019s prior aggravated felony conviction. According to the PSR, the guideline range of sentencing was seventy-seven to ninety-six months based on Gonzalez-Espinoza\u2019s enhanced base offense level and criminal history category of VI. Overruling Gonzalez-Espinoza\u2019s objections, the district court entered judgment and sentenced Gonzalez-Espinoza to seventy-seven months in prison. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">We review de novo the lower court\u2019s finding that Gonzalez-Espinoza\u2019s sentence did not violate <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>See United States v. Samuels, 308 F.3d </em>662, 671 (6th Cir.2002); <em>see also United States v. Lloyd, </em>10 F.3d 1197, 1220 (6th Cir.1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 883, 115 S.Ct. 219, 130 L.Ed.2d 147 (1994) (\u201cA defendant\u2019s challenge to his sentence on constitutional grounds presents a question of law over which this court should exercise <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d). The district court\u2019s interpretation and legal conclusions regarding the Sentencing Guidelines also are reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Hibbler, </em>159 F.3d 233, 236 (6th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>526 U.S. 1030, 119 S.Ct. 1278, 143 L.Ed.2d 372 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Gonzalez-Espinoza claims on appeal that because his indictment only charged him with violating \u00a7 1326(a) and did not contain any mention of his prior aggravated felony under \u00a7 1326(b), the Government\u2019s use of his burglary conviction violates his right to due process. In essence, Gonzalez-Espinoza argues that the sixteen-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) violates the principle announced in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201cany fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. The statute at issue, subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 1326, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-9\">(a) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, any alien who-(l) has been denied admission, excluded, deported, or removed or has departed the United States while an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal is outstanding, and thereafter (2) enters, attempts to enter, or is at any time found in, the United States ... shall be fined under Title 18, or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-10\">(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in the case of any alien described in such subsection- ... (2) whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony, such alien shall be fined under [Title 18], imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a), (b). The issue presented in this case is governed by the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and this court\u2019s interpretation of that case after <em>Apprendi </em>in <em>United States v. Gate-wood, </em>230 F.3d 186 (6th Cir.2000) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1107, 122 S.Ct. 911, 151 L.Ed.2d 878 (2002), and most recently in <em>United States v. Aparco-Centeno, </em>280 F.3d 1084 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number><em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 2638, 153 L.Ed.2d 818 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">In recent months, we confirmed our position that prior aggravated felony convictions used to enhance sentencing under \u00a7 1326(b) are not elements of a \u00a7 1326(a) violation, but rather are mere sentencing factors which are not required to be set forth in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt to the jury. <em>See Aparco-Centeno, </em>280 F.3d at 1088. Our decision in <em>Aparco-Centeno </em>relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>which held that \u00a7 1326(b) was not an additional element of a \u00a7 1326(a) offense requiring separate pleading and proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but rather was an enhancement for a criminal\u2019s recidivism and therefore held that a lower standard of proof was sufficient. <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219. <em>Apprendi </em>expressly left <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>intact. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (\u201cApprendi does not contest [Almendarez-Torres\u2019s] validity and we need not revisit it for purposes of our decision today____\u201d). As we recognized in <em>Gatewood </em>when we denied the defendant\u2019s due process challenge that his prior convictions used to convict him under the three-strikes statute were elements of the offense, <em>\u201cAlmendarez-Torres </em>remains the law.\u201d <em>Gatewood, </em>230 F.3d at 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">The facts in <em>Aparco-Centeno </em>are nearly identical to those presented by Gonzalez-Espinoza. In the former case, the defendant appealed on the grounds that his sentence under \u00a7 1326 was inaccurate because, among other things, his prior conviction was used to enhance his sentence but was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Aparco-Centeno, </em>280 F.3d at 1085. A panel of this corut held that because <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>established an exception to the principle set forth in <em>Apprendi, </em>the prior conviction was not required to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 1086. Moreover, the panel stated that although <em>Apprendi </em>\u201ccriticized [Almendarez-Torres\u2019 s] articulation of the law, [ ] it explicitly provided for its survival where the defendant admits the prior aggravated felonies as fact and permits them to affect his sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">The issue Gonzalez-Espinoza raises on appeal is directly controlled by our opinion in <em>Aparco-Centeno. </em>Because his prior burglary conviction resulted in his deportation, this conviction could be used to enhance his sentence for recidivism pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). His prior conviction was not required to be alleged in the indictment, nor was it necessary to prove this conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See id. </em>at 1086. Moreover, much like the defendant in <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>Gonzalez-Espinoza did not contest the existence of his burglary conviction, but only its use in determining his sentence. <em>See Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 227,118 S.Ct. 1219. <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains an exception to the principle of <em>Apprendi, </em>allowing \u00a7 1326(b) to serve as an enhancement for recidivism when there has been a violation of \u00a7 1326(a). <em>Id. </em>at 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">Gonzalez-Espinoza\u2019s argument fails because it directly challenges this court\u2019s binding precedent. \u201c[A] prior published opinion of this court is binding unless either an intervening decision of the United States Supreme Court requires modification of the prior opinion or it is overruled by this court sitting en banc.\u201d <em>United States v. Roper, </em>266 F.3d 526, 530 (6th Cir.2001). At oral argument, counsel for Gonzalez-Espinoza did not contest that this court was bound by the holding in <em>Aparco-Centeno </em>and specifically indicated his desire to request a rehearing en banc. Moreover, Gonzalez-Espinoza\u2019s appeal essentially asks this court to announce that <em>Apprendi </em>overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>in direct contravention to the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>Court\u2019s express language. <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (\u201cEven though it is arguable that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>was incorrectly decided, ... Apprendi does not contest the decision\u2019s validity and we need not revisit it for purposes of our decision today____\u201d). As stated in <em>Agostini v. Felton, </em>lower federal courts should \u201cfollow the case which directly controls\u201d and avoid assessments that the Supreme Court has overruled its precedent by implication. 521 U.S. 203, 237,117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">Because the Supreme Court expressly declined an opportunity to overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and because we relied on that decision when we issued our opinion in <em>Aparco-Centeno </em>stating that \u00a7 1326(b) is an enhancement provision for recidivism as opposed to an element of \u00a7 1326(a), we see no error in the sentence entered by the district court. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
