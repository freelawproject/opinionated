We have reviewed the record, the briefs of the parties, and the applicable law, and we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-16\">Because neither Cruz\u2019s sentence of imprisonment nor term of supervised release exceeded the applicable default statutory maximum, there was no violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>See United States v. Cortes-Claudio, </em>312 F.3d 17, 18-19 (1st Cir.2002). There being no <em>Apprendi </em>violation, the question of the retroactive application of <em>Apprendi </em>becomes unnecessary to resolve here. Similarly rendered moot is the third issue on which a COA was granted \u2014 whether Cruz can establish cause and prejudice to overcome his procedural default of the <em>Apprendi </em>issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-17\">The district court\u2019s judgment denying Cruz\u2019s section 2255 motion is <em>AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
