Johnson appeals a district court judgment that dismissed his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit. The case has been referred to this panel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. We unanimously agree that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Claiming multiple constitutional violations, Johnson sued several employees of the Michigan Department of Corrections. The factual underpinning of the suit is this: Johnson lost his job in the prison library after his internecine relationship with a staff librarian came to the warden\u2019s attention. Apparently, Johnson and the librarian had a running dispute concerning Johnson\u2019s right to unfettered use of the copier, and Johnson chose to up the ante by filing a choleric complaint with the warden that focused on Johnson\u2019s assessment of the librarian\u2019s intelligence. Johnson also alleged that his subsequent reclassification from the library to the yard crew was unfair because it hurts his feet to shovel snow or mow grass.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">In an exhaustive, eleven-page opinion, the district court: dismissed Johnson\u2019s claims against defendant Visser as unexhausted, dismissed his claims against defendant Overton for lack of personal involvement, determined that Johnson\u2019s retaliation claim lacked a factual basis in the light of Johnson\u2019s own pleadings, and declined to exercise jurisdiction over Johnson\u2019s state claims of ethnic intimidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Johnson\u2019s claims. Because the district court articulated specific reasons for its decision, the issuance of a detailed written opinion would serve no useful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for the reasons stated by that court in the opinion dated June 14, 2002. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
