For reversal, Coleman argues that (1) the district court erroneously construed her complaint as simply raising claims of a hostile work environment and constructive discharge, rather than discrimination; (2) she produced sufficient evidence of discrimination; and (3) the district court failed to consider her evidence. After de novo review, <em>see Forrest v. Kraft Foods, Inc., </em>285 F.3d 688, 691 (8th Cir.2002), and for the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-19\">Coleman was hired by the Varner Unit Records Department, and after approximately ten months, she resigned, citing extreme stress due to a heavy workload and other stress-related conditions. In her complaint, she alleged that ADC had failed to place her in her hired position or to promote her, refused to train her, required her to work alone with limited help for ten months, and required her to perform other people\u2019s duties while prohibiting others from assisting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-20\">While Coleman presented her own deposition testimony that her supervisor had treated her unfairly and yelled at her on numerous occasions, ADC presented evidence that (1) Coleman had made frequent and excessive errors shortly after she began working, and did not improve after the errors were brought to her attention and she was counseled; (2) Coleman was given additional duties and on-the-job training, but made frequent mistakes in performing those duties as well; and (3) Coleman\u2019s initial assignment was that given to all new Records employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-21\">We conclude Coleman\u2019s evidence was insufficient to show constructive discharge, a hostile work environment, or any adverse employment action; rather, the evidence showed her treatment by supervisors was due to her poor performance. <em>See Ross v. Douglas County, </em>234 F.3d 391, 395-96 (8th Cir.2000) (holding prima facie case for hostile work environment includes showing of severe conduct that affected term, condition, or privilege of employment); <em>Breeding v. Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co., </em>164 F.3d 1151, 1156-59 (8th Cir.1999) (holding prima facie case of discrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>includes showing of adverse employment action; constructive discharge could satisfy element of adverse employment action, but there was no constructive discharge where evidence did not support that discrimination, rather than actual performance problems, prompted reprimands and poor evaluations); <em>see also Helfter v. UPS, Inc., </em>115 F.3d 613, 616 (8th Cir. 1997) (holding conclusory statements in affidavits and deposition testimony, \u201cstanding alone, are insufficient to withstand a properly-supported motion for summary judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We also grant ADC\u2019s motion to strike Coleman\u2019s newly submitted evidence and deny Coleman\u2019s counter-motion. <em>See Griffin v. Super Valu, </em>218 F.3d 869, 871 (8th Cir.2000) (refusing to consider documents that were not before district court).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-16\">.
