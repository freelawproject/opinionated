Rasmussen appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Alvin W. Thompson, Judge). In December 1990 Rasmussen was convicted of murdering his wife in violation of Connecticut General Statutes Section 53a-54a. At trial, the State\u2019s evidence showed that Rasmussen had strangled his wife, attacked her with a home-made spear, and then attempted to convince the police that his wife\u2019s death was the result of a botched burglary while he was sleeping. The District Court denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus but granted a Certificate of Appealability. On appeal, Rasmussen contends that (1) the trial court was required to charge the jury on the lesser included offenses of manslaughter in the first and second degrees and (2) that his mental and emotional state was so fragile that he was unable to comprehend his <em>Miranda </em>rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>or intentionally waive them while in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Appellant\u2019s first contention provides no basis for habeas relief. Both the Supreme Court and our court have expressly refrained from deciding whether the Constitution requires lesser-included-offense instructions in non-capital cases. <em>Beck v. Alabama, </em>447 U.S. 625, 638 n. 14,100 S.Ct. 2382, 65 L.Ed.2d 392 (1980); <em>Jones v. Hoffman, </em>86 F.3d 46, 48 (2d Cir.1996) (per curiam). <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>however, bars us from announcing new rules of constitutional interpretation in habeas corpus cases. 489 U.S. 288, 315, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). \u201cSince a decision interpreting the Constitution to require the submission of instructions on lesser-included offenses in non-capital cases would involve the announcement of a new rule, we hold that <em>Teague </em>precludes our consideration of the issue.\u201d <em>Jones v. Hoffman, </em>86 F.3d at 48. Although the State failed to make a <em>Teague-based </em>argument below, we have the discretion to recognize the preclusive force of Teague. <em>Caspari v. Bohlen, </em>510 U.S. 383, 389, 114 S.Ct. 948, 127 L.Ed.2d 236 (1994). We choose to do so here and conclude that <em>Teague </em>bars Rasmussen\u2019s first contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Rasmussen\u2019s second contention is that he did not properly receive <em>Miranda </em>warnings and that his custodial statements were improperly admitted at his trial. We have reviewed the District Court\u2019s analysis of the circumstances surrounding Rasmussen\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and we similarly reject the claim for substantially the reasons stated by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s denial of Rasmussen\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
