Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000); <em>Inmediato v. Rye Neck Sch. Disk, </em>73 F.3d 454 (2d Cir.1996). We nevertheless agree with the district court that whatever the precise nature and extent of the right, the actions complained of do not constitute a material intrusion upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
