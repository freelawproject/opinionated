Delestin\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although counsel states that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, he does raise several issues in the brief. Delestin has filed a supplemental brief. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have considered the briefs and examined the entire record for meritorious issues. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">On appeal, Delestin\u2019s counsel raises three issues: (i) ineffective assistance of counsel; (ii) inadequacy of Delestin\u2019s guilty plea; and (in) violations of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Likewise, in his supplemental brief, Delestin argues that his counsel at sentencing rendered ineffective assistance and that his guilty plea was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">At his sentencing hearing, Delestin testified, under oath, that he was satisfied with his counsel. Thus, his claim of ineffective assistance is foreclosed on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 120 (4th Cir.1991) (holding that ineffective assistance of counsel claims are not considered on direct appeal unless counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness conclusively appears on the face of the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">Delestin\u2019s claim that his guilty plea was involuntary also must fail. Violations of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 are evaluated for harmless error. <em>United States v. Damon, </em>191 F.3d 561, 564 n. 2 (4th Cir.1999) (citing <em>United States v. Goins, </em>51 F.3d 400, 402 (4th Cir.1995)). Furthermore, a defendant is bound by representations made during a plea colloquy relating to the voluntariness of the plea absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. <em>Burket v. Angelone, </em>208 F.3d 172,191 (4th Cir.2000). Because the transcript of the guilty plea hearing reveals that the district court complied with Rule 11, because Delestin testified, under oath, that his plea was not the result of any coercion, threats, or harassment, and because he has produced no evidence to rebut this testimony, Delestin\u2019s argument that his guilty plea was involuntary is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">Likewise, Delestin\u2019s arguments based on <em>Apprendi </em>must fail. <em>Apprendi </em>is applicable only where a fact, other than that of a prior conviction, increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum. 530 U.S. at 490. Although Delestin was sentenced to 144 months imprisonment, the maximum statutory penalty pursuant to \u00a7 841 is twenty years imprisonment. <em>United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 199-200 (4th Cir.2000). Thus, because Delestin\u2019s sentence did not exceed the prescribed statutory maximum, his reliance on <em>Apprendi </em>is misplaced and these claims must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Delestin\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
