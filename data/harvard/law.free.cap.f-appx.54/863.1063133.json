Rahim pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud and the remaining counts were dismissed. Shortly before sentencing, however, Rahim moved to withdraw his guilty plea. The district court denied this motion and then sentenced Rahim to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment. Rahim appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and also challenges the district court\u2019s calculation of the loss for sentencing purposes. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-16\">On or about October 27, 1978, Rahim applied for and received a Social Security number under the name of Mohammad Zal\u00e1 Ahmad Abdel Rahim. Nearly ten years later, on or about October 9, 1987, Rahim applied for and received a second Social Security number; this card was is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>sued under the name of Mohammad Zaki Ahmad. Then on or about July 25, 1995, Rahim applied once more for a Social Security card, this time using the name of Zaki Ahmad Mohamed Abdul Rahim. On his last application, Rahim falsely indicated that he did not have a Social Security number.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Rahim applied for SSI benefits on or about April 15, 1994. In this application, he falsely indicated that he was disabled due to a broken back, a bleeding ulcer and hearing trouble. Based on his false application, the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) determined that he was disabled. Rahim later filed another application for SSI benefits. In that application, Rahim made several false statements and omissions: He did not disclose that he had two other Social Security numbers; he did not disclose that he was receiving unemployment compensation; he did not disclose that his wife was receiving unemployment compensation; he falsely stated that he had not received any income since April 1994; he did not disclose material personal resources, including a savings account. And he did not disclose that he had received worker\u2019s compensation payments; he also failed to reveal that he had purchased a grocery store, opened two bank accounts and had five new automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">On January 19, 2000, Rahim completed a \u201cStatement for Determining Continuing Eligibility for Supplemental Security Income Payments\u201d for the SSA. In this statement, Rahim once more failed to reveal his use of other names and other Social Security numbers. He also did not disclose that he and his wife owned and operated a grocery store and that they were employed by and earned money from that grocery store. He also failed to disclose various assets, including bank accounts, life insurance policies and automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">Based on Rahim\u2019s applications and his \u201cStatement for Determining Continuing Eligibility for Supplemental Security Income Payments,\u201d Rahim received SSI payments from the federal government in the amount of $38,919.25 and state-paid SSI benefits in the amount of $8,086.66. Additionally, because Rahim received federal SSI benefits, he also obtained Medicaid benefits from the State of Wisconsin in the amount of $23,235.89.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">As a result of this scheme, a federal grand jury returned a seven-count indictment against Rahim, alleging five counts of mail fraud (Rahim had received the SSI and Medicaid payments through the United States mails), in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1342; one count of making false statements in an initial application for SSI benefits, in violation of 42 U.S.C. 1383a(a)(l); and one count of making false statements for use in determining the continuing right to SSI benefits, in violation of 42 U.S.C. 1383a(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">Rahim pleaded not guilty and a trial was set for August 14, 2001. In preparation for trial, the government had approximately 17 witnesses under subpoena, and four law enforcement agents were prepared to testify at trial. However, on August 10, 2001, shortly before the scheduled trial date, Rahim entered into a plea agreement with the government under which he pleaded guilty to count one and the remaining counts were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">On October 23, 2001, over two-and-one half months after he pleaded guilty and only three days before his scheduled sentencing date, Rahim moved for leave to withdraw his guilty plea. Rahim did not file an affidavit in support of his motion, but instead filed a three-paragraph document he entitled a \u201cmemorandum brief,\u201d in which he argued that he should be permitted to withdraw his guflty plea because: (1) \u201che did not completely understand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>charges against him at the time he entered the guilty plea\u201d: (2) \u201che was not aware of the alleged evidence to substantiate the charges to which he pled guilty\u201d; and (3) he \u201cmaintains his innocence to these charges.\u201d In response, the district court canceled the October 26, 2001 sentencing hearing and set a briefing schedule to address Rahim\u2019s motion to withdraw. The government then filed an affidavit and brief arguing that Rahim\u2019s motion should be summarily denied because he failed to present any fact impugning the validity of his guilty plea. Rahim did not respond to this brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">On November 30, 2001, the district court held a non-evidentiary hearing on Rahim\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. At that hearing, the district court held that Rahim was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and that Rahim\u2019s plea agreement and the transcript from the change of plea hearing made clear that Rahim knowingly and voluntarily entered into the plea agreement. Accordingly, the district court denied Rahim\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. A new sentencing hearing was then scheduled and, on February 7, 2002, the district court sentenced Rahim to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment, three years of supervised release and restitution in the amount of $70,241.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Rahim appeals, arguing that the district court erred in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Rahim also challenges his sentence, claiming that the district court erred in calculating the amount of loss involved in the offense under the guideline provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">On appeal, Rahim first argues that the district court erred in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. A hearing on a motion to withdraw a plea is to be \u201croutinely granted\u201d if the movant offers \u201csubstantial evidence that impugns the validity of the plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Redig, </em>27 F.3d 277, 280 (7th Cir.1994). However, if no such evidence is offered, or if the allegations in support of the motion \u201care mere conclusions or are inherently unreliable,\u201d the motion may be denied without a hearing. <em>Id. </em>This court reviews the district court\u2019s determination on whether an evidentiary hearing is necessary for an abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Winston, </em>34 F.3d 574, 579 (7th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing on Rahim\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea because Rahim failed to present substantial evidence calling into question the validity of the plea. Rather, in support of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, Rahim merely contended that he did not understand the charges against him, that he was not informed of the evidence against him, and that he was not in fact guilty. There was no need for the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing to address these points because the plea agreement and transcript of the change of plea hearing provided the necessary information for the district court to rule on these issues. Moreover, these arguments are merely conclusory and fail to demonstrate the need for further fact-gathering. In fact, on appeal, Rahim fails to cite to any additional evidence he would have presented at an evidentiary hearing. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rahim an evidentiary hearing on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>See, e.g., Redig, </em>27 F.3d at 280-81 (district court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>withdraw his guilty plea without a hearing where the defendant merely presented eonelusory allegations that plea was not voluntary and knowing); <em>Winston, </em>34 F.3d at 579 (district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea where defendant failed to allege in motion or affidavit facts that would constitute grounds for allowing the withdrawal of the guilty plea).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Rahim next argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Rule 32(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure authorizes a district court to permit the withdrawal of a guilty plea \u201cif a defendant shows any fair and just reason.\u201d However, after the district court has accepted a defendant\u2019s guilty plea, \u201cthe defendant does not have an unlimited right to withdraw the plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Milquette, </em>214 F.3d 859, 861 (7th Cir.2000). A district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, <em>see United States v. Pike, </em>211 F.3d 385, 388 (7th Cir.2000), and a district court\u2019s findings regarding whether the defendant has demonstrated a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d to withdraw his guilty plea are reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Ray, </em>828 F.2d 399, 422 (7th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">As previously noted, before the district court Rahim offered three reasons in support of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea: (1) \u201che did not completely understand the charges against him at the time he entered the guilty plea\u201d; (2) \u201che was not aware of the alleged evidence to substantiate the charges to which he pled guilty\u201d; and (3) he \u201cmaintains his innocence to these charges.\u201d On appeal, however, Rahim argues that his plea was not voluntarily entered because he did not have a full understanding of the plea hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">In support of this argument, Rahim cites to portions of the plea colloquy which he maintains demonstrate that he had a limited understanding of English. Specifically, he quotes the district court\u2019s questioning during the colloquy, wherein the court asked \u201c[a]nd you speak English?\u201d Rahim responded \u201c[n]ot that much. I do speak English.\u201d The district court inquired further: \u201cDo you speak enough that you understand what we\u2019re talking about today?\u201d Rahim responded \u201c[s]ome words, yes. Some words, no.\u201d Later in the colloquy, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-9\">Court: Then Mr. Rahim, you\u2019re pleading guilty to this charge because you are guilty. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-10\">Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-11\">Court: Okay. And counsel, Mr. Bishop, is there any reason why I shouldn\u2019t, in view of your client\u2019s admission of guilt, accept your client\u2019s guilty plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-12\">Defense Counsel: I can think of no reason not to, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-13\">Court: All right. Then I will accept the guilty plea. Mr. Rahim, what is your plea to Count 1 of the indictment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-14\">Defendant: Yes, I received it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-15\">Court: So then your plea is what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-16\">Defendant: I don\u2019t know how I have to do this. They know they send me the check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-17\">Court: I am asking are you pleading\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-18\">Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-19\">Court: There\u2019s either two pleas. Guilty or not guilty. I take it \u2014 what\u2019s your plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-20\">Defendant: They feel I am guilty, I\u2019m guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-21\">Court: Do you agree that you are guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>Defendant: That\u2019s what they feel. I cooperate with them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-4\">Court: You\u2019re pleading guilty, then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-5\">Defendant: Yes, I am pleading guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-6\">AUSA Campbell: Judge, I would like him to say he\u2019s pleading guilty because he is guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-7\">Court: Yes, I think so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">Mr. Rahim, we\u2019ve come this far. We\u2019re about 90 percent done, so let\u2019s just try and get the last 10 percent. You\u2019re pleading guilty because you are guilty. Is that right?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-9\">Defendant: No, it\u2019s not correct. But I am pleading guilty. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-10\">Defense Counsel: One moment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj2\">(Discussion off the record.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-11\">Court: Let me ask you again, after consultation with your lawyer. You\u2019re pleading guilty because you are guilty. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-12\">Defendant: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-13\">Court: Okay. Are you comfortable, Mr. Campbell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-14\">AUSA Campbell: Yes, thank you, Judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-16\">Rahim contends on appeal that this exchange demonstrates that he had difficulty understanding English and thus the proceedings, and that he also \u201chad some issues regarding whether or not he was guilty.\u201d However, in denying Rahim\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, the district court concluded that \u201cRahim understood the nature of the charges he faced,\u201d and that his claim of actual innocence failed because he had admitted his guilt during the plea colloquy. Specifically, the district court concluded that \u201c[g]iven the great care with which Rahim\u2019s plea was accepted, and the consultations with counsel prior to and during the plea colloquy, in addition to the lapse of more than two months from the time the plea was entered until the motion for withdrawal, Rahim\u2019s conclusory assertion that he\u2019s innocent falls far short of the fair and just standard of [Rule 32(e) ].\u201d While it is true that Rahim had stated at one point in the plea colloquy that he was not pleading guilty because he was guilty, he then reversed tack and acknowledged that he was pleading guilty because he was in fact guilty. The district court accordingly found that \u201cit is apparent that Rahim has not adequately provided any reason or any evidence to think that his guilty plea was involuntary, or that his repeated statements of factual guilt were false.\u201d Given the foregoing, we conclude that the district court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-18\">Moreover, the purpose of Rule 32(e) - which authorizes district court to allow a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea - is \u201cto allow a hastily entered plea made with unsure heart and confused mind to be undone, not to allow a defendant \u2018to make a tactical decision to enter a plea, wait several weeks, and then obtain a withdrawal if he believes he made a bad choice in pleading guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Al</em>exander, 948 F.2d 1002,1004 (6th Cir.1991) (quoting <em>United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 345 (5th Cir.1984)). Yet, the procedural history of this ease demonstrates that Rahim\u2019s plea was not hastily entered, and that his attempt to withdraw his plea was part of his continuous procedural posturing. Specifically, the time-line of this case finds Rahim first charged on March 28, 2001. He pleaded not guilty on April 20, 2001, and a trial was set for August 1, 2001. Then on July 17, 2001, he indicated that he wanted to change his plea and a tentative change-of-plea hearing was set for July 18, and then rescheduled for July 20. On that date, Rahim decided not to change his plea, and a new trial date was set for August 14, 2001. Then at an August 10, 2001 pretrial conference, Rahim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>and his attorney signed a plea agreement and Rahim entered a guilty plea as to count one. The district court then scheduled a sentencing hearing for October 26, 2001. Three days before the sentencing hearing, Rahim moved to withdraw his guilty plea. And then after the district court denied his motion and proceeded to sentence Rahim, Rahim expressly disavowed ever having authorizing his counsel to file the motion to withdraw the plea in the first instance, and stated that he always intended to accept responsibility for his offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This procedural history demonstrates that Rahim\u2019s decision to plead guilty was not hastily made or the product of confusion, and that Rahim was instead hedging the system. The delay between the time Rahim pleaded guilty and his subsequent motion to withdraw, as well as the prejudice to the government (who had approximately 17 witnesses under subpoena, and four law enforcement agents prepared to testify at trial) by Rahim\u2019s change of mind, further supports the district court\u2019s denial of Rahim\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>680 F.2d 1145, 1152-53 (7th Cir.1982). Under all of these circumstances, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rahim\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Finally, Rahim argues that district court erred in determining the amount of loss involved in his offense of conviction for purposes of determining his sentence. As noted above, the district court determined that the loss involved in the offense of conviction totaled $70,241.80, based on the $38,919.25 in federal SSI benefits, the $8,086.66 in state-paid supplemental SSI benefits, and the Wisconsin Medical Assistance Program benefits of $23,235.89 that Rahim received. On appeal, Rahim argues that the district court erred in determining the amount of the loss because it \u201cdid not receive any type of testimony as to how the loss amount was determined.\u201d However, in his written plea agreement, Rahim \u201cknowingly and voluntarily waive[d] his right to appeal his sentence in this case,\u201d provided that his sentence was not \u201cin excess of the statutory maximum\u201d or based on the \u201csentencing court\u2019s reliance on any constitutionally impermissible factor.\u201d Rahim\u2019s 24-month sentence was less than the 30-year statutory maximum governing mail fraud offenses, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. Rahim also does not contend that the sentencing court relied on a constitutionally impermissible factor. Therefore, he has waived his right to appeal his sentence. <em>United States v. Hare, </em>269 F.3d 859, 860 (7th Cir.2001) (\u201dA waiver of appeal is valid, and must be enforced, unless the agreement in which it is contained is annulled (for example, because involuntary.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">Rahim entered into a plea agreement with the government and while he later regretted that decision, the district court found no just and fair reason supporting withdrawal of his guilty plea. That decision was not clearly erroneous and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw the guilty plea. Rahim\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s sentence also fails because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>waived his right to appeal his sentence. For these and the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b939-6\">. The government argues that because Rahim maintained at his sentencing hearing that he did not authorize his attorney to file the motion to withdraw his plea, Rahim has waived any claim of error stemming from the denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Because we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Rahim\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, we need not determine whether Rahim\u2019s subsequent renunciation of this motion constituted a waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
