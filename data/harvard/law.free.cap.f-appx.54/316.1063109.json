A search of Caldwell\u2019s home pursuant to a warrant revealed more than 200 grams of marijuana, almost 2 grams of marijuana seeds, and four scales. He was sentenced to twelve years in prison and fined $40,000. After direct review in state court that affirmed his conviction, Caldwell filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. Consistent with a magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation, which the district court affirmed in its entirety over Caldwell\u2019s objections, the district court denied Caldwell\u2019s habeas petition. The district court also denied Caldwell a certificate of appealability and his motion to conduct his appeal <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Proceeding pro se, Caldwell filed a motion with this court to conduct this appeal <em>in forma pauperis, </em>applies for a certificate of appealability, and appeals the dismissal of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-17\">In his habeas petition, Caldwell made eight claims: (1) that evidence was seized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>from his home in violation of both the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Section 30 of the Oklahoma Constitution; (2) that the prosecution impermissibly introduced evidence of his arrest in violation of state law and the federal constitution; (3) that the introduction of hearsay testimony violated state evidence rules and his federal constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him; (4) that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by referring to facts not in evidence in closing argument; (5) that he suffered from ineffective assistance of counsel at trial; (6) that the bailiff had improper contact with the jury during trial; (7) that his sentence is excessive; and (8) that cumulative errors entitle him to habeas relief. In his appeal to us, Caldwell challenges the district court\u2019s denial of all of these claims except claims (6) and (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">We conclude that Caldwell\u2019s Fourth Amendment claims are foreclosed by <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 494, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976), which holds that habeas relief is unavailable for Fourth Amendment violations when the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to litigate such claims below. <em>See also Smallwood v. Gibson, </em>191 F.3d 1257, 1265 (10th Cir. 1999). Caldwell\u2019s other claims are without merit, involve claims under state law that are not reviewable in a federal habeas proceeding, <em>see, e.g., Davis v. Reynolds, </em>890 F.2d 1105, 1109 n. 3 (10th Cir.1989) (\u201cAlternative claims, whether grounded in state statutes or the State Constitution, are not cognizable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a).\u201d), or are non-reversible, harmless errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Accordingly, for substantially the reasons stated in the magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation, we DENY a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal. Caldwell\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-18\"> After examining appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
