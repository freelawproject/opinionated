We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo, <em>see Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-19\">Moran contends that the district court erroneously concluded that he was not entitled to statutory tolling for the ten and one-half month period between the California Court of Appeal\u2019s denial of his habeas petition and the filing of another habeas petition in the California Supreme Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time of its order, the district court did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>Saffold v. Carey, </em>312 F.3d 1031, 1035-36 (9th Cir.2002) (concluding that petitioner was entitled to statutory tolling for the period between state petitions because the California Supreme Court did not deny the petition as untimely). Accordingly, we vacate and remand so that the district court may reconsider in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Carey v. Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214, 122 S.Ct. 2134, 153 L.Ed.2d 260 (2002), and this court\u2019s decision on remand in <em>Saffold v. Carey, </em>312 F.3d 1031 (9th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-20\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b722-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b722-22\">. We decline to address Moran\u2019s equitable tolling contention because it is beyond the scope of the certificate of appealability. Similarly, we decline to address Moran's argument for an evidentiary hearing. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b722-23\">.
