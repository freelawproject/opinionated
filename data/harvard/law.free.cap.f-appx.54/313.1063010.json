Willis files under \u00a7 2241 to challenge his federal sentence for the possession and distribution of cocaine. He alleges that his sentence is invalid because (1) the trial court was without jurisdiction and the indictment against him was void, (2) he received ineffective assistance of counsel, and (3) he was a victim of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-23\">But motions under \u00a7 2241, such as the one Willis now files, are generally reserved to challenge the execution of a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>rather than its validity. <em>Bradshaw v. Story, </em>86 F.3d 164, 166 (10th Cir.1996). The proper venue for attacking a sentence itself is under \u00a7 2255. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Moreover, claims may only be made under \u00a7 2241 when the statute is the litigant\u2019s exclusive remedy. <em>Bradshaw, </em>86 F.3d at 166. Willis\u2019s claim here is more properly brought under \u00a7 2255 as it challenges the validity of his sentence rather than the conditions of his confinement. <em>Id. </em>(holding that a petition under \u00a7 2241 cannot be \u201can additional, alternative, or supplemental remedy to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\u201d). He makes no other showing that \u00a7 2255 would be inadequate or ineffective as a remedy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Mr. Willis\u2019s motion to replace pages in his brief is denied as moot. For substantially the reasons stated by the magistrate judge and the district court, we AFFIRM the denial of Willis\u2019s \u00a7 2241 motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-9\"> After examining appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
