We lack jurisdiction and dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">Medina contends that her waiver of the right to appeal was not knowing and voluntary. We review the validity of a waiver de novo, <em>United States v. Aguilar-Muniz, </em>156 F.3d 974, 976 (9th Cir.1998), and conclude that Medina\u2019s contention is unpersuasive. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>235 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2000) (assessing a knowing and voluntary waiver of appeal based on language of the waiver and facts surrounding the entry of the plea). Medina\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Han, </em>181 F.Supp.2d 1039 (N.D.Cal.2002) regarding the definition of knowing and voluntary is unavailing. <em>See Nguyen, </em>235 F.3d at 1184 (stating that the point of a waiver is the relinquishment of claims regardless of their merit); <em>see also United States v. Ruiz, </em>536 U.S. 622, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 2455, 153 L.Ed.2d 586 (2002) (stating a waiver is knowing and intelligent if the defendant realizes how it would apply generally even if unaware of specific consequences).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">Medina next contends that the waiver of appeal is invalid because the government breached the plea agreement; first by failing to provide promised protection to her family, and second by not recommending a downward departure for substantial assistance. Medina failed to allege breach in the district court and she fails to demonstrate on appeal that the government breached. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>187 F.3d 1129, 1134 (9th Cir.1999) (stating that plea agreements are contracts and the government is held to the literal terms of the agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">Because Medina validly waived her right to appeal, we decline to address the contention that her 135-month sentence violates <em>Apprendi. See United States v. Vences, </em>169 F.3d 611, 613 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-14\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b738-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
