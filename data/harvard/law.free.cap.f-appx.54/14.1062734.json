At that time, police responded to a 911 call at a residence located at 17 Windsor Boulevard, Londonderry, New Hampshire. They patiently attempted to take into custody, and disarm, plaintiff-appellant Michael E. Jaques. As the drama played out, gunfire erupted. Jaques was severely wounded by a shot fired by Sgt. Gerard Dussault.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">In the aftermath of the shooting, Jaques invoked 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and brought a federal civil rights suit against the Town of Londonderry (the Town) and several Londonderry police officers (including Sgt. Dussault, Chief Joseph Ryan, Officer Chris Gand\u00eda, and Officer Jack Slade).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He alleged, inter aha, that Sgt. Dussault had used excessive force against him; that Chief Ryan and the Town had instituted a series of wrong-headed customs, policies, and practices; and, to make matters worse, that they had inadequately trained the Town\u2019s police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-17\">After protracted pretrial discovery, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. <em>See Jaques v. Town of Londonderry, </em>No. 00-432, 2002 WL 1332491 (D.N.H. June 17, 2002). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-18\">There is no need to tarry. The district court wrote a lengthy, closely reasoned opinion addressing, and fully disposing of, the appellant\u2019s claims. Having carefully considered the record, the briefs, the appellant\u2019s assignments of error, and the parties\u2019 arguments, we conclude, without serious question, that the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>disposition of the case was correct in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">We have made it an article of faith \u201cthat when a lower court accurately takes the measure of a case and articulates a cogent rationale, it serves no useful purpose for a reviewing court to write at length.\u201d <em>Seaco Ins. Co. v. Davis-Irish, </em>300 F.3d 84, 86 (1st Cir.2002); <em>accord Maurice v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>235 F.3d 7, 9-10 (1st Cir.2000); <em>Chico-Velez v. Roche Prods., Inc., </em>139 F.3d 56, 58 (1st Cir.1998); <em>Ayala v. Union de Tronquistas de P.R., </em>74 F.3d 344, 345 (1st Cir.1996); <em>Holder\u2019s Capital Corp. v. Cal. Union Ins. Co. (In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.), </em>989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir.1993). This is a paradigmatic example of the sort of case in which that principle should be applied. Consequently, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for substantially the reasons elucidated in that court\u2019s thoughtful rescript. We add only four brief comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\"><em>First: </em>The appellant asseverates that summary judgment was barred by a plethora of factual disputes. He overlooks, however, that the mere presence of genuinely disputed facts does not pretermit summary judgment. \u201cTo achieve that end, the dispute must relate to a <em>material </em>fact.\u201d <em>Kearney v. Town of Wareham, </em>316 F.3d 18,-, [No. 02-1264, slip op. at 10] (1st Cir.2002) (emphasis in the original). A fact is material if \u2014 and only if \u2014 it has the capacity to affect the outcome of the case. <em>United States v. One Parcel of Real Prop. (Great Harbor Neck, New Shoreham, </em>R.I.), 960 F.2d 200, 204 (1st Cir. 1992). The disputes to which the appellant alludes are about facts that are not critical to the proper adjudication of the summary judgment motion (and which, therefore, are not material).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\"><em>Second: </em>As a result of his actions on the morning in question, the appellant pled guilty to a criminal charge of reckless conduct. <em>See </em>N.H.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 631:3. Under New Hampshire law, <em>see, e.g., Hopps v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>127 N.H. 508, 511, 514, 506 A.2d 294 (1985), that plea admitted the material allegations contained in the indictment. Thus, the correct starting point for analysis of the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion was to take, as a given, that the appellant \u201crecklessly engaged in conduct which placed another in danger of serious bodily injury.\u201d In the circumstances at hand, that admission was damning. <em>See Napier v. Town of Windham, </em>187 F.3d 177, 184-85 (1st Cir.1999).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\"><em>Third: </em>There is no question here that the appellant, known to Sgt. Dussault to be a former Army Ranger, steadily advanced on Sgt. Dussault; that he was armed; that he refused to obey the officer\u2019s orders; that the officer retreated; that the appellant fired the first shot; and that another officer (later identified as Gand\u00eda) returned fire. Only then did Sgt. Dussault, believing that a comrade was under attack and that he himself was in jeopardy, discharge his weapon. Given the compressed time frame, the highly charged environment, and the kaleidoscopic sequence of events, a rational jury could not find that Sgt. Dussault\u2019s return of fire was objectively unreasonable. <em>See Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 396-97, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989) (explaining that \u201c[t]he calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments \u2014 in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving \u2014 about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation\u201d); <em>accord Napier, </em>187 F.3d at 184-85, 187; <em>Roy v. Inhabitants of City of Lewiston, </em>42 F.3d 691, 695 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\"><em>Fourth: </em>We say only a few words about the claims against Chief Ryan and the Town. The bottom fine is that the failure of the appellant\u2019s cause of action against Dussault dooms his attempt to impose liability on Chief Ryan and the Town. Without an underlying constitutional violation \u2014 and if Dussault is not liable, there is no such violation here \u2014 a claim of municipal liability necessarily fails. <em>See Nieves v. McSweeney, </em>241 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir.2001); <em>Evans v. Avery, </em>100 F.3d 1033, 1040 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">We need go no further. We hold that the district court did not err in granting the defendants\u2019 motion for <em>brevis </em>disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-13\">. On appeal, Jaques pursues only his excessive force claim against Sgt. Dussault and his municipal liability claims against the Town and Chief Ryan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b86-8\">. We find unpersuasive the appellant\u2019s effort to distinguish <em>Napier </em>on the ground that, here,. the admission did not encompass an <em>imminent </em>threat of harm. While not an element of the offense to which he pled guilty, the imminence of the threat posed by the appellant\u2019s conduct is an inescapable inference from the undisputed facts of record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
