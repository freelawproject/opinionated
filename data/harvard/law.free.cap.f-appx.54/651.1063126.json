We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-17\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Evans\u2019 \u00a7 2254 petition <em>de novo, see Lott v. Mueller, </em>304 F.3d 918, 922 (9th Cir.2002), we have considered petitioner\u2019s pro se brief as well as the brief filed by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-18\">Evans did not file this habeas petition until after the one-year statute of limitations imposed by AEDPA had expired, therefore it is untimely unless saved by statutory or equitable tolling. <em>See Jorss v. Gomez, </em>311 F.3d 1189, 1192 (9th Cir.2002) (stating that a petition is timely, \u201ceven if filed after the one-year time period has expired, when statutory or equitable tolling applies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-24\">The district court correctly concluded that statutory tolling does not apply because Evans did not file his first state habeas petition until after the limitations period had run. <em>See Nino v. Galaza, </em>183 F.3d 1003, 1006 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cAEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations is not tolled from the time a final decision is issued on direct state appeal and the time the first state collateral challenge is filed because there is no case \u2018pending\u2019 during that interval.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-25\">The district court also correctly concluded that Evans does not merit equitable tolling on account of his alleged mental condition, or because his state trial counsel did not file a direct appeal on his behalf. <em>See Fail v. Hubbard, </em>315 F.3d 1059,-(9th Cir.2002) (holding that equitable tolling was unwarranted because \u201cthe delay in this case was not beyond Fail\u2019s control\u201d); <em>see also Lott v. Mueller, </em>304 F.3d at 922 (stating that \u201cequitable tolling ... is available only if extraordinary circumstances beyond a prisoner\u2019s control make it impossible to file a petition on time\u201d) (citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-28\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b721-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-31\">.
