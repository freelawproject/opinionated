We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-22\">We previously reversed the district court\u2019s denial of Williams\u2019 pretrial motion to suppress evidence, which resulted in the reversal of all but Williams\u2019 conviction for theft of a firearm, and required a new sentencing hearing on that remaining count. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>No. 00-30074, 2001 WL 337857, 11 Fed.Appx. 842 (9th Cir. Apr.4, 2001) (unpublished memorandum disposition). Williams contends in this appeal that the district court erred at re-sentencing by adjusting his base offense level upwards, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l), cross-referencing \u00a7 2X1.1 and \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-23\">Because the district court was entitled to consider relevant conduct in connection with both acquitted offenses and illegally seized evidence, including evidence of drug trafficking, <em>see United States v. Watts, </em>519 U.S. 148, 154, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997) (concluding that \u201ca sentencing court may consider conduct of which a defendant has been acquitted\u201d) <em>and United States v. McIver, </em>186 F.3d 1119, 1132 (9th Cir.1999) (concluding that a sentencing court may generally consider as relevant conduct evidence suppressed at trial), we conclude that the district court did not err by applying \u00a7 2K2.1(e)(1). <em>See United States v. Gallant, </em>136 F.3d 1246, 1248 (9th Cir.1998) (affirming application of \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l) where defendant used stolen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>firearm as backup when fleeing crime scene).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b741-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
