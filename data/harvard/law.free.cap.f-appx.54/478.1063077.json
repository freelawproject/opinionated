We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Jimenez-Angeles v. Ashcroft, 291 F.3d 594, 599 (9th Cir.2002). We review de novo, id. at 599-600, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Petitioners contend that the IJ should have allowed them to apply for suspension of deportation because they presented themselves to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) before the effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d). Because the INS commenced removal proceedings after April 1, 1997, IIRIRA\u2019s permanent rules apply, and petitioners were not eligible for suspension of deportation. See id. at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Petitioners also contend that the application of IIRIRA\u2019s permanent rules was impermissibly retroactive. Petitioners\u2019 constitutional claim is foreclosed by our opinion in Jimenez-Angeles, see id. at 601-602 (finding that applicant who revealed herself to the INS one month before IIRIRA\u2019s effective date had no settled expectation that suspension of deportation would be available).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">We lack jurisdiction over petitioners\u2019 claim that the INS should have immediately commenced deportation proceedings after they filed for asylum. See id. at 598-99 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g)).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b548-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
