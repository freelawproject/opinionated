Myers appeals his conviction and 294-month sentence for conspiracy to obstruct commerce by robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) (2000), and brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-26\">Myers contends there was insufficient evidence to convict him. We review a jury\u2019s verdict for sufficiency of the evidence by determining whether any rational trier of fact, when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). We do not review witness credibility and assume the jury resolved all contradictions in the evidence in the Government\u2019s favor. <em>United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.1998). Myers\u2019 co-conspirators provided detailed testimony regarding Myers\u2019 and their participation in a number of robberies that occurred between November 1998 and February 1999. Additionally, the Government provided a videotape from one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>robberies showing Myers, who was identified by his clothing and physical characteristics, brandishing an AK-47 assault rifle. We find there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Myers contends he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial when the district court limited defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of a Government witness regarding statements made by an unindicted co-conspirator. We review the district court\u2019s decision to limit cross-examination for abuse of discretion, <em>see United States v. Cropp, </em>127 F.3d 354, 358 (4th Cir.1997), and find none. <em>See Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Myers\u2019 conviction and sentence. We have reviewed the claims raised in Myers\u2019 pro se supplemental brief and find them meritless. We also deny Myers\u2019 motion for a sixty-day leave to file a pro se supplemental brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b846-8\"> Because the record does not conclusively establish that Myers\u2019 counsel rendered ineffective assistance, his claim is not cognizable on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
