Jolly appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing her claim against Compaq Computer Corporation filed pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1461 (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2002) (ERISA). Jolly claims that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Compaq and concluding that Compaq did not violate the tenets of ERISA by failing to timely provide Jolly with a comprehensive plan relating Compaq\u2019s short-term disability program.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-25\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988). Upon written request, ERISA requires an employer to \u201cfurnish a copy of the latest updated summary plan description, plan description ... or other instruments under which the plan is established or operated.\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1024(b)(4) (West Supp.2002). It is undisputed that at the time of Jolly\u2019s request for documentation, Compaq had not yet completed its comprehensive plan document relating to short-term disability. Accordingly, we conclude that, at the time of Jolly\u2019s request, the comprehensive plan document was not an instrument under which the plan was established or operated.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Faircloth v. Lundy Packing Co., </em>91 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>F.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir.1996). Jolly was thus not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">In No. 02-1136, Jolly assigns error to \u201cthe December 18, 2001, order that denied her motion for attorney fees.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s second notice of appeal, docketed January 17, 2002). This order denies a motion for attorney\u2019s fees filed by Compaq, not by Jolly. However, because Jolly included a request for attorney\u2019s fees in her motion for summary judgment, we conclude that the district court\u2019s denial of Jolly\u2019s motion for summary judgment and award of summary judgment to Compaq implicitly denied Jolly\u2019s request. Accordingly, the matter is properly before the court for review. We have held that only a prevailing party may succeed on a motion for attorney\u2019s fees under ERISA. <em>See Martin v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Va., </em>115 F.3d 1201,1209-10 (4th Cir.1997). Because Jolly\u2019s claim does not succeed on the merits, she cannot prevail on her claim for fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the order of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-26\"> We also note that Compaq provided Jolly with a summary plan description in a timely manner, and further, that upon its completion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>February, 2001, Compaq provided Jolly with a copy of the comprehensive plan documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
