Lyons pled guilty to attempting to defraud a federally-insured bank through the theft of another person\u2019s identity. In March 2001, an unknown individual, claiming to be \u201cJ.W.R.\u201d, called the Summit Bank and applied for a loan. The caller used J.W.R.\u2019s date of birth and social security number and the loan was approved. It was Lyons\u2019 role in the criminal scheme to go to the bank and collect the loan check. He made two appointments to do so, but failed to show up for either, raising the bank personnel\u2019s suspicions. Lyons made a third appointment to pick up the check, which he kept. While helping Lyons open a checking account in the name of J.W.R., the bank teller became increasingly suspicious that Lyons was not who he claimed to be. The police were called and they arrested Lyons at the bank. Lyons admitted that he had knowingly used the name, date of birth, and social security number of J.W.R. to obtain the loan. In addition, he stated that an unidentified co-conspirator had supplied a counterfeit driver\u2019s license, social security card, Internal Revenue Service W-2 forms, and other materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-15\">The Government filed an information charging Lyons with bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Lyons entered a plea of guilty. His total offense level was an 8 and his criminal history category was \u201cHI,\u201d resulting in a sentencing guidelines range of 6-12 months. In a letter brief Lyons requested that the District Court impose the minimum six-month sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>and allow him to serve it at a half-way house. Lyons is a misfit with an extensive history of substance abuse (mostly alcohol) and a criminal record of considerable vintage, but with no recent entries. The Government responded with a request that the Court give Lyons the maximum 12-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In support of this request, the Government relied on: (1) Lyons\u2019 \u201cextensive\u201d criminal history, most of which was too dated to affect his criminal history category; (2) the fact that Lyons\u2019 one-time drug addiction was of no moment here because he had been drug-free for four years before committing this crime; and (3) the fact that Lyons had refused to \u201cprovide any assistance to law enforcement [officials] in [their] investigation of what is believed to be a wide-spread bank fraud scheme engaged in by the defendant and others.\u201d Supplemental App. at 13. The Government contrasted Lyons\u2019 situation with that of another member of the suspected scheme, Terry Brown, who had cooperated and who had received a sentence at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range. While the Government acknowledged Lyons\u2019 \u201cright to remain silent and not provide any information to law enforcement authorities\u201d, it argued that Lyons should not receive the same benefit as Brown at sentencing. Supp.App. at 14. The District Court ultimately sentenced Lyons to twelve months in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Lyons\u2019 appeal presents three questions: (1) did the District Court violate Lyons\u2019 Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when it asked Lyons to identify his co-conspirator at his sentencing hearing and/or by imposing a harsher sentence because he failed to cooperate with the Government?; (2) did the District Court violate Lyons\u2019 due process right not to be sentenced on the basis of unreliable and unreasonable inferences by allegedly considering his failure to cooperate when determining, for purposes of fashioning a sentence, whether he was rehabilitating himself?; and (3) did the District Court err in exceeding its sentencing discretion by considering a factor outside the scope of sentencing when it allegedly concluded, on the basis of Lyons\u2019 lack of cooperation, that Lyons did not intend to rehabilitate himself?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">We dispose of Lyons\u2019 second and third arguments summarily. With respect to the second, Lyons cannot show the necessary prejudice, nor does he show that considering a defendant\u2019s lack of cooperation in determining whether that defendant is rehabilitating himself is an unreasonable inference. With respect to the third argument, Lyons does not demonstrate that in allegedly considering his failure to cooperate, the District Court went beyond the scope of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The major issue on appeal is the first point, to which we now turn. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">The background for our determination lies in the colloquy of the sentencing hearing, which we describe at some length.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmR\">The Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-12\">I too have a question Miss Gauli-Rufo for your client. I would like to know who provided him with the fake New Jersey driver\u2019s license, Social Security card, W-2 Forms, pay stubs, business cards.... Because it seems to me that that is something we should know and should get to the bottom of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-13\">Ms. Gauli-Rufo:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-14\">Your honor, I have to object to that for a number of reasons, and I\u2019ll explain my position here. And this also relates to Mr. Kwon\u2019s [the prosecutor] memoran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>dum, which basically tries to use my client\u2019s constitutional rights basically to \u2014 to up his sentence, shall we say. I think it\u2019s totally inappropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\">The Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-5\">No, he\u2019s not \u2014 I understand your objection, but I had that question when I read the PSR. It wasn\u2019t Mr. Kwon\u2019s letter. ... That, it seems to me that this is something that \u2014 since he\u2019s already pled guilty and his sentence can\u2019t be increased, that I would deem relevant to know if he\u2019s really turning his life around or not. We see a lot of years of a lot of crimes, some significant, some relatively minor, but if he knows who it is, so that no one else faces the prospect of being victimized, I would feel better about people in the State of New Jersey not having this happen to them....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">Ms. Gauli-Rufo:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">Your Honor, I would have to again object to him disclosing that, for whatever reason he did have for not disclosing. There could be many many reasons for not disclosing who provided him, or who was an accomplice, or who was an accessory, or who it was involved in this crime with him. For the purposes of his sentencing today, for the purposes of pleading guilty, he has acknowledged that he committed this crime, he has acknowledged his involvement in the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">The Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">... I guess what I\u2019m musing about is how, he can only not answer that question if he\u2019s telling me that it will incriminate him. But given that he has already pled, and there is, you know, his guideline range is what it is, and it\u2019s a very narrow guideline range, I don\u2019t see a self-incrimination, I can\u2019t theorize that there could be any self-incrimination basis for not answering the question, so that others in the state will have a better shot of not being a victim of identity fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-11\">Ms. Gauli-Rufo</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-12\">... I don\u2019t know right now that my client would not answer that if I posed that to him, but I would just like to stress for the record that if he chose to cooperate, as Mr. Kwon has said, early on, or if he chose to give that information, or if he didn\u2019t ... choose to give it, it could be that it could incriminate him, it could be other reasons as well, Your Honor....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-13\">The Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-14\">It could, although he could certainly very easily, I suppose he can\u2019t be immunized and be asked the question. I don\u2019t see it as likely a self-incrimination issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-15\">App. 11-14. At this point Gauli-Rufo conferred with Lyons about whether he was willing to name his co-conspirator. Lyons told his lawyer his co-conspirator\u2019s first name, which she relayed to the Court, but said he knew neither his surname nor his address. The District Court then moved the hearing along.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-16\">The Government asked the Court to sentence Lyons to the maximum 12 months. Lyons, naturally, requested the bottom of the range, 6 months. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court sentenced Lyons to nine months in a federal correctional institution, followed by three months in a community corrections center, and five years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-17\">Because the question whether the District Court considered Lyons\u2019 lack of cooperation in fashioning his sentence is at the heart of Lyons\u2019 claim, it is useful to rescribe some of what the Judge said upon handing down the sentence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-18\">You\u2019ve been standing before courts as far back as when I was in high school. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve often said you want to turn your life around ... How is it possible that in all those times you\u2019ve never actually turned your life around and what\u2019s different now to lead me to think you\u2019re really going to turn your life around?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">I would like to believe that you\u2019re turning your life around, but there\u2019s a big part of my brain that\u2019s got some doubts about that because of your past record; and because you stand here and say you\u2019re a victim.... I wasn\u2019t born yesterday. Okay? And I am going to be watching your case. And I am going to be keeping you on a leash, which you will see when I deliver the sentence to you. And so you, whether you want to or not, will have no choice but to turn your life around____ Because I only know there were countless other judges just like me where you stood there and said in a sincere voice, as you\u2019re mustering here today, that you\u2019re turning your life around, and in fact you hoodwinked those judges because you didn\u2019t. So that\u2019s over, ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">App. at 25, 28-29, 81-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">The Government contends that Lyons did not attempt to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege during the sentencing hearing and that, consequently, he waived any appellate argument he might have had based on the privilege. Lyons answers that \u201c[although defense counsel never uttered the precise words \u2018Fifth Amendment,\u2019 it was clear to all involved that the Fifth Amendment was the thrust of her argument.\u201d Lyons\u2019 Br. at 19 note 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">In response to the Judge\u2019s request that Lyons tell the Court who his co-conspirator was, Lyons\u2019 attorney said \u201c[ ]I have to object to that for a number of reasons, and I\u2019ll explain my position here. And this also relates to Mr. Kwon\u2019s [the prosecutor] memorandum, which basically tries to use my client\u2019s constitutional rights basically to' \u2014 to up his sentence, shall we say. I think it\u2019s totally inappropriate.\u201d App. at 11-12. The Judge\u2019s response to this objection does suggest that everyone understood that they were discussing Lyons\u2019 Fifth Amendment privilege: \u201c[ ]this is something that \u2014 since he\u2019s already pled guilty and his sentence can\u2019t be increased, that I would deem relevant to know if he\u2019s really turning his life around or not.\u201d App. at 12. The Judge also mused \u201c[ ]how, he can only not answer that question if he\u2019s telling me that it will incriminate him. But given that he has already pled, and there is, you know, his guideline range is what it is, and it\u2019s a very narrow guideline range, and it\u2019s a very low guideline range, I don\u2019t see a self-incrimination, I can\u2019t theorize that there could be any self-incrimination basis for not answering the question____\u201d App. at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">Indeed, the prosecutor himself suggested that the Fifth Amendment privilege was at issue here when he stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-15\">[h]e has already pled, it is what somewhat akin to acceptance of responsibility, which when they come to the probation officer they tell the probation officer about their conduct, their roles and the roles of others, and that goes to acceptance of responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-16\">Now, taking Miss Gauli-Rufo\u2019s argument to its logical conclusion, they would apparently have a Fifth Amendment right in that context, which clearly is not correct. And that is essentially the Government\u2019s point here, he does not have a Fifth Amendment right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-17\">App. at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-18\">What is most notable about the foregoing discussion, however, is that the one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>person who never mentioned the Fifth Amendment was defense counsel. It would have been in order for her to have clearly invoked the privilege for her chent, but she failed to do so. This failure deprived the court of the opportunity to inquire precisely how the privilege was implicated. Rather than specifically asserting the privilege, defense counsel told the court that \u201c[tjhere could be many reasons for not disclosing ... who was an accomplice ...,\u201d and that if Lyons did not choose to cooperate \u201cit could be that it could incriminate him, it could be other reasons as well.\u201d App. at 12,13-14. Because the jurisprudence in this area is more demanding than the defendant acknowledges, defense counsel\u2019s vague objections were not sufficient to invoke the privilege. As the Supreme Court has made clear, \u201c[t]he Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination is not self-executing.\u201d <em>Roberts v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 552, 559, 100 S.Ct. 1358, 63 L.Ed.2d 622 (1980); <em>See also United States v. Frierson, </em>945 F.2d 650, 660 (3d Cir.1991). Therefore, we will affirm the judgment imposed by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">We do, however, take this opportunity to point out troubling aspects of the District Court\u2019s sentencing colloquy. Lyons contends that the District Court coerced his statement naming his co-conspirator by urging that he disclose it and by advising him that it would consider his cooperation \u201crelevant to know if he\u2019s really turning his life around or not,\u201d a factor the court would then take into account in fashioning Lyons\u2019 sentence. App. at 12. Because Lyons waived his Fifth Amendment privilege, the Court\u2019s actions did not amount to a violation of that privilege. Nonetheless, we are concerned about the prosecutorial tone of this sentencing colloquy and trust that the District Court will avoid it in future.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
