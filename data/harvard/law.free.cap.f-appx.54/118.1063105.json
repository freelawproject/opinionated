Turby alleges that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) committed a wide variety of errors, and that his find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>ings were not supported by substantial evidence. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Kathleen Turby suffers from depression as well as a number <em>of </em>serious ailments involving her legs and back. In 1996, Turby filed an application for Social Security disability benefits for the period October 6, 1993, to June 30, 1995. Her claim was denied, as was reconsideration, and Turby requested a hearing. Before the ALJ, Turby testified regarding her mental and physical impairments, and a vocational expert testified regarding the types of positions an individual with limitations like Turby\u2019s might hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The ALJ concluded that Turby was ineligible for benefits. He agreed that the medical evidence showed that Turby suffered from mental and physical impairments, but found her subjective testimony not \u201cfully credible,\u201d and concluded that she remained capable of performing a limited range of sedentary work, positions including information operator, security monitor, and assembler.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Turby appealed. The matter was referred to a magistrate judge, who issued a report recommending that the ALJ\u2019s decision be affirmed. The District Court adopted the report and recommendation, and Turby timely filed this appeal. The District Court had jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), and we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Although our review of the District Court\u2019s order is plenary, we are not permitted to weigh the evidence or substitute our conclusions for those of the ALJ. <em>Williams v. Sullivan, </em>970 F.2d 1178, 1182 (3d Cir.1992); <em>see also Fargnoli v. Massanari, </em>247 F.3d 34, 38 (3d Cir.2001). We may reverse only if the ALJ\u2019s findings were not supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate.\u201d <em>Fargnoli </em>247 F.3d at 38; <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). It is \u201cless than a preponderance of the evidence but more than a mere scintilla.\u201d <em>Fargnoli </em>273 F.3d at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Turby raises the following six issues: (1) whether the ALJ properly considered Turby\u2019s physical limitations; (2) whether the ALJ properly considered Turby\u2019s subjective testimony of pain and exertional limitations; (3) whether the hypothetical posed to the vocational expert adequately portrayed Turby\u2019s limitations; (4) whether the ALJ adequately developed the record; (5) whether the ALJ properly considered Turby\u2019s ailments as a whole; and (6) whether the ALJ properly considered her approval for state disability benefits and the statements by her physicians that she was disabled for purposes of those benefits. We will consider each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">First, Turby argues that the ALJ failed to appropriately consider the opinions of her treating physicians, and thus that the ALJ\u2019s conclusions about Turby\u2019s physical limitations were not supported by substantial evidence. The ALJ\u2019s decision, however, makes clear that he gave extensive consideration to the opinions of Turby\u2019s physicians and relied heavily upon those opinions in making his ultimate determination. Moreover, the record is replete with medical evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s finding that Turby had the physical and mental residual function to perform a limited range of sedentary jobs during the relevant time period, including statements by her physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">None of Turby\u2019s more specific complaints about the ALJ\u2019s treatment of her physical limitations have merit. She first asserts that the ALJ misconstrued an Au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>gust 1994 opinion by Turby\u2019s physician Dr. Goldman. In that opinion, Goldman noted that Turby was progressing and had been working in a limited capacity as a vacuum cleaner salesperson, but also recognized that she continued to be incapable of performing her previous position as a librarian, and concluded that she was disabled for state purposes on that basis. Goldman\u2019s conclusions are wholly consistent with the ALJ\u2019s, who found that Turby was neither capable of returning to her previous position nor capable of performing a position with a similar level of physical exertion. Turby then states that the ALJ failed to recognize the significance of her medical history, but there is absolutely no support for that claim in the record. The ALJ\u2019s decision recounted Turby\u2019s medical history in detail, and nothing in that history is at all inconsistent with the ALJ\u2019s findings. Finally, Turby asserts that the ALJ rejected a report by Turby\u2019s physician, Dr. Balog, suggesting that Turby had begun to suffer from lumbosacral radiculitis (inflamation of the nerve root) after lifting a television set in September of 1993. Again, there is no indication that the ALJ \u201crejected\u201d the report; the ALJ noted Balog\u2019s diagnosis and later prescription for pain medication, as well as his suggestion that Turby return to work without restrictions within a few days. In short, the ALJ\u2019s decision with regard to her physical limitations was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Second, Turby argues that the ALJ improperly discounted her subjective testimony. We have made clear that subjective complaints must be given \u201cserious consideration.\u201d <em>Mason v. Shalala, </em>994 F.2d 1058, 1067 (3d Cir.1993); <em>Green v. Schweiker, </em>749 F.2d 1066, 1068 (3d Cir. 1984). Accordingly, where the ALJ does not fully accept the claimant\u2019s subjective testimony, the ALJ is obligated to explain why. <em>Burnett v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>220 F.3d 112,120 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">We examine the ALJ\u2019s findings \u201cwith the deference required of the substantial evidence standard of review,\u201d <em>Bums v. Barnhart, </em>312 F.3d 113, 129 (3d Cir.2002), and conclude that the ALJ adequately considered Turby\u2019s subjective testimony. The ALJ\u2019s decision discussed Turby\u2019s complaints at length, and concluded that the medical evidence generally supported her claim of pain and exertional limitations. With regard to the disabling nature of her pain, however, the ALJ found her testimony only \u201cfairly credible,\u201d and unsupported by the medical evidence except \u201cto the extent that she is limited to a residual functional capacity no higher than less than the full range of sedentary work.\u201d This conclusion has support in the medical record, as Turby\u2019s physicians suggested at various times that she was capable of performing sedentary or other light work. The ALJ also properly identified a variety of facts about Turby suggesting that her pain would not preclude her from working within the narrow class of positions identified.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Burns, </em>312 F.3d at 130-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>31. Moreover, Turby crucially fails to identify any relevant medical opinion in support of her claim that her pain and exertional limitations were more severe than the ALJ found them to be. <em>Id.; Hartranft v. Apfel, </em>181 F.3d 358, 362 (3d Cir.1999). Thus, we cannot conclude that the ALJ gave inadequate consideration to Turby\u2019s subjective complaints. <em>See Simmonds v. Heckler, </em>807 F.2d 54, 58 (3d Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Third, Turby argues that the hypothetical questions considered by the vocational expert were inadequate. We agree with Turby that the \u201chypothetical posed to [the] vocational expert \u2018must reflect all of the claimant\u2019s impairments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burns, </em>312 F.3d at 125-26 (quoting <em>Chrupcala v. Heckler, </em>829 F.2d 1269, 1276 (3d Cir. 1987)). As we have recently noted, \u201cWhere there exists in the record medically undisputed evidence of specific impairments not included in a hypothetical question to a vocational expert, the expert\u2019s response is not considered substantial evidence.\u201d Bur<em>ns, </em>312 F.3d at 125-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Turby argues that two relevant facts were not included in the vocational expert\u2019s hypothetical: (1) her frequent need to lie down to take pressure off her spine, and (2) her need to elevate her left leg as recommended by one of her physicians in June of 1992. With regard to her need to lie down, we reiterate that her subjective claims of disabling pain and ex-ertional limitation were properly examined and partially rejected by the ALJ. There appears to be no medical evidence supporting her need to lie down in the relevant time period, and a later opinion suggesting that lying down might be beneficial also recommends that Turby begin her \u201cback to work activities.\u201d With regard to leg elevation, we note that Turby cites a single note made a full year before the relevant period, and that subsequent medical evidence suggested that she should be able to perform some work without restrictions. Moreover, the medical opinion noted above indicating that lying down might be beneficial also notably recommended that she discontinue elevation. At any rate, there is no indication that these isolated facts were necessary to the vocational inquiry; they are not \u201cspecific impairments\u201d for which there is \u201cmedically undisputed evidence.\u201d <em>See Burns, </em>312 F.3d at 125-26. Relevantly, the hypothetical included: references to Turby\u2019s physical conditions involving her leg and back, very significant limitations on movement and physical exertion, and frequent alternation between sitting and standing. Under these circumstances, the hypothetical \u201caccurately portrayed]\u201d Turby\u2019s physical and mental impairments, Poded<em>worny v. Harris, </em>745 F.2d 210, 218 (3d Cir.1984), and was therefore properly relied upon by the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">Fourth, Turby argues that the ALJ failed to develop the record with sufficient precision. We have frequently noted that ALJ\u2019s are under \u201ca duty to develop a full and fair record in social security cases.\u201d <em>Ventura v. Shalala, </em>55 F.3d 900, 902 (3d Cir.1995). We note, however, that this duty is most acute where the claimant is unrepresented, <em>see Livingston v. Califano, </em>614 F.2d 342, 345 (3d Cir.1980), and that here Turby was in fact represented by counsel. Accordingly, Turby\u2019s counsel was responsible for ensuring that the ALJ was aware of any facts favorable to Turby\u2019s claim for benefits. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1740(b)(1) (stating that counsel is \u201cobligated] to assist the claimant in bringing to [the Administration\u2019s] attention everything that shows that the claimant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>disabled\u201d). Regardless, Turby fails to identify a single material issue into which the ALJ failed to inquire. <em>Cf. Gachette v. Weinberger, </em>551 F.2d 39, 41 (3d Cir.1977) (noting for a similar claim that on remand the district court should consider counsel\u2019s \u201coffer of proof regarding what a more fully developed record might have shown\u201d). The only evidence cited by Turby is both already present in the record and fully consistent with the ALJ\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Fifth, Turby asserts that the ALJ did not properly consider the combination of Turby\u2019s ailments, as required by <em>Bumam v. Schweiker, </em>682 F.2d 456 (3d Cir.1982). There is absolutely no merit to this claim. The ALJ\u2019s report explicitly discussed and considered Turby\u2019s wide range of mental and physical limitations, and the hypothetical posed to the vocational expert explicitly included the full range of impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Finally, Turby argues that the ALJ did not give proper weight to Pennsylvania\u2019s decision to award her disability benefits. Turby received temporary disability benefits from the state from 1993 until 1997, when her benefits became permanent. Similarly, she argues that the ALJ did not properly consider the opinions of her physicians stating that they considered her disabled for purposes of receiving state benefits. Her arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The physicians\u2019 statements were in reference to her previous employment in a library, which required the extensive climbing of stairs, lifting and carrying of books, and other significant physical exertions. Her inability to perform such tasks, however, was explicitly found by the ALJ and considered in the vocational expert\u2019s hypothetical. Moreover, it is worth noting again that the same medical opinions indicated that Turby could in fact perform sedentary or other light work. Thus, contrary to Turby\u2019s assertions, the ALJ did rely on the statements to the extent they were relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Turby\u2019s argument with regard to the state\u2019s determination of eligibility for disability benefits fails for similar reasons. State agency determinations of disability are not binding on the Social Security Administration because the inquiries for eligibility are distinct. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1504. Nonetheless, the ALJ here accorded \u201csignificant weight\u201d to Pennsylvania\u2019s determination that Turby was eligible for benefits. Like the related statements by Turby\u2019s physicians, however, the state determination was only relevant as to the types of positions Turby may have been able to work, and was therefore thoroughly consistent with the ALJ\u2019s ultimate conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s order wifi be AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\">. Among other factors, the ALJ noted that: Turby was able to walk an acre at a time; for at least part of the relevant time period she was employed (though not gainfully) in a limited capacity as a vacuum cleaner salesperson; she suffered from no significant motor, strength, or neurological defects; she occasionally drove, including a vehicle with a manual transmission; and she cared for her own personal needs and performed many of life's normal daily activities including washing dishes, grocery shopping, watching television, reading, doing crafts, visiting friends and family on occasion, and feeding her pets. Turby\u2019s reliance on <em>Smith v. Califano, </em>637 F.2d 968 (3d Cir.1981) is unavailing. Although certainly \"[d]isability does not mean that a claimant must vegetate in a dark room excluded from all forms of human and social activity,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 971, it is nonetheless appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>priate for the ALJ to consider \"the number and type of activities\" in which the claimant engages. <em>Burns, </em>312 F.3d at 130-31.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
