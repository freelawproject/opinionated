Appellant argues that the district court erred when, on April 4, 2001, it denied his motion to dismiss the underlying indictment. Appellant argues that the deportation order on which the indictment was based was invalid because: 1) his waiver of his right to contest deportation was not considered and intelligent; 2) his Fifth Amendment due process rights were violated because his counselor at his deportation hearing provided constitutionally ineffective assistance; and 3) the notice of deportation impermissibly relied upon a \u201cyouthful offender\u201d violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The district court found that appellant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal was \u201cconsidered and intelligent,\u201d and that his ineffectiveness of counsel claim failed because he had not shown that his counselor did not provide reasonable advice and that he was thereby prejudiced. In addition, the court found that appellant had failed to establish that the deportation proceeding was \u201cfundamentally unfair.\u201d Finally, the district court rejected appellant\u2019s youthful offender argument, finding that appellant had waived his right to judicial review of this issue and that he had failed to show prejudice given that he had committed at least one other crime satisfying the requirements for deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of an alien\u2019s motion to dismiss an indictment brought pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 because it involves mixed questions of law and fact. <em>See United States v. Fernandez-Antonia, </em>278 F.3d 150, 156 (2d Cir .2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d), an alien may only challenge the validity of a deportation order if: 1) all administrative remedies have been exhausted, 2) the deportation proceeding improperly deprived him of the opportunity for judicial review, and 3) the entry of the deportation order was fundamentally unfair. <em>See also Fernandez-Antonia, </em>278 F.3d at 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">We find that the district court\u2019s denial of Moura\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment was proper because Moura failed to show that he was deprived of the opportunity for judicial review. In <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Roque, </em>301 F.3d 39 (2d Cir.2002), an alien ordered deported under the transitional provisions of IIRIRA moved to dismiss his indictment on the charge of illegal reentry following deportation. We held that the motion was properly denied because, despite IIRIRA\u2019s restrictions on judicial review, habeas relief remained available under 28 U.S.C \u00a7 2241 and, therefore, Gonzalez Roque had not been deprived of all judicial review. <em>See id. </em>at 49-50. Moura, deported under the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1961, also had habeas review available to him. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105 (providing for both direct and collateral review of deportation orders). After learning that he had been denied parole, Moura remained incarcerated in the United States with a deportation warrant lodged against him for more than a year before actually been deported. During that time, he did not seek judicial review of his deportation despite the fact that \u00a7 2241 relief remained available. Under the circumstances, appellant cannot now claim that he was denied all judicial review of his deportation order as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d). <em>See Gonzalez-Roque, </em>301 F.3d at 49-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">For the above reasons, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
