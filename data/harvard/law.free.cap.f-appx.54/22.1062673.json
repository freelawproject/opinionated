The district court rejected Appellant\u2019s claims (1) that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, and (2) that the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory evidence. However, the court accepted Appellant\u2019s argument that, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New </em>Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the judgment of conviction against him for violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (for drug trafficking involving 5 kilograms or more of drugs) could not stand, since the jury had not made any findings as to drug quantity. The court therefore amended the judgment to indicate a conviction pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), the section that prohibits drug trafficking without regard to specific quantity. The court determined that re-sentencing was not necessary, however, because Appellant\u2019s Guideline range would be the same under either section and because the sentence that the court imposed \u2014 188 months \u2014 did not exceed the statutory maximum for a conviction under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">The district court concluded that <em>Apprendi </em>\u201cdoes not apply to factors relevant under the Sentencing Guidelines that simply help a court determine where within a given statutory range a defendant should be sentenced.\u201d The court cited decisions in several other circuits that had reached this conclusion, but noted that \u201cthe Second Circuit has yet to address the issue.\u201d The district court therefore granted a certificate of appealability on the \u201csingle issue\u201d of its \u201cdenial of [Defendant\u2019s] <em>Apprendi </em>claim insofar as it applies to factors relevant under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">Subsequent to the district court\u2019s granting of the certificate of appealability on that question, we issued our opinion in <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>240 F.3d 180, 184 (2d Cir.2001), holding that \u201ca guideline factor, unrelated to a sentence above a statutory maximum or to a mandatory statutory minimum, may be determined by a sentencing judge and need not be submitted to a jury.\u201d Therefore any argument by Appellant on this point is foreclosed, and indeed he appears to have abandoned the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-14\">Appellant instead argues, for the first time on appeal, that his conviction must be reversed because, following <em>Apprendi, </em>\u201cdefendants should ... have the right to present a defense of sentencing entrapment and to have that defense decided by a jury when their sentence will be based on quantity.\u201d To the extent that this new claim raises a question different from that decided in <em>Garcia, </em>however, it exceeds the scope of the certificate of appealability, and we are without jurisdiction to hear it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number><em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); <em>see also Smaldone v. Senkowski, </em>273 F.3d 133, 139 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201cThis Court has interpreted \u00a7 2253\u2019s requirement to preclude consideration of issues outside the certificate of appealability.\u201d). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
