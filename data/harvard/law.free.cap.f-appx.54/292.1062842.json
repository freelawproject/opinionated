R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">This is a pro se state prisoner 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights appeal. Mr. Carter claims that his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment was violated because Appellees were deliberately indifferent in failing to protect him from attack by other inmates at the Central New Mexico Correctional Facility. Prior to his transfer to CNMCF, Appellant had been assaulted by inmates at the Guadalupe County Correctional Facility. Appellant states that he had been in the Aryan Brotherhood but was beaten by the gang when they discovered that he was in prison for sexual offenses. The magistrate judge recommended that Mr. Carter\u2019s motion to amend the complaint be denied and summary judgment be granted. After reviewing Mr. Carter\u2019s timely written objections, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommended disposition and dismissed the action with prejudice. Mr. Carter appeals to this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-16\">We agree that Appellant has not demonstrated that Appellees exhibited deliberate indifference to his safety as required by the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-17\">A prison official\u2019s failure to prevent harm \u201cviolates the Eighth Amendment only when two requirements are met.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). First, the prison official\u2019s act or omission must be \u201cobjectively, sufficiently serious\u201d and \u201cresult in the denial of the minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities. ... [T]he inmate must show that he is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citations omitted). Second, the \u201cprison official must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>have a sufficiently culpable state of mind,\u201d in this case \u201cdeliberate indifference to inmate health or safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Deliberate indifference requires actual knowledge of the risk to inmate safety. <em>See id. </em>at 837, 511 U.S. 825, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><em>Curley v. Perry, </em>246 F.3d 1278, 1282 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 922, 122 S.Ct. 274,151 L.Ed.2d 201 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Appellant has been in administrative segregation at his own request during his entire stay at CNMCF. By placing Appellant in administrative segregation, prison officials demonstrated some concern for his safety. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, Appellant\u2019s attacker was in restraints and was being escorted by a correctional officer at the time of the assault. \u201cEven if it is negligent of [the prison officials] not to take further protective actions, it cannot be said that they have shown deliberate indifference.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">After a thorough review of the briefs and the record, and for substantially the same reasons set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s disposition adopted by the district court in its June 25, 2002, Order, we hold that no relief is available to Mr. Carter pursuant to \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The decision of the trial court is AFFIRMED. Appellant\u2019s motion for leave to proceed without prepayment of the appellate filing fee is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Appellant must continue making partial payments on court fees and costs previously assessed until such have been paid in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-18\">. We have jurisdiction because Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal is dated within the thirty days to file an appeal. See Fed. R.App. P. 4(c) (a pro se prisoner\u2019s notice of appeal is deemed filed when it is delivered to prison officials for forwarding to the district court); see also <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
