We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Frost v. Symington, </em>197 F.3d 348, 353 (9th Cir. 1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Sanchez\u2019 Eighth Amendment claim against correctional officers Travis, Halbert, and Reynoso because Sanchez failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether these defendants acted with deliberate indifference to his safety. <em>See Jeffers v. Gomez, </em>267 F.3d 895, 914 (9th Cir.2001) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Sanchez\u2019 Eighth Amendment claim against the remaining defendants, who were all named solely in their supervisory capacities, because Sanchez did not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether these defendants were personally involved or whether there was a sufficient causal connection between the supervisor\u2019s conduct and the alleged constitutional violation. <em>See id. </em>at 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">The district court properly denied Sanchez\u2019 motion to extend the time for discovery. <em>See Margolis v. Ryan, </em>140 F.3d 850, 853 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b355-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
