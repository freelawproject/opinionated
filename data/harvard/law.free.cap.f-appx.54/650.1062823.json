R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b720-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-16\">In this diversity action, attorney Peter Clinco appeals pro se the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Dennis Roberts following a bench trial on Clinco\u2019s intentional infliction of emotional distress (\u201cIIED\u201d) claim. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>Zivkovic v. S. Cal. Edison Co., </em>302 F.3d 1080, 1088 (9th Cir.2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-17\">The district court did not err by finding that Roberts\u2019 conduct did not constitute IIED, or by relying on <em>Cochran v. Cochran, </em>65 Cal.App.4th 488, 76 Cal.Rptr.2d 540, 546 (Cal.Ct.App.1998), as legal precedent. The evidence adduced at trial was more analogous to the facts of <em>Cochran </em>than the facts of <em>Kiseskey v. Carpenters\u2019 Trust for So. Cal., </em>144 Cal.App.3d 222, 192 Cal.Rptr. 492, 496 (Cal.Ct.App.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-22\">We are unpersuaded by Clinco\u2019s contention that the district court erred by allowing Roberts to introduce evidence regarding the parties\u2019 on-going dispute over the ownership of a Toyota Land Cruiser. The evidence was relevant to Roberts\u2019 mental state at the time he sent the offending communications. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 401 (defining relevant evidence); <em>Cochran, </em>76 Cal.Rptr.2d at 543 (stating IIED claim requires plaintiff to prove defendant acted intentionally or recklessly to cause emotional distress); <em>see, e.g., Saridakis v. United Airlines, </em>166 F.3d 1272, 1278 (9th Cir.1999) (holding collective bargaining agreement relevant to union member\u2019s IIED claim). Furthermore, we reject Clinco\u2019s contention that he was \u201cblindsided\u201d by this evidence. He has not pointed to any place in the record where he sought either to introduce rebuttal evidence or to adjourn to prepare a rebuttal. <em>See, e.g., Nguyen v. Southwest Leasing and Rental Inc., </em>282 F.3d 1061, 1067 (9th Cir.2002) (concluding party entitled to rebut even erroneously admitted evidence pursuant to doctrine of curative admissibility); <em>Han v. Stanford Univ., </em>210 F.3d 1038, 1040 (9th Cir.2000) (dismissing appeal where appellant failed to support his factual assertions with citations to the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b720-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
