Akana claims that the government was obligated by the terms of the plea agreement to move for a downward departure for substantial assistance, which the government refused to do at sentencing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-23\">The government was under no obligation to move for the downward departure that Akana seeks. <em>See United States v. Vences, </em>169 F.3d 611, 613 (9th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Flores-Payon, </em>942 F.2d 556, 561-62 (9th Cir.1991). Any obligation to file such a motion was entirely discretionary on the part of the government, which had legitimate and non-discriminatory reasons for declining to so move: Akana\u2019s promised cooperation was less than complete, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>and he was indicted on unrelated drug charges shortly before his sentencing. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). Nor was the district court under any obligation to continue Akana\u2019s sentencing to enable him to \u201cclear up\u201d those charges. <em>See United States v. Lewis, </em>991 F.2d 524, 528 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">The district court\u2019s denial of Akana\u2019s request for relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Akana\u2019s motion asking the court not to publish this disposition is denied as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b960-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
