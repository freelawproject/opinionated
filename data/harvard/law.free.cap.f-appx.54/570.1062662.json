The District Court diminished his offense level under the sentencing guidelines based on his lack of a prior record, his acknowledgment of responsibility, his honesty with investigators, and his minor role in the offense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Rosario appeals the judgment, contending that he merits a four-level reduction for \u201cminimal\u201d participation instead of the two-level reduction for \u201cminor\u201d participation. We disagree and affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">FBI agents intercepted a shipment of 1,500 pounds of marijuana in January of 2000. They decided to follow through with the planned transaction in an undercover operation at the shipment\u2019s destination in Philadelphia, making arrangements to deliver the drugs to conspirator Joaquin Rosa-Pagan. On one occasion, Rosa-Pagan used Rosario as an intermediary when speaking with the undercover agents. Rosario also accompanied Rosa-Pagan on a \u201ccounter-surveillance\u201d monitoring of the truck with which the conspirators intended to transport the marijuana. When a driver arrived with the loaded truck at the designated location, agents arrested Rosa-Pagan and two other conspirators. Rosario was not present at this scene, but he held the $75,000 \u201ctransportation fee,\u201d most of which he returned to an intimate acquaintance of Rosa-Pagan\u2019s following the arrests, but $5,000 of which he kept in satisfaction of a legitimate and unrelated debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The District Court noted during Rosario\u2019s sentencing hearing that he \u201ckn[e]w[] the major players,\u201d \u201cwas entrusted to ... answer the telephone\u201d and communicate with other participants, and passed on directions in furtherance of the conspiracy. It contrasted this with the archetypal minimal participant, the \u201cmule\u201d who merely delivers drugs ignorant of the actual people in charge. We review the District Court\u2019s evaluation of Rosario\u2019s role for clear error but give plenary review to interpretations of the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Bierley, </em>922 F.2d 1061,1064 (3d Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">\u201cSuch factors as a defendant\u2019s lack of knowledge or understanding of the overall enterprise and of others\u2019 activities are evidence of a minimal role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d 236, 238-39 <em>(citing </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3B1.2, Application Note 1). We have also held that a defendant\u2019s \u201ceconomic gain and the extent of physical participation\u201d may inform findings regarding minimal-participant status. <em>United States v. Haut, </em>107 F.3d 213, 217 (3d Cir.1997). We have declined to adjust a defendant\u2019s level of participation from minor to minimal given findings that he actually promoted the criminal activity to the undercover officer. <em>United States v. Salmon, </em>944 F.2d 1106,1127 (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Rosario points to no clear error in the District Court\u2019s factual findings and argues for the downward departure based on a set of facts on which the prosecution and defense substantially agree. Although Rosario understood less of the scheme than Rosa-Pagan, the facts do not evince the real \u201clack of knowledge or understanding\u201d that distinguish a minor participant from an even more minimal one. Accompanying a significant player on a \u201ccounter-surveillance\u201d operation surely constitutes \u201cphysical participation\u201d in the more central operations of the conspiracy even if one\u2019s presence is not necessary. Rosario\u2019s communication with the undercover agent may fall short of the active promotion discussed in <em>Salmon, </em>but his diminished responsibility is amply reflected in the District Court\u2019s categorization of him as a minor participant. We have no trouble affirming the District Court\u2019s judgment that a further departure was not warranted based on the facts given.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
