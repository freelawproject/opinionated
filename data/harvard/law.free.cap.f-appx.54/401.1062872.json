New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Gibson received a 240-month term of imprisonment on re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-23\">Gibson challenges his conviction and sentence arguing that he suffered a constitutional violation by the indictment\u2019s failure to charge a specific drug quantity and the failure of facts used to determine his sentence to be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We hold that Gibson\u2019s 240-month conviction and sentence do not violate the principles of <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny, including <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002). <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625,122 S.Ct. 1781,1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002); <em>United States v. Kinter, 235 </em>F.3d 192, 199-202 (4th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 937, 121 S.Ct. 1393, 149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-24\">Finally, Gibson challenged the district court\u2019s determination of drug quantity. We find that the district court did not clearly err in its determination. <em>See United States v. Randall, </em>171 F.3d 195, 210 (4th Cir.1999) (clear error standard of review); <em>United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989) (witness credibility is not subject to appellate review).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-25\">We therefore affirm the judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
