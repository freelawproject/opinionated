Keenan, Judge), granting the defendants-appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment and dismissing the plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 three complaints. The District Court found that the plaintiffs-appellants (the \u201cEmployees\u201d) \u2014 all of whom are either present or former (1) New York City Police Department sergeants, lieutenants, captains, or deputy inspectors (the <em>Kelly </em>and <em>Abrumo </em>plaintiffs-appellants) or (2) Department of Correction (\u201cDOC\u201d) correction captains (the <em>Meringolo </em>plaintiffs-appellants) \u2014 were salaried employees and thus exempt from the overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, et seq. On appeal, the Employees challenge the District Court\u2019s (1) determination that their Employers \u2014 the City of New York, the Police Department, and the DOC \u2014 did not engage in an actual practice of impermissible suspensions without pay, (2) denial of additional discovery, and (3) finding that the Employers could avail themselves of a window of correction pursuant to 29 C. F.R. \u00a7 541.118(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-18\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Graham v. Long Island R.R., </em>230 F.3d 34, 38 (2d Cir.2000). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>thus resolve all ambiguities and draw all inferences in favor of the non-moving party and then determine the existence of material factual disputes. <em>See Gallo v. Prudential Residential Servs., Ltd. Partnership, </em>22 F.3d 1219, 1223-24 (2d Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The FLSA requires employers to pay employees overtime wages, at the rate of time and a half, for hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a single week. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207. Under the FLSA, however, employees who are \u201cemployed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity ... as such terms are defined and delimited ... by regulations of the Secretary [of Labor]\u201d are not covered by the FLSA\u2019s overtime requirements. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(1). In order to exempt an employee from the FLSA\u2019s overtime requirements, an employer must meet the Secretary of Labor\u2019s \u201csalary test,\u201d under which the employee must be paid \u201con a salary basis\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\">(a) An employee will be considered to be paid \u201con a salary basis\u201d within the meaning of the regulations if under his employment agreement he regularly receives each pay period on a weekly, or less frequent basis, a predetermined amount constituting all or party of his compensation <em>which amount is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed. </em>Subject to the exceptions provided below, the employee must receive <em>his full salary for any week in which he performs any work </em>without regard to the number of days or hours worked. This policy is also subject to the general rule that an employee need not be paid for any work-week in which he performs no work....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQj\">(5) Penalties imposed in good faith for infractions of safety rules of major significance will not affect the employee\u2019s salaried status. Safety rules of major significance include only those relating to the prevention of serious danger to the plant, or other employees, such as rules prohibiting smoking in explosive plants, oil refineries, and coal mines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0Y\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.118 \u2022 (emphases added). Thus, an employer can only reduce a salaried employee\u2019s pay for part of a work week if there is an infraction of a safety rule of major significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">In <em>Auer v. Robbins, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court found that, for an employer of purportedly salaried employees to fall under the FLSA\u2019s overtime requirements, the employer must engage in an \u201cactual practice\u201d or have \u201can employment policy that creates a significant likelihood\u201d of docking employee compensation for behavior <em>other than </em>infractions of safety rules of major significance. 519 U.S. 452, 461, 117 S.Ct. 905,137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997); <em>see also Ahern v. County of Nassau, </em>118 F.3d 118, 121-22 (2d Cir.1997). Here, the Employees fail to press on appeal the argument that there was not \u201can employment policy that creates a significant likelihood\u201d of impermissible pay deductions and pin their hopes on the issue of \u201cactual practice,\u201d contending that their Employers imposed partial-week disciplinary suspensions despite the salary basis test\u2019s requirement that a salaried employee receive \u201chis full salary for any week in which he performs any work.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.118(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">In <em>Yourman v. Giuliani, </em>we stated that \u201cthe existence <em>vel non </em>of an \u2018actual practice\u2019 of imposing pay deductions cannot be decided by the simple expedient of dividing the number of impermissible deductions by the number of managerial employees.\u201d 229 F.3d 124, 130 (2d Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 923, 121 S.Ct.. 1362, 149 L.Ed.2d 291 (2001). Specifically, <em>Your-man </em>requires the - consideration of additional factors \u201csuch as the number of times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>that other forms of discipline are imposed, the number of employee infractions warranting discipline, the existence of policies favoring or disfavoring pay deductions, the process by which sanctions are determined, and the degree of discretion held by the disciplining authority.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">In the instant case, however, the Employees, since they did not file a timely 56.1(c) statement, must be treated as having admitted that the <em>Yourman </em>factors ran against them. Specifically, they must be treated as having admitted that (1) disciplinary punishments were rare; (2) conduct deserving of discipline was rare; (3) minor violations usually resulted in informal punishments, such as warnings; (4) suspensions without pay were imposed after negotiations with the individuals who had committed infractions; and (5) in such negotiations, these individuals were represented by union-supplied counsel. <em>See </em>Local Civil Rule 56.1(c) (\u201c[a]ll material facts set forth in the statement required to be served by the moving party will be deemed to be admitted unless controverted by the statement required to be served by the opposing party\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The Employees argue that (1) the mere possibility of impermissible deductions under the Employers\u2019 disciplinary policies demonstrated the existence of an \u201cactual practice\u201d of the imposition of such deductions and (2) the Employers\u2019 change in policy prohibiting mid-week impositions of suspensions without pay indicated that their prior policies did not satisfy the \u201csalary basis\u201d test. We disagree. The fact that the Employers\u2019 disciplinary policies technically allowed impermissible deductions has some probative value, but not enough to establish a genuine question of material fact as to the existence of an \u201cactual practice.\u201d Likewise, we do not find the Employers\u2019 prohibition of suspensions without pay that start in the middle of the week \u2014 a policy change articulated in Police Department Interim Order 31 and DOC Memorandum Number 01/99, adopted on May 27, 1999 \u2014 to be sufficiently indicative of a prior \u201cactual practice\u201d of imposing impermissible pay deductions to avoid summary judgment. <em>See Childers v. City of Eugene, </em>120 F.3d 944, 947 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Upon engaging in the analysis required by <em>Yourman, </em>229 F.3d 124, 130, we agree with the District Court\u2019s decision that, given (1) the paucity of impermissible deductions, (2) the infrequency of disciplinary action, (3) rare disciplinary rule infractions, (4) the Employers\u2019 emphasis on informal punishments, and (4) negotiated suspensions in which offending Employees received legal representation, there was no genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of an actual practice of impermissible pay deductions. Thus, there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Employees were exempt from FLSA\u2019s overtime requirements, and the District Court\u2019s grant of the Employers\u2019 motion for summary judgment was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">Although summary judgment should \u201cbe refused where the nonmoving party has not had the opportunity to discover information that is essential to [its] opposition,\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 250 n. 5, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986), we cannot agree with the Employees\u2019 contention that, in the wake of <em>Yourman, </em>more discovery was necessary. As the District Court noted, there had already been 10 years of discovery prior to <em>Yourman. </em>Given the extensive factual record, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying additional discovery to the Employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">When an impermissible deduction \u201cis inadvertent, or is made for reasons other than lack of work,\u201d an employer may re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>store an employee\u2019s exemption by reimbursing the employee and promising to comply with the FLSA exemption regime in the future. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.118(a)(6). The City has submitted declarations promising (1) to reimburse Employees who have been improperly docked pay and (2) to comply with exemption requirements in the future. Under these circumstances, we find that the Employers may take advantage of the window of correction provided in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.118(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">We have considered the appellants\u2019 other contentions and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and dismissal of the complaints.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
