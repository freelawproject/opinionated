We reverse. Appellees Barbara Swor, Patricia Wiley, and Andrew Simpson cross-appeal the determination that neither Szemeredi nor another passenger, Jonathan Drew, were covered for the same incident under the terms of their parents\u2019 Homeowner\u2019s Insurance Policies. We affirm. Because the facts are familiar to the parties, we recount them only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-15\">1. In his role as a passenger, Peter Szemeredi did not \u201cuse\u201d the Meade car in the sense in which that term is employed in the relevant automobile policy. Certainly, the term \u201cuse\u201d is amenable to varied interpretations. Had the policies explicitly adopted a definition of the term \u201cuse\u201d which encompassed a passenger riding in a vehicle, we would be bound by the language of the policy, even though the term \u201cuse\u201d is otherwise defined for purposes of the California Insurance Code. <em>See State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. W.C.A.B., </em>16 Cal.4th 1187, 69 Cal.Rptr.2d 602, 947 P.2d 795, 801 n. 7 (1997) (\u201can insured is not required to consult the California codes to discover any statutory limitations on coverage but is ordinarily entitled to trust the language of the policy\u201d); <em>Utah Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n v. United Serv. Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>230 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1019, 281 Cal.Rptr. 917 (1991) (statutory provisions cannot limit coverage otherwise provided by the policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-16\">But we have held that where, as here, the policy leaves the term \u201cuse\u201d undefined, that term carries a meaning consistent with the meaning employed in the relevant statutory provisions. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Showa Shipping Co. LTD., </em>47 F.3d 316, 321 (9th Cir.1995) (relying on Cal. Ins.Code \u00a7 11580.06(f) &amp; (g) definition of \u201cuse\u201d). Contrary to appellee\u2019s argument, this holding in <em>Showa </em>is not dicta. Rather, it is a necessary link in the logic supporting one of two alternative holdings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>Best Life Assurance Co. v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>281 F.3d 828, 834 (9th Cir.2002) (alternative holdings are not dicta).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We therefore apply the statutory definition of \u201cuse\u201d to the Allstate Policy. Under the statutory definition of \u201cuse,\u201d Szemeredi did not use the Meade car and was therefore not an \u201cinsured person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">2. Although Szemeredi did not \u201cuse\u201d the Meade car, it is undisputed that Brian Meade did, because Meade drove the car. The accident which created Szemeredi\u2019s liability arose out of Meade\u2019s use of the car. The Homeowner\u2019s Insurance Policy excluded coverage for all injuries \u201carising out of\u2019 the use of any vehicle without regard to who was using it. Szemeredi\u2019s liability is therefore not covered by that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">3. For the reasons stated, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s determination that Szemeredi was covered by his parents\u2019 Automobile Insurance Policy, and AFFIRM its determination that Szemeredi and Drew were not covered by their parents\u2019 Homeowner\u2019s Insurance Policies. Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b332-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
