Bristol sought reinstatement of his employment with the Board, back pay, retirement rights, pension and health benefits, and monetary damages. In response, the Board filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), asserting that each of Bristol\u2019s claims was barred by the relevant statute of limitations and failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Trager, <em>J.) </em>granted the Board\u2019s motion, and Bristol appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-18\">We review de novo the dismissal of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), taking as true the material facts alleged in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. <em>See Bernheim v. Lift, </em>79 F.3d 318, 321 (2d Cir. 1996); <em>Jackson Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co. v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., </em>32 F.3d 697, 699-700 (2d Cir.1994). A dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a cognizable claim may be affirmed only where \u201cit appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Citibank, </em>N.A <em>v. KH Corp., </em>968 F.2d 1489,1494 (2d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-19\">Based on a de novo review of the record, we agree that Appellant\u2019s claims fail as a matter of law for substantially the reasons given by the district court. We have considered all of Mr. Bristol\u2019s claims and find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>them meritless.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-11\">. On appeal, Bristol alleges that the Board's actions violate the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-634 (1976). We see no reason to consider this issue, raised for the first time on appeal, <em>see Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 120-21, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976), especially since Bristol\u2019s assertion is unsupported by evidence in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
