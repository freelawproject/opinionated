We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. While Yarn has alleged abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion in denying him a jury trial and limiting the cross-examination of witnesses, he has not alleged facts which would support this conclusion. Yarn\u2019s claim of error by the district court in its factual determination that Yarn became angry, thus prompting the institutional use of force against him, is based upon a credibility determination, which this court will not review on appeal. <em>Murdaugh Volkswagen, Inc. v. First Nat\u2019l Bank of S.C., </em>801 F.2d 719, 725 (4th Cir. 1986). Finally, we find specious Yarn\u2019s contention that the district court erred in not evaluating the force applied and the seriousness of the resulting injury against the need for the use of force, given that such an evaluation was a necessary and integral part of the district court\u2019s final determination denying relief to Yarn. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
