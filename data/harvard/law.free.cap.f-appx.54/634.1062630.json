We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Oliver v. Keller, </em>289 F.3d 623, 626 (9th Cir.2002). We have jurisdiction and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"A1K\">Under California law, an insurance company \u201cowes a broad duty to defend its insured against claims that create a potential for indemnity.\u201d <em>Horace Mann Ins. Co. v. Barbara B., </em>4 Cal.4th 1076, 17 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 213, 846 P.2d 792 (Cal.1993) (en banc) (citation omitted); <em>see also Montrose Chem. Corp. v. Superior Court, </em>6 Cal.4th 287, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 471, 861 P.2d 1153 (Cal.1993) (en banc) (the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify) (citation omitted). The duty to defend, however, is not absolute and when there is no potential for coverage, there is no duty to defend. <em>Montrose, </em>24 Cal.Rptr.2d at 473, 861 P.2d 1153 (when the complaint shows on its face that the injury complained of is excluded from the policy, the insurer is under no duty to defend). The determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend is made by comparing the allegations of the third party complaint with the terms of the policy. <em>Id. </em>at 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">The Federal policy excludes from coverage \u201cdamages arising out of any actual, alleged, or threatened sexual molestation, sexual misconduct or harassment, or abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">Stewart\u2019s invasion of privacy claim alleges that Mr. Rudd got into bed with her, fondled her, pressed himself against her, touched her, asked her sexually explicit questions, and hid outside her bedroom in order to watch her undress. Stewart\u2019s amended complaint also incorporates by reference Stewart\u2019s allegations that Mr. Rudd \u201cforced her to perform oral sex,\u201d \u201csexually attacked\u201d her, \u201crepeatedly raped and sodomized\u201d her, and \u201cphysically assaulted her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-14\">The conduct alleged in Stewart\u2019s verified complaint constitutes actual or alleged sexual misconduct, abuse, or harassment. In light of the express language of the Federal policy excluding coverage for such acts, Federal was under no obligation to provide a defense. <em>See Northland Ins. Co. v. Briones, </em>81 Cal.App.4th 796, 97 Cal.Rptr.2d 127, 135 (Cal.Ct.App.2000) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>(\u201cWhether the allegations are true on not, there was no duty to defend because, in view of the sexual misconduct exclusion, there was no potential for coverage.\u201d) Stewart\u2019s few remaining allegations including those alleged as part of her invasion of privacy cause of action, fall within the \u201cgeneral category\u201d of conduct undertaken to further the alleged sexual misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Stewart\u2019s verified amended complaint also alleges that she was forced to \u201chave sexual relations\u201d with Mrs. Rudd while Mr. Rudd watched. Stewart \u201cincorporates [this] allegation with the same force and effect\u201d into her cause of action for invasion of privacy. As a result, Stewart\u2019s claims against Mrs. Rudd are also excluded under the express terms of the Federal policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The fact that Ms. Stewart eventually recanted her allegations does not compel a finding that Federal was obligated to provide a defense. The parties\u2019 settlement agreement converts Stewart\u2019s causes of action for intentional conduct into statements of general negligence. California courts have rejected the \u201ccommon argument\u201d that if the underlying cause of action is based on negligence, there must be a duty to defend. <em>Quan v. Truck Ins. Exchange, </em>67 Cal.App.4th 583, 79 Cal.Rptr.2d 134, 141 (Cal.Ct.App.1998) (pleading a claim under negligence cannot convert an intentional act into an \u201caccident\u201d for the purposes of meeting the terms of an insurance policy); <em>see also Northland Ins. Co., </em>97 Cal.Rptr.2d at 136 (California law does not permit reclassifying sexual misconduct in order to trigger insurance coverage).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">That there are unresolved issues of fact concerning the nature of Mr. Rudds\u2019 relationship with Stewart does not create a defense obligation where there is no potential liability <em>under the policy. Quan, </em>79 Cal.Rptr.2d at 144 (emphasis in original). California courts have rejected the notion that \u201cso long as there remain any \u2018disputed factual issues,\u2019 determinative of the insured\u2019s liability <em>to the plaintiff </em>in the underlying action, a liability insurer must continue to defend.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(distinguishing <em>Horace </em>Mann) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Because we find that Federal had no duty to defend the Rudds against Stewart\u2019s allegations under the express terms of the Federal policy, we do not reach the issue of whether California Insurance Code \u00a7 533 precludes coverage in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">We have carefully reviewed the Rudds\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b705-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
