These charges arose from Velarde-Lopez\u2019s participation in the shooting of a federal officer while smuggling marijuana into the United States. Appellant challenges his conviction on four different grounds. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-16\">Velarde-Lopez first argues that his confession was not voluntary, rather it was a product of coercion applied against him by the Mexican police, and therefore should not have been admitted at trial. He then alleges that his post-arrest statements were made in violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights because his waiver was not voluntary. Next, appellant argues that the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>trict court erred by denying his motion to continue the trial based on needed further investigation of witnesses disclosed by the government. Finally, Velarde-Lopez contends that he was denied the ability to present an adequate defense and deprived of due process of law because the district court erred by permitting the testimony of two witnesses, both of whom were not on the government\u2019s witness list. We affirm the district court on all issues raised by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Velarde-Lopez\u2019s first argument fails because the district court determined that there was not coercion applied against him by the Mexican police.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court reviews de novo the voluntariness of confessions. <em>United States v. Doe, </em>170 F.3d 1162, 1168 (9th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>137 F.3d 1158, 1165 (9th Cir.1998). The district court\u2019s factual findings underlying its determination of voluntariness are reviewed for clear error. <em>Doe, </em>170 F.3d at 1168. The district court stated that it reached its conclusion regarding alleged coercion based on: conflicts in the appellant\u2019s story; appellant\u2019s failure to tell FBI agents about the alleged abuse, even when the Mexican police were not present; testimony by Agent Spilsbury that indicated no physical signs of abuse or water torture; and the fact that although appellant claims that the reason he confessed to Spilsbury was because he had been told to do so by the Mexican Police before the FBI arrived, appellant nonetheless initially invoked his rights. According to the district court, this initial invocation does not make sense had appellant truly been coerced into confessing. Because these factual findings were not clearly erroneous given the evidence in the record, the district court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">Velarde-Lopez also alleges that his post-arrest statements were made in violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights because his waiver was not voluntary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This argument fails. The voluntariness of a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights is reviewed by this court de novo. <em>United States v. Okafor, </em>285 F.3d 842, 846 (9th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Amano, </em>229 F.3d 801, 803 (9th Cir.2000). The district court found that Velarde-Lopez\u2019s post-arrest statements made to Agent Spilsbury were voluntary, and that there was no claim by appellant that Spilsbury had used coercion in any way. Velarde-Lopez initially invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights, after which an FBI agent asked him a series of biographical questions. It is well-settled law in this circuit that biographical questions, such as name, address, date of birth, height, and weight, are permitted even after a person invokes his or her <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>United States v. Foster, </em>227 F.3d 1096, 1103 (9th Cir. 2000). Indeed, this circuit has held, \u201cthis court and the Supreme Court generally do not view inquiries regarding general biographical information as \u2018interrogation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.; Pennsylvania v. Muniz, </em>496 U.S. 582, 601,110 S.Ct. 2638,110 L.Ed.2d 528 (1990) (plurality opinion); <em>United States v. Booth, </em>669 F.2d 1231, 1238 (9th Cir.1981). Therefore, notwithstanding appellant\u2019s initial invocation, Spilsbury\u2019s questioning regarding biographical information was permissible and did not implicate <em>Miranda. </em>In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>course of such questioning, Velarde-Lopez waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The district court found this waiver to be voluntary. Thus, the district court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Appellant further contends that the district court erred by denying his motion to continue the trial based on needed further investigation of witnesses disclosed by the government. This contention also fails. A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion for continuance is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>262 F.3d 998, 1002 (9th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Zamora-Hernandez, </em>222 F.3d 1046,1049 (9th Cir.2000). In this case, the district court ordered the government to make early <em>Jencks </em>and <em>Brady </em>disclosure no later than 72 hours before the beginning of trial. The government produced this material regarding three potential witnesses fourteen days before trial. The district court further ordered the government to produce all relevant <em>Brady, Giglio </em>material pertaining to the witnesses before trial. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse it\u2019s discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion to continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Finally, Velarde-Lopez argues that the district court erred by permitting the testimony of witnesses Alejandra Lopez and Alejandro Tadeo Arvizu, both of whom were not on the government\u2019s witness list. The trial court\u2019s decision to grant an exception to its witness disclosure requirements is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Nash, </em>115 F.3d 1431, 1440 (9th Cir.1997). The district court found that the appellant was not entitled to either a witness list or early <em>Jencks </em>disclosure, and that any prejudice to appellant\u2019s ability to effectively cross-examine witness Valencia-Rodr\u00edguez could be cured by re-calling him to the stand. Further, the district court postponed Arvizu\u2019s testimony for five days to give appellant an opportunity to investigate and prepare for the witness. The district court also read Arvizu\u2019s and Lopez\u2019s names to the jury and determined that none of the jurors knew either of them. The district court did not abuse its discretion and is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b336-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-7\">.
