We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Valdez v. Rosenbaum, </em>302 F.3d 1039, 1043 (9th Cir.2002), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-22\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Trevino\u2019s Eighth Amendment claims because Trevino failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether excessive force was applied. <em>See Clement v. Gomez, </em>298 F.3d 898, 903 (9th Cir.2002); <em>see also Jeffers v. Gomez, </em>267 F.3d 895, 902 (9th Cir.2001) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-23\">Summary judgment on Trevino\u2019s deliberate indifference claims was proper because Trevino failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether prison officials failed to protect him, <em>see Leer v. Murphy, </em>844 F.2d 628 (9th Cir.1988), or acted with deliberate indifference to his medical needs, <em>see Clement, </em>298 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-24\">Trevino also contends that the district court improperly denied him further discovery. We review discovery rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>Klingele v. Eikenberry, </em>849 F.2d 409, 412 (9th Cir.1988). This contention lacks merit because Trevino\u2019s general claims regarding his discovery requests fail to make clear what information he is seeking and how that would preclude summary judgment. <em>See Hall v. State of Hawaii, </em>791 F.2d 759, 761 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-25\">Trevino\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b537-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
