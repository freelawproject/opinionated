An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). When, as here, a district court dismisses a \u00a7 2255 petition solely on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability mil not issue unless the movant can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have reviewed the record and conclude for the reasons stated by the district court that Austin has not made the requisite showing. <em>See United States v. Austin, </em>Nos. CR-98-469, CA-02-411-24-6 (D.S.C. filed July 31, 2002 &amp; entered Aug. 1, 2002). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We also deny Austin\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
