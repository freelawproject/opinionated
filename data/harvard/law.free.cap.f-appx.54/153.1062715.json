Rainey seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to reconsider a prior order which construed his motion for resentencing under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000) as a successive motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a proceeding under \u00a7 2255 unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (2000). When, as here, a district court dismisses a \u00a7 2255 motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>solely on procedural grounds, a certif\u00edcate of appealability will not issue unless the movant can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the [motion] states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have reviewed the record and conclude for the reasons stated by the district court that Rainey has not made the requisite showing. <em>See United States v. Rainey, </em>Nos. CR-94-69, CA-99-13-4 (E.D.Va. July 24, 2002). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
