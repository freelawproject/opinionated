New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Although the details of Taylor\u2019s crime are not before us, it has been assumed by the district court that, but for the fact that Taylor was sentenced long before <em>Apprendi, </em>the rule in <em>Apprendi </em>would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-18\">Taylor has already filed two successive motions challenging his sentence under \u00a7 2255, both which have been denied. His second \u00a7 2255 motion challenged his sentence precisely on <em>Apprendi </em>grounds. It was rejected because the rule in <em>Apprendi </em>may not be retroactively applied. <em>United States v. Mora, </em>208 F.3d 228 (10th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-19\">Motions under \u00a7 2241, such as the one Taylor now files, are generally reserved to challenge the execution of a sentence rather than its validity. <em>Bradshaw v. Story, </em>86 F.3d 164, 166 (10th Cir.1996). The proper venue for attacking a sentence itself is under \u00a7 2255. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-20\">Nonetheless, as the magistrate judge and the district court found, Taylor\u2019s motion could not prevail under either statute. It could not prevail under \u00a7 2255 because successive \u00a7 2255 motions are barred unless the petitioner can prove actual innocence or the retroactive application of a new rule. <em>See generally </em>Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (incorporating 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244). Taylor here makes no claim of actual innocence and, as discussed above, the rule in <em>Apprendi </em>may not be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-21\">Taylor\u2019s claim could also not prevail under \u00a7 2241. Claims under \u00a7 2241 may only be made when the statute is the litigant\u2019s exclusive remedy. Here Taylor\u2019s claim is more properly brought under \u00a7 2255 because it challenges his sentence rather than the conditions of his confinement. <em>Bradshaw, </em>86 F.3d at 166 (finding that a petition under \u00a7 2241 is not \u201can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>additional, alternative, or supplemental remedy to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\u201d). The fact that Taylor has already been denied relief under \u00a7 2255 is not a reason for finding that alternative statute inadequate or ineffective as a remedy. <em>Caravalho v. Pugh, </em>177 F.3d 1177,1178 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">For substantially the reasons stated by the magistrate judge and the district court, we then AFFIRM the denial of Taylor\u2019s \u00a7 2241 motion. In the alternative, if his motion is construed as a successive petition under \u00a7 2255, we DENY Taylor a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal. Mr. Taylor\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-17\"> After examining appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
