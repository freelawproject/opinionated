Austin pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Austin entered into a plea agreement in which he agreed to be sentenced under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) as an armed career criminal and, with limited exceptions, waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence. The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Austin to the mandatory minimum of fifteen years (180 months) imprisonment and five years supervised release. On appeal, Austin\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning whether Austin\u2019s prior convietions qualified as violent felonies for enhanced sentencing under section 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-21\">Because Austin in his plea agreement knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal his sentence, and the exceptions are inapplicable, we enforce that waiver. See <em>United States v. Estradar-Bahena, </em>201 F.3d 1070,1071 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>171 F.3d 567, 568 (8th Cir.1999). Having found no nonfrivolous issues related to Austin\u2019s conviction, see <em>Benson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. We further deny Austin\u2019s motion for appointment of different counsel, and note that any claims of ineffective assistance of counsel should be brought, if at all, in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, see <em>United States v. Cain, </em>134 F.3d 1345, 1352 (8th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-22\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-18\">. The Honorable Ortrie D. Smith, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
