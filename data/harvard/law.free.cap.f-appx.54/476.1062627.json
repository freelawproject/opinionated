Because the transitional rules apply, <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review for substantial evidence the BIA\u2019s determination that an applicant has not established eligibility for asylum, and we must uphold the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir.1998). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-21\">Rodriguez testified that the bank branch where she worked in Malaybalay denied a loan to farmers who were suspected of having ties to an anti-government group, she was mugged at gunpoint by two unidentified men, received a phone call advising her to \u201cwatch out,\u201d and unidentified persons threw stones through windows of her mother\u2019s home in Cagayan de Oro City at a time when she was visiting Manila. Because this evidence does not compel the conclusion that Rodriguez was persecuted or has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of an enumerated ground, the BIA\u2019s determination that she failed to establish eligibility for asylum is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Ochave v. INS, </em>254 F.3d 859, 865-7 (9th Cir.2001). It follows that she failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See id. </em>at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-22\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b546-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
