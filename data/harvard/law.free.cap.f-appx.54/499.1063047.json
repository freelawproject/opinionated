Because the Board correctly determined that Ms. Roy was not entitled to a survivor annuity under FERS, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b569-18\">Ms. Roy was married to Kenneth M. Roy from 1989 until Mr. Roy\u2019s death on October 24, 2001. Mr. Roy was employed by the United States Department of Agriculture from January 1, 1996, until his death in 2001. Previously, Mr. Roy had served in the United States Army from January 27, 1976, through January 26, 1979. Upon Mr. Roy\u2019s death, Ms. Roy applied to OPM for survivor death benefits under FERS. OPM awarded her a basic employee death benefit and a lump sum reimbursement of her husband\u2019s retirement contributions, but it denied her application for a survivor annuity. Ms. Roy sought reconsideration of OPM\u2019s decision, which was denied. She then appealed OPM\u2019s decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board, which affirmed OPM\u2019s action. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-19\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b569-20\">The Board was correct in upholding OPM\u2019s decision denying Ms. Roy\u2019s request for a survivor annuity. In order for Ms. Roy to be eligible for a survivor annuity, Mr. Roy would have had to complete at least 10 years of creditable civilian service, or he would have had to be a retired annuitant at the time of his death. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8442. Neither criterion was satisfied in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Ms. Roy argues that the Board should have considered her husband\u2019s veteran status when determining whether she is entitled to survivor death benefits under section 8442(b). However, payments from the federal employee retirement fund are limited to those authorized by statute; neither OPM nor the Board have the discretion to waive any statutory requirement because of veteran status. Further, even if Mr. Roy\u2019s military service could be added to his civilian service for purposes of computing his total civilian service, his total of less than nine years\u2019 service would still fall short of the ten-year statutory requirement. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8442(b). Accordingly, we discern no error in the Board\u2019s decision upholding the denial of a survivor annuity to Ms. Roy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-16\">. In their respective decisions in this case, OPM and the Board referred to a third ground on which a survivor annuity could be granted: if the employee's death is accidental (even if the employee is not retired or has not completed at least 10 years of civilian service). We are unable to locate any statutory authority for payment of a survivor annuity based on accidental death, and the government has not cited us to any such authority. The only reference to accidental death that the government cites in its brief is to an inapposite regulation that pertains to the length of the employee's marriage, which is not at issue in this case. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 843.303. Nothing in that regulation or the corresponding statutes, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8441(1), 8441(2), 8442(e), suggests that the survivor of an employee who does not have at least 10 years of civilian service or is not a retired annuitant would be eligible for an annuity under FERS simply because the employee\u2019s death was accidental. While the federal worker compensation statutes provide for a survivor annuity in certain circumstances when the employee's death \u201cresults from an injury sustained in the performance of duty,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8133, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>is no suggestion in this case that Mr. Roy\u2019s death was work-related.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
