Pegago argues that the exclusion is ambiguous and therefore should be interpreted to allow him coverage. For the reasons set forth below, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND with instructions for the district court to enter judgment in favor of Pegago.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">On Friday, August 22, 1997, Pegago, Christopher Wilson, and Timothy Downs were involved in an automobile accident. The boys had planned an outing at school on Thursday and finalized their plans on the telephone Thursday evening. After midnight, Wilson sneaked out of his house, went to his grandfather\u2019s house next door, and took his grandfather\u2019s truck without permission by using a duplicate key that he had secretly made.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Wilson picked up Pegago, who had also sneaked out, and they headed to Cox Elementary School. Pegago cut down a sapling with a knife, and Wilson drove on the grass. After leaving the school, the pair picked up Downs at his home. They stopped for gas, so that the gas level would not reveal that Wilson had taken his grandfather\u2019s truck. Then the three boys went to the home of Downs\u2019s girlfriend, where Downs spoke to his girlfriend until almost 8:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">By this time, Pegago was anxious to return home because his uncle usually arrived home around 3:00 a.m. In order to get Pegago home before his uncle, Wilson began to speed. Pegago later estimated that they were traveling at a rate of 80-90 miles per hour, and Wilson estimated 135 miles per hour. A police officer saw the speeding truck and began to give chase. At a sharp turn in the road, Wilson lost control of the vehicle. The truck flipped six times and Pegago was thrown from the cab.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">Pegago never thought that Wilson had permission to use the truck. He knew that Wilson was not legally entitled to drive because Wilson only had a learner\u2019s permit. Pegago also knew that his parents would not permit him to leave the house late at night or to ride with Wilson. In fact, Pegago had been punished for sharing a joy ride with Wilson earlier that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">Pegago\u2019s parents have an insurance policy with Hamilton Mutual Insurance Company of Cincinnati (\u201cHamilton Mutual\u201d) that provides uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage. The policy states that it will \u201cpay damages which an \u2018insured\u2019 is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an \u2018uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle\u2019 because of \u2018bodily injury.\u2019\u201d Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 382. The policy defines an \u201cinsured\u201d as \u201c[y]ou or any \u2018family member,\u2019 \u201d J.A. at 383, and defines \u201c \u2018[fjamily member\u2019 [as] a person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household.\u201d J.A. at 379. The policy also provides a list of exclusions, including an entitlement exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-13\">We do not provide Uninsured of [sic] Underinsured Motorists Coverage for \u201cbodily injury\u201d sustained by any person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-14\">^ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-15\">5. Using a vehicle without a reasonable belief that that person is entitled to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-16\">J.A. at 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-17\">Pegago filed a personal injury action against Wilson in Kentucky state court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>While this action was pending, Hamilton Mutual filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. Hamilton Mutual sought a declaration that it owed neither underinsured nor uninsured motorists coverage for Pegago\u2019s injuries. On February 27, 2001, the district court ordered that Hamilton Mutual owed neither underinsured nor uninsured motorists coverage for Pegago\u2019s injuries. The district court held that Hamilton Mutual was not hable to Pegago for damages that might arise out of his state-law claims because he fell under the policy\u2019s entitlement exclusion. J.A. at 19 (reasoning that Pegago was using the vehicle without a reasonable belief of entitlement and would have been excluded from coverage \u201c[b]y any definition of entitlement\u201d). Pegago timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">In cases such as this falling under our diversity jurisdiction, we apply the same law, including choice of law, that would be applied in the state courts of the forum state. <em>Kipin Indus., Inc. v. Van Deilen Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>182 F.3d 490, 493 (6th Cir.1999). Because the parties do not dispute that Kentucky law applies in this case, we apply Kentucky law for the purpose of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">In light of the parties\u2019 stipulation that there are no issues of material fact, the only issue on appeal is whether the district court properly interpreted the insurance policy. We review de novo a district court\u2019s interpretation of a contract, such as an insurance policy. <em>Parameter Driven Software, Inc. v. Mass. Bay Ins. Co., </em>25 F.3d 332, 336 (6th Cir.1994). Therefore, we need to determine whether Pegago is precluded from coverage under his parents\u2019 insurance policy in light of the policy\u2019s entitlement exclusion. In other words, we must determine whether the entitlement exclusion applies to Pegago.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">In <em>State Automobile Mutual Insurance Co. v. Ellis, </em>700 S.W.2d 801, 803 (Ky.Ct. App.1985), the Kentucky Court of Appeals held that an identically-worded entitlement exclusion did not apply because the policy\u2019s express coverage of family members created an ambiguity. In <em>Ellis, </em>the fourteen-year-old daughter of the owner of an insured vehicle took the vehicle without permission, caused a collision, and was sued for property damage and expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 802. The insurance company denied coverage because the policy included an exclusion stating that it \u201cdid not provide coverage for any person '[ujsing a vehicle without a reasonable belief that that person is entitled to do so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">Rather than apply the exclusion, the <em>Ellis </em>court determined that an ambiguity arises \u201c[w]hen an attempt is made to apply the general exclusion to a family member\u201d who is specifically covered under the policy. <em>Id. </em>Although \u201cordinary words in insurance policies are to be given their ordinary meaning,\u201d the court concluded that ordinary meaning could not resolve the ambiguity. <em>Id. </em>at 802-03. The court reasoned that, where a policy\u2019s ordinary meaning is not clear, \u201c[d]oubts concerning the construction of insurance contracts are to be liberally construed in favor of the insured, and exclusions are to be strictly construed to make insurance effective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Davis v. American States Ins. Co., </em>562 S.W.2d 653, 655 (Ky.Ct.App. 1977)). Therefore, \u201c[i]f an insurance contract allows two reasonable constructions, the one most favorable to the insured prevails.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Wolford v. Wolford, </em>662 S.W.2d 835, 838 (Ky.1984)). Moreover, \u201c[i]n cases of ambiguity specific clauses in insurance policies control general clauses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 2 <em>Couch on Insurance </em>2d \u00a7 15:71 (Rev. Ed.1984)). From these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>premises, the <em>Ellis </em>court concluded that the daughter was covered because she was \u201cspecifically included in the coverage of the policy as a \u2018family member\u2019 and ... the general exclusion does not operate to exclude that coverage.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Here, Pegago\u2019s parents are the insured, and the language of the policy in question specifically covers Pegago. The uninsured and underinsured motorists section of the policy defines \u201can insured\u201d as \u201c[y]ou or any \u2018family member.\u2019 \u201d J.A. at 388. Under the policy, a \u201cfamily member\u201d is \u201ca person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household.\u201d J.A. at 379. This language is identical to that which the Kentucky Court of Appeals found to \u201cspecifically afford[ ] coverage\u201d in <em>Ellis. </em>700 S.W.2d at 802. Pegago is a person related by blood to the policyholder and is a resident of the policyholder\u2019s household. Therefore, the Pegagos\u2019 policy specifically covers Pegago because he meets the definition of \u201cfamily member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Moreover, under Kentucky law, this coverage of Pegago under the policy is not excluded by the policy\u2019s entitlement exclusion. The language of the exclusion in the Pegagos\u2019 policy is also identical to that considered in <em>Ellis:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">We do not provide Uninsured of [sic] Underinsured Motorists Coverage for \u201cbodily injury\u201d sustained by any person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">^ \u00edf\u00ed \u00edS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">5. Using a vehicle without a reasonable belief that that person is entitled to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">J.A. at 383. The <em>Ellis </em>court described this language as a \u201cgeneral exclusion.\u201d 700 S.W.2d at 801-802. Under Kentucky law, the general exclusion does not operate to exclude the specific coverage afforded to Pegago as a family member of the policyholder. Therefore, the entitlement exclusion does not apply to Pegago, and he is covered under the policy\u2019s uninsured and underinsured motorists provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">For the above reasons, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s decision holding that Hamilton Mutual owed Pegago neither uninsured nor underinsured motorists coverage for damages that may arise out of Pegago\u2019s state-law claims against Wilson, and REMAND for the district court to enter judgment in favor of Pegago.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
