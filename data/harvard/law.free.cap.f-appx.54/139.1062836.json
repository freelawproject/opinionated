Eugene Gibbs appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to extend the time to appeal the dismissal of his complaint. In order to qualify for an extension of time to appeal, a litigant must show excusable neglect or good cause. Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(5). Because Gibbs\u2019 motion focused exclusively on the merits of his underlying claims, we find that the district court did not err in finding that Gibbs had not satisfied the requirements for an extension of time. Accordingly, we affirm the order of the district court. <em>See Gibbs v. United States, </em>No. CA-02-45 JFM (D.Md. Aug. 22, 2002). We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
