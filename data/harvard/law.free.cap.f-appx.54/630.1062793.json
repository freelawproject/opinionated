Wynn pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. At sentencing, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> overruled Wynn\u2019s objection to application of the career-offender Guideline, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(B), which the presentence report had recommended based on a prior two-count state felony drug conviction (for which Wynn had received concurrent prison terms) and a prior federal felony drug conviction. After finding that the applicable sentencing range was 188-235 months, the court granted the government\u2019s motion for a substantial-assistance downward departure, and sentenced Wynn to 90 months imprisonment and 4 years supervised release. On appeal, Wynn\u2019s counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing the district court erred in finding Wynn was a career offender and the court should have granted a greater downward departure. Wynn has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-21\">First, we conclude that the career-offender determination was proper, despite Wynn\u2019s assertion that one of the state counts of conviction had been set aside and the other was being appealed: at the time of this sentencing, at least one state count of conviction remained valid, and thus invalidation of the other state count would still leave the requisite two prior convictions. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1, 4B1.2(c). Second, the extent of the district court\u2019s departure is unreviewable. <em>See United States v. McFarlane, </em>309 F.3d 510, 516 (8th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-22\">Having independently reviewed the record in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-19\">. The Honorable Fernando J. Gaitan, Jr., United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
