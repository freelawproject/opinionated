The Board also, by order of March 8, 2002, denied Endale\u2019s timely motion to reconsider. Endale\u2019s petition for review is untimely as to the March 8, 2000 order. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-21\">Endale\u2019s petition for review is timely as to the Board\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration. We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(a) (2002), in concluding that, based on changed conditions in Ethiopia, Endale did not have a well-founded fear of persecution or entitlement to asylum based on past persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b) (2002); <em>Gonohasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 541-42 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-22\">We deny as untimely the petition for review as to the Board\u2019s order of March 8, 2000. We deny the petition for review of the March 8, 2002, order upon finding that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
