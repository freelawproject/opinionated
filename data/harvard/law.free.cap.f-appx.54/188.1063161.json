This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. RApp. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">On August 31, 1992, Ferqueron pled no contest to two counts of felonious assault. Ferqueron was sentenced to serve 120 days in jail. Ferqueron did not appeal his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-17\">On February 19, 1998, Ferqueron filed a motion for relief from judgment, which was denied by the trial court. The Michigan Court of Appeals denied Ferqueron\u2019s delayed application for leave to appeal on August 21, 2000, and denied his motion for rehearing on October 24, 2000. On March 27, 2001, the Michigan Supreme Court denied Ferqueron\u2019s delayed application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-18\">In his \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus, signed on March 31, 2001, and filed on April 10, 2001, Ferqueron raised the following ground for relief; his no contest plea was invalid because his wife coerced and tricked him into so pleading, he was under the influence of prescription drugs when he entered the plea, and his trial counsel\u2019s advice to enter the plea was erroneous and constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-19\">Straub filed an answer to the petition, to which Ferqueron responded. The district court dismissed Ferqueron\u2019s habeas corpus petition, concluding that Ferqueron\u2019s claims are procedurally defaulted and that the court lacked jurisdiction over the petition because Ferqueron is not \u201cin custody\u201d for the convictions under attack. Ferqueron\u2019s motions for reconsideration were denied. The district court subsequently granted Ferqueron\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-20\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s disposition of a habeas corpus petition. <em>Payton v. Brigano, </em>256 F.3d 405, 407-08 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-21\">A habeas corpus petitioner must be \u201cin custody\u201d pursuant to a state conviction when the petition is filed in order to vest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>the district court with jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); <em>Maleng v. Cook, </em>490 U.S. 488, 490, 109 S.Ct. 1923, 104 L.Ed.2d 540 (1989). When a petitioner\u2019s sentence for a conviction has fully expired, the conviction may not be directly challenged because the petitioner is no longer \u201cin custody\u201d pursuant to that conviction. <em>Lackawanna County Disk Attorney v. Coss, </em>532 U.S. 394, 401, 121 S.Ct. 1567, 149 L.Ed.2d 608 (2001). The collateral consequences of a conviction for which the sentence has completely expired are insufficient to render a petitioner \u201cin custody\u201d under \u00a7 2254(a). <em>Maleng, </em>490 U.S. at 492, 109 S.Ct. 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">A petitioner satisfies the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement by directly attacking a sentence that he is currently serving. <em>Lackawanna, </em>532 U.S. at 401-02, 121 S.Ct. 1567. However, when a petitioner\u2019s current sentence has been enhanced by a prior conviction, for which the sentence imposed has completely expired, the petitioner may not attack the prior conviction indirectly through an attack upon his current sentence if the prior conviction is no longer subject to challenge of its own accord. <em>Id. </em>at 403-04,121 S.Ct. 1567.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Ferqueron\u2019s habeas corpus petition for lack of jurisdiction. Ferqueron may not directly attack his 1992 convictions for felonious assault through the instant petition because he is no longer \u201cin custody\u201d pursuant to those convictions, whose sentences have expired. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); <em>Lackawanna, </em>532 U.S. at 401, 121 S.Ct. 1567. Furthermore, even if Ferqueron\u2019s petition is construed as an attack upon his current sentence, which was enhanced by his prior 1992 convictions, he may not collaterally attack his 1992 convictions because those convictions are conclusively valid and are no longer subject to challenge in their own right. <em>See Lackawanna, </em>532 U.S. at 403-04, 121 S.Ct. 1567. Thus, Ferqueron may not use the instant \u00a7 2254 petition as a vehicle to challenge his 1992 convictions, for which the sentences have fully expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">There are two possible exceptions to the general rule espoused in <em>Lackawanna; </em>however, Ferqueron does not fall within either exception. First, Ferqueron\u2019s 1992 convictions were not obtained in the absence of counsel, as Ferqueron was represented by counsel during the 1992 plea proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 404, 121 S.Ct. 1567. Second, Ferqueron had an available forum for review of the prior convictions, of which he availed himself, in that he sought post-conviction relief. <em>See id. </em>at 405-06,121 S.Ct. 1567.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
