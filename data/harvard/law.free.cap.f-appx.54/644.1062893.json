We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we review de novo, <em>Hicks v. Small, </em>69 F.3d 967, 969 (9th Cir.1995), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-21\">The district court properly determined that it lacked diversity jurisdiction because McMahon failed to carry his burden of proving complete diversity. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1); <em>Kanter v. Warner-Lambert Co., </em>265 F.3d 853, 857-58 (9th Cir.2001). In particular, McMahon, a Nevada citizen, failed to rebut the evidence submitted by defendant Martha McMahon that she also was a citizen of Nevada at the time the complaint was filed. <em>See id. </em>at 857 (explaining that for diversity purposes, citizenship is determined by domicile and not residency).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-22\">The district court properly determined that McMahon did not state an actionable Clayton Act claim, his only federal cause of action. <em>See Hicks, </em>69 F.3d at 969 (affirming Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) dismissal where federal claim failed). The facts McMahon alleged in the amended complaint did not set forth an anti-trust injury as required under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15. <em>See Pool Water Prods. v. Olin Corp., </em>258 F.3d 1024, 1034 (9th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-23\">Because the district court properly dismissed McMahon\u2019s federal claim, it did not abuse its discretion by declining jurisdiction over the state law claims. <em>See Sinaloa Lake Owners Ass\u2019n v. City of Simi Valley, </em>70 F.3d 1095, 1102-03 (9th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-24\">In light of our disposition, we do not reach McMahon\u2019s contention regarding the Eleventh Amendment immunity defense raised by defendant Bay Conservation &amp; Development Commission in its motion to dismiss the complaint. <em>See, e.g., Sandy v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number><em>Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>222 F.3d 1202,1208 n. 7 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">We lack jurisdiction to consider the district court\u2019s order denying McMahon\u2019s post-dismissal motion to amend the complaint because McMahon failed to file an amended notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">We are unpersuaded by McMahon\u2019s contention that Judge Breyer impermissibly reassigned this case to himself upon a finding that it was related to an earlier case pending before him. <em>See Badea v. Cox, </em>931 F.2d 573, 575 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201cDistrict court judges have \u2018broad discretion\u2019 regarding the assignment or reassignment of cases.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b714-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
