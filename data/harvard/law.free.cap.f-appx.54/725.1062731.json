These motions were denied and Wilson was sentenced, inter aha, to a total of 181 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Wilson raises five issues on appeal: (1) there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdicts; (2) the police lacked probable cause to search Wilson\u2019s residence and the evidence thereby obtained should have been suppressed; (3) the search of the leather jacket was unlawful and the evidence thereby ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>tained should have been suppressed; (4) the jury instructions given by the district court judge were inadequate; and (5) there was no evidence that the seized contraband was, in fact, cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">We have jurisdiction of this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). Our standards of review are as follows. We review for substantial evidence the sufficiency of the evidence on which the jury based its verdict. <em>See United States v. Gibbs, </em>190 F.3d 188, 197 (3d Cir.1999). In connection with the suppression hearing, we review the District Court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, while our review of its legal conclusions is de novo. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 698-99, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Myers, </em>308 F.3d 251 (3d Cir.2002). Further, \u201c[w]e generally review jury instructions for abuse of discretion, but our review is plenary when the question is whether the instruction misstates the law.\u201d <em>Walden v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., </em>126 F.3d 506, 513 (3d Cir.1997) (citations omitted). However, we review the record for plain error where no objection was made before the District Court. <em>See United States v. Jake, </em>281 F.3d 123, 132 (3d Cir.2002). Lastly, where an issue was not raised before the District Court and is raised for the first time on appeal, our review is also limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Wolfe, </em>245 F.3d 257, 260-61 (3d Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The facts of this case are familiar to the parties and will not be recited herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">\n<em>The Jury Verdict</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Wilson claims that there were insufficient facts on which to base the jury verdict that Wilson was guilty of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, and, as a result, the convictions on both counts must be reversed. Both parties agree that the government\u2019s case against Wilson was one of constructive possession. \u201cConstructive possession necessarily requires both \u2018dominion and control\u2019 over an object and knowledge of that object\u2019s existence.\u201d <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>90 F.3d 814, 817-18 (3d Cir.1996) (quoting <em>United States v. Iafelice, </em>978 F.2d 92, 96 (3d Cir. 1992)); <em>see also </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Wilson recites a number of alleged facts as support for his claim of insufficient evidence to prove either element of constructive possession. In reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, <em>see Gibbs, </em>190 F.3d at 197, we find that there was sufficient evidence to support an inference that the drugs and gun belonged to Wilson. Thus we hold that Wilson did not sustain his heavy burden of demonstrating that the trial evidence was insufficient for the jury to convict him of both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">\n<em>Probable Cause and Suppression Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">Wilson also alleges that the search warrant was invalid because, allegedly, the affidavit in support of the search warrant failed to recognize that Wilson\u2019s family members owned the home that was searched. When a warrant is challenged on the grounds that the magistrate\u2019s probable cause determination was in error, we inquire whether there was \u201ca \u2018substantial basis\u2019 for finding probable cause [based on the affidavit], as after-the-fact scrutiny by courts of the sufficiency of an affidavit should not take the form of de novo review.\u201d <em>United States v. Ninety-Two Thousand Four Hundred Twenty-Two Dollars and Fifty-Seven Cents, </em>307 F.3d 137 (3d Cir.2002) (citations omitted). We find that the search warrant was valid as the probable cause determination was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>proper.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">As the search warrant was valid, we find that the District Court correctly denied Wilson\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence obtained in the search of his residence, including that found in the leather jacket.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Wilson claims that the search of the leather jacket violated <em>Chimel </em>and the drug evidence should have been suppressed. <em>See Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 763, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969). In a lawful arrest, the officer may reasonably search and seize evidence on the arrestee\u2019s person and \u201cthe area into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary items\u201d in order to prevent harm to the officer or destruction of evidence. <em>Id. </em>We find that the search warrant was valid and that the search of the leather jacket was reasonable. The district court did not err in denying Wilson\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Wilson contends that the jury instructions gave the jury \u201can inaccurate description\u201d of constructive possession and intent. On review of the record, we find that the District Judge did not commit plain error in charging the jury. Plain error \u201cis found \u2018sparingly and only where the error was sure to have had unfair prejudicial impact on the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d \u2019 <em>United States v. Thayer, </em>201 F.3d 214, 222 (3d Cir.1999) (quoting <em>United States v. Zehrbach, </em>47 F.3d 1252, 1263 n. 9 (3d Cir.1995) (en banc)). We review the \u201ctotality of the instructions and not a particular sentence or paragraph in isolation.\u201d <em>Thayer, 201 </em>F.3d at 221 (quoting <em>United States v. Coyle, </em>63 F.3d 1239, 1245 (3d Cir.1995)). The charge to the jury given by the District Court was an accurate and clear statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">\n<em>Evidence of Cocaine Base</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">Wilson lastly alleges that the seized cocaine was not \u201ccocaine base\u201d because it was neither pure nor smokable; thus he contends that the District Court erred in applying the enhanced sentencing guidelines governing cocaine base. Wilson concedes that he did not make this argument before the District Court. He bases his argument on trial testimony that the drug experienced some drying in storage and weighed less at trial than at seizure. Following review of the record for plain error, we hold that the District Court did not err in finding that the drug was crack cocaine and therefore did not commit plain error in applying the sentencing guidelines under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b797-14\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-16\">. Wilson\u2019s trial counsel filed a motion to suppress, including among the allegations that the search warrant lacked probable cause and was overly broad. This motion was denied after a hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b795-24\">. Wilson is represented by new counsel for this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b797-8\">. We are dismayed to discover that in Wilson\u2019s brief, his appellate counsel on several occasions attributed to the trial judge statements made by Wilson\u2019s trial counsel \u2014 an attribution which tends to bolster Wilson's claim before this Court. Wilson\u2019s appellate counsel further failed to include in his Appendix the relevant pages that identified the source of the quotation as Wilson\u2019s attorney. (Appellant\u2019s Principal Brief 12, 21, 24, misquoting Appellant\u2019s Appendix 47).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b797-17\">. Because we find that the warrant was supported by probable cause, we do not address the government\u2019s alternative argument that the search was sustainable under the \"good faith\" exception to the exclusionary rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
