After granting the government\u2019s downward-departure motion made under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, p.s., the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Reyes to the statutory minimum of 120 months imprisonment, to be followed by 5 years supervised release. On appeal, Reyes\u2019s newly appointed counsel has moved to withdraw, and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that Reyes\u2019s original attorney suggested he would receive only a 5-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-20\">Construing counsel\u2019s argument as a challenge to the voluntariness of Reyes\u2019s guilty plea, we note that the district court warned Reyes, at his guilty plea hearing, that he faced a 120-month mandatory-minimum sentence, and Reyes acknowledged that the court would decide his sentence, and that he could not withdraw his plea if he received a higher-than-expected sentence, <em>see United States v. Granados, </em>168 F.3d 343, 345 (8th Cir.1999) (per curiam); further, the court was not permitted to depart below the mandatory-minimum sentence absent a government motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), <em>see United States v. Baker, </em>64 F.3d 439, 441 (8th Cir.1995). Finally, any ineffective-assistance claim is not properly before us. <em>See United States v. Cain, </em>134 F.3d 1345,1352 (8th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-21\">Having carefully reviewed the record in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues. Thus, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-17\">. The Honorable Joseph F.
