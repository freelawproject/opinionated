We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>312 F.3d 1094, 1099 (9th Cir.2002), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Castro-Diaz failed to prove that he was persecuted on account of an enumerated ground. <em>See INS v. EliasZacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482-83, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (political opinion); <em>Cruz-Navarro v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1024, 1029-30 (9th Cir.2000) (membership in a particular social group). Castro-Diaz testified that guerillas demanded money, information and materials from him, and in one incident killed his cattle and attempted to burn his ranch. Castro-Diaz failed to demonstrate that this treatment was on account of an actual or imputed political opinion. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482-83,112 S.Ct. 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">Castro-Diaz also failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution that was \u201cboth subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 960 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">It follows that Castro-Diaz failed to satisfy the more stringent standard to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
