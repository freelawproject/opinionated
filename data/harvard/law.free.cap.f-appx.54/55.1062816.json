Williams contends that the District Court erred in concluding that his New York convictions for criminal possession of stolen property qualify as \u201caggravated felon[ies]\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). Because we agree that Williams\u2019 convictions qualify as \u201caggravated felonies\u201d within the meaning of the statute, we affirm the Order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Williams, a thirty-two year old native of Guyana, entered the United States on May 15, 1985. On May 19, 1998, Williams was convicted in New York State court of two counts of criminal possession of stolen property. The court sentenced Williams to one year\u2019s imprisonment on each count, with the sentences to run concurrently. As a result of these convictions, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) issued a Notice to Appear on November 24, 1998, placing Williams in removal proceedings. In a decision dated December 9, 1999, an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) determined that Williams\u2019 convictions did not qualify as aggravated felonies and granted Williams\u2019 application for \u201ccancellation of removal\u201d pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a). The IJ also granted Williams a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The INS appealed the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d). The Government\u2019s appeal focused on the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Williams\u2019 sentence of \u201cone year\u201d failed to satisfy the requirement under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) of a conviction \u201cfor which the term of imprisonment [imposed is] at least one year.\u201d The BIA reversed the decision of the IJ. Assuming that Williams\u2019 convictions qualified as \u201ctheft offenses,\u201d the BIA held that a sentence of one year for criminal possession of stolen property rendered that conviction an aggravated felony. As a result, the BIA ruled that Williams was precluded from eligibility for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b. Section 1229b grants the Attorney General the discretion to cancel removal of an individual who meets certain criteria, including that the individual \u201chas not been convicted of any aggravated felony.\u201d The BIA also found Williams statutorily ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">Williams filed his Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus on February 7, 2001 to challenge the BIA decision. The District Court appointed counsel to represent him. After a series of briefings and hearings, the District Court denied the petition on December 21, 2001. Although the District Court entered an order staying removal to allow counsel to file an appeal, the Government removed Williams from the United States on or about December 23, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">II. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">The District Court exercised jurisdiction over Williams\u2019 habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c). <em>See INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (holding that neither the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 nor the Illegal Immigration Reform Act of 1996 repealed the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review aliens\u2019 habeas petitions). This Court exercises appellate jurisdiction over the District Court\u2019s order denying habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. <em>See Steele v. Blackman, </em>236 F.3d 130,133 (3d Cir.2001). We review <em>de novo </em>the District Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>denial of habeas corpus relief and its interpretation of the applicable statute. <em>See Gerbier v. Holmes, </em>280 F.3d 297, 302 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Williams argues that his convictions for possession of stolen property in New York do not qualify as aggravated felonies under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). First, he claims that the relevant sections of New York law and the INA make clear that possession of stolen property is not a \u201ctheft offense (including receipt of stolen property).\u201d Second, he contends that the BIA and the District Court erred in adopting a harsh interpretation of Congressional intent based on ambiguous statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u201cAny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The INA defines \u201ca theft offense (including receipt of stolen property) or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year\u201d as an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). Williams argues that the plain language of the INA does not extend to possession offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Williams was convicted under New York Penal Law \u00a7 165.40, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">Criminal Possession of stolen property in the fifth degree. A person is guilty of criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth degree when he knowingly possesses stolen property, with the intent to benefit himself or a person other than an owner thereof or to impede the recovery by an owner thereof. Criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth degree is a class A misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">Based on the language in both the state and federal statutes, he concludes that while one who steals a car or car parts may be guilty of a theft offense in New York, one who possesses such items is culpable of neither a theft offense nor receiving stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">The Seventh Circuit recently dealt with this issue and held that \u201cthe modern, generic, and broad definition of the entire phrase \u2018theft offense (including receipt of stolen property)\u2019 is a taking of property or an exercise of control over property without consent with the criminal intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits of ownership, even if such deprivation is less than total or permanent.\u201d <em>Hernandez-Maneilla v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>246 F.3d 1002, 1009 (7th Cir. 2001). The Seventh Circuit cited a number of reasons for reaching this conclusion. First, both the Model Penal Code and Black\u2019s Law Dictionary recognize that \u201ctheft\u201d encompasses many crimes, indicating that any definition should be broad. <em>See id. </em>at 1008. Second, other courts have noted that Congress has indicated that the phrase \u201caggravated felony\u201d encompasses a vast range of offenses, as evidenced by the fact that, in 1996, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) added offenses under the label \u201caggravated felony\u201d and lowered the sentencing threshold from five years to one year under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). <em>See id. </em>Third, \u201cby choosing the words \u2018theft offense\u2019 rather than just \u2018theft,\u2019 and by expressly including \u2018receipt of stolen property,\u2019 Congress signaled that it was not presenting an exhaustive list of offenses (i.e. just theft and receipt); rather, with its word choices, Congress indicated that the phrase ought to be given a broad read.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Finally, while other offenses listed as \u201caggravated felonies\u201d reference other statutes, which limit the scope of deportable offenses under those sections, \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) contains no such references.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>We agree with the analysis of the Seventh Circuit and conclude that the phrase \u201ctheft offense (including receipt of stolen property)\u201d should be read broadly. Williams was convicted of knowingly possessing stolen property, with the intent to benefit himself or a person other than an owner thereof or to impede the recovery by an owner thereof, through his work in a \u201cchop shop.\u201d The Immigration Judge heard testimony that Williams participated in removing parts from cars that he knew were stolen. We conclude that Williams\u2019 convictions for criminal possession of stolen property based on this conduct qualify as \u201ctheft offenses\u201d under our broad reading of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">We also reject Williams\u2019 second argument, that the BIA and the District Court erred in adopting a harsh interpretation of Congressional intent based on ambiguous statutory language. \u201c[T]he rule of lenity does not apply simply because a statute requires interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Graham, </em>169 F.3d 787, 790 (3d Cir.1999) (citations omitted). Based on the language used in the section of the statute at issue, changes made to past versions of the section, and comparisons to other sections of the statute, we conclude that Congress intended the phrase \u201ctheft offenses (including receipt of stolen property)\u201d to be given a broad meaning. As a result, we need not resort to the rule of lenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Accordingly, because Williams\u2019 convictions for possession of stolen property under New York law meet the definition of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G), we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
