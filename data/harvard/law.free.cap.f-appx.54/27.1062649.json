The district court filed its judgment on April 24, 2002. Frazier\u2019s notice of appeal is dated May 20, 2002. The appeal was not submitted within the ten-day window mandated by Fed. R.App. P. 4(b). There is no indication in the record that any of Rule 4\u2019s exceptions to the ten-day rule apply in this case. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to hear the appeal. <em>See United States v. Outen, </em>286 F.3d 622, 630 (2d Cir.2002) (\u201c[N]ot only are the time limits of Fed. RApp. P. 4 mandatory and jurisdictional, these time limits are the one procedural area which courts of appeal are expressly forbidden from altering or suspending in an individual case.\u201d) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). That the district court allegedly failed to advise the defendant of his right to appeal does not change this jurisdictional fact; the defendant\u2019s remedy, if any, may be pursued through a habeas action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Ferraro, </em>992 F.2d 10, 11-12 (2d Cir.1993) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-16\">The appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
