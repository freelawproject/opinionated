The male plaintiffs were employed at various times as either bus mechanics or bus drivers at the Connetquot School District\u2019s bus garage in Bohemia, NY, where they were allegedly exposed to toxic substances. Citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, plaintiffs alleged violations of due process and equal protection by reason of the Connetquot defendants\u2019 knowing exposure of plaintiffs to carcinogens and their deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs\u2019 safety, and by the Suffolk County defendants\u2019 awareness of the hazardous conditions and their failure to compel the Connetquot defendants to remedy those conditions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, plaintiffs challenge the district court\u2019s holding that they failed to allege a valid \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c). <em>Burnette v. Carothers, </em>192 F.3d 52, 56 (2d Cir.1999). \u201cIn deciding a Rule 12(c) motion, we apply the same standard as that applicable to a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), accepting the allegations contained in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">We agree with the district court that plaintiffs failed to state a \u00a7 1983 claim because they did not allege the deprivation of a legally cognizable constitutional right. <em>See Dwares v. City of New York, </em>985 F.2d 94, 98 (2d Cir.1993). The complaint, fairly read, premises the due process claim on a denial of a minimal level of workplace safety in public employment, or on defendants\u2019 deliberate indifference to plaintiffs\u2019 safety. Neither allegation is viable under \u00a7 1983, <em>see Collins v. City of Harker Heights, </em>503 U.S. 115, 127-130, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992), and we adhere to its holding today.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-14\">Plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim is likewise meritless: \u201cTo show an equal protection violation, appellants must show that they were selectively treated compared with similarly situated employees, and that selective treatment was based on impermissible considerations.... \u201d <em>Knight v. Conn. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Health, </em>275 F.3d 156, 166 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotation mark omitted). At most, plaintiffs suggest that they were discriminated against as municipal employees, Blue 26, but they do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>allege how others \u201csimilarly situated\u201d were subject to different treatment, or what \u201cimpermissible consideration\u201d motivated the selective treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">We have reviewed plaintiffs\u2019 other contentions and find no merit in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The record discloses that John Murray and Richard Markfelder are now deceased. A \u00a7 1983 claim survives death \u201cif applicable state law creates a right of survival.\u201d <em>Barrett v. United States, </em>689 F.2d 324, 331 (2d Cir.1982). \u201cUnder New York law the claim arising from the infringement of [plaintiffs] civil rights survives his death and may be asserted by his personal representative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even if death occurs between the filing of the suit and the time of the appeal, a personal representative still must be substituted. <em>See Johnson v. Morgenthau, </em>160 F.3d 897, 898-99 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam). No personal representative has been substituted for either John Murray or Richard Markfelder. Their claims are therefore dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is the judgment of the district court is VACATED IN PART with the instruction to dismiss without prejudice as to John Murray and Richard Markfelder, who are deceased, and AFFIRMED in all other respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-9\">. The plaintiffs also brought state law claims, over which the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
