(the \u201cClinic\u201d). The Clinic is a not-for-profit, multi-specialty medical group, providing medical and administrative services for employee benefit plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">O\u2019Neill entered the Clinic on August 1, 2000 for induction of labor. The Clinic denied O\u2019Neill a Cesarean section as not medically necessary and discharged her that day. She returned again the following day for induction of labor. However, the Clinic did not perform a Cesarean section until August 3, 2000. O\u2019Neill\u2019s baby did not survive the delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-15\">O\u2019Neill filed a state-law malpractice suit against her treating physicians. She also sued the Clinic, alleging both vicarious liability and direct claims of corporate negligence. She claims that the Clinic \u201cpurposefully and knowingly discourag[ed] the performance of Cesarean sections\u201d and \u201cpurposefully and knowingly plac[ed] more emphasis on profits than on quality of patient care.\u201d She contends that, had she received a Cesarean section earlier, her baby would not have died.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-16\">The Clinic removed the case to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, asserting that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq., </em>preempts O\u2019Neill\u2019s state law claims and hence the District Court had jurisdiction. To support this assertion, the Clinic contended that O\u2019Neill\u2019s claim was really an attempt to recover benefits due under an ERISA plan, to clarify rights to those benefits, or to enforce rights to future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>benefits, and thus stated a cause of action under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">O\u2019Neill filed a motion to remand, alleging that her claims did not relate to ERISA plan administration or denial of plan benefits but rather to provision of medical care and, under Third Circuit precedent, <em>see Pryzbowski v. U.S. Healthcare, Inc., </em>245 F.3d 266 (3d Cir.2001); <em>Lazorko v. Pa. Hosp., </em>237 F.3d 242 (3d Cir.2000); <em>In re U.S. Healthcare, Inc., </em>193 F.3d 151 (3d Cir.1999); <em>Dukes v. U.S. Healthcare, Inc., </em>57 F.3d 350 (3d Cir.1995), ERISA did not completely preempt her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">On December 20, 2001, the District Court granted O\u2019Neill\u2019s motion to remand, holding that the claims involved \u201cquality of care\u201d rather than ERISA plan administration. The Clinic now seeks review of the District Court\u2019s remand order.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">A remand order is ordinarily not reviewable on appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). There are two exceptions to this rule, however. First, a district court\u2019s remand order is reviewable when based on reasons other than those grounds specified in \u00a7 1447(c). <em>Thermtron Prods., Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, </em>423 U.S. 336, 350-352, 96 S.Ct. 584, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, we may review a remand order when the district court has made a separable decision that \u201cpreceded the remand both in logic and in fact has ramifications beyond merely determining the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Powers v. Southland Corp., </em>4 F.3d 223, 230 (3d Cir.1993); <em>see also City of Waco v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>293 U.S. 140, 55 S.Ct. 6, 79 L.Ed. 244 (1934). The Clinic argues that this case fits within the second exception. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">Cases successfully invoking the second exception have sought to appeal determinations with important ramifications for substantive issues other than federal jurisdiction. In <em>Powers, </em>the district court allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaint to add another defendant under a relation back theory, even though the statute of limitations governing the action against that defendant had expired. Because adding the new defendant destroyed diversity jurisdiction, the district court remanded the case to state court. <em>Powers, </em>4 F.3d at 224. Our Court concluded that \u201cthe district court\u2019s decision to permit the amendment of the complaint by application of the relation back doctrine ... is separable from the decision to remand\u201d because that decision determined whether the new defendant could be sued at all and therefore had ramifications beyond determining the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 228.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Invoking the same logic, in <em>Aliota v. Graham, </em>984 F.2d 1350 (3d Cir.1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 817, 114 S.Ct. 68, 126 L.Ed.2d 37 (1993), we held that a district court\u2019s decision substituting federal employee-defendants in their individual capacities in place of the United States, which led to a remand to state court, was reviewable because the order substituting the individual defendants was not \u201cinextricably linked to the question of remand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1353. In <em>Carr v. American Red Cross, </em>17 F.3d 671 (3d Cir.1994), we reviewed a remand order when the remand was compelled by the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss the Red Cross as a defendant. Carr had given the Red Cross a joint tortfeasor release in settlement of Carr\u2019s claims against Red Cross. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 674. Because dismissing the Red Cross barred Carr from pursuing further judicial remedies against it, the court\u2019s decision had \u201cindependent relevance in adjudging the rights of all ... parties involved in [the] action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">The Clinic strains to find a separable decision by suggesting that the District Court \u201cin effect\u201d made two rulings: (1) the Clinic is not an ERISA entity; and (2) O\u2019Neill\u2019s claims relate to quality of care rather than quantity of care. However, it is clear that the District Court only decided the latter issue, concluding that the claims concerned only quality of care and thus escape ERISA preemption. As to the first issue, the District Court merely decided that the Clinic was functioning as a medical care provider rather than an ERISA administrator in the circumstances of O\u2019Neill\u2019s case, a question that necessarily bears on whether O\u2019Neill\u2019s claims relate to quantity of care or quality of care. Given that the District Court made this determination \u201cfor the purpose of determining subject matter jurisdiction, the issue is not separable because it cannot be said to have preceded the remand decision \u2018in logic and in fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carr, </em>17 F.3d at 675 (quoting <em>City of Waco v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>293 U.S. 140, 143, 55 S.Ct. 6, 79 L.Ed. 244 (1934) (emphases omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The Clinic argues in the alternative that Congress intended remand orders in ERISA cases to be reviewable. It stresses the need for uniform application of ERISA law and the importance of the ERISA program for Americans\u2019 health care. We decline to read an ERISA exception into \u00a7 1447(d), however. Had Congress intended federal appellate courts to review orders remanding cases for lack of complete ERISA preemption, it would have explicitly provided for that review. Fading that explicit provision, we lack jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Because we have no jurisdiction over the Clinic\u2019s appeal, we deny as moot O\u2019Neill\u2019s motion to supplement the joint appendix and to expand the record.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-8\">. Because the District Court remanded for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, one of the reasons \u00a7 1447(c) specifies for remand, the first exception is clearly inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b141-13\">. We nonetheless dismissed the appeal in <em>Powers </em>because the order from which the appeal was taken was neither final under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, nor was it covered by the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
