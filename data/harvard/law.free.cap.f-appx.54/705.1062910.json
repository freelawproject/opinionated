We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-18\">The appellant identifies five principal questions on appeal: (1) whether the court erred in giving a \u201cgeneral unanimity instruction\u201d to the jury, rather than specifying that the' jurors had to agree unanimously as to the particular day on which the defendant possessed the firearm; (2) whether the court abused its discretion in handling the government\u2019s belated, mid-trial disclosure of a police videotape recorded moments after the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>arrested; (3) whether Defendant\u2019s rights under Fed.R.Crim.P. 43 were violated by two chambers conferences, in which he did not participate, regarding a juror\u2019s potential bias; (4) whether the court erred in imposing a sentencing enhancement for perjury; and (5) whether Defendant received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel. The fifth issue need not long detain us, as Appellant asks that we refrain from deciding the matter so that he can better develop the factual record and pursue his ineffective assistance claim on a habeas petition. Given the agreed-upon need for further factual development, this is the suitable course. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>205 F.3d 23, 35 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Since the defense did not object below (1) to the general unanimity instruction or (2) to the court\u2019s decision not to invite Defendant to attend the in-chambers conferences, we review the court\u2019s actions for plain error. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>274 F.3d 655, 667 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201c[Bjefore an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.... If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). \u201cAn error is plain if it is clear or obvious at the time of appellate consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Our circuit permits the use of general unanimity instructions \u201cexcept in cases where the complexity of the evidence or other factors create a genuine danger of jury confusion,\u201d <em>United States v. Schiff, </em>801 F.2d 108, 114-15 (2d Cir.1986). That is not this case. After explaining that the government was not required to prove possession \u201con both of the dates listed in the indictment,\u201d the trial court charged the jury that the government did have the \u201cburden ... to prove that the defendant committed a crime on one of the two dates alleged, or on a date reasonably near either of the two dates alleged.\u201d This instruction, coupled with the court\u2019s general unanimity charge, would fairly alert an average juror that unanimity was required as to \u201cone of the two dates\u201d of possession. Indeed, we have upheld general unanimity instructions in cases that were considerably more complicated than the one before us. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Shaoul, </em>41 F.3d 811, 817-18 (2d Cir.1994) (general unanimity instruction acceptable in complex conspiracy case involving schemes to defraud insurance company). Accordingly, we cannot say that the court made a \u201cclear or obvious\u201d error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant fares no better with his claim that the tidal judge erred in not inviting Defendant\u2019s attendance at two in-chamber conferences, during which the judge and counsel for both parties (1) decided how to respond to an anonymous tip regarding a juror who allegedly was biased against the defendant, and (2) interviewed that juror. The juror in question was properly removed, so we deem any error that may have been made harmless. <em>Cf. Yarborough v. Keane, </em>101 F.3d 894, 899 (2d Cir.1996) (using harmless-error analysis to excuse the defendant\u2019s absence from a hearing on whether to disqualify a prosecution eye-witness).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-13\">As for the late-disclosed videotape, we find that the court did not abuse its discretion (a) in denying the defense\u2019s motions for a mistrial and for a continuance sufficient to procure expert examination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>tape, or (b) in granting the defense only a limited opportunity for a private viewing of the tape. We affirm the court\u2019s rulings in these respects substantially for the reasons that it stated, and we note that even at this late date, the defendant has not shown prejudice, i.e., how earlier disclosure of the tape, or a longer continuance, would have altered his trial plan. The eases cited by the appellant are not on point. The videotape was not relied upon by the prosecution, in contrast to the late-disclosed evidence in <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>420 F.2d 26, 28-29 (2d Cir.1969) and <em>United States v. Edwardo-Franco, </em>885 F.2d 1002, 1009 (2d Cir.1989). And the videotape did not compromise the defendant\u2019s trial strategy, as did the tardy disclosure in <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>239 F.3d 163,168 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">The remaining issue for us to consider is whether the sentencing court erred in enhancing Appellant\u2019s sentence for perjury. Appellant does not dispute that the court made the requisite findings \u201cthat the defendant 1) willfully 2) and materially 3) committed perjury,\u201d <em>United States v. Zagari, </em>111 F.3d 307, 329 (2d Cir.1997), but Appellant asks us to disallow enhancements for perjury except where the jury\u2019s guilty verdict necessarily reflects a disbelief in the defendant\u2019s testimony. This we cannot do, as <em>United States v. Fan, </em>36 F.3d 240, 247 (2d Cir.1994) is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">We have reviewed Appellant\u2019s other arguments and suggestions, and find no merit in them. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Appellant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is rejected without prejudice to renewal in a subsequent timely habeas petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-9\">. It is unavailing on plain-error review for Defendant to suggest that <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999) undermines the Second Circuit precedents that approve of general instructions, for <em>Richardson </em>does not address the choice between general and specific unanimity instructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
