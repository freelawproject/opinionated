This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">In 1994, Dennis King was tried in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and was found guilty by a jury on six counts of using facilities in interstate commerce with the intent that murder be committed. King\u2019s conviction and 145 month sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. <em>United States v. King, </em>75 F.3d 1217 (7th Cir.1996). King\u2019s first post-conviction motion, a motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, was denied in the district court and it does not appear that King took an appeal from this decision. In 2002 King, now incarcerated in a federal facility in Lexington, Kentucky, filed a \u00a7 2241 petition challenging the constitutionality of his conviction. The district court sua sponte ordered the petition to be dismissed and this appeal followed a series of orders denying King\u2019s post-judgment motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-14\">The district court dismissed King\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, in which King raised several constitutional challenges to his conviction, after concluding that King did not meet his threshold burden to show that his \u00a7 2255 remedies were inadequate or ineffective to this task. This court reviews de novo the dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>United States v. Peterman, </em>249 F.3d 458, 461 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1008, 122 S.Ct. 493, 151 L.Ed.2d 404 (2001). An examination of the record and law supports the district court\u2019s articulation of \u00a7 2241 jurisprudence and the decision to dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-15\">Chicago-area businessman Dennis King was convicted in the Northern District of Illinois on six counts of using interstate facilities with the intent to hire someone to kill his estranged wife. The evidence of record included eight separate audio recordings of conversations, most of them over the telephone, between King and his nephew in which King discussed locating, paying, and facilitating the task of, a \u201chit man.\u201d A summary of those recordings is found in the body of the Seventh Circuit decision affirming King\u2019s conviction. <em>See King, </em>75 F.3d at 1220-21. King\u2019s appellate counsel argued, in vain, that the admission of these conversations tainted King\u2019s trial and King subsequently raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>a complete, if unsuccessful, challenge to the admission of these tapes (among other claims) in his motion to vacate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">It is against this background that King, presently incarcerated in the Sixth Circuit, filed a petition for habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the Eastern District of Kentucky. King articulates twenty-two separate grounds for relief in his effort to show \u201cwhy his [King\u2019s] jury trial, direct appeal, and \u00a7 2255 appeal [sic] are invalid.\u201d The twenty-two grounds include, \u201cactual innocence,\u201d (Ground 1), ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel (Grounds 2-11), a massive conspiracy against King by the courts and government (Grounds 12-18, 21-22), and due process/trial error (Grounds 19-20). Each of these grounds for relief is directed to the constitutionality of King\u2019s conviction; not one of these grounds is directed to the actual execution of King\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The district court conducted its initial review of the petition on King\u2019s motion for pauper status and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243. The district court reviewed King\u2019s litigation history and the claims presented in the petition. The court then observed that, as King was attempting to use \u00a7 2241 to mount a collateral attack upon his conviction, it was incumbent upon him to show that his traditional remedies under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 were \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 115. The court concluded that King\u2019s claims did not meet the \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d test as construed in <em>Charles v. Chandler, </em>180 F.3d 753, 756-58 (6th Cir.1999), the latest Sixth Circuit pronouncement on the subject. Having reached this conclusion, the district court ordered the petition to be dismissed for want of subject matter jurisdiction. This appeal followed two unsuccessful post-judgment motions essentially raising the identical claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Section 2241 of Title 28 provides that a federal prisoner may bring a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district in which he is incarcerated. If the prisoner seeks to challenge the execution of his sentence, he must file a \u00a7 2241 petition in the district court having jurisdiction over his custodian. <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 755-56. If the prisoner wishes to challenge the imposition of his sentence, he must file a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate the sentence in the district court in which he was sentenced. <em>Id. </em>King\u2019s petition is a clear challenge to the imposition of his sentence, not the execution or manner in which his sentence is being served. Therefore, \u00a7 2255, not \u00a7 2241, would ordinarily provide the proper vehicle by which King should present his challenge. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">King may be entitled to review of his claims under \u00a7 2241, however, if he is able to establish that \u00a7 2255 \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 H 5. The remedy under \u00a7 2255 is not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d in this context merely because a petitioner has been denied relief under that statute, because he is procedurally barred from pursuing relief under that statute, or because he has been denied permission to file a second or successive motion to vacate. <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 756. \u201cThe remedy afforded under \u00a7 2241 is not an additional, alternative or supplemental remedy to that prescribed under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 758. The leading, and arguably only, example of an \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d remedy under \u00a7 2255 is the case of a prisoner who can show that an intervening change in the law establishes his actual innocence. <em>See, e.g., In re Davenport, </em>147 F.3d 605, 609-10 (7th Cir.1998) (prisoner convicted of \u201cusing\u201d firearm during a drug crime or violent crime found himself innocent when the Supreme Court subsequently defined \u201cuse\u201d in a restrictive manner in <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501,133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>An examination of the grounds raised in King\u2019s petition show that he was not entitled to use \u00a7 2241 to mount a collateral challenge to his conviction. King\u2019s only \u201cactual innocence\u201d claim, Ground One, is merely a re-hash of King\u2019s prior arguments directed to the sufficiency of the evidence or his lack of pre-disposition to commit the crimes of conviction. The twenty-one remaining grounds, as described above, do not even purport to demonstrate King\u2019s \u201cactual innocence\u201d in this context. The district court properly concluded that \u00a7 2241 is unavailable to King for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Accordingly, all pending motions are denied and the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.
