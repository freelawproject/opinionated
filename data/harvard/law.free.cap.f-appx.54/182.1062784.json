Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-26\">Me\u00e1is had originally been sentenced to imprisonment for 360 months. Drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>quantity was not charged in his indictment, nor was quantity specified in the court\u2019s jury instructions or in the jury\u2019s verdict. We vacated the sentence as plain error, and remanded for resentencing. <em>See Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The district court held a resentencing hearing and imposed a 240 month sentence. Me\u00e1is appeals from this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Me\u00e1is first argues that his conviction, as well as his sentence, should have been vacated because the indictment did not charge a specific drug quantity and did not charge the use of a minor in the commission of the offense. In <em>United States v. Benenhaley, </em>this court rejected this argument and reaffirmed its prior holding that \u201can indictment that charges an unspecified drug quantity suffices to support a conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 [ (2000) ].\u201d 281 F.3d 423, 424 (4th Cir.) (citing <em>United States v. Promise, </em>255 F.3d 150, 160 (4th Cir.2001)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 123 S.Ct. 275, 154 L.Ed.2d 116 (2002). Thus, although Me\u00e1is\u2019 indictment did not charge a specific quantity, his conviction was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Me\u00e1is next argues that <em>Apprendi </em>requires that sentencing factors \u2014 such as amount of drugs and use of a minor in the commission of the offense- \u2014 be alleged in the indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. We have previously held that sentencing factors are not required to be alleged in the indictment or submitted to the jury. <em>United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 202 (4th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 937, 121 S.Ct. 1393, 149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001). \u201c[T]he relevant [statutory] \u2018maxi-mum\u2019 under <em>Apprendi </em>is found on the face of the statute rather than in the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201. Thus, Me\u00e1is\u2019 statutory maximum was 240 months under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), based on an unspecified quantity of cocaine base. Because the sentence imposed on remand did not exceed the statutory maximum, application of the sentencing factors of drug quantity and use of a minor does not implicate the rale announced in <em>Apprendi. See Kinter, </em>235 F.3d at 201-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">The last issue raised by Me\u00e1is is that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is facially unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi. </em>We have previously rejected this argument and see no reason to revisit it. <em>See United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 232 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">Accordingly, we affirm Me\u00e1is\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b253-7\"> <em>Apprendi </em>held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond a prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
