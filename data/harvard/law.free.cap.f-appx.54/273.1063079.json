He argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel when his attorney waived lesser included offense and defense-related jury instructions that were inconsistent with Petitioner\u2019s trial testimony that he was not at the scene of the crime. Because the facts are known to the parties, we do not recite them here. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">1. <em>The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 governs Petitioner\u2019s claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">Petitioner filed his federal <em>habeas </em>petition after April 24, 1996. Therefore, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) governs our review<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the state court\u2019s determination that counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable under <em>Strickland v. Washington.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-16\">II. <em>The AEDPA standard of review defeats Petitioner\u2019s claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-17\">Assuming that Petitioner could show that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance at trial, Petitioner would then need to establish that the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established Fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>eral law\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner has failed to make either showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The state court concluded that counsel\u2019s decision not to request the jury instructions was a reasonable tactical choice given Petitioner\u2019s decision to testify that he was not at the scene.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In order to grant the petition, we would need to conclude, not that Petitioner\u2019s legal conclusion is better than that reached by the state court, but that the state court\u2019s conclusion is so clearly wrong as to be unreasonable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">A. <em>Under AEDPA we defer to the state court\u2019s conclusion that counsel\u2019s selection of the defense was reasonable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The state court concluded that trial counsel acted reasonably in resting Petitioner\u2019s defense on Petitioner\u2019s testimony that he was not at the scene of the crime. If the jury had believed Petitioner, then he would have been absolved of all participation in the crimes that night. Only one witness testified that Petitioner was present at the scene. His testimony was susceptible to impeachment because he had given previous inconsistent statements to the police and was testifying in exchange for the state\u2019s agreement not to prosecute him for murder. Therefore, we cannot say that the state court\u2019s conclusion is so unreasonable that it requires reversal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">Neither <em>Phillips v. </em>Woodford<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> nor <em>Johnson v. </em>Baldwin<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> require us to overturn the state court\u2019s conclusion that the selection of the defense was reasonable. Both of these cases found ineffective assistance for selecting a weak defense over a stronger one, but both relied upon the fact that counsel failed to investigate in order to make an informed choice in selecting the defense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, <em>Johnson </em>did not involve AEDPA deference to the state court\u2019s conclusions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In this case, Petitioner does not allege that inadequate investigation led to his counsel\u2019s decision to present a defense consistent with Petitioner\u2019s version of the events. Indeed, the record reflects that counsel listened to Petitioner\u2019s story, reviewed the evidence in the case, went back to Petitioner and confronted him about the inconsistencies between his version of the events and the other evidence, and Petitioner still insisted upon testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-15\">B. <em>Because counsel\u2019s selection of defense was reasonable, counsel\u2019s waiver of inconsistent jury instructions did not deny Petitioner effective assistance of counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-16\"><em>As </em>discussed above, AEDPA does not allow us to overturn the state court\u2019s conclusion that counsel\u2019s selection of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>fense was reasonable. Our determination of this predicate issue effectively resolves this appeal. Now, in our analysis of whether Petitioner\u2019s counsel was constitutionally ineffective when he waived the jury instructions that were inconsistent with Petitioner\u2019s testimony, we must presume that counsel\u2019s selection of the defense was reasonable. Working under this presumption, we cannot then conclude that counsel\u2019s decision to waive inconsistent jury instructions constituted ineffective assistance.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s counsel stated that his decision to waive these jury instructions was a tactical choice not to contradict his client\u2019s testimony and risk conveying to the jury that Petitioner\u2019s own lawyer believed he was lying.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The state court thus reasonably concluded that counsel had no obligation to request jury instructions inconsistent with the otherwise reasonable defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Petitioner relies upon <em>United States v. </em>Span<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to support his claim. Petitioner\u2019s reliance upon <em>Span </em>is misplaced; in that case, this court found that counsel had provided ineffective assistance because counsel\u2019s misunderstanding of the law resulted in his failure to request an excessive force jury instruction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, counsel\u2019s decision in <em>Span </em>to forego the instruction was simply erroneous, not strategic.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In this case, no evidence suggests that coun-</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">s\u00e9is decision was premised upon a misunderstanding of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b344-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-10\">. <em>Lindh v.
