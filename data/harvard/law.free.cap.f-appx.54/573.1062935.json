O'Kelley, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Georgia, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b644-7\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"AlC\">FUENTES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">On October 22, 2001, Appellant Dorian Tabares pled guilty to a one-count information charging him with violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2) by re-entering the United States after he was deported subsequent to being convicted of an aggravated felony. In the Presentence Investigation Report, the Probation Office assigned Tabares a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of II, which placed him in a sentencing range of 41-51 months. At sentencing on April 5, 2002, Tabares moved for a downward departure on the basis that, as a result of his alien status, he would suffer a fortuitous increase in the severity of his sentence. The District Court declined to depart downward.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Tabares filed a timely Notice of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">The District Court exercised jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review a district court\u2019s decisions concerning departures from the Sentencing Guidelines for an abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Abuhouran, </em>161 F.3d 206, 209 (3d Cir.1998) (citing <em>United States v. Sally, </em>116 F.3d 76, 78 (3d Cir.1997)). However, \u201c[w]e lack jurisdiction to review a refusal to depart downward when the district court, knowing it may do so, nonetheless determines that departure is not warranted.\u201d <em>United States v. McQuilkin, </em>97 F.3d 723, 729 (3d Cir.1996) (citing <em>United States v. Denardi, </em>892 F.2d 269, 272 (3d Cir. 1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">As pertinent to this appeal, Tabares argued at the sentencing hearing that his sentence would be fortuitously increased due to his alien status (1) because he would serve an additional six months in INS detention and (2) because, as a deportable alien, he was ineligible for early release programs for which non-alien defendants with the same offense level and criminal history category were eligible. On appeal, Tabares asserts that the District Court did not take into consideration the additional six months incarceration he would be subjected to due to his ineligibility for early release and focused only on the increased severity of his sentence due to the six months he would serve in INS custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-14\">Our review of the record indicates that the District Court recognized its discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>to depart downward. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">I acknowledge that I have the authority to depart in this case.....But I\u2019m am [sic] exercising my discretion not to depart. I will consider your arguments as to where I sentence [Tabares] within the range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">App. at 48-44. The record also shows that the District Court considered Tabares\u2019 argument that a downward departure was warranted because his ineligibility for early release would fortuitously result in a more severe sentence being imposed on him than would be imposed on a similarly situated non-alien. After defense counsel advanced Tabares\u2019 early release argument, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">THE COURT: He can\u2019t get released because he has to be deported.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3j\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes. But he\u2019s getting 12 months more than everybody else at [an offense level of] 21.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFl\">THE COURT: I understand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">App. at 34. When sentencing Tabares, the District Court explained the reasons underlying its denial of the requested downward departure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-11\">I don\u2019t depart because I don\u2019t find that this case falls within United States versus Smith.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In that case the courts are told to depart only when they are persuaded that the greater severity, to the extent one considers this severity, is undeserved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-13\">In this case, whenever a defendant illegally re-enters a country after having been deported once and told that he is legally barred from re-entering, he certainly knows and deserves administrative deportation proceedings after the illegal re-entry. So I don\u2019t find that it falls within Smith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-14\">I also don\u2019t find that it falls outside the heartland of the other reentry cases. There\u2019s simply nothing about Mr. Ta-bares\u2019 case that is different from all of the unlawful re-entry cases we are seeing now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-15\">App. at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-16\">Because it is clear from the record that the District Court carefully considered all arguments advanced by Tabares in support of his motion for downward departure and acted well within its discretion in denying the relief sought, the District Court\u2019s decision is not reviewable by this Court. The instant appeal is therefore dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-10\">. However, the District Court sentenced Ta-bares to imprisonment for a term of 41 months, the lowest term under the applicable guidelines range. Additionally, the Court agreed to recommend to the Bureau of Prisons that Tabares be designated to a facility close to Tampa, Florida so that Tabares' family could visit with him there.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b645-18\">. <em>United States v.
