At sentencing, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied Saenz-Salas\u2019s request for a downward departure based on the overrepresentation of his criminal history, and then sentenced him to 41 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-24\">On appeal, Saenz-Salas\u2019s counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing the district court abused its discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>denying the downward departure. We conclude that the ruling is unreviewable, because the district court\u2019s refusal to depart was a discretionary decision. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Arce, </em>267 F.3d 775, 783-84 (8th Cir.2001). Upon reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no non-frivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-25\">. The Honorable Ronald E.
