We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-21\">Smallwood challenges the district court\u2019s decision to admit the expert testimony of a detective regarding the general characteristics of the drug trade. We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, including the decision to admit or exclude expert evidence, for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Barnette, </em>211 F.3d 803, 816 (4th Cir.2000); <em>see also Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). We find no abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Gastiaburo, </em>16 F.3d 582, 589 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-22\">Smallwood contends the district court erred when it denied his Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal and allowed the Government to reopen its case-in-chief to establish the necessary elements of Counts Four and Five of his indictment. A district court\u2019s decision to reopen a case to admit new evidence is \u201cwithin the district court\u2019s sole discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Abbas, </em>74 F.3d 506, 510 (4th Cir.1996). In determining whether a district court abused its discretion in reopening a case, we examine \u201c(1) whether the party moving to reopen provided a reasonable explanation for failing to present the evidence in its ease-in-chief; (2) whether the evidence was relevant, admissible, or helpful to the jury; and (3) whether reopening the case would have infused the evidence with distorted importance, prejudiced the opposing party\u2019s case, or precluded the opposing party from meeting the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510-11. With these standards in mind, we find no abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Jackson, 124 F.3d </em>607, 617 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-23\">Smallwood contends the district court erred by failing to exclude a certified copy of the juvenile court document reflecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Smallwood\u2019s conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine. A district court has broad discretion in ruling on the relevance and admissibility of evidence, which will not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>United States v. Bostian, </em>59 F.3d 474, 480 (4th Cir.1995). A district court will not be found to have abused its discretion unless its decision to admit evidence under Rule 404(b) was arbitrary or irrational. <em>United States v. Haney, </em>914 F.2d 602, 607 (4th Cir.1990). We find the district court\u2019s decision to admit the certified copy of Smallwood\u2019s conviction was not arbitrary or irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Smallwood maintains that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s guilty verdict on Counts One and Two. In reviewing a sufficiency claim on appeal, we sustain the verdict if the record contains substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the government, to support it. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). We find there was sufficient evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Smallwood\u2019s conviction and 123-month sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
