In 1998 Mr. Brave Bird was sentenced to 30 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1153, 2243(a), and 2246(2)(A). In May 2002, while he was serving his supervised release (after release from custody on a prior revocation sentence), Mr. Brave Bird admitted that he had violated a release condition. The district court revoked Mr. Brave Bird\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to 12 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">On appeal, Mr. Brave Bird argues that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a prison sentence at the top of the recommended Guidelines range. After careful review of the record, we find that the 12-month sentence was within the limits of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) and was not an abuse of discretion. <em>Cf. United States v. Shaw, </em>180 F.3d 920, 922-23 (8th Cir. 1999) (per curiam) (where Guidelines recommended revocation range of 3-9 months, district court did not abuse discretion in imposing 24-month prison sentence in light of nature of violations, including repeated failure to submit urine specimens, and court\u2019s expressed desire to ensure defendant would receive intensive treatment in structured environment).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Accordingly, we affirm, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-10\">. The Honorable Charles B. Kornmann, United States District Judge for the District of South Dakota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
