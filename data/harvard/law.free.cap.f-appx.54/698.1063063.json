Morson, The Morson Group, Inc. d/b/a The Morson Collection (\u201cMorson\u201d or \u201cdefendants\u201d) timely appeal from the District Court\u2019s civil judgment entered December 12, 2001, denying defendants\u2019 motions for judgment as a matter of law (\u201cJMOL\u201d), or, alternatively, for a new trial. Following a jury verdict entered July 25, 2001 a judgment was entered against defendants in favor of Palazzetti Import/Export, Inc. and Sergio Palazzetti (\u201cPalazzetti\u201d or \u201cplaintiff\u201d) in the amount of $1,661,981 for lost profits. The District Court entered two amended judgments-the first, entered December 17, 2001, adjusted the lost profits damages to $1,569,833 with interest accruing from July 19, 2001, and an additional $92,147.96 for accounts stated claims with interest accruing from December 18, 1997 (interest of $22, 726.61 was calculated by the clerk), totaling an additional $114,874.57. Interest on the accounts stated claim was to continue accruing through the date of satisfaction at the per diem rate of 0.0062% (2.23% per annum). The second amended judgment stated that plaintiff was entitled to recover $114,874.57 on the accounts stated claim and the lost profits damages were calculated by the Clerk totaling $1,584,140.46 and that interest would continue to accrue through the date of satisfaction at 0.0062% per diem (2.23% per annum).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">\u201c[W]e review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision regarding a motion for judgment as a matter of law, applying the same Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 standard as the district court below.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Bowen, </em>278 F.3d 103, 108 (2d Cir.2002) (citing <em>Song v. Ives Labs., Inc., </em>957 F.2d 1041, 1046-47 (2d Cir.1992). In <em>Phillips, </em>we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-10\">Under that stringent standard, we do not weigh the credibility of witnesses or the evidence and grant judgment as a matter of law only where there is \u201csuch a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the jury\u2019s findings could only have been the result of sheer surmise and conjecture, or ... [there is] such an overwhelming amount of evidence in favor of the movant that reasonable and fair minded men could not arrive at a verdict against him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-11\"><em>Id. </em>(alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">The District Court denied defendants\u2019 motion for JMOL, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b), stating that JMOL \u201cmay not be granted \u2018unless the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the opposing party, is insufficient to permit a reasonable juror to find in [its] favor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110 (quoting <em>DiSanto v. McGraw-Hill, Inc./Platt\u2019s Div., </em>220 F.3d 61, 64 (2d Cir.2000)). The Court concluded that the jury reasonably found that defendants were subject to an implied covenant requiring the licensee to actively exploit a license in light of the express language in the License and all of the surrounding circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">The Court identified the facts that supported the jury\u2019s findings: (1) Morson had the right to renew for an unlimited number of ten-year periods in exchange for a fee calculated on the Boston store\u2019s sales; (2) the period of the License was ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>years, which commenced with the opening of the store; (3) Palazzetti was obligated under the License to advertise the Boston store and Morson was obliged to pay $5,000 per quarter for such advertising; (4) Gregory Morson entered a ten year lease for the Boston store a few months after signing the License; and (5) the last payment to plaintiff pursuant to the License was for close to $100,000 for the prior six months\u2019 sales, making the $100,000 license fee look insubstantial and more like a \u201cguaranteed minimum\u201d for royalties rather than sufficient consideration to preclude plaintiff from recovering for lost profits under the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">The District Court concluded that these factors permitted the jury to draw the inference that the parties expected Morson to exercise reasonable diligence to operate a Palazzetti store for ten years. <em>Id. </em>The District Court also quoted the jury instructions, which laid out that the jury was to find that the defendants anticipatorily repudiated <em>or </em>that plaintiffs breached. The jury found that defendants breached or repudiated, a result that allows plaintiffs to claim damages for total breach. <em>See, e.g., Norcon Power Partners, L.P. v. Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., </em>92 N.Y.2d 458, 462-63, 682 N.Y.S.2d 664, 667, 705 N.E.2d 656 (1998) (holding that anticipatory repudiation permits the other party to claim damages for total breach). We agree with the District Court that the jury\u2019s verdict was not a result of pure conjecture or surmise and that sufficient evidence was produced from which the jury could find defendants liable for anticipatory repudiation and breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">\u201cThis court reviews the grant of a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Amorgianos v. Nat\u2019l R. R. Passenger Corp., </em>303 F.3d 256, 261 (2d Cir.2002) (citing <em>Farrior v. Waterford Bd. of Educ., </em>277 F.3d 633, 634 (2d Cir. 2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S. Ct. 2661, 153 L.Ed.2d 836 (2002)). \u201cGranting a new trial on that basis is appropriate if the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result or ... the verdict is a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Under this standard, we have no difficulty in concluding that the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion for new trial was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">We have considered all of defendants\u2019 claims on appeal. We note that we have some sympathy for Morson\u2019s position. (As Magistrate Judge Maas observed, \u201cHad this case been tried without a jury, I might well have reached a different conclusion.\u201d). But, for the reasons stated above, we are necessarily constrained by the task before us. Accordingly, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court, substantially for the reasons stated by the Court in its Opinion and Order entered December 12, 2001. <em>See Palazzetti Import/Export, Inc. v. Morson, </em>2001 WL 1568317 (S.D.N.Y.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
