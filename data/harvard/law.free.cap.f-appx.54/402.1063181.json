Morke filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) action which the district court dismissed without prejudice under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) (2000) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Prior to the entry of that order, Morke filed an amended complaint. The magistrate judge construed the filing as a motion to amend and denied the motion, noting that the action had been closed and that Morke could file a new complaint if he so chose given that his complaint had been dismissed without prejudice.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The district court subsequently denied Morke\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Morke now appeals these two orders, claiming that he was entitled to file his amended complaint as a matter of course under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) and that a new complaint would be barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-16\">\u201cA party may amend the party\u2019s pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). Here, no responsive pleading was filed; the district court announced its decision sua sponte. Prior to the entry of judgment, Morke moved to amend his \u00a7 1983 complaint. Under Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a), Morke was entitled to file his amended complaint as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-17\">We therefore vacate the orders of the magistrate judge and the district court and remand with directions that the court reopen its judgment for consideration of Morke\u2019s amended complaint. In so doing, we express no opinion as to the merits of the amended complaint. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-18\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b473-20\">The case was referred to a magistrate judge for all non-dispositive motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
