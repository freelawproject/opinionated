At sentencing, the court imposed a 2-level increase for obstruction of justice. Thereafter, the court sentenced Mayorga to concurrent 235-month prison terms on each count, and to concurrent 5-year supervised-release terms. On appeal, Mayorga argues that the obstruction increase was clearly erroneous, and that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdicts. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-20\">We conclude the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdicts. <em>See United States v. Stroh, </em>176 F.3d 439, 440 (8th Cir.1999) (in considering sufficiency of evidence, this court reviews evidence in light most favorable to verdict; reversal is warranted only if no reasonable jury could have found defendant guilty). The government presented, inter alia, the testimony of Mayorga\u2019s coconspirators, as well as government agents, who testified to Mayorga\u2019s involvement in controlled drug purchases. The jury was entitled to believe the testimony of these witnesses that Mayorga was involved in the trafficking of methamphetamine, cocaine, and marijuana in the quantities found. <em>See United States v. Fellers, </em>285 F.3d 721, 725 (8th Cir.2002) (credibility determinations are left to jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-21\">We also conclude the district court did not err in imposing the obstruetion-of-justice enhancement. The district court did not clearly err in finding, based on trial testimony, that Mayorga attempted to improperly influence a witness to not testify. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(a)) (obstruction-of-justiee enhancement is warranted when defendant threatens, intimidates, or otherwise unlawfully influences codefendant, witness, or juror, directly or indirectly, or attempts to do so); <em>United States v. Vaca, </em>289 F.3d 1046, 1049 (8th Cir.2002) (this court reviews district court\u2019s factual findings in support of obstruction enhancement for clear error; attempt to intimidate or threaten witness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>even if unsuccessful, is sufficient to sustain obstruction enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b699-17\">. The Honorable Richard G. Kopf, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
