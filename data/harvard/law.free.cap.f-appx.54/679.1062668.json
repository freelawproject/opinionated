Because the transitional rules apply, <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review for substantial evidence. <em>Chand v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-22\">The IJ gave specific and cogent reasons to support the adverse credibility finding, including inconsistencies between Edgar Marroquin\u2019s application and his testimony. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001). Some of these inconsistencies, such as Edgar Marroquin\u2019s failure to include in his asylum application that guerrillas allegedly forced him to dig a hole and buried him up to his head, went to the heart of the asylum claim. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, the IJ\u2019s determination that Edgar Marroquin\u2019s demeanor evidenced embellishment is entitled to special deference. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir.1999) (according special deference to the IJ\u2019s eye-witness observations of a petitioner\u2019s demeanor). Accordingly, the Marroquins\u2019 application for asylum and withholding of deportation was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b749-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
