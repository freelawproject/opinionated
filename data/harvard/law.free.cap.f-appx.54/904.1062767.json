Restani, Judge, United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b974-25\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b974-26\">Sarabjit Kaur (\u201cKaur\u201d) appeals from the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) which affirmed the order of the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denying her application for asylum and withholding of deportation based on an adverse credibility determination. Review of credibility findings is under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Mejia-Paiz v. INS, </em>111 F.3d 720, 723 (9th Cir.1997). Where the IJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>provides specific reasons for questioning a witness\u2019s credibility, the Court may evaluate those reasons to determine whether they are valid grounds upon which to base a finding that the applicant is not credible. <em>Damaize-Job v. INS, </em>787 F.2d 1332, 1337-38 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s finding of inconsistencies, both internally and with her written asylum application \u2014 regarding the number and timing of her alleged detentions, the treatment she received at the hands of the Indian authorities, and the type of medical treatment she sought upon her release. We find that the record reveals the discrepancies in her testimony to be minor inconsistencies in relation to her otherwise consistent and detailed descriptions of material aspects of her persecution, and that the inconsistencies stem in large part from apparent miscommunications during direct and cross-examination. <em>See Vilorio-Lopez v. INS, </em>852 F.2d 1137, 1142 (9th Cir.1988) (\u201cMinor inconsistencies in the record such as discrepancies in dates which reveal nothing about an asylum applicant\u2019s fear for his safety are not an adequate basis for an adverse credibility finding.\u201d); <em>see also Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1165-66 (9th Cir.2000) (a minor inconsistency in identifying the location of a person\u2019s persecution, in light of otherwise consistent testimony, cannot form the basis of an adverse credibility finding, especially where \u201casylum hearings frequently generate mistranslations and miscommunications.\u201d). Nor do we find that the cumulative effect of these minor inconsistencies casts serious doubt as to whether the persecution ever occurred, as they apparently stem from confusion among the various instances of persecution. <em>Cf. Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 940 (9th Cir.2000) (cumulative effect of numerous inconsistencies supports adverse credibility finding where inconsistencies involve \u201cthe heart of [petitioner\u2019s] asylum claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">With respect to the IJ\u2019s reliance on omissions in her application, the Ninth Circuit has rejected adverse credibility findings based on an asylum application that is less complete than the testimony at the hearing. <em>See Aquilera-Cota v. INS, </em>914 F.2d 1375,1382-83 (9th Cir.1990). <em>Cf. Pal, </em>204 F.3d at 940 (affirming adverse credibility determination in part because the oral testimony was \u201cinconsistent with, not an amplification of, his application.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">Lastly, the IJ\u2019s finding with respect to S. Kaur\u2019s \u201cinarticulateness\u201d in relating facts relevant to her political opinion is not supported by substantial evidence. Although Kaur did make several general references to \u201cunjust treatment,\u201d she also indicated that: (1) she gave talks on the \u201cfalse encounters\u201d in which Sikhs were being killed by government forces; and (2) a major grievance of the student organization to which she allegedly belonged was the presence of military and police from outside Punjab. Kaur also described in detail the involvement of her brother in the student organization and the circumstances surrounding his disappearance, as well as the names of several other members who were beaten and/or killed by government forces. Taking the events Kaur described as true, we conclude that the evidence compels a finding that she had a well-founded fear of persecution on account of her political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">Accordingly, we GRANT the petition; VACATE the BIA\u2019s decision; GRANT Kaur\u2019s application for withholding of removal; and REMAND for reconsideration in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b974-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
