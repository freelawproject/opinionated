Gilberton contests this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-23\">Our review of a grant of summary judgment is de novo. <em>Goosby v. Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical, Inc., </em>228 F.3d 313, 318 (3d Cir.2000). Summary judgment is appropriate if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Saldana v. Kmart Corp., </em>260 F.3d 228, 231-32 (3d Cir.2001). We view all facts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>at 232. However, \u2022the party opposing summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>may not rely on the allegations in their pleadings; instead, through \u201cmore than a scintilla\u201d of evidence, they must present \u201cspecific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">\u201cAs with all questions of statutory interpretation, we begin with the language of the statute itself.\u201d <em>In re United Healthcare Systems, Inc., </em>200 F.3d 170, 176 (3d Cir.1999). \u201cWhere statutory language is plain, we must enforce that language according to its terms.\u201d <em>Caterpillar, Inc. v. Int\u2019l Union, United Auto., Aerospace &amp; Agric. Implement Workers of Am., </em>107 F.3d 1052, 1058 (3d Cir.1997). Moreover, \u201c[w]here the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, further inquiry is not required, except in the extraordinary case where a literal reading of the language produces an absurd result.\u201d <em>Idahoan Fresh v. Advantage Produce, Inc., </em>157 F.3d 197, 202 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">We reject Gilberton\u2019s argument that the District Court erred when it ruled in favor of IRS. Sections 46(a) and (b) of the I.R.C. provide tax credits for investment in power generation facilities that qualify as \u201cbiomass properties,\u201d as defined in Section 48(1)(15). A biomass property includes \u201ca boiler for which the primary fuel will be an alternate substance.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 48(l)(3)(A)(i) (1987). An alternate substance is defined as \u201cany substance other than ... oil and natural gas, and ... any product of oil and natural gas,\u201d but \u201cdoes not include any inorganic substance and does not include coal (including lignite) or any product of such coal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 48(1)(3)(B), (15)(B)(ii). The culm that Gilberton uses to fuel its power generation facility is a mixture of anthracite, a form of coal, and inorganic materials. Accordingly, under the plain language of Section 48(1), culm is not an alternate substance. Gilberton\u2019s invocation of the policy consideration that drove the enactment of Section 48 of the I.R.C. is unavailing. \u201cWhere statutory language is plain, we must enforce that language according to its terms.\u201d <em>Caterpillar, Inc., </em>107 F.3d at 1058. The plain language of Section 48(1) of the I.R.C. excludes Gilberton from claiming an energy tax credit under Section 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">We have considered all of Appellant\u2019s arguments and see no basis for reversal. The judgment of the District Court is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
