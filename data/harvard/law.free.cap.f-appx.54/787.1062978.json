Because our review of the record discloses that the ALJ\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence, we reverse the award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-15\">We review decisions of the BRB to determine whether the BRB properly found that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and was in accordance with law. <em>See Doss v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>53 F.3d 654, 658 (4th Cir.1995). In making this determination, we conduct an independent review of the record in deciding whether the ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Dehue Coal Co. v. Ballard, </em>65 F.3d 1189, 1193 (4th Cir.1995). Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but only such evidence that a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>See Lane v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>105 F.3d 166, 170 (4th Cir.1997). Subject to the substantial evidence requirement, the ALJ has the sole authority to make credibility determinations and resolve inconsistencies or conflicts in the evidence. <em>See Grizzle v. Pickands Mather &amp; Co., </em>994 F.2d 1093, 1096 (4th Cir.1993). An ALJ, however, may rely only on a medical opinion that constitutes a reasoned medical judgment. <em>See Freeman United Coal Mining Co. v. Cooper, </em>965 F.2d 443, 448 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-16\">To establish that he is entitled to black lung benefits in a case under Part 718, a miner must prove: \u201c(1) he has pneumoconiosis; (2) the pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mine employment; (3) he has a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>tion; and (4) pneumoconiosis is a contributing cause to his total respiratory disability.\u201d Mi<em>lburn Colliery Co. v. Hicks, </em>188 F.3d 524, 529 (4th Cir.1998). The parties stipulated that Angelilli is totally disabled by a pulmonary impairment, but disagreed on whether Angelilli suffered from pneumoconiosis and on whether his impairment was caused by pneumoconiosis, Angelilli\u2019s extensive smoking history, or a combination of these two factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">A claimant may establish the existence of pneumoconiosis by means of (1) chest x-rays; (2) biopsy or autopsy evidence; (3) invocation of the presumptions at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 718.304-718.306; or (4) medical opinion evidence. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a) (2002). In findings that are not challenged on appeal, the ALJ determined that Angelilli failed to establish the existence of pneumoconiosis by x-ray evidence, that there was no biopsy or autopsy evidence, and that the presumptions of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 718.304-718.306 were not applicable to Angelilli\u2019s claim. Therefore, the only basis upon which Angelilli may establish that he suffers from pneumoconiosis is medical opinion evidence pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(4) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">A miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis if the disease</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A42\">is a substantially contributing cause of the miner\u2019s totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment. Pneumoconiosis is a \u201csubstantially contributing cause\u201d of the miner\u2019s disability if it:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-7\">(i) Has a material adverse effect on the miner\u2019s respiratory or pulmonary condition; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-8\">(ii) Materially worsens a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment which is caused by a disease or exposure unrelated to coal mine employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.204(c)(1) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">Dr. Devabhaktuni examined Angelilli on January 22, 1991, and April 1, 1997. He was deposed on September 3, 1997. In 1991, he documented Angelilli\u2019s smoking history of one pack per day from 1943 until 1972. He found Angelilli\u2019s lungs clear on examination. He diagnosed Angelilli as suffering from hypertension and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), based upon the results of a pulmonary function test and an exercise stress test. He attributed the severe COPD to Angelilli\u2019s cigarette smoking and occupational dust exposure, but did not differentiate between the relative contributions of these factors. The severe COPD caused Angelilli to be severely impaired. At his deposition, Dr. Devabhaktuni stated that he had not diagnosed pneumoconiosis in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">In 1997, Dr. Devabhaktuni found that Angelilli\u2019s lungs exhibited \u201cleft basilar rales and occasional ronchi [sic].\u201d A pulmonary function study again demonstrated a severe obstructive impairment that was not responsive to bronchodilators. Dr. Devabhaktuni diagnosed coronary artery disease and COPD. The COPD resulted from smoking and occupational dust exposure and resulted in a severe pulmonary impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">Dr. Renn also examined Angelilli twice. On September 4, 1984, Dr. Renn found Angelilli\u2019s lungs clear except for \u201cbibasilar inspiratory crackles that clear completely with coughing.\u201d Dr. Renn interpreted an x-ray as negative for pneumoconiosis, but a pulmonary function test revealed a severe obstructive defect that did not improve with bronchodilators. He concluded that Angelilli was totally disabled from returning to his last coal mine employment as a result of a \u201cmoderate-severe obstructive ventilatory defect secondary to chronic bronchitis, hypertension, possible angina pectoris and exogenous obesity.\u201d These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>conditions were not caused by pneumoconiosis, but the chronic bronchitis resulted from Angelilli\u2019s cigarette smoking history.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Dr. Renn again examined Angelilli on August 18, 1997. He was also desposed. He found Angelilli\u2019s lungs clear on examination, and again interpreted a chest x-ray as negative for pneumoconiosis. The pulmonary function test again indicated a severe obstructive impairment that did not significantly improve with bronchodilators. Although Angelilli reported that he had stopped smoking in 1978, the arterial blood gas test revealed a carboxyhemoglobin level that indicated he was currently smoking a quarter to a half pack of cigarettes per day. Dr. Renn also reviewed several medical records and test reports that included Dr. Devabhaktuni\u2019s report of examination on April 21, 1997. Dr. Renn concluded that Angelilli did not have pneumoconiosis, but suffered from chronic bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, and carboxyhemoglobinemia. Angelilli had a severe obstructive ventilatory defect that was totally disabling, that was not caused by nor contributed to by coal mine dust exposure. Angelilli\u2019s chronic bronchitis and emphysema were caused by his history of cigarette smoking.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Dr. Fino reviewed medical records, issued a written opinion, and was also deposed. Dr. Fino concluded that Angelilli did not have pneumoconiosis, but suffered from an obstructive ventilatory abnormality that involved both the large and small airways. This defect was caused by an asthmatic bronchitis condition that was caused by cigarette smoking and was unrelated to his coal mine employment. Angelilli was totally disabled, but would have been similarly disabled if he had never entered a coal mine.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The ALJ gave greatest weight to the opinion of Dr. Devabhaktuni, and discredited the opinions of Doctors Renn and Fino. In his first decision, the ALJ discredited Dr. Fino\u2019s opinion regarding the existence of pneumoconiosis because he did not examine Angelilli, and because Dr. Fino did not opine whether the asthmatic component of Angelilli\u2019s respiratory impairment could have been aggravated by coal dust exposure. The ALJ discredited Dr. Renn\u2019s opinion regarding the existence of pneumoconiosis because Dr. Renn testified at his deposition that coal dust exposure cannot aggravate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, an opinion the ALJ found inconsistent with the definition of legal pneumoconiosis. The ALJ discredited the opinions of Doctors Fino and Renn regarding disability causation because these doctors did not diagnose pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">The ALJ credited Dr. Devabhaktuni\u2019s opinion that Angelilli\u2019s disabling COPD was contributed to by coal dust exposure as sufficient to establish both the existence of pneumoconiosis and that Angelilli\u2019s respiratory disability was contributed to by pneumoconiosis. The ALJ credited Dr. Devabhaktuni\u2019s opinion because he had recently examined Angelilli and thoroughly explained his conclusions, he expressed an opinion consistent with the definition of legal pneumoconiosis, and he considered Angelilli\u2019s smoking history. On the first appeal, the BRB rejected the ALJ\u2019s reasoning and weighing of the medical opinions and remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">In his second decision, the ALJ again gave greater weight to the opinion of Dr. Devabhaktuni. The ALJ initially noted that he believed Angelilli\u2019s testimony that he had stopped smoking in 1978, which was corroborated by his wife\u2019s testimony. This conclusion was then cited to undermine Dr. Renn\u2019s opinion because Dr. Renn did not explain how he concluded that Angelilli\u2019s respiratory impairment resulted from smoking, rather than coal dust expo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>sure, when exposure to tobacco smoke ceased prior to the cessation of Angelilli\u2019s exposure to coal dust. The ALJ also found Dr. Fino\u2019s opinion not well reasoned, based upon a statement in Dr. Fino\u2019s deposition that indicated that he was making a \u201cdangerous leap\u201d in applying research on working miners to this case involving a retired miner. The ALJ found Dr. Devabhaktuni\u2019s opinion well reasoned because, although he cited a smoking history only half that found by the other physicians, he explained that exposure to industrial irritants commonly caused the same respiratory symptoms as tobacco smoking. On the second appeal, the BRB affirmed the ALJ\u2019s weighing of the medical opinion evidence, but remanded for reconsideration of the evidence of the existence of pneumoconiosis under <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Compton, </em>211 F.3d 203 (4th Cir.2000). After the ALJ again awarded benefits, the BRB affirmed and Consolidation Coal appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Our review of the record convinces us that the ALJ erred in his evaluation of the medical opinion evidence. The reports of Dr. Devabhaktuni\u2019s examinations of Angelilli were documented on Department of Labor forms. These reports, contrary to the ALJ\u2019s initial characterization, do not fully explain Dr. Devabhaktuni\u2019s reasoning and conclusions, but rather merely document those conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Further, we find that Dr. Devabhaktuni\u2019s opinions were equivocal and not well reasoned. In his deposition, Dr. Devabhaktuni acknowledged several objective symptoms exhibited by Angelilli that were not consistent with a respiratory impairment caused by coal dust exposure. When Dr. Devabhaktuni was asked how he determined the cause of Angelilli\u2019s COPD, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-7\">Q Okay. The etiologies of those diseases you indicated what on the form?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-8\">A Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is due to smoking and occupational dust exposure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-9\">Q How were you able to conclude that it was due to a combination of smoking and occupational dust exposure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-10\">A Well, because chronic obstructive lung disease or emphysema or chronic bronchitis is thought to be associated with smoking and also dust exposure, whether it be \u2014 whatever. Smoke and dust. And since I know that he worked in the mines, then, he has some dust exposure there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-11\">Q Not every individual who worked in the mines develops a dust induced lung disease, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-12\">A Not necessarily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-13\">Q How was it you were able to determine that this gentleman\u2019s exposure in the mines resulted in some part of his pulmonary disease?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-14\">A He has pulmonary impairment and once you have impairment you look at what are the contributing factors. And the ones I could identify were those two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxGK\">Q Can you tell us which of the two caused more of the impairment or are you able to apportion them in any fashion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-15\">A Usually obstructive lung disease is more due to smoking and \u2014 but some contribution from the dust exposure also.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-16\">Later in his deposition, the doctor stated \u201c[m]y impression was this gentleman has severe obstructive lung disease which is usually related to cigarette smoking. But, it could have been contributed to by the dust exposure.\u201d During cross-examination by Angelilli\u2019s counsel, Dr. Devabhaktuni remained uncertain, stating \u201cmy impression was that his chronic obstructive lung disease may have been some of it due to contribution from the dust expo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>sure,\u201d and \u201cMr. Angelilli is disabled. He has severe impairment from a chronic obstructive lung disease which may have been somewhat contributed to by the dust exposure.\u201d We conclude that, rather than merely expressing the uncertainties of medical science, Dr. Devabhaktuni\u2019s equivocal statements indicate a lack of definitive reasoning that undermines the probative value of his opinions. <em>See United States Steel Mining Co. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>187 F.3d 384, 389-90 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">We also conclude that Dr. Devabhaktuni\u2019s opinion was not well reasoned. Contrary to the opinions of Doctors Renn and Fino, who explained how the objective testing led them to conclude that Angelilli\u2019s impairment resulted solely from his smoking history, Dr. Devabhaktuni admitted an inability or failure to interpret the pulmonary function test results beyond noting that they indicated small airways involvement. Dr. Devabhaktuni did not have the benefit of considering other medical information and reports that were considered by Doctors Renn and Fino, and admitted that he did not conduct testing necessary to more specifically differentiate the cause of Angelilli\u2019s impairment. The objective testing, particularly the pulmonary function tests, also undermined Dr. Devabhaktuni\u2019s opinion that Angelilli suffered from a coal dust-induced lung disease, as those tests revealed improvement in Angelilli\u2019s lung function from 1984 to 1991, a result contrary to the irreversible nature of pneumoconiosis. Finally, we conclude that the ALJ erred in crediting Dr. Devabhaktuni\u2019s opinion, and that, even crediting the doctor\u2019s opinion, it was insufficient to establish that pneumoconiosis was \u201ca substantially contributing cause of the miner\u2019s totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.204(c)(1) (2002). Because we find that the ALJ erred in crediting Dr. Devabhaktuni\u2019s opinion, and his was the only medical opinion evidence supporting the award of benefits, we need not address Consolidation\u2019s remaining arguments that the ALJ also erred in discrediting the opinions of Doctors Renn and Fino.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Although the ALJ provided lengthy explanations for his conclusions, his reasoning was based upon factual inaccuracies that resulted from an improper evaluation of the medical opinions such that \u201cno \u2018reasonable mind\u2019 could have interpreted and credited the [medical opinions] as the ALJ did.\u201d <em>See Piney Mountain Coal Co. v. Mays, </em>176 F.3d 753, 764 (4th Cir.1999). Moreover, because there remains no evidence upon which to base a finding of entitlement to benefits, we reverse the award of benefits. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">\n<em>REVERSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
