Smith appeals pro se the judgment of the district court dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and the denial of his motion for reconsideration. Because Smith filed his motion for enlargement of time in which to file a motion for reconsideration more than 10 days after the district court entered judgment, the scope of this appeal is limited to the district court\u2019s March 8, 2002 order denying reconsideration. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(vi); Fed. R. Civ. P 6(a) &amp; (b). We have jurisdiction to review this order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-22\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying reconsideration of either the underlying judgment or the supplemental affidavit of bias and prejudice because Smith did not present newly discovered evidence or demonstrate that the initial decisions were erroneous or manifestly unjust. <em>See School Dist. 1J, Multnomah County v. ACandS, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1255, 1263 (9th Cir.1993); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 (allowing only one affidavit of bias and prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-23\">We reject Smith\u2019s contention that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-24\">We grant appellees First American Title Insurance Agency of Mohave, Inc., Stock-men\u2019s Bank and Darrell and Virginia Lautaret\u2019s unopposed motions for attorneys fees and costs. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 38. Appellees may submit fee affidavits, and Smith may oppose, pursuant to Ninth Circuit Rules 39-1.1, 39-1.6, <em>&amp; </em>39-1.7. We direct the Appellate Commissioner to determine the amount of the award. <em>See </em>Ninth Circuit Rule 39-1.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-25\">We deny the request by Stockmen\u2019s Bank and the Lautarets for a pre-filing review order.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-26\">We deny Smith\u2019s May 17, 2002 motion to correct the district court record because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>the February 13, 2002 supplemental affidavit is already part of the record and has been reviewed by this court.
