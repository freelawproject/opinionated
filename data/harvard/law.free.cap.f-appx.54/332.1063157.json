On appeal, Yu argues that under retroactive application of <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999), his convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>tion of a CCE was flawed because the jury was not instructed that it had to unanimously agree on the series of violations constituting the CCE in order to find Yu guilty. Because Yu has unsuccessfully attempted to petition this claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and because he is challenging the imposition of his sentence, his appeal also inherently argues that a failure to allow collateral review of this issue would raise serious constitutional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition de novo.\u201d <em>Santana-Madera v. United States, </em>260 F.3d 133, 138 (2d Cir.2001). This court has indeed found that <em>Richardson </em>applies retroactively, <em>see Santana-Madera v. United States, </em>260 F.3d 133 (2d Cir.2001), but we can not consider the merits of Yu\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition unless we find that \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective for obtaining collateral review of the issue he seeks to appeal, and that \u201cfailure to allow for collateral review would raise serious constitutional questions.\u201d <em>Triestman v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 361, 377 (2d Cir.1997). Additionally, as we said in <em>Underwood v. United States, </em>166 F.3d 84 (2d Cir.1999), \u201c[although procedural defaults have been excused in cases in which a fundamental miscarriage of justice would result from a failure to entertain the claim,\u201d when there is no such threat of miscarriage, the petition may be denied and use of \u00a7 2241 withheld. <em>Id. </em>at 88 (quotations and citations omitted) (holding that despite an intervening Supreme Court case, the court would not allow defendant to petition under either section due to lack of actual innocence and procedural default). In the context of collateral-review jurisprudence, the Supreme Court has said that \u201cthe term \u2018miscarriage of justice\u2019 means that the defendant is actually innocent.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Here, Yu raised this exact claim of improper jury instructions in his \u00a7 2255 habeas petition in 1997, and the claim was rejected as proeedurally barred because he had failed to raise it on direct appeal. <em>Yu v. United States, </em>1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4506, 1998 WL 160964 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 1998). As we have said in <em>Triestman, </em>access to \u00a7 2241 is not preserved simply because of a substantive or procedural bar to \u00a7 2255. 124 F.3d at 376. In this case, Yu was convicted of several offenses relating to heroin importation and distribution, a majority of which have not been vacated, and are sufficient to justify a CCE. Therefore, despite <em>Richardson, </em>Yu has failed to establish the necessary actual innocence to qualify for the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 and allow a petition under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
