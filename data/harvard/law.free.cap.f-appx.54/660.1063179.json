Ortiz-Domingo appeals from his guilty plea conviction and 24-month sentence imposed for illegal re-entry following deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Ortiz-Domingo\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating that there are no arguable issues for review, and a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. Ortiz-Domingo has filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-21\">Ortiz-Domingo entered a conditional guilty plea pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2) waiving all appeal rights except those expressly reserved. <em>See United States v. Arzate-Nunez, </em>18 F.3d 730, 737 (9th Cir.1994). Having independently reviewed the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we are satisfied that the plea agreement, including the waiver of the right to appeal, was entered knowingly and voluntarily. <em>See United States v. Aguilar-Muniz, </em>156 F.3d 974, 976 (9th Cir.1998). Because the issues Ortiz-Domingo raises in his supplemental brief were not expressly reserved, we enforce the waiver and grant the motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-22\">As Ortiz-Domingo notes, the judgment references 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) which does not define a separate crime. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 234-35, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Accordingly, we remand the case to the district court with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>directions to correct the judgment by striking the reference to \u00a7 1326(b)(1), so that it will unambiguously reflect that Ortiz-Domingo was convicted of only one punishable offense pursuant to \u00a7 1326(a). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106; <em>United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>222 F.3d 1057, 1062 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED in part and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b730-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
