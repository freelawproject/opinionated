Nesbitt reserved his right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained during a search of his vehicle and has appealed that order. We have reviewed the record and considered the arguments made on appeal, and we find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress and we therefore affirm Nesbitt\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
