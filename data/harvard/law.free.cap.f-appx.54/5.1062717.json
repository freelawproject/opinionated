It is</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence be affirmed. The Government presented sufficient evidence that <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original). We reject appellant\u2019s argument that we should extend the holding of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), to include prior convictions. The Supreme Court expressly refused to do just that in <em>Apprendi </em>itself. <em>See id. </em>at 490 (\u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). Appellant\u2019s final argument \u2014 that the sentence enhancement for obstruction of justice was improperly applied \u2014 is irrelevant because his sentencing as a career criminal was not affected by any enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">We remand this case to the district court to change page 2 of the Judgment and Commitment Order to \u201c235 months\u201d from \u201c235 years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
