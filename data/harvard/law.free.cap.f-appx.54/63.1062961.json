He challenges the District Court\u2019s order affirming the decision of the Social Security Commissioner (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) to deny him Disability Insurance Benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d) and Supplemental Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d). Wood alleges that there is insufficient evidence to uphold the findings of the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) that (a) Wood\u2019s testimony was not credible, (b) he was capable of sedentary work, and (c) he was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The District Court had jurisdiction to hear Wood\u2019s appeal pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review is limited to determining whether there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); see <em>also Morales v. Apfel, </em>225 F.3d 310, 316 (3d Cir.2000). Substantial evidence is defined as more than a mere scintilla. <em>Morales, </em>225 F.3d at 317. Substantial evidence \u201cdoes not mean a large or significant amount of evidence, but rather such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988); <em>see also Consolidation Coal Co. v. Kramer, </em>305 F.3d 203, 207 (3d Cir.2002). Because we find that the Commissioner\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order affirming the decision of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">An individual is entitled to receive DIB and SSI when he or she has a medically determinable impairment of such severity that it prevents him or her from engaging in any kind of substantial gainful work that exists in the national economy for a statutory minimum twelve-month period. <em>Allen v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 37, 40 (3d Cir.1989). There is a five-step evaluation process used by the Commissioner to determine whether an individual satisfies this definition and is therefore entitled to receive disability benefits. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. The Commissioner considers: (1) whether the claimant is engaging in substantial gainful activity; if not, (2) whether the claimant is suffering from a severe impairment; if so, (3) whether the claimant\u2019s impairment meets or equals the requirements of a listed impairment; if not, (4) whether the claimant has the ability to return to his or her past work; and, if not, (5) whether the claimant can perform any other work available in the national economy. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(b)-(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">The ALJ found that Wood\u2019s testimony about his disability was not entirely credible; that Wood was capable of performing sedentary work; and that because such work existed in the national economy, Wood was not disabled. Wood claims that the ALJ\u2019s finding that he was only partially credible is not supported by the evidence because everything to which he testified was supported by medical evidence. Further, Wood argues that the evidence shows that his chronic pain and considerable cognitive deficits make it impossible for him to concentrate and perform daily activities in the way required to maintain regular employment. For this reason, Wood maintains that the ALJ lacked substantial evidence to find that he was capa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>ble of performing sedentary work and to conclude, as a result, that he was not disabled and therefore not entitled to DIB and SSI. Finally, Wood argues that the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that he is not under a disability is not supported by substantial evidence. After a thorough review of the record, and giving due consideration to the briefs filed in this appeal, we believe that the ALJ carefully considered the evidence in this case and that his denial of Wood\u2019s claim was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">First, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Wood\u2019s testimony was not entirely credible is supported by substantial evidence. When making determinations as to a claimant\u2019s credibility, an ALJ must \u201cdetermine the extent to which a claimant is accurately stating the degree of pain or the extent to which he or she is disabled by it.\u201d <em>Hartranft v. Apfel, </em>181 F.3d 358, 362 (3d Cir. 1999). In assessing Wood\u2019s credibility, the ALJ found inconsistencies between his testimony and the record evidence. For instance, the ALJ noted that Wood\u2019s treatment records do not show that he has ever complained of pain at the severity level to which he testified at the hearing. The ALJ was thus justified in concluding that there was \u201csome exaggeration of the limitations established in his residual functional capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Second, the ALJ\u2019s decision that Wood is capable of performing sedentary work is supported by medical evidence in the record. In reaching this conclusion, the ALJ rejected the conclusion of the state agency medical experts that Wood was capable of doing light work as inconsistent with the evidence, and instead gave greater weight to the opinions of Wood\u2019s treating physician and the consulting physician. In concluding that Wood was capable of performing sedentary work, the ALJ relied on medical evidence that Wood had, for example, full active range of motion of both shoulders, elbows and wrists, normal motor strength in both upper and lower extremities, normal hip flexor motor strength, and full range of motion at both knees and ankles. Wood contends that the evidence of his treating physician demonstrates that his depression and cognitive defects are a restriction on his ability to engage in ongoing basic work activities. We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s decision about the extent to which these factors influence his ability to work is supported by evidence from Wood\u2019s treating physician and the consulting physician that Wood had only a mild adjustment disorder and mild depression. The ALJ\u2019s decision is also supported by Wood\u2019s own testimony about his daily activities, including that he regularly did laundry, mowed the lawn, and weeded his yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Finally, Mr. Wood argues that the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that he was not under a disability is not supported by substantial evidence. It seems from Wood\u2019s brief that by this he means that the ALJ\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Wood was not disabled, after having performed the requisite five-step analysis, was not supported by substantial evidence. We disagree. The ALJ properly undertook the requisite five-step analysis to determine whether Wood was disabled, and his ultimate conclusion is supported by substantial evidence, including his findings about Wood\u2019s credibility, his conclusion that Wood was capable of sedentary work, and the testimony of a vocational expert that Wood was capable of performing work that existed in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">i!t sH <em>t\u2019fi </em># i\u00a1:</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">Because the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order affirming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>the decision of the Social Security Commissioner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
