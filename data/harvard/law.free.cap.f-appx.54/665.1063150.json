Collins appeals pro se the district court\u2019s dismissal of his habeas corpus petition, filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">In his petition, filed in the Arizona district court, Collins challenged his 136-month sentence he received in the underlying criminal case in the Western District of Washington. As the district court recognized, such challenges normally must be raised by way of a motion to correct a sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Lorentsen v. Hood, </em>223 F.3d 950, 953 (9th Cir.2000). The district court properly dismissed Collins\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition because he has not demonstrated that a motion under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>See Moore v. Reno, </em>185 F.3d 1054, 1055 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam) (rejecting contention that section 2255 is inadequate or ineffective merely because prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion might be procedurally barred); <em>Tripati v. Henman, </em>843 F.2d 1160, 1162 (9th Cir.1988) (stating that \u00a7 2255 \u201cis not inadequate or ineffective ... merely because the sentencing court denied relief on the merits\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b736-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-9\">. We point out that the Arizona district court could not construe the instant petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion because it lacked jurisdiction over such a motion. <em>See Tripati v. Henman, </em>843 F.2d 1160, 1162 (9th Cir.1988) (stating that a \u00a7 2255 motion must be filed in the sentencing court). Moreover, a new \u00a7 2255 would be Collins\u2019 second such motion and he would therefore be required to seek this court\u2019s approval before the district court could accept it. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2255, 2244(b)(3)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
