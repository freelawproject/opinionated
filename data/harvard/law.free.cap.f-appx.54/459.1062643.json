The sole issue in this case, in which AMCO Insurance Company filed a declaratory relief counterclaim, is whether the district court erred by falling to find the exclusionary clause contained in an automobile insurance policy overbroad or ambiguous and therefore in violation of the scope of permissible exclusions under California Insurance Code \u00a7 11580.1(c). Because the parties are familiar with the pertinent facts, we do not state them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Contrary to Mrs. Womack\u2019s contentions, the exclusion provisions under review are neither overbroad nor ambiguous. Mrs. Womack contends that <em>Phelps v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>106 Cal.App.3d 752, 165 Cal.Rptr. 263 (1980) compels the conclusion that the exclusionary language is overbroad. In <em>Phelps, </em>the court analyzed a family exclusion clause which defined an insured as any \u201cresident of the named insured\u2019s household with respect to the owned automobile,\u201d permissive users, and three other classes of \u201cpersons who are insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 757, 165 Cal.Rptr. 263. The family exclusion at issue excluded, \u201cany person\u201d from coverage, whereas the then existing statutory scheme permitted an exclusion of coverage only for \u201can insured.\u201d Because \u201cthe family exclusion clause excludes persons who are not insureds within the provision ... it is broader than allowed by section 11580.1 subdivision (c)(5).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 758, 165 Cal.Rptr. 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Here, in contrast to <em>Phelps, </em>the class of persons affected by the family exclusion is no broader than the class of persons insured. The underlying policy defines \u201cinsured\u201d to include the name insured, the spouse if resident of the same household, and a family member, meaning \u201ca person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household.\u201d The family exclusion at issue only applies to \u201cyou\u201d or any \u201cfamily member.\u201d The class of excluded insureds under the family exclusion clause is coextensive with the class of individuals insured under the policy and therefore does not suffer from the same overbreadth as the clause at issue in <em>Phelps.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Finally, the exclusion provision is not ambiguous. This court \u201cmay not impose coverage by adopting a strained or absurd interpretation in order to create an ambiguity where none exists.\u201d <em>Rosen v. Nations Title Ins. Co., </em>56 Cal.App.4th 1489,1497, 66 Cal.Rptr.2d 714 (1997). The exclusion provision is not susceptible to two different reasonable interpretations as urged by Mrs. Womack. The context makes clear that the \u201cpermissive user,\u201d Provision B.l, and \u201cfamily member,\u201d Provision B.2, exclusions are mutually exclusive. In order to read the two provisions as one, the court must disregard the plain meaning of Provision B.l that \u201c[t]his exclusion does not apply to you or any \u2018family member.\u2019 \u201d The \u201cclear and explicit\u201d meaning of this sentence, interpreted in its \u201cordinary and popular sense,\u201d <em>Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc., </em>11 Cal.4th 1, 18-19, 44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619 (1995), is that the permissive user exclusion, Provision B.l, and the family member exclusion, Provision B.2, are separate and independent provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Once the exclusions are viewed separately, there is no ambiguity because each exclusion stands alone and encompasses separate, excludable coverage in compliance with the public policy set forth in Insurance Code \u00a7 11580.1. <em>See Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Cocking, </em>29 Cal.3d 383, 388, 173 Cal.Rptr. 846, 628 P.2d 1 (1981) (\u201csection 11580.1, subdivision (c), is not only consistent with state public policy, it itself constitutes and expresses that policy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">In sum, we do not find the family exclusion provision either overbroad or ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"Az1\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
