Saxton appeals the district court\u2019s judgment of sentence. The district court had overruled Saxton\u2019s objection to a two-level increase in the offense level for \u201cmore than minimal planning\u201d pursuant to Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(4)(A) (2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Because we write solely for the benefit of the parties, we recount the facts and procedural history of the case only as they are relevant to the following discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">In 1979, Sue Ellen Saxton,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Frederick Saxton\u2019s wife, was elected Prothonotary and Clerk of Courts for Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, an office she held until August 2000. An investigation revealed that throughout her twenty-year career, she embezzled funds collected in the normal course of business and converted these funds for the personal use of herself and Frederick. On February 21, 2001, the Government filed an Information charging Sue Ellen and Frederick with one count for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (conspiracy) involving: the embezzlement of money from a program receiving federal funds, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A); the transportation of stolen money in interstate commerce, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 and the receipt of stolen money which has crossed a state or United States boundary, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2315. The Information charged that the conspiracy began in or around January 1993 and continued to at least April 2000. On January 23, 2001, Frederick pled \u201cguilty\u201d before the district court to the one count of conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-15\">The district court held a sentencing hearing on January 18, 2002. Among other things, it determined that an upward departure from the Sentencing Guidelines of two levels from offense level 12 (which under Criminal Category I provides for a range of incarceration of 10 to 16 months) to offense level 14 (which under Criminal Category I provides for a range of incarceration of 15 to 21 months) was warranted under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(4)(A) for \u201cmore than minimal planning.\u201d Accordingly, the district court sentenced Frederick to a 15-month term, followed by three years supervised release, a $100 special assessment and restitution in the amount of $995,930.90, to be paid by Frederick and Sue Ellen, jointly and severally.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-16\">In denying Frederick\u2019s objection to the two-level increase, the district court stated that his repeated acts of accepting money from his wife over a period of time distinguished his case from the usual case involving conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>\u00a7 371, especially since the legitimate combined income of the couple paled in comparison to the sums the couple spent and Frederick, as Sue Ellen\u2019s husband, had the ability to stop her at any time from her illegal acts. The district court further noted Frederick\u2019s whiling participation, over time, in the couple\u2019s lavish lifestyle.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">We have jurisdiction to hear Frederick Saxton\u2019s appeal of the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review a district court\u2019s determination as to whether the commission of some particular offense involved more than minimal planning for clear error. <em>United States v. Cianscewski, </em>894 F.2d 74, 82 (3d Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The Sentencing Guideline Section 2B1.1(b)(4)(A) provides, in relevant part: \u201cIf the offense involved more than minimal planning, increase [the offense level] by 2 levels....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(4)(A). \u201c \u2018More than minimal planning\u2019 is deemed present in any case involving repeated acts over a period of time, unless it is clear that each instance was purely opportune.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, Application Note 1(f).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">Frederick argues that the district court erred in increasing his offense level by two levels based on his conduct reflecting \u201cmore than minimal planning\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 because his conduct of repeatedly accepting monies from Sue Ellen, over time, was typical for the commission of the crime for which he pled guilty and was purely opportune.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">Saxton\u2019s argument is without merit. This Court has defined \u201cpurely opportune\u201d as \u201c \u2018spur of the moment conduct, intended to take advantage of a sudden opportunity.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Monaco, </em>23 F.3d 793, 797 (3d Cir.1994) (quoting <em>United States v. Rust, </em>976 F.2d 65, 57 (1st Cir. 1992)). This Court has determined that more than minimal planning existed, rather than taking advantage of a sudden opportunity, where the defendant over a period of a few months, on four occasions, submitted false billing statements, <em>id., </em>and where the defendant was responsible for delivering 28 documents on three occasions to carry out a fraud. <em>United States v. Kopp, </em>951 F.2d 521, 536 (3d Cir.1991), <em>overruled, in part, by statute on other grounds, by United States v. Corrado, </em>53 F.3d 620 (3d Cir.1995). <em>See also United States v. Georgiadis, </em>933 F.2d 1219, 1221, 1227 (3d Cir.1991) (administrator of Bank\u2019s mortgage settlement closings who diverted settlement funds into his own accounts many times over a period of time engaged in \u201cmore than minimal planning.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-15\">Frederick\u2019s participation in multiple deposit transactions of embezzled funds into his and Sue Ellen\u2019s personal account, in addition to his frequent thousands-of-dollars gambling sprees with Sue Ellen in Atlantic City, New Jersey, fails to qualify as \u201cspur of the moment conduct,\u201d or the taking advantage of a \u201csudden opportunity.\u201d Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in determining Frederick\u2019s sentence based on a two-level increase in offense level for more than minimal planning pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-16\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-17\">We will affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b422-12\">. While the most recent amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines have abolished the more than minimal planning offense level adjustment, the guidelines used in connection with Saxton\u2019s sentence authorized such an adjustment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B 1.1 (b)(4)(A) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b422-18\">. <em>United States v. Sue Ellen Saxtort </em>appeal No. 01-1326 is based on the same facts related herein. A separate opinion resolving that appeal will be filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b423-11\">. More than minimal planning also exists \"if significant affirmative steps were taken to conceal the offense....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, Application Note 1(f). The district court did not rely on this ground, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
