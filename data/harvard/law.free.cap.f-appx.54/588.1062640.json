Webb seeks the transcript to aid his preparation of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. However, as there is no \u00a7 2255 motion pending, Webb is not entitled to a free transcript. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f) (2000); <em>see also United States v. Horvath, </em>157 F.3d 131, 132-33 (2nd Cir. 1998). The district court will examine the file and records of the case when the motion is filed. Rule 4(b), Rules Governing \u00a7 2255 Proceedings. Webb is not required to set forth his claims in great detail in filing the \u00a7 2255 motion. Rule 2(b), Rules Governing \u00a7 2255 Proceedings. Therefore, we affirm the order of the district court. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
