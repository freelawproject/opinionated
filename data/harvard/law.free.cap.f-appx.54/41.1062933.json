Raymonn Rowe is a minor child, who has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Ella Hairston, his mother, requested benefits under the Act and its applicable provisions. Hairston contends that the District Court erred in its determination that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (ALJ) denial of SSI benefits was supported by substantial evidence. In addition, Hairston challenges the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that her statements regarding Raymonn\u2019s functional limitations were not entirely credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 to review the district court\u2019s final order. Review of the Commissioner\u2019s final decision is limited to determining whether that decision is supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Monsour Medical Ctr. v. Heckler, </em>806 F.2d 1185, 1190 (3d Cir.1986). \u201cOverall, the substantial evidence standard is deferential and includes deference to inferences drawn from the facts if they, in turn, are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Schaudeck v. Commissioner of Social Security Administration, </em>181 F.3d 429, 431 (3d Cir.1999) (citing <em>Monsour, </em>806 F.2d at 1190-91). For the following reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">The final rules for determining minor disability benefits define the statutory standard of \u201cmarked and severe limitations\u201d in terms of an impairment that meets, medically equals, or functionally equals the severity of an impairment in the listing. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924(d). A child\u2019s functional limitations will be evaluated in the following domains: (1) acquiring and using information; (2) attending and completing tasks; (3) interacting and relating with others; (4) moving about and manipulating objects; (5) caring for herself or himself; and (6) health and physical well-being. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(b)(l)(i)-(vi). A medically determinable impairment or combination of impairments functionally equals a listed impairment if it results in \u201cmarked\u201d limitations in two domains of functioning or an \u201cextreme\u201d limitation in one domain. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(e)(2). A marked limitation exists when an impairment seriously interferes with the ability to independently initiate, sustain, or complete activities. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">Hairston claims that Raymonn\u2019s limitations are functionally equivalent to a listing under the Act. Substantial evidence exists, however, to show that Raymonn did not have two marked limitations or one extreme limitation in any functional domain. When analyzing the first domain of acquiring and using information, the Commissioner considers how well a child acquires or learns information and how well the child uses that information. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(g). The ALJ found that Raymonn had mild to moderate, but less than marked limitation of function. We find there is substantial evidence to affirm this. Raymonn achieved average grades with fifty percent special education placement. Also, his tests indicated he fell within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>average to low-average range for his age group in reading, mathematics, language, and writing performance. Dr. Pacella had noted that Raymonn had adequate language development and good problem solving abilities, and his school work improved once he was medicated on Adderall.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Second, there is substantial evidence for the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Raymonn had no more than a moderate limitation in his ability to attend and complete tasks. The Commissioner considers how well a child begins, carries through, and finishes his or her activities. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(h). The record reveals that Raymonn did not have more than a moderate limitation in his ability to attend and complete tasks. Upon starting Ritalin, his activity level improved to a good level, Ms. Kline reported he worked hard and had the ability to pay attention, and Dr. Pacella found no signs of distractability or hyperactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Third, there is substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Raymonn did not have more than a moderate limitation in his ability to interact. Once starting Ritalin, his mother stated his aggressive behavior towards his brother decreased, Ms. Kline stated he related well to other children, Dr. Pacella found him to be quiet and cooperative, and during his visit to St. Vincent hospital, he was easily engaged in conversation with the doctor. Raymonn\u2019s interactions also improved once he switched to the medication Aderrall. This conclusion is supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Hairston failed to assert a marked limitation in the remaining three domains. We find substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Raymonn did not have a limitation in those domains.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Finally, Hairston argues that the ALJ erred in concluding that her statements did not credibly establish marked and severe limitation of function. There is, however, substantial evidence to support the factual findings of the ALJ. It is for the ALJ to make these findings and to resolve the conflicts in evidence. <em>See Monsour Medical Center, </em>806 F.2d. at 1190-91. Here, the ALJ did so in favor of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
