Berge appeals from the final judgment entered in the District Court for the Northern District of Iowa dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b). For the reasons discussed below, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-18\">In his pro se complaint, Berge named Estherville Law Enforcement Center (ELEC) Investigator Greg VanLangen, ELEC Sergeant Brett Shatto, ELEC Chief Eric Milburn, and Emmet County Sheriff Larry Lamack. He alleged that VanLangen arrested him based on evidence \u201cthat was false and unconstitutionally acquired,\u201d that the evidence was derived from \u201ca non-testimonial identification procedure,\u201d and that VanLangen filed a sworn affidavit which contained false information received from a confidential informant, which led to Berge\u2019s arrest, all in violation of Iowa state laws and the Fourth Amendment. Berge alleged that Shatto, Milburn, and Lamack \u201cwere all [adequately] involved in this case as well.\u201d Berge was detained three months until charges were dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-19\">The district court held that Berge failed to state a violation of a constitutional or federal statutory right, and dismissed his complaint. The district court did not rule on Berge\u2019s pending motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-20\">A complaint must include only \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). Here, Berge\u2019s complaint can fairly be read as alleging that VanLangen knew the information provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>in the affidavit was false and thus a violation of Berge\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. <em>See Lambert v. City of Dumas, </em>187 F.3d 931, 935 (8th Cir.1999) (holding Fourth Amendment protects right to be free from arrest without probable cause); <em>Moody v. St. Charles County, </em>23 F.3d 1410, 1411-12 (8th Cir.1994) (holding allegation that false affidavit was basis for arrest warrant is sufficient to state \u00a7 1983 Fourth Amendment claim against affiant officer); <em>Burk v. Beene, </em>948 F.2d 489, 494-95 (8th Cir. 1991) (\u00a7 1983 suit; holding officer who was aware affidavit was untruthful \u201cshould have known [it] would violate the accused\u2019s constitutional rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">As to Shatto, Milburn, and Lamack, however, Berge failed to specify in his complaint how any of them violated a protected right. <em>See Martin v. Sargent, </em>780 F.2d 1334, 1338 (8th Cir.1985) (holding that to state \u00a7 1983 claim against defendant, plaintiff must allege that defendant \u201cwas personally involved in or had direct responsibility for incidents that\u201d resulted in injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of Berge\u2019s complaint as to VanLangen, we affirm the dismissal as to the other defendants, and we remand this case to the district court for further proceedings. On remand the district court should consider Berge\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
