On appeal, Valles-Herrera argues the district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> erroneously imposed a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for possessing a firearm during the commission of the offense. We disagree. The district court was presented with evidence Valles-Herrera lived in the residence in which the firearm was found, <em>see United States v. Boykin, </em>986 F.2d 270, 274 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 888, 114 S.Ct. 241, 126 L.Ed.2d 195 (1993), and the firearm was in plain sight in the living room, making it accessible to protect the drugs, drug paraphernalia, and drug money also found in the residence, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment.
