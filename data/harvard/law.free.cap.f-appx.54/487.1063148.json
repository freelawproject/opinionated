R.App.P. 34(a)(2). Accordingly, we deny Fisher\u2019s request for oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b558-4\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Stephen Fisher appeals pro se the district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging, among other things, that the defendants, all current or former employees of the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance (the \u201cTax Department\u201d), retaliated against him because he published a book critical of the Tax Department. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. After de novo review, <em>Hansen v. United States, </em>7 F.3d 137, 138 (9th Cir.1993) (per curiam), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The district court properly granted summary judgment to Daniel Devensky and Kevin Hand because Fisher failed to adduce evidence demonstrating that either Devensky or Hand was aware of the forthcoming publication of Fisher\u2019s book before Fisher commenced this action. <em>See Butler v. Elle, </em>281 F.3d 1014, 1027-28 (9th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The district court also properly granted summary judgment to Michael Urbach, the former Tax Department Commissioner, because Fisher failed to adduce evidence demonstrating that Urbach was personally involved in the alleged constitutional violation. <em>See Jeffers v. Gomez, </em>267 F.3d 895, 915-16 (9th Cir.2001) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Fisher\u2019s economic extortion and conspiracy claims fail for the same reasons as his retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">Fisher\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b558-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
