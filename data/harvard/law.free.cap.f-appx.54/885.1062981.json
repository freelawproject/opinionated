The Board affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s order that Hassan-Abdallah be removed from the United States. Hassan-Abdallah contends that he automatically became naturalized under \u00a7 321(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a)(3) (the \u201cAct\u201d), and therefore cannot be removed. Alternatively, Hassan-Abdallah argues that he cannot be removed because he became a \u201cnational\u201d by applying for citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Hassan-Abdallah did not attain naturalization pursuant to \u00a7 321(a)(3) of the Act. Naturalization of a child under this provision depends upon three elements: (1) the \u201cnaturalization of a parent\u201d (2) who has \u201clegal custody\u201d of the child (3) \u201cwhen there has been a legal separation of the parents.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a)(3). The Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals correctly ruled that at no point did all three of these elements exist at the same time in Hassan-Abdallah\u2019s case. To the degree that there is any ambiguity in the statute in this regard, the Board\u2019s interpretation \u2014 that the legal separation cannot have ended by operation of the parents\u2019 remarriage at the time one parent became naturalized \u2014 is a reasonable one. We therefore must defer to the Board\u2019s construction. <em>See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">Nor did Hassan-Abdallah become a \u201cnational\u201d by allegedly applying for citizenship. We held in <em>Hughes v. Ashcroft, </em>255 F.3d 752 (9th Cir.2001), that \u201cin order for a person who is born outside the United States to qualify for \u2018national\u2019 status, he must, at a minimum, demonstrate (1) birth in a United States territory or (2) an application for United States citizenship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 757. The record does not establish that Hassan-Abdallah submitted a properly completed application for citizenship with a signed oath swearing allegiance to the United States, or that he was ever formally naturalized following approval of such an application. Hassan-Abdallah has not met even the minimum requirements for establishing nationality.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">Because Hassan-Abdallah did not become naturalized under \u00a7 321(a)(3) or attain \u201cnational\u201d status, he is subject to removal. Hassan-Abdallah\u2019s petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b956-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
