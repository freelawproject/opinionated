UPS removed the case to federal court, where Templeton added James Beaver, a UPS manager, as a defendant. Templeton also added claims for fraud and misrepresentation. The District Court initially found that most of Templeton\u2019s claims were preempted by \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185 (2000). Later, the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reconsidered its order and remanded the case to state court, finding that some of Templeton\u2019s state-law tort claims (the claims for fraud, outrage, and deceit) were not in fact preempted by \u00a7 301 and that no federal claims were pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">UPS and Beavers appeal the District Court\u2019s remand order. As an initial matter, we agree with the parties that in the circumstances of this case the remand order is appealable. <em>See St. John v. Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists, Local #1010, </em>139 F.3d 1214, 1216-17 (8th Cir.1998) (construing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)). As to the merits of the appeal, we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusions regarding preemption and lack of federal-court jurisdiction to entertain any of the state-law claims asserted in Templeton\u2019s amended complaint. We note that UPS and Beavers do not suggest in this appeal that there is a basis for diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">No error of fact or law appears, and an extended opinion would lack significant precedential value. The District Court\u2019s order of remand is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-7\">.
