On appeal, Appellant contends the motion court clearly erred in denying, without an evidentiary hearing, his claim he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Because we hold that Appellant's allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel is not clearly refuted by the record, we reverse and remand to the motion court for an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 9, 2011, Appellant pleaded guilty to one count of attempted first degree robbery and one count of armed criminal action in Jefferson County Cause No. 11JE-CR00463-01 (Jefferson County case) for an incident which occurred on February 12, 2011. He was sentenced on August 9, 2011, to 15 years on the attempted robbery count and 5 years on the armed criminal action count in the Missouri Department of Corrections (the DOC), with the sentences to be served consecutively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 29, 2016, Appellant was charged by the State of Missouri (the State) in St. Louis County Cause No. 11SL-CR09370-01 (St. Louis County case) with one count of robbery in the first degree (Count I) and one count of armed criminal action (Count II) for an incident alleged to have occurred on February 11, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant was arraigned on the charges and entered pleas of not guilty on September 14, 2016. On October 4, 2016, Appellant's trial counsel (Counsel) filed a motion to dismiss Count II, the armed criminal action charge, as the crime was alleged to have occurred on February 11, 2011, outside of the statute of limitations. Count II was dismissed by the trial court on October 14, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Trial was set in the matter for January 9, 2017. On January 4, 2017, the court ordered the case to remain on the docket on January 9, 2017, but scheduled the case for a settlement conference rather than a trial. At the settlement conference, the\n   case was continued until January 20, 2017, for Appellant to enter a guilty plea. While there are comments in the plea and sentencing transcript from January 23, 2017, which allude to a hearing held on Friday, January 20, 2017, there was no transcript or written documentation filed. On January 23, 2017, Appellant entered a blind plea of guilty to Count I and was sentenced the same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the plea hearing, the court advised Appellant of his trial rights, which Appellant indicated he understood. The prosecutor set forth the factual basis for the plea, stating Appellant entered Big Lots in St. Louis and demanded money and the surveillance tape from the manager. The prosecutor stated she would have presented testimony from the manager and another employee that Appellant displayed a gun and took over $1,300 from the store. She stated the two witnesses knew Appellant personally as he previously worked at Big Lots, and further, Appellant later admitted committing the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellant initially testified the statement of the prosecutor was not correct, and the court went off the record to allow Appellant to speak with Counsel. Once back on the record, Appellant testified the prosecutor's statement was factually accurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The court conducted the following inquiry:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   TRIAL COURT: Have any threats or promises been made to you in order to get you to plead guilty?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [APPELLANT]: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   TRIAL COURT: Are you pleading guilty voluntarily of your own free will?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [APPELLANT]: Yes\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   TRIAL COURT: And are you pleading guilty because you are in fact guilty of the crime that was charged?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [APPELLANT]: Yes, ma'am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The prosecutor set forth the sentencing range, indicating the range was 10 to 30 years or life in prison, and Appellant testified he understood the sentencing range. The court then stated \"this is a plea not pursuant\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ,\" but inquired of the prosecutor what the State's recommendation was. The prosecutor stated the recommendation was for 18 years in the DOC, and Appellant agreed that offer had been communicated to him previously by Counsel. The court questioned Appellant regarding the assistance Counsel provided, during which a recess was taken because the court wanted \"to give [Appellant] an opportunity to speak with [his] attorney,\" as it \"seem[ed] like there [was] some confusion,\" and the court was \"not sure whether [Appellant] [understood] what [was] actually going on.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After allowing Appellant to speak with Counsel and confirming Appellant had no questions of Counsel or the court, the court accepted Appellant's plea of guilty. Appellant waived the pre-sentence investigation, and the court sentenced him to 11 years in the DOC. The court ordered Appellant's sentence to run concurrent with his sentence in his Jefferson County case and ordered Appellant be given credit for \"any and all time served.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following the pronouncement of Appellant's sentence, the court advised Appellant of his rights under Rule 24.035. The court questioned him again regarding the assistance he received from Counsel. The\n   court asked him if \"other than the plea bargain, did [his] lawyer make any threats or promises to get [him] to plead guilty,\" and Appellant stated \"no.\" The court then asked if Appellant had anything else he wished to tell the court regarding Counsel's representation and the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [APPELLANT]: To be honest, Your Honor, I don't think we spent enough time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   TRIAL COURT: Mr. Like, the State was offering you eighteen years, and your attorney -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [APPELLANT]: But that's what I was going to say. Besides all that, I feel I'm satisfied with the amount of time that she was able to get me or plead me out, but I still - you know what I'm saying, I still don't think I was able to - because I think I was more so worried about -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   TRIAL COURT: Mr. Like, we had this discussion on Friday.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [APPELLANT]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   TRIAL COURT: Ms. Steele does not run the Missouri Department of Corrections. Whatever your out date is going to be on the other case, that is determined by the Missouri Department of Corrections. It is not determined by your attorney. She cannot calculate that time for you. And we had this discussion on Friday about what your out date is going to be on the other case and you're already up there on and whether or not this case is going to impact it. Ms. Steele does not run the Missouri Department of Corrections. She is a public defender hired by the State of Missouri.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [APPELLANT]: Right, but I was --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   TRIAL COURT: The parole board will determine all of that. What your out date is. They determine all of that. And she can't-and if she gives you some information and you rely on it, then you're going to be upset. So all she can do it try to make the best deal that she can, and then once you get to the Missouri Department of Corrections, they will tell you how this will impact your new date. She doesn't know. There's no way she can know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [APPELLANT]: No, there's not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   TRIAL COURT: You were sentenced to a certain amount of time plus you have consecutive time. She doesn't know how the consecutive time is going to affect your - the first part of your sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [APPELLANT]: Not only her. I don't either.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The court told Appellant it was his decision to go into Big Lots that put Appellant in front of the court, and what he was asking of Counsel was \"to work some kind of magic\" and \"[i]t doesn't work like that.\" The court then found there was no probable cause to believe Appellant received ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On April 7, 2017, Appellant filed a timely\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion to vacate, set aside, or correct the judgment or sentence. The motion court appointed the Public Defender's office to represent Appellant on April 12, 2017, and the transcript from the plea and sentencing hearing was filed on April 24, 2017. On May 16, 2017, appellate counsel entered her appearance and requested an extension of time to file an amended motion, which was granted on May 23, 2017. The amended motion was timely filed on July 24, 2017, along with appellate counsel's request for an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Appellant's amended post-conviction motion alleged Counsel advised Appellant he would receive credit for the time he was incarcerated in the DOC on his Jefferson County case towards his St. Louis County case. Appellant's motion stated when he returned to the DOC following his guilty\n   plea, he was informed by the DOC he would not receive credit for the sentence on his St. Louis County case for the time served on his Jefferson County case. Appellant's post-conviction motion further alleged but for Counsel's erroneous representation to Appellant regarding credit for time served, Appellant would not have pleaded guilty but instead insisted on going to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On August 18, 2017, the court denied Appellant's request for an evidentiary hearing on the post-conviction motion. The court issued its Judgment on December 19, 2017, denying the post-conviction motion. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Points On Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On appeal, Appellant alleges the motion court clearly erred in denying his post-conviction motion without an evidentiary hearing because he alleged facts which warranted relief and were not clearly refuted by the record, in that he was denied his rights to effective assistance of counsel and due process because plea counsel induced his involuntary, unintelligent, and unknowing guilty plea by erroneously advising Appellant he would be credited for the time he served on his unrelated Jefferson County case, and had Appellant known he would not receive credit for time served he would not have pleaded guilty but would have proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This Court's review of the motion court's denial of a Rule 24.035 motion is limited to a determination of whether the findings and conclusions are clearly erroneous.

Appellant's post-conviction motion claims Counsel advised Appellant he would receive credit towards his St. Louis County sentence for the time he served in the DOC on his Jefferson County sentence. Appellant claims he relied on this advice when he pleaded guilty, and when he returned to the DOC after having been sentenced he discovered his St. Louis County sentence would not be credited with the time he spent in the DOC on his Jefferson County sentence. Appellant's motion claims without Counsel's misrepresentation, Appellant would not have pleaded guilty and would have proceeded to trial.

Taken in context, it appears the court is using the term \"out date\" to refer to when Appellant will be eligible for parole, as evidenced by the court's statement to Appellant that \"the parole board will determine all of that. What your out date is.\" However, Appellant claimed he received ineffective assistance of counsel because Counsel advised Appellant he would receive credit for all the time served in prison related to the Jefferson County case on the St. Louis County case sentence, and that advice was incorrect - not because Counsel erroneously informed Appellant when his parole date would be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   What date Appellant is eligible for parole is a separate inquiry from how much credit for time served Appellant will receive. An individual can be released from prison and serve the remainder of their sentence on parole. However, \"time served before sentencing is still service of one's sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

App. W.D. 2013). Therefore, if Appellant receives no credit for time served on his eleven-year sentence and is paroled\n   after five years, he would still be required to serve the remaining six years of his sentence, albeit out of prison. If Appellant receives credit for five years of time served, and he is paroled after five years, he would only be required to serve one year on parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   While the motion court was correct the record refuted that Counsel made Appellant a promise as to when his out date might be, that was not the claim alleged in Appellant's motion.
