The trial court heard punishment evidence and sentenced Appellant to confinement for 40 years. On appeal, Appellant presents two issues, first challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support the deadly-weapon element of the offense, and then contending that the trial court erred when it admitted Appellant's out-of-court statements as evidence. We affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 6, 2016, Appellant was an inmate at the El Paso County Jail Annex. As part of his duties that morning, Officer Jesus Morales provided food to Appellant, who became extremely upset and belligerent and complained that his portion was too small. After he had given the other inmates their food, Officer Morales advised Appellant to keep his plate, and informed him that he would bring Appellant an extra plate. Appellant's belligerence continued, and he began inciting the other inmates. Concerned that the other inmates might become belligerent and create a safety hazard, possibly leading to a riot, Officer Morales decided to transfer Appellant to administrative segregation for safety reasons, and for purposes of clearing the threat, and preventing the situation from escalating. This decision was initially approved by Sergeant Ernest Esparza.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Officer Morales advised Appellant that he was being transferred and instructed him to gather his belongings. Appellant was upset that he was being transferred. As Officer Morales took Appellant from his cell, Appellant informed Officer Morales that he \"didn't know who he was messing with,\" and stated that he was going to file a grievance against Officer Morales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant placed his belongings on his mattress, and as he began to carry the mattress, an object that appeared to be a homemade handle to a weapon fell. The handle appeared to have been taken from a scrub brush and had been modified from its original shape. Altered items are not authorized in the facility and are considered contraband. When Officer Morales picked up the item and asked Appellant what it was, Appellant stated he had found the item.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer Morales placed Appellant in a visitation area and searched him, and when he searched Appellant's property in Appellant's presence, Officer Morales discovered a \"weapon,\" a \"shank\" made from a plastic eyeglass earpiece that was sharpened at the edges to a very sharp point. The weapon was located in a container with some of Appellant's soap, deodorant, and other belongings that had been in Appellant's possession and in his cell. Officer Morales agreed that although the two pieces, the handle and the shank, could be put and held together, they needed something added to prevent the handle from separating from the weapon. Officer Morales wrote a violation report for possession of a weapon in a penal institution, which typically would trigger an administrative process against Appellant that he was permitted to challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sergeant Esparza testified that Officer Morales approached him regarding pursuit of an administrative disciplinary sanction for the items found, and when Sergeant Esparza saw what had been found, he decided in his discretion to place Appellant in segregation and to pursue criminal charges against Appellant for possessing a weapon rather than imposing administrative\n   sanctions. The custodian of records for the El Paso County Sheriff's Office also testified that Sergeant Esparza did not agree to proceed administratively against Appellant as Officer Morales had requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the State rested its case, Appellant sought a directed verdict on the basis that the State had failed to prove or elicit testimony that the weapon was capable of causing death or serious bodily injury, and noted that the testimony showed that the two items could not form a weapon without anything else. The trial court denied the motion for directed verdict, and Appellant neither testified nor called any witnesses. After deliberations, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. Appellant pleaded true to two enhancement allegations and sought a determination on punishment from the trial court, which sentenced Appellant to 40 years' confinement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We first address Appellant's sufficiency challenge. When reviewing the record for legal sufficiency, we consider the combined and cumulative force of all admitted evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the verdict to determine whether a jury was rationally justified in finding guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Section 1.07(a)(17) of the Penal Code defines a deadly weapon as: (A) a firearm or anything manifestly designed, made, or adapted for the purpose of inflicting death or serious bodily injury; or (B) or anything that in the manner of its use or intended use is capable of causing death or serious bodily injury. TEX.PEN.CODE ANN . \u00a7 1.07(a)(17)(A), (B) (West 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In Issue One, Appellant contends the State's evidence is insufficient because it failed to establish under Section 1.07(a)(17)(B) that the weapon components at issue, in the manner of its use or intended use, was capable of causing death or serious bodily injury. TEX.PEN.CODE ANN . \u00a7 1.07(a)(17)(B). However, this is only one definition of a deadly weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The record clearly shows that the State attempted to satisfy the deadly-weapon element of the charged offense under subsection (A) by presenting evidence which it believed would show that the weapon was \"manifestly designed, made, or adapted for the purpose of inflicting\n   death or serious bodily injury.\" TEX.PEN.CODE ANN . \u00a7 1.07(a)(17)(A). For this reason, our analysis regarding satisfaction of the deadly-weapon element under subsection (A) is guided by the Court of Criminal Appeals' guidance in\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9984189,9984071\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/821/616/\">\n    821 S.W.2d 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 620 (Tex. Crim.

In\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   , the Court observed that the legislature has classified as deadly weapons \"other objects specifically designed, made, or adapted to cause serious bodily injury\" regardless of their usage, and declared that where the evidence is adequate to prove the deadly-weapon element under subsection (A), it is unnecessary \"to verify that the object was really capable of causing death, either in the manner of its actual use or in the manner of its intended use\" under subsection (B).\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9984189,9984071\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/821/616/\">\n    821 S.W.2d at 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

Issue One is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In Issue Two, Appellant argues the trial court erroneously admitted in evidence Appellant's statement because it permitted a collateral offense, harassment of a public servant, to be considered by the jury. Although Appellant acknowledges the State may present evidence of an extraneous act to show a defendant's preparation, he contends the evidence is not relevant because it is not so linked together in relation to time and circumstance with the charged offense such that one can be fully shown without proving the other. He further contends that evidence of an extraneous offense offered through Appellant's statements is unrelated to the instant offense and were related only to Appellant's intent to file a grievance against Officer Morales. Moreover, because Appellant did not testify nor present witnesses, he asserts that his statement could not properly be admitted on the basis that he \"opened the door\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   to admission of the extraneous offense nor because he had left a false impression regarding previous conduct. He ultimately argues that even if relevant, under a Rule 403 balancing test, the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading of the jury, considerations of undue delay, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Preservation of Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Generally, to preserve error there must be a timely and specific objection to the complained-of evidence.\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

App. 2010). Specifically, to preserve a complaint for appellate review, the record must show that a defendant made a timely and specific objection to the trial court in compliance with the rules of evidence or the rules of appellate procedure, that the objection was sufficiently specific to make the trial court aware of the complaint unless the specific grounds were apparent from the context, and that the trial court ruled on the objection, either expressly or implicitly, or refused to rule and the complaining party objected.

Therefore, that complaint is preserved for our consideration.

For these reasons, Appellant maintains the trial court improperly admitted in evidence his statement to Officer Morales when it conducted its Rule of Evidence 403 balancing test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Under Rule 403, it is presumed that the probative value of relevant evidence exceeds any danger of unfair prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    De La Paz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8157470\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/279/336/#p343\">\n    279 S.W.3d at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v.

App. 2009). Based on this presumption as well as our review of the record and the relevant Rule 403 criteria, we conclude the probative value of the extraneous-offense evidence was not substantially outweighed by any prejudicial impact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The record establishes that the trial court could have reasonably concluded that Appellant's statement was admissible in evidence for the following reasons. Appellant's statement to Officer Morales had inherent probative value regarding whether Appellant intentionally and knowingly possessed the contraband, and the State needed the statement in evidence to establish Appellant's guilty knowledge regarding possession of the contraband. Appellant's statement did not have a tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis but rather assisted the State in proving that Appellant had knowledge that he was in possession of the contraband, and likewise did not have a tendency to confuse or distract the jury from the main issue in the case, which was Appellant's alleged intentional and knowing possession of a weapon in a penal institution. Similarly, the statement did not have a tendency to be given undue weight by the jury or to mislead the jury, and merely went to show Appellant's knowing possession of the contraband. In fact, Appellant had professed to Officer Morales that he had found the handle but had kept it. Finally, the statement did not cause undue delay and was not cumulative of other evidence. At trial, the statement was addressed during two sets of questions and answers; the first occurring during the State's direct examination, and the other occurring during defense counsel's cross-examination. Because we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this statement in evidence, Issue Two is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tex.Pen.Code Ann . \u00a7 1.07(a)(37) (West Supp. 2017)(\"Penal institution\" means a place designated by law for confinement of persons arrested for, charged with, or convicted of an offense); Tex.Loc.Gov't Code Ann . \u00a7\u00a7 351.001 (West 2005) (a county's commissioners court shall provide safe and suitable jails for the county), 351.041(a)(county sheriff is the keeper of the county jail);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Tex.Gov't Code Ann . \u00a7\u00a7 511.001(2) (West 2017) (\"Correctional facility\" means a facility operated by a county or other specified entity for the confinement of a person arrested for, charged with, or convicted of a criminal offense), (3)(\"County jail\" means a facility operated by or for a county for the confinement of persons accused or convicted of an offense), (6)(\"Inmate\" means a person arrested for, charged with, or convicted of a criminal offense of this state or another state of the United States and confined in a county jail or other specified facility), (7)(\"Prisoner\" means a person confined in a county jail).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
