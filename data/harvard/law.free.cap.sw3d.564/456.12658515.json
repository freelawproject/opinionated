Because the Department complains of the absence of a reporter's record of the expunction proceedings, we reverse the trial court's judgment and remand for a new hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In January 1999, O.T.A. was indicted for committing the offense of engaging in organized criminal activity occurring on or about November 13, 1998. In February 1999, O.T.A. was indicted for the offense of engaging in organized criminal activity occurring on or about November 27, 1998. T.A. pleaded guilty to the lesser-included offense of burglary of a vehicle for the offense alleged in the February 1999 indictment. He consented to deferred adjudication, and the trial court sentenced O.T.A. to two years' deferred-adjudication community supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 9, 2015, O.T.A. petitioned the trial court pursuant to article 55.02 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure to expunge all records and files arising from his arrest for the offense alleged in the January 1999 indictment. Petitioner O.T.A. identified the Texas Department of Public Safety, among others, as an agency possessing such records, and requested that the Clerk of the Court serve each official, entity, and agency listed in his petition. The Department filed an answer and original denial, as well as special exceptions to the petition for expunction in which it noted that the cited date of incident and date of arrest did not match the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court issued an order which set the petition for expunction for a hearing. The order was faxed to petitioner's counsel, and contained an instruction, \"Please give notice to all concerned parties.\" The trial court issued an order of expunction that contains an alleged date of offense that corresponds to that recited in the January 1998 indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Department brings this restricted appeal and complains that: (1) the trial court misinterpreted the expunction statute to allow records of the arrest to be destroyed when O.T.A. served a term of community supervision for his arrest; (2) O.T.A. failed to satisfy his burden of proving by legally sufficient evidence any of the statutory requirements to entitle him to an\n   expunction; and (3) the trial court erred by failing to hold a hearing and did not have any evidence that would permit the court to rule on the petition for expunction in the absence of a hearing, or alternatively, if the trial court conducted a hearing, the case must be remanded for a new trial because there is no reporter's record of the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We review a trial court's ruling on a petition for expunction under an abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    In re C.F.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094808\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/388/326/#p328\">\n    388 S.W.3d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 328 (Tex.App.-El Paso 2012, no pet.) ;\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of the Expunction of D.R.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7323567\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/322/771/#p772\">\n    322 S.W.3d 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 772-73 (Tex.App.-El Paso 2010, no pet.).
