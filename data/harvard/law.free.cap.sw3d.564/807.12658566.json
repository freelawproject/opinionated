Wills, and tenants/occupants John Doe and Mary Doe. The judgment granted Nationstar possession of unlawfully detained premises after foreclosure. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum of law has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
