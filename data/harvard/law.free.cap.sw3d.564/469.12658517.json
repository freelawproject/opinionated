The trial court found Appellant guilty, and sentenced him to twelve years' confinement. On appeal, he challenges the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence on the basis that it was obtained without probable cause or reasonable suspicion, without a valid warrant, and without valid consent in violation of the 4th and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Texas Constitution, and the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. Finding no error, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    The Traffic Stop\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While on patrol at approximately 2:00 a.m. on July 24, 2016 near police headquarters, El Paso Police Officer Ricardo Robles observed Appellant operating a vehicle which slowed to an almost complete stop at a green light and was equipped with a non-functioning right-side stoplamp. Officer Robles performed a traffic stop, and observed the driver of the vehicle, Appellant, to have slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, and a strong odor of an unknown alcoholic beverage. Appellant informed Officer Robles that he had consumed four beers, was traveling home from a family party, and had no identification or insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   DWI Task Force Officer Steven Alvarez, who was fueling his patrol vehicle nearby, saw the traffic stop and offered to assist Officer Robles. Officer Robles and his partner Officer Solrzano performed a background check while Officer Alvarez administered standardized field sobriety tests to Appellant. Officer Alvarez concluded that Appellant was intoxicated, and arrested him for driving while intoxicated. Multiple open warrants for Appellant were confirmed after his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    The Suppression Hearing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellant sought to suppress all evidence on the basis that the initial traffic stop was illegal. During the suppression hearing, Appellant argued that the Texas\n   Transportation Code requires only two stoplamps, and reading from the statute addressing stoplamps, acknowledged that the code defines a stoplamp as emitting \"a red light that's visible ... when the vehicle is braking.\" Although Appellant also acknowledged that Texas has adopted the federal standards for stoplamps, he argued that because the left-side and the high-mounted stoplamps on the vehicle were functioning, the vehicle was code-compliant, and the traffic stop was improper. Appellant also argued that the outstanding warrants did not serve to attenuate the illegal traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State countered that the initial stop was proper because the Texas Transportation Code, through Section 547.3215, has adopted the federal safety standards embodied in 49 C.F.R. Section 571.108, which require a third high-mounted stoplamp. The State further noted that under Section 547.004 of the Texas Transportation Code, a person commits a misdemeanor offense if the person operates or moves a vehicle that is not equipped in a manner that complies with the vehicle standards and requirements set forth in that chapter, and relying on a case with similar facts as the one before the trial court, argued that Officer Robles had probable cause to conduct the traffic stop because it is a misdemeanor offense to have a non-functioning stoplamp. The trial court denied Appellant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In his sole issue on appeal, Appellant contends the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress because federal regulations only require that a vehicle be \"equipped\" with three stoplamps, and because two of the three stoplamps on Appellant's vehicle were functioning, he argues his stop was unconstitutional. Because the stop was allegedly unconstitutional, Appellant argues the stop tainted evidence showing he was driving while intoxicated and the use of such evidence prohibited its use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We review a trial court's ruling refusing to suppress evidence for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Crain v.
