Smith's\n   point effectively argues that the trial court's grant of Capital Region's motion to dismiss cannot be sustained on either ground raised in the motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Judgment dismissed Smith's petition with prejudice on the ground that civil contempt cannot be used to enforce the payment of money. The Judgment was silent on whether the Commission possessed exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether interest was owed, the additional ground for dismissal raised in Capital Region's motion to dismiss. We begin our analysis with Capital Region's exclusive jurisdiction argument. If the motion to dismiss can be sustained on that ground, then the trial court's ruling on the use of civil contempt to enforce the payment of money would be rendered superfluous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Capital Region argues that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to consider Smith's petition because \"whether interest is due and the amount ... remains indeterminate and 'open'.\" [Respondent's Brief, p. 9]. Capital Region argues that as a result, the Commission retains exclusive jurisdiction pursuant to section 287.120 to determine whether and in what amount interest is owed to Smith. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Commission awarded Smith interest on her award. Specifically, the Commission held that \"any past due compensation shall bear interest as provided by law.\" It is settled that \"such language constitutes an award of interest pursuant to section 287.160.3.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Sutton v. Vee Jay Cement Contracting Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11139163,11139196\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/37/803/\">\n    37 S.W.3d 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 807-08 (Mo.

There is no indeterminate issue, therefore, regarding \"whether\" interest was awarded. Plainly, it was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   It is true that the Commission's award did not calculate the amount of interest owed. It did not state when interest would begin to accrue, or at what rate. However, that does not render the award of interest indeterminate or open. The \"amount\" of interest awarded on past due compensation owed Smith was \"as provided by law.\" The phrase \"shall bear interest as provided by law\" is \"susceptible to only one interpretation: interest shall be calculated pursuant to [section] 287.160.3.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Thus, where the Commission awards interest \"as provided by law,\" the amount of interest awarded is not indeterminate and open because it \"can be determined from an examination of the record and the applicable statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Sutton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11139163,11139196\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/37/803/\">\n    37 S.W.3d at 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Assuming the matter was otherwise properly before the trial court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court would have had the authority to calculate interest due Smith\n   based on application of section 287.160.3 to the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Capital Region cites no authority to the contrary addressing the calculation of interest awarded \"as provided by law.\" Instead, it relies by analogy on\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Labor and Industrial Relations Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6857988\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/465/471/\">\n    465 S.W.3d 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2015), where the Supreme Court found that a settlement remained subject to the Commission's exclusive jurisdiction to review claims pursuant to section 287.801 because the settlement \"left the issue of Employee's entitlement to compensation for future medical care indeterminate and 'open.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6857988\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/465/471/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6857988\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/465/471/\">\n    at 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In effect, the settlement was a \"partial award,\" that left the Commission with jurisdiction over the claim for purposes of future adjustments.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6857988\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/465/471/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. ISP Minerals, Inc.\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the instant case. The Commission's November 13, 2013 award was a final award. It did not leave any claim for benefits undetermined. Interest was awarded as provided by law. Calculation of the exact amount of interest owed is not an open claim that remained subject to the Commission's exclusive jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court's grant of Capital Region's motion to dismiss cannot be affirmed on this basis that the Commission possessed exclusive jurisdiction over the calculation of interest owed to Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We therefore turn to the second ground for dismissal raised in Capital Region's motion to dismiss - the ground expressly relied on by the trial court to grant the motion. The trial court found that civil contempt \"does not lie merely to compel the payment of money.\" Though Smith argues to the contrary, Missouri law on this point is clear and settled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Civil contempt is intended to benefit a party for whom relief is granted by coercing compliance with the relief granted.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Smith's petition for civil contempt does not seek this relief, and does not even refer to section 287.500. If the Commission's award has not yet been made a judgment pursuant to section 287.500, then as a matter of law, the trial court would have had no authority to enforce the Commission's award through any means, as section 287.500 \"provides the means by which a final Commission award becomes enforceable.\"\n    <em>\n     Deane\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6925803,6925820\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/437/321/\">\n     437 S.W.3d at 325\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Baxi v.

Thus, even if civil contempt could lie to enforce the payment of money (which it cannot), it is axiomatic that the trial court's inherent power to use civil contempt as a tool to encourage enforcement of its judgments would depend, in the first instance, on the existence of a judgment issued by the trial court.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 326 (\"Courts have inherent power to enforce\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      their own judgments\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    ....\") (quoting\n    <em>\n     Schumacher\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093248\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/400/364/#p369\">\n     400 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    369 ) (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
