Stephen argues that the motion court erred in ordering $1,960.00 of modifiable\n   spousal maintenance payable from him to Karla Richardson (\"Karla\") because the trial court failed to include Karla's $1,730.00 monthly pension income from her portion of his marital military pension in determining her ability to meet her reasonable needs. We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Statement of Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Stephen and Karla were married on August 26, 1989. The parties separated on or about June 30, 2012. A petition for dissolution was filed and a trial was held. On March 13, 2014, the court entered its Amended Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment and Decree of Dissolution of Marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the time of trial on the original dissolution, spousal maintenance was the sole contested issue. The parties consented to a joint legal and joint physical custody parenting plan and agreed as to the amount of child support. The parties settled the issues regarding the division of property and debt through a Separation and Property Settlement Agreement which was found to be fair and not unconscionable and was ordered by the dissolution court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As relevant to the issues currently before this court, at the time of the dissolution Stephen was retired from the United States Navy and his military pension was \"matured,\" meaning he was currently receiving monthly pension benefits. The property settlement agreement and the subsequent judgment provided that each party would receive one half of the monthly military pension payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties jointly offered two exhibits in the original dissolution setting forth Stephen's gross income at the time of the dissolution to be $9,582.66 per month, which included his salary from his current employment with the Veterans Administration and his monthly military pension benefits from his Navy service. The dissolution court found his net income for purposes of determining if he had the ability to pay maintenance, to be $7,247.79 per month. The dissolution court found Karla's reasonable needs to be $4,105.00 per month. The dissolution court did not impute any income to Karla based on various factors and found that she had no income at that time but would have income equal to her share of the monthly pension benefit after the dissolution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The dissolution judgment provided for Stephen to pay Karla modifiable maintenance in the amount of $4,450.00 per month, which after payment of her tax burden, the court found sufficient to meet her reasonable needs. The dissolution judgment further provided for an automatic reduction of that maintenance obligation\n   to the amount of $2,850.00 per month beginning on the month following Karla receiving the monthly payments based on her portion of Stephen's military pension, which the court determined would be in the amount of $1,600.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The military pension benefits were considered monthly income to each of the parties for the purposes of determining maintenance. Neither party appealed the judgment of dissolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Less than one year after the dissolution judgment, in December of 2014, Stephen filed his first Motion to Modify the Dissolution Judgment, which was consented to by Karla. The Motion to Modify only addressed issues dealing with custody and visitation. The modification action was settled and the parties agreed that neither party would pay child support to the other. On February 2, 2015, the court entered a Judgment and Order Modifying Decree of Dissolution. The court found in that judgment that as of July 2014, Karla began receiving the monthly benefits that she was entitled to from Stephen's military pension and that pursuant to the original dissolution judgment the maintenance obligation was automatically reduced to the sum of $2,850.00 as of August 2014. The court found that the change in the maintenance amount was \"not a modification as to the maintenance, but rather that a requirement in reduction of the maintenance payment has occurred.\" The court did not recalculate the income and expenses of the parties in the modification judgment in regards to the maintenance obligation. This judgment of modification was not appealed by either party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Slightly over one year later, on March 25, 2016, Stephen filed a Motion to Modify Decree of Dissolution for Reduction of Maintenance, which was later amended. Stephen alleged that a substantial and continuing change in circumstances had occurred since the time of the original judgment in that: (1) Karla had sufficient opportunity to gain employment; (2) Karla's home constituted an unreasonable expense that was not a reasonable need; and (3) the children of the parties no longer resided with Karla.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A trial was held on July 18, 2017, and the trial court issued a Judgment and Decree of Modification of Maintenance on September 28, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   At trial Karla testified that she did not believe that she had any mental health problems and she had stopped seeing her mental health provider due to that belief. Karla also testified that she had not obtained employment since the dissolution and she had done nothing to obtain employment or job training. Karla testified that she had a depressed mood, trouble with her daily activities, anxiety, fear of socialization, and anxiety when driving or leaving her house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court found Karla's testimony to be contradictory and her evidence insufficient to establish an inability to be employed. The trial court found that Karla was capable of gainful employment and had made no good faith effort since the time of the dissolution to obtain employment. The trial court found that \"[Karla's] failure to make a good faith effort at obtaining self-sufficiency constitutes a substantial and continuing change in the circumstances since the time of the Judgment\n   that makes the original Judgment unreasonable.\" Following this finding, the trial court recalculated the maintenance award. The court imputed income to Karla for 40 hours per week at minimum wage, for a monthly income total of $1,335.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court also found that Karla had the ability to earn approximately $446.00 per month in net investment income based on over $200,000.00 in cash that she had in a bank account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of these findings are challenged on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The trial court further found that Karla received pension income from Stephen's military retirement in the amount $1,730.00 per month but the trial court did not \"find that this pension payment is income for purpose of determining maintenance.\" Although not raised or argued by either party, the trial court in its judgment cited to\n   <em>\n    Lindo v. Higginbotham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12380394\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/517/558/\">\n    517 S.W.3d 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. App. E.D. 2016) for the proposition that \"the reduction of maintenance, dollar for dollar in the amount of the pension benefit, has the effect of impermissibly amending the division of marital property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court found Karla's reasonable needs to be $3,685.00 per month. The trial court ordered that spousal maintenance due from Stephen to Karla should be reduced to $1,960.00 per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Karla's Income and Expense Statement that was received into evidence at trial showed her gross monthly income from all sources as $4,500.00 per month. She included in her monthly income the $1,650.00 monthly payment from the military pension and $2,850.00 in monthly maintenance she was receiving at that time. Clearly it was her position at trial that the court should consider her portion of the pension benefits as income for purposes of determining her ability to meet her reasonable needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The judgment provided Karla with a monthly income of $3,741.00 without consideration of the monthly pension benefit of $1,730.00. The court found her reasonable needs to be $3,685.00 per month. If the pension benefits are considered as income, her monthly income, including the maintenance award, would exceed her reasonable needs by $1,786.00 per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Stephen's Income and Expense Statement that was received at trial showed a gross monthly income from all sources as $8,988.00 and this amount included the portion of the military pension benefit that he was receiving each month. He showed a net monthly income of $5,940.00, which also included the pension benefits. The trial court found that based on his income he had the ability to pay maintenance. His ability to pay maintenance is not challenged on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This timely appeal followed. Stephen raises two points on appeal but the central issue in both is whether the trial court\n   erred in failing to consider the monthly benefits Karla received from the military pension in calculating her ability to meet her own reasonable needs.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Because this is a court tried case, \"the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed unless it is not supported by substantial evidence, it is against the weight of the evidence, or it erroneously declares or applies the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Blue Ridge Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.

In his first point on appeal, Stephen argues that the trial court erred in ordering $1,960.00 of modifiable spousal maintenance because by failing to continue to consider Karla's $1,730.00 monthly payment from her portion of the marital military pension as income, the trial court misapplied the law. In his second point on appeal, Stephen argues that the trial court erred in ordering $1,960.00 of modifiable spousal maintenance because by failing to include Karla's $1,730.00 monthly payment from Karla's portion of the marital military retirement pension as income, the trial court misapplied the law by excluding a readily available source of income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Point One\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In Stephen's first point on appeal he argues that the trial court erred by not considering Karla's $1,730 monthly payment from her portion of the marital military retirement pension as income. Stephen argues that the trial court's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Lindo v. Higginbotham\n   </em>\n   was misapplied since Karla's $1,730 monthly income from her portion of the marital military pension was already included as income for purposes of determining maintenance in the original dissolution judgment, and by not including the pension income the trial court was altering the prior marital property division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Stephen's motion to modify the court's prior judgment regarding maintenance is governed by section 452.370\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   . That section provides that \"the provisions of any judgment respecting maintenance or support may be modified only upon a showing of changed circumstances so substantial and continuing as to make the terms unreasonable.\" Section 452.370.1. \"[I]n determining whether or not a substantial change in circumstances has occurred, [the court] shall consider all financial resources of both parties[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12410242\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/536/771/#p778\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the trial court determined that Karla's failure to make a good faith effort to obtain self-sufficiency constituted a substantial and continuing change in circumstances, which justified a modification of the maintenance award. This finding is not disputed on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Once the trial court has found that the requisite change in circumstances has been shown, the court must then determine if maintenance should be terminated or determine the appropriate amount of maintenance to award. To be entitled to continued maintenance, the trial court must first determine, as relevant to this case, that the spouse seeking maintenance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (1) Lacks sufficient property, including marital property apportioned to him, to provide for his reasonable needs; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (2) Is unable to support himself through appropriate employment[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Section 452.335.1(1)-(2). \"In determining the amount to award for maintenance in a modification proceeding under \u00a7 452.370, the trial court may, but is not required to, consider the factors found in \u00a7 452.335, just as if the trial court was determining an original maintenance award.\"\n   <em>\n    Kunce v.

When the future payments from the marital portion of a pension plan have been awarded to one of the party's in the calculation of the division of property, the future payments are then a part of that party's marital estate and should not be used in a modification to reduce maintenance on a dollar for dollar basis because to do so would constitute an amendment of the property division.\n   <em>\n    Leslie v.

This would be true whether the pension payments are used to establish a party's ability to pay maintenance or are considered in determining a party's ability to meet his or her reasonable needs. To do so would effectively be forcing one party to consume an asset from the division of property in order to pay or receive maintenance as the value of those future payments was taken into account in the division of the marital property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Stephen argues that the trial court misapplied the law by not continuing to include Karla's monthly pension benefit as income in the maintenance calculation because those payments were treated as income in the original dissolution judgment and not treating them as such in the modification changed the original dissolution court's division of property. Stephen argues that the court misapplied the holding in\n   <em>\n    Lindo v. Higginbotham\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Lindo\n   </em>\n   , Higginbotham argued that because Lindo, post-dissolution, began to receive pension income due to his early retirement, this constituted a substantial change of circumstances sufficient to support a motion to modify a maintenance award.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 564. The trial court denied Higginbotham's motion to modify because \"[t]reating [Lindo's] current ability to receive monthly payments from these assets as a change of circumstances justifying a change in the maintenance payments would effectively amount to a modification of the division of property in the original dissolution action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Eastern District of this court agreed, stating that \"[t]he reduction of maintenance, dollar for dollar in the amount of the pension benefit, has the effect of impermissibly amending the division of marital property.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Lindo\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable on several grounds. First, the receipt of pension benefits was not the basis for the trial court's finding that a change in circumstances had occurred in the case at bar. It was Karla's failure to use her best efforts to become self-supporting that the trial court found constituted the requisite change in circumstances justifying the modification of the maintenance award. Once the court determined that a modification of the maintenance award was justified, the court must then, pursuant to section 452.370.1, consider \"all financial resources of both parties ...\" in determining the modified amount of maintenance to be awarded. It was under this second step of the analysis that the court was required to\n   <em>\n    consider\n   </em>\n   the pension payments. Also, unlike\n   <em>\n    Lindo\n   </em>\n   where the pension income was not originally considered as monthly income and factored into the maintenance calculation, here the original maintenance calculation in the final judgment\n   of the dissolution court, included the pension income in the maintenance calculation. In this case the pension had matured and Stephen was currently receiving the monthly benefits at the time of the dissolution. Karla was going to begin receiving her share of that pension income as soon as the paperwork from the dissolution was processed through the pension plan. The property settlement agreement, which was incorporated into the judgment, did not provide for a value of the pension plan, but merely divided the monthly pension payments as income between the parties.

In the judgment the income that Stephen was currently receiving from the military pension was listed as income both for purposes of calculating his child support and maintenance obligations. The income that Karla was going to be receiving as soon as the paperwork from the dissolution was final and processed by the pension plan was used for determining her income for purposes of child support and for determining her ability to meet her reasonable needs regarding maintenance. The property settlement agreement and subsequently the final judgment did not place a total value on the military pension plan, but merely divided the monthly benefit payments equally between the parties. Neither party may collaterally attack the final dissolution judgment by arguing the income from the military pension was improperly treated for the calculation of maintenance in that judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201408\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201408\">\n    at 391-392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The benefits are paid from a fund supported by contributions from the employer and in some cases a predetermined contribution by the employees. Usually the employee's contribution is based on a percentage of the employees pay and the contribution is mandatory for all employees. Under these plans there is no separate pool of assets from which each individual's benefits are derived, but rather a large pool of assets which is accumulated and invested on behalf of all employees and from which a set monthly benefit is paid to each employee upon \"vesting\" and reaching \"maturity\".\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
