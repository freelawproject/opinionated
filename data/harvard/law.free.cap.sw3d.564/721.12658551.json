District raises two points on appeal. District argues that the policies were properly promulgated, contrary to the trial court's determination, and that Lehmann was not entitled to injunctive relief because she has an adequate remedy at law. Because District substantially complied with \u00a7 171.011,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the statute granting District authority to enact rules and regulations, the policies at issue are valid. Accordingly, the trial court erred in entering a declaratory judgment finding them invalid as well as a permanent injunction barring District from proceeding with the termination hearing on the basis of the policies, and its decision is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Lehmann is a certified speech-language pathologist, who has been employed by District for approximately twenty-five years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 4, 2017, District served Lehmann a Statement of Charges, alleging that Lehmann willfully and persistently violated and failed to obey District policies IGBA-1 and GBCB, related to Programs with Disabilities and Staff Conduct. Lehmann requested a hearing in response to the charges, and a hearing was set for October 28, 2017, but it was rescheduled to January 16, 2018. On November 27, 2017, under \u00a7 536.050, Lehmann filed a petition for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief in the Circuit Court of Cole County,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   arguing that District lacked authority to seek her termination on the basis of policies IGBA-1 and GBCB because they constituted invalid regulations insofar as they were \"policies\" and not \"regulations,\" and \u00a7 168.114.1(4) permits termination proceedings against a \"permanent teacher\" for the violation of only \"published regulations of the board of education.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The trial court held a hearing on Lehmann's petition on January 11, 2018, wherein it received six exhibits from District, which consisted of the agenda and minutes of various District Board of Education meetings approving policies IGBA-1 and GBCB, as well as copies of the policies themselves. At the hearing, Lehmann conceded that, contrary to the argument in her petition, the validity of the policies did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   turn on whether they were denominated \"policies\" or \"regulations.\" Lehmann argued, for the first time however, that the policies were nevertheless invalid because District's exhibits did \"not show that [the policies] had been duly signed by the Board or that they were ever delivered to the district clerk or that they were transmitted by the district clerk to the teachers employed at the schools,\" and, she argued, \"those [three] steps are required by Statute 171.011.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Lehmann also conceded that \"posting on the [District's] website is equivalent to transmitting forth with\" and \"that the district clerk is now embodied by the secretary to the superintendent or secretary to the school board.\" Thus, Lehmann's sole basis for her argument that the policies were invalid was that District had not presented a\n   <em>\n    signed\n   </em>\n   copy of the policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the hearing, the trial court issued a declaratory judgment indicating that policies IGBA-1 and GBCB were invalid because they failed to comply with the statutory requirement that they be signed. In so ruling, the trial court relied on Missouri Supreme Court case law interpreting \u00a7 536.021 and holding that a \"rule promulgated in violation of \u00a7 536.021 is void.\" The trial court determined that, \"[l]ikewise, [District] must comply with the relatively simple requirements of \u00a7 171.011, RSMo., in promulgating its regulations or its regulations are void.\" The trial court concluded that, because \"District has failed to show that its Policies IGBA-1 and GBCB were 'duly signed by order of the board' as expressly required by \u00a7 171.011, RSMo.[,] ... Policies IGBA-1 and GBCB were not properly promulgated by the Fox C-6 Board of Education and are therefore void.\" District appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"When reviewing a declaratory judgment, our standard of review is the same\n   as in any other court-tried case.\"\n   <em>\n    Lueckenotte v.

And then they are then authorized to be put on the website, which is available to all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   And it also would be contrary to these requirements and prohibited by law where the policies to be designated as duly adopted once they have been put on the website if they have not gone through these steps. So there's no doubt that it followed those procedures.

She then raised, at the hearing, a new claim of invalidity-that District failed to comply with \u00a7 171.011. She presented no evidence, however, to support this argument. Instead, she asserted that her claim was supported by \"certain exhibits\" that were attached to a \"responsive filing by the Board.\" Lehmann failed to identify which exhibits she was relying on and made no effort to introduce the documents into evidence at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   District, despite having no duty to do so, offered six exhibits into evidence to refute Lehmann's new theory of invalidity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those exhibits consisted of the agenda and minutes of Board meetings wherein policies IGBA-1 (Exhibits A, B) and GBCB (Exhibits C, D) were approved, as well as copies of the policies themselves (Exhibit E was policy IGBA-1 and Exhibit F was policy GBCB). Based on these exhibits and the language of \u00a7 171.011, the trial court determined that policies IGBA-1 and GBCB were not properly promulgated because neither policy was signed and, therefore,\n   the policies were invalid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In so holding, the trial court misapplied the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Section 171.011 enables \"[t]he school board of each school district in the state [to] make all needful rules and regulations for the organization, grading and government in the school district.\" The statute further provides that any such rules \"shall take effect when a copy of the rules, duly signed by order of the board, is deposited with the district clerk.

The court upheld the rule against a challenge to its validity, determining that, \"although the technical requirements for issuing rules and regulations were not met, the teachers had ample and actual notice\" of the revised calendar; thus, \"there was 'substantial and sufficient compliance' with the statutory requirements and ... the board's regulations were valid.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10072133\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/483/629/#p633\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Here, Lehmann has never claimed that she was unaware of Policies IGBA-1 or GBCB or the requirements they imposed upon her as a teacher or that District otherwise failed to provide notice of the policies to District teachers. On the contrary, the evidence demonstrates that District provided notice to the public, generally, of not only its intent to adopt the policies but also its actual adoption thereof. And, as the trial court found, \"the legislative intent [of the transmission requirement] is satisfied by posting newly-adopted rules on the Internet,\" and \"the [notice] requirement of \u00a7 171.011, RSMo., is thereby met.\" Additionally, Lehmann never challenged the sufficiency of the underlying procedure adopting the two rules; instead, her challenge was directed solely at the lack of a signature on the face of the rules themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Thus, under the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Adamick\n   </em>\n   , District substantially complied with \u00a7 171.011, and its policies are valid. \"If there was a substantial compliance with the statute, and no one was misled, that is all the law requires.\"\n   <em>\n    Meloy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9957000\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/631/933/#p936\">\n    631 S.W.2d at 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    McClure v.
