Correll claims that the motion court clearly erred because her conviction of the felony of stealing and sentence of six years' imprisonment were unlawful under the Missouri Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Bazell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182019\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/497/263/\">\n    497 S.W.3d 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo.banc 2016).
