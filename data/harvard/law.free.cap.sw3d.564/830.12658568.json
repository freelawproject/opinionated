The decedent's family contended that the truck driver was negligent in operating the truck and the driver's employer, the truck owner, was negligent in training the driver. The jury found that negligence of the driver, the truck owner-employer, and the decedent proximately caused the collision. The trial court rendered judgment on the verdict. The court of appeals affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The issues are (1) whether the trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of the pedestrian's mental illness and the fact that she had alcohol and drugs in her system at the time of the collision, and (2) whether the employer could be held directly liable for the death based on a negligent training theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We conclude that (1) the trial court erred by excluding the evidence, and (2) there is no evidence to support the finding that the alleged negligence of the employer in training the driver proximately caused the collision. We reverse and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 27, 2012, Mary Turner was on the south side of Rittiman Road in San Antonio, walking east on a sidewalk that paralleled Rittiman. Before reaching the corner where Rittiman intersects with Goldfield Street, Turner veered to her right, cutting the corner of Rittiman and Goldfield. She walked southeasterly across a parking lot and reached Goldfield south of its intersection with Rittiman. While Turner was walking across the parking lot toward Goldfield, James Lundry was driving a JBS Carriers, Inc. 18-wheeler tractor-trailer (truck) east on Rittman toward Goldfield. When Lundry reached the intersection of Rittiman and Goldfield he began a right turn to head south on Goldfield. As Lundry began the turn, a car traveling north on Goldfield toward Rittiman approached the intersection. Lundry was partially through the turn onto Goldfield when it became apparent that his truck and the car on Goldfield were blocking each other's progress and one or the other would have to back up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Lundry testified that at this point the driver of the car was making hand signals toward Lundry, and that Lundry made his own hand signal toward the driver to indicate that the driver needed to back up. The car backed up and created enough space for Lundry to complete the turn onto Goldfield. As Lundry was completing the turn, the truck's right front fender struck Turner, who by that time was crossing Goldfield approximately fifty-seven feet south of its intersection with Rittiman. Turner was knocked down and the tires of the trailer ran over her as Lundry proceeded down Goldfield. Lundry was unaware of Turner's presence or that she had been run over. He continued driving until a witness to the accident caught up with him and told him what had happened. Turner was pronounced dead at the scene. A security video camera from a nearby store recorded the events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Turner's children, Trinette Washington, Sophia Lenzy, and Thomas Lenzy (collectively, the family), sued JBS and Lundry, asserting wrongful death and survival actions. The family alleged that Lundry, while acting in the course and scope of his employment with JBS, negligently operated the truck and that JBS was independently negligent for, among other things, failing to properly train Lundry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The case was tried to a jury. JBS and Lundry sought to introduce evidence showing that Turner had mental health issues and before her death she had ingested substances that impaired her judgment. The proferred evidence included an autopsy, Turner's prior medical records, and testimony from an expert medical witness. The autopsy revealed that Turner had alcohol, cocaine, and oxycodone present in her body. Her personal effects included a \"drug-type glass pipe,\" and her medical records noted a history of crack cocaine abuse. The medical records also revealed that months before the accident, Turner's doctor had prescribed medications to treat her for anxiety and recommended that she have a psychiatric evaluation, which she did shortly before her death. The psychiatric evaluation resulted in Turner's being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. She received a prescription for two additional medications to treat those conditions. Turner's daughter told the San Antonio police investigating the accident that Turner had mental health issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dr. Keith Miller, a medical expert hired by JBS and Lundry, opined that the various substances in Turner's body impacted her cognition and that she was suffering from an acute exacerbation of her underlying mental disease at the time of the accident. Based on the autopsy, toxicology reports, and video of the occurrence, Dr. Miller testified during an offer of proof by JBS and Lundry that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-18\">\n   [i]t appeared to me that Ms. Turner walked in a steady pace without breaking stride, without speeding up or slowing down, walked right into the side of a tractor-trailer. Now, that's-that certainly to me in my experience-my education, training and experience, fits the scenario of a person who is not only impacted by medication but more likely is having an exacerbation of a severe mental condition particularly of the nature of schizophrenia paranoid type and bipolar disorder. We know that Ms. Turner was at least not taking some of her medications prescribed. Not taking the medication probably was a worse scenario for Ms. Turner than taking them; although, either could do that. And what I saw on the video, unfortunately, fits that situation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The trial court excluded all evidence of Turner's mental health, prescription medications, and alcohol and drug use. The court agreed with JBS and Lundry that the autopsy and toxicology reports, Turner's daughter's statements to the police regarding Turner's mental health issues, and Dr. Miller's expert testimony were relevant to some extent. Nevertheless, the court concluded that \"the prejudice outweighs, you know, what you want to put in so at this point I'm still going to sustain the objection by [the family] as to not going into those areas.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. EVID. 403 (allowing a court to exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At trial, evidence was introduced regarding an area Lundry allegedly could not see from the cab of the truck-that is, a \"blind spot\"-located off the truck's right front fender. Evidence was also introduced regarding JBS's hiring, training, supervision, and maintenance programs, along with evidence that JBS's training manual did not mention that the truck's driver would have a blind spot in the area where Turner was when she and the truck collided. The family presented opinion testimony that the reason Turner entered the street when and where she did was because she mistook Lundry's gesture to the car's driver to be a signal by which Lundry was waiving her across the street. The\n   family also presented evidence to support their position that Lundry did not see Turner because he was distracted by his interaction with the driver of the car at the intersection, not because the truck had a blind spot. A police detective who investigated the accident testified that in his opinion Turner was at fault in causing the accident because she failed to yield the right-of-way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The jury found Lundry, JBS, and Turner negligent. It attributed 50% of the responsibility to Lundry, 30% to JBS, and 20% to Turner. The jury awarded damages for Turner's physical pain and mental anguish, funeral and burial expenses, and each child's loss of companionship and mental anguish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Both parties appealed.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374653\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/513/703/#p707\">\n    513 S.W.3d 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 707 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2017). In part, JBS challenged the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury's separate finding of direct negligence on its part. Both JBS and Lundry challenged the trial court's excluding evidence of Turner's mental health, the substances discovered in her body during the autopsy and their effects, and Dr. Miller's opinions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374653\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/513/703/#p707\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The court of appeals affirmed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374653\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/513/703/#p707\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374653\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/513/703/#p707\">\n    at 708-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

After detailing the proferred testimony of Dr. Miller, the court addressed the evidence's probative value:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Dr. Miller, a family physician, based his opinions on medical records made over two months before the accident. His trial testimony linking Turner's medical records to her specific state of mind on the day of the accident was weak, and in his deposition, he admitted he could not testify about Turner's state of mind on the day of the accident. Further, the security camera footage of the accident does not show Turner acting erratically. Therefore, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in determining, pursuant to Rule 403, that the probative value of this evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice in labeling Turner a bipolar schizophrenic drug addict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374653\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/513/703/#p707\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The dissenting justice disagreed, stating that \"not only did the trial court abuse its discretion in excluding such evidence as more prejudicial than probative, ... the excluded evidence was crucial to the issue of proportionate responsibility, resulting in the rendition of an improper judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374653\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/513/703/#p707\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374653\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/513/703/#p707\">\n    at 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Barnard, J., dissenting). She noted that the excluded evidence established that \"Turner suffered from two serious mental health conditions ... that could have affected her perceptions,\" which, if admitted, \"would have provided an explanation as to why Turner chose to walk into a roadway-seemingly without stopping or looking-outside of the crosswalk.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374653\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/513/703/#p707\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374653\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/513/703/#p707\">\n    at 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In this Court, JBS and Lundry bring two issues: (1) the trial court erred by excluding the evidence of mental health, alcohol use, and drug use; and (2) JBS was erroneously held directly liable to the family in addition to its respondeat superior liability for Lundry's actions. We address them in order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Exclusion of Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   JBS and Lundry argue that the evidence of Turner's mental health, prescription medication use, and drug and alcohol use was relevant to the issue of her negligence. Without this evidence, JBS and Lundry assert, they were effectively denied their primary defense because the case turns on the factual question of why Turner walked into the street-was it because Turner believed Lundry waved her into the street as the family maintained, or was it because she was impaired and crossed the street at an improper place without looking for oncoming traffic? They also urge that the court of appeals failed to properly discern the difference between \"prejudicial\" and \"unfairly prejudicial\" when it weighed the probative value of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The family counters that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence because its probative value was low and the danger of unfair prejudice was high. The family asserts that there was no evidence Turner was impaired at the time of the accident, Dr. Miller did not link the results of the toxicology report with any of Turner's actions, and the stigma associated with schizophrenia and drug use would have created a high danger of unfair prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A trial court's exclusion of evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Caffe Ribs, Inc. v.

If a trial court abuses its discretion and erroneously excludes evidence, then the question is whether the error \"probably caused the rendition of an improper judgment.\" TEX. R. APP.

Rather, if erroneously excluded evidence was \"crucial to a key issue,\" then the error was likely harmful-that is, it probably caused the rendition of an improper judgment-unless the evidence was cumulative or the rest of the evidence was so one-sided that the error likely made no difference in the judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300707\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/302/866/#p870\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

But Dr. Miller clarified in his deposition that he had not seen the toxicology report or the autopsy, while his offer of proof testimony at trial showed that after his deposition he reviewed those documents and took them into account in forming his opinion that Turner's action as depicted in the video \"fit the scenario\" of a person impacted by a mental condition, medication, and drugs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The family argues that Dr. Miller's bill of exception testimony does not show Turner was actually intoxicated or impaired. But a specific showing of intoxication is not required in order for evidence regarding the use of substances to be admissible.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ford Motor Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10268680\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/81/1032/#p1037\">\n     81 S.W.2d at 1037\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (evidence of smell of liquor on a driver's breath was admissible in light of evidence that the driver swerved to the opposite side of the road). As for impairment, Dr. Miller's testimony sufficiently linked Turner's mental health and drug use to her actions to make it relevant to and probative of the question of whether her mental health, drug use, or both, were connected to the actions she took relative to her death, and particularly to the question of whether her actions were such as would have been taken by a person using ordinary care.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TEX.

To the extent any stigma associated with mental illness might raise prejudice concerns, as noted above, the key question in analyzing this assertion is not whether the evidence is prejudicial, but\n    whether it is\n    <em>\n     unfairly\n    </em>\n    prejudicial. Evidence is\n    <em>\n     unfairly\n    </em>\n    prejudicial if it has an \"undue tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.\"\n    <em>\n     Diamond Offshore Servs.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655997\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/542/539/#p549\">\n     542 S.W.3d at 549\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The jury was tasked with deciding whether Turner acted with ordinary care in walking into the street under the circumstances.

The excluded evidence would have allowed the jury at least some view of those processes when it assessed whether her actions met the standard of ordinary care-that is, whether she walked into the street because her mental processes were impaired, or because Lundry's hand signals induced her to do so, as the family asserted.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655997\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/542/539/#p549\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (\"The [excluded evidence] does not encourage the jury to decide on any improper basis, but rather on the basis that Williams's condition is not as severe as he claims.

Absent the excluded evidence, the jury was not properly informed in making its decision. It had to judge Turner's decision-making processes and actions after having seen and heard only a limited, filtered version of the evidence as to those processes and actions. While we recognize the potential for jurors to derive unfair negative connotations from the excluded evidence, under these circumstances, that potential is not substantially outweighed by the probative value of the evidence. Thus, the evidence is not\n    <em>\n     unfairly\n    </em>\n    prejudicial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The family also argues that the probative value of the excluded evidence was lower because the jury was able to view a video of the events in determining who was at fault. We disagree. The video of the occurrence, in combination with other evidence the family introduced, provided a one-sided view of the possible\n    <em>\n     reasons\n    </em>\n    for Turner's actions. An expert witness called by the family addressed that question. He opined that, considering the video and Lundry's testimony, Turner may have walked into the street in response to the hand motions that Lundry testified he directed toward the driver of the car blocking his turn from Rittiman onto Goldfield. That theory was brought up by the family throughout the trial. The evidence Lundry and JBS sought to introduce undoubtedly would have been prejudicial to the family's theory if the evidence had been admitted-as \"much of a proponent's evidence is legitimately intended to wound the opponent.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Diamond Offshore Servs. Ltd.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655997\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/542/539/#p549\">\n     542 S.W.3d at 549\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The excluded evidence would have provided a distinct and completely different reason for Turner's actions from that advanced by the family.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    In sum, we agree with Lundry and JBS that allowing them to introduce evidence providing an alternative explanation for Turner's actions-her mental condition and the drugs and alcohol in her system- would not have been\n    <em>\n     unfairly\n    </em>\n    prejudicial to the Family when considered in context of the record as a whole. The probative value of the excluded evidence was high, not low, when considered in context with the video and other evidence the family\n    introduced regarding Turner's actions related to the question of why Turner walked into the street.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    We conclude that the trial court erred by excluding the toxicology report and Dr. Miller's opinion that Turner's mental health condition and the drugs in her system likely contributed to her actions. That being said, an erroneous exclusion of evidence is not reversible error unless it was harmful-that is, it \"probably caused the rendition of an improper judgment.\" TEX. R. APP. P. 61.1(a). We address that question next.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Harm\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    \"Exclusion of evidence is likely harmless if the evidence was cumulative or if the rest of the evidence was so one-sided that the error likely made no difference in the judgment.\"\n    <em>\n     Gunn v. McCoy\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657377\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/554/645/#p668\">\n     554 S.W.3d 645\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 668 (Tex. 2018). But the exclusion \"is likely harmful if it was 'crucial to a key issue.' \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657377\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/554/645/#p668\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    The first consideration-whether the evidence was cumulative or strongly one-sided- does not support a conclusion that the exclusion was harmless. To begin with, the excluded evidence was not cumulative. It related directly to Turner's state of mind and mental condition that resulted in her decision to walk into the street where and under the circumstances she did. Absent the excluded evidence, the only evidence the jury heard as to those matters was opinion testimony from an expert called by the family. That testimony did not address the question of whether Turner had impaired thought processes or perception abilities. To the contrary, it implied that she was\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    impaired and saw Lundry's hand signal and interpreted it as an ordinary person would have-as a direction for her to continue walking across the street. Further, the evidence was not heavily one-sided in favor of the family's position. The liability and percentage of responsibility questions largely turned on why Lundry did not see and avoid running over Turner, and why Turner did not avoid colliding with the plainly visible truck. While Lundry testified directly as to why he did not see Turner, the family's evidence as to why Turner acted as she did was largely speculative and based primarily on opinion evidence by the family's expert.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    As to the second consideration, whether the excluded evidence was crucial to a key issue, it is unquestionable that Turner's state of mind and mental decision-making processes were crucial to the key issue of whether her decision to walk into the street met the standard of reasonable care. As noted above, the family's theory was that Turner began to cross the street some distance from the crosswalk because she saw Lundry's hand signal and thought he was signaling her to cross. The family's expert witness testified that in his opinion Turner was looking at the truck and \"she could\n    <em>\n     probably\n    </em>\n    see the guy doing the hand signals.\n    <em>\n     Maybe\n    </em>\n    she thought he was signaling her forward.\" (emphasis added). The attorney for the family asked another witness about Lundry's hand signal and also brought it up in closing argument. The evidence offered by Lundry and JBS was designed to directly rebut the family's theory by showing that Turner did not walk into the street because she thought she had been given a signal to cross, but rather did so because she was impaired to the extent she did not stop walking even in light of the clearly visible moving truck. Evidence of Turner's impairment was crucial to the questions of whether her actions fell below the standard of reasonable care, and if so, the extent to which her impairment and actions made her responsible for the occurrence. The jury found her 20% responsible even absent evidence that she\n    was impaired. The proffered evidence likely would have affected the jury's allocation of responsibility to both Lundry and Turner, at a minimum. Thus, the trial court's erroneous exclusion of the evidence probably caused rendition of an improper judgment. That being so, the court of appeals erred by affirming the trial court's judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    <strong>\n     III. JBS's Direct Negligence\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    JBS asserts that it cannot be held directly liable for two reasons. First, there is no evidence to support the negligent training theory of liability. Second, a direct negligence claim may not be submitted as to a corporate employer if that employer has already conceded that it will be vicariously liable for any negligence found against its employee.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    As to the first issue, sufficiency of the evidence, the family claims JBS waived the issue by focusing its briefing on the second issue regarding its direct liability. The family also asserts that the evidence of JBS's failure to train Lundry as to the blind spot in front of his truck supports the jury's finding of direct negligence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    In responding to the second issue-that JBS cannot be held directly liable because it has admitted vicarious liability-the family argues that JBS waived the issue because it made the argument for the first time in this Court. In the alternative, the family asserts that the Legislature has mandated that the negligence of each responsible party must be considered, thus a defendant's direct negligence should be considered even if that defendant may also be vicariously liable for its employee's negligence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 33.011(6). Thus, the family argues, they had the right to submit both Lundry's negligence and JBS's independent, direct negligence for the jury to consider in apportioning responsibility, and the fact that JBS agreed to be financially responsible for any judgment against Lundry did not make JBS any less independently negligent in causing Turner's death.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    <strong>\n     A.

For example, it urged that \"[t]here is no evidence that JBS's training program is faulty,\" and challenged the trial court's failure to enter a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which it argued in the trial court was appropriate based on the lack of evidence to support the jury's verdict.

The appeals court also agreed with the family that \"the jury was free to conclude that JBS failed to use ordinary care when it instructed Lundry on how to safely operate the 18-wheeler ... when it failed to determine whether Lundry's seat position allowed him to see in front of the truck.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374653\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/513/703/#p707\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The single negligence question in the jury charge asked whether \"the negligence, if any, of those named below proximately cause[d] the occurrence in question.\" Lundry, JBS, and Turner were named. Proximate cause was defined as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    \"Proximate cause\" means a cause that was a substantial factor in bringing about an occurrence and without which cause such occurrence would not have occurred. In order to be a proximate cause, the act or omission complained of must be such that a person using\n    <em>\n     ordinary care\n    </em>\n    would have foreseen that the occurrence, or some similar occurrence, might reasonably result therefrom. There may be more than one proximate cause of an occurrence.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    JBS disputes the family's claim that there was evidence it failed to train Lundry about the blind spot in front of the truck. But even assuming there was evidence it failed to do so, JBS further maintains there was no evidence that its failure was a cause in fact of the occurrence; that is, there was no evidence that had it so trained Lundry, the occurrence would have been avoided. We agree. Assuming there was evidence that Lundry was not trained regarding the blind spot, there was no evidence that if he had received such training the occurrence would not have happened. Thus, there was no evidence that the alleged absence of training by JBS as to the blind spot in front of the truck proximately caused the occurrence. That part of the judgment based on the finding that JBS's direct negligence was a proximate cause of the occurrence is reversed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    In light of the foregoing, we need not and do not reach JBS's contention that its direct liability should not have been submitted to the jury because JBS did not contest its vicarious liability for Lundry's actions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals. We render judgment that the family take nothing against JBS on the direct negligence claim. We remand the claims against Lundry and those against JBS based on respondeat superior to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Justice Lehrmann and Justice Boyd did not participate in the decision.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
