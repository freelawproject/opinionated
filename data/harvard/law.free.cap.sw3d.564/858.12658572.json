Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A jury found Appellant Raymond Lumsden guilty of aggravated sexual assault of a child, indecency with a child, and criminal solicitation of a minor and assessed his punishment at confinement for life for each offense, and the trial court ordered the three life sentences to run consecutively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2015.031\">\n    Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 15.031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 21.11, 22.021 (West Supp. 2018) (setting forth elements of the offenses of criminal solicitation of a minor, indecency with a child, and aggravated sexual assault of a child, respectively). In fourteen issues, Lumsden appeals his convictions and sentences. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Victim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Allison,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   who was almost nine years old at the time of the trial, testified that after her mother Kelly started dating Lumsden, they moved in with him. Allison had her own room at Lumsden's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the night in question, Kelly went to bed early because she was not feeling well. Allison's brother David had also gone to bed. Allison stayed up late watching television with Lumsden. At one point, she went upstairs to grab a blanket and a pillow because she was really sleepy. She laid down beside Lumsden, who was sitting on the couch watching television. While Allison\n   was laying on her back on the couch, Lumsden put his pointer finger under her purple and pink monkey pajamas and under her panties and touched her \"privates.\" Allison said that Lumsden touched the outside of her private that she used to pee and that his pointer finger stayed still, which made her \"[a] little uncomfortable.\" Lumsden touched the inside of the part that Allison used to poop. Allison testified that Lumsden wanted her to touch \"the thing he went pee with,\" but she said no. Allison became hungry and asked for red Jell-O, which Lumsden allowed her to have. Afterwards, Lumsden went to bed, and she slept on the couch because she was too tired to go upstairs to her room. Allison testified that the time on the clock reflected that it was midnight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The next morning, after Kelly came downstairs and woke up Allison, Allison told her that Lumsden had touched her privates. Kelly then took Allison to the police station, and from there, the police escorted Kelly and Allison to the hospital. Allison told a nurse what Lumsden had done to her and underwent a physical exam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following day, Allison recounted the touching to a forensic interviewer at the Children's Advocacy Center. Allison thereafter began seeing a counselor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Victim's Mother\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Kelly, who was divorced from Allison's father, testified that she moved in with Lumsden in November 2014. On the evening of March 10, 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kelly had a kidney infection, took a muscle relaxer, and went to bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When Kelly went downstairs the next morning, she found Allison asleep on the couch. Kelly testified that finding Allison on the couch was unusual because she had her own bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Kelly sat down next to Allison on the couch, rubbed her back, and told her that it was time to wake up. Kelly said that Allison opened her eyes \"really big\" like she was \"startled almost,\" looked at Kelly, and said she was really tired. Kelly asked Allison why she was tired, and she said, \"Ray and I had a lot of fun last night.\" When Kelly asked what they did, Allison replied that it was a secret. Kelly told Allison that she was not to keep secrets from her. Allison said that she could tell Kelly one thing-that she and Lumsden had eaten Jell-O and cookies even though Allison knew that Kelly did not like her to have sugar at night. Kelly told her that it was sometimes okay to have sugar at night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Kelly asked what Allison and Lumsden had done. At that point, Allison's demeanor completely changed. Kelly explained that Allison \"tightened up. She looked down. She looked scared. Something was wrong.\" Kelly testified that she had never seen Allison act like that. Allison said that she could not tell Kelly the other secret because Lumsden had told her \"never ever to tell\" and that Kelly would be mad. Kelly then asked Allison, \"Did he touch you?\" Allison said, \"Yes, in two places,\" and she held up her fingers. Allison told Kelly that Lumsden had touched her \"privates\" and her bum, and she pointed down whenever she said privates. Kelly asked Allison whether Lumsden had touched her inside or outside her panties, and she said inside. Allison told Kelly that Lumsden had inserted his finger inside her privates and her bum, that he asked her if she liked it, that she said no, and that he said that was\n   what mommy likes. Kelly told Allison, \"Baby, you know that wasn't right. You know that was wrong. Right?\" Allison said, \"[Y]eah.\" Kelly asked Allison if she had touched Lumsden, and Allison replied, \"He asked me if I wanted to, but I said no.\" Kelly picked up Allison and told her that she was proud of her for telling her what had happened and that they were going to talk to some other adults they could trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Once they were in the car, Kelly called 911, and the 911 operator guided her to the sheriff's office. Kelly spoke briefly to two police officers at the Denton County Sheriff's Office. Then, she followed a police officer to the hospital. Kelly testified that she was in the room when a sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) examined Allison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   While they were at the hospital, Kelly received text messages from Lumsden. She \"was really angry\" and sent him a text that asked how he could have done this. Lumsden \"was really mad\" and responded that Allison had blamed her grandpa\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and her father\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   for \"the same things,\" that she could not be trusted, and that she needed help. Kelly testified that Allison had never told her that her grandpa or her father had touched her inappropriately and that she (Kelly) did not believe Lumsden's texts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The following day, Allison's father took her to the Children's Advocacy Center, and Kelly met them there. Kelly moved out of Lumsden's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Victim's Half-Brother\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Kelly's son David testified that his mother had previously dated Lumsden, and David identified Lumsden in the courtroom. David said that on the night in question, he was at Lumsden's house with Kelly, Lumsden, and Allison. David testified that he had school the next day but that Allison did not because she attended school in a different school district. David recalled that Lumsden had given Kelly some medicine because she was not feeling well and that she went to bed. David testified that he, Allison, and Lumsden had watched television for a while but that he had gone to bed about 9:30. David heard Lumsden tell Allison that she could stay up as long as she wanted because she did not have school the next day. When David went to bed, Allison and Lumsden were sitting next to each other on the couch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The next morning when David went downstairs to eat breakfast, he saw Allison sleeping on the couch with a blanket over her. When he left for school, Allison was still asleep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   While David was at school, the receptionist notified him that his mom was going to be late because she was at the hospital. When Kelly eventually picked up David, they went to Lumsden's house, and he packed a bag. After they left, Kelly received a call, and they returned to Lumsden's house, which had police cars everywhere. David said that they went to a shelter that night. David did not recall Allison ever telling him about her grandpa or her father touching her inappropriately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Denton County Sheriff Deputies Gilberto Velo and Maurice Floyd (the deputies)\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Deputy Gilberto Velo with the Denton County Sheriff's Office testified that he and Deputy Maurice Floyd were dispatched to the patrol office on the morning of March 10, 2015, in response to a sexual assault call report. The deputies spoke with Kelly, who appeared to be shocked and in disbelief as she was talking. Deputy Velo said that Kelly teared up as she explained what Allison had told her had occurred the night before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Deputy Floyd recalled that Kelly\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   began to unfold to us verbally what her daughter stated to her about secrets, plural, and her comment as I recall, she says, well, honey, you know, momma has always told you we don't keep secrets. And then her mother said, well, I need to know what those secrets are. And from what I call -- recall, she stated that her daughter stated to her that the secrets involved Jell[-O], that she would be rewarded, so to speak, Jell[-O] for, number one, keeping quiet about what the secret was about and then, number two, the mother began to elaborate on the fact that she had been touched in a -- her private area and that she wasn't -- she had been told, now, don't tell anybody. Don't say anything to mommy about this because basically momma does -- does this too to me, that being the actor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Neither Deputy Velo nor Deputy Floyd interviewed Allison that day. Allison was not in the room while the deputies spoke with Kelly. Afterwards, Deputy Floyd spoke with one of the investigators, who advised him that Allison needed to be seen by a SANE at Denton Regional Medical Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Kelly and Allison then followed the deputies to Denton Regional Medical Center. The deputies contacted Child Protective Services to make them aware of the report they had taken. Once the investigators arrived at the hospital, the deputies left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Investigator John Schofield\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   John Schofield, an investigator with the Denton County Sheriff's Office, testified that he went to Denton Regional Medical Center on March 10, 2015, and obtained a box from a SANE and placed it in evidence at the sheriff's office. Later that evening, Schofield assisted warrant deputies by watching for Lumsden's vehicle because a warrant had been issued for his arrest. Schofield spotted the vehicle and went toward the area where Lumsden's residence was located but was alerted that he had been arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    F. The SANE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Nurse Julie Carriker, a registered nurse who worked part-time as a SANE for Denton County, testified that when she spoke with Allison at Denton Regional Medical Center, the first thing she asked her was if\n   she knew why she was there. Nurse Carriker testified that Allison told her the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   So she told me that Ray touched her private part or her privates. She said that he did it all the time. She said that she didn't know why, but that it had happened again the previous night. And she told me that she was in the living room, that he had turned the TV off[,] and [that] he [had] touched her kidney parts was what she called it. And so I said, can you point to where that is? And she pointed to her vaginal area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Then she said the second time that he touched her, he touched her butt[,] and he put his hands in her pajamas. And she would say that he swirled his hand around, and she said[,] \"Here,\" and then she pointed again to that -- to the vaginal area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   She said that he kept pushing his finger into her butt and that he always swirled it around and it hurt her. She also said that he touched his pee part, and she pointed to the area -- the groin area. And she said he was swirling his pee part around playing with it. She mentioned that he kissed her on the lips, and she said that he does it all the time and that he wanted her to touch his private parts but she said no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   After obtaining Allison's history, Nurse Carriker performed a head-to-toe exam of Allison, looking for any signs of trauma. Nurse Carriker testified that she performed Allison's physical exam at 2:00 p.m. on March 11, 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   which was approximately fourteen hours after the incident. Nurse Carriker explained that during the exam, she noted \"generalized redness\" that covered Allison's vaginal area and a tear or a cut \"barely inside the anal opening at about 7:00.\" Nurse Carriker testified that the redness on Allison's vagina was consistent with Allison's statement that Lumsden had put his finger there and had swirled it around. Nurse Carriker documented in her report that Allison's anus dilated quickly, and she explained that she sees that \"in abuse cases.\" Nurse Carriker testified that the tear in Allison's anus was consistent with Allison's statement that Lumsden had inserted his finger in her bottom. Allison told Nurse Carriker that the tear in her anus bothered her. Nurse Carriker swabbed Allison's mouth, vagina, anus, and fingernail area and combed through her hair to collect biological evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    G. The Forensic Interviewer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Priscilla Alvarado, who serves as a family services coordinator at the Children's Advocacy Center for Denton County, testified that during her forensic interview with Allison on March 11, 2015, she said that her mom's boyfriend Lumsden had \"done this to her.\" Alvarado testified that Allison provided sensory details and peripheral details when she explained what had happened to her. The video of the forensic interview was played for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   During the forensic interview, Allison said that she was seven years old and that she was there because \"my friend Ray [whom she identified as her mother's boyfriend] keeps touching my privates, and I don't know why.\" Allison told Alvarado that Lumsden had touched her more than one time, that she could not remember the first time, but that it had occurred when she was seven years old. Allison later told Alvarado that Lumsden had touched her four times, that one time he only touched her pee part, and that the other times \"were kind of like the same thing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Allison told Alvarado about a recent touching. Allison said that after she took a bath, she went downstairs to be with Lumsden. She said that she was wearing her Monkey Junior pajamas and rainbow panties and that Lumsden was wearing a dark blue shirt and gray pants. After her half-brother David went to bed, she went upstairs to grab toys and a pillow so that she could sleep on the couch. Allison said that Lumsden was sitting at the very end of the couch and that she was laying on him on her back \"to get really cozy.\" Allison explained that it was midnight and that Lumsden touched her \"privates,\" which she explained was her term for the body parts that she used to go to the bathroom. Allison said that Lumsden touched her under her clothes with his fingers and that he was \"wobbling\" and kept \"wiggling\" his fingers. Allison told Alvarado that Lumsden had put his finger in her butt \"really, really deep\" and that it had made her feel \"weird\" and \"disgusting\" and \"embarrassed.\" Allison said that she told Lumsden to stop. Allison said that Lumsden asked her to touch his pee part, but she told him no. Allison told Alvarado that Lumsden \"tells me he always touches [Mom's] butt and pee spot.\" Allison said that Lumsden also told her not to tell anyone and specifically not to tell her mother. Lumsden then gave her red Jell-O, which she said was her favorite. Allison told Alvarado that this kind of touching had not happened with anyone else before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    H. Lumsden's Son's Friend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Elliott, who was in eighth grade, testified that he was friends with Lumsden's son John. After Lumsden bonded out of jail on these offenses, Elliott received a call from a man named Troy who lived at Lumsden's house and was allegedly John's uncle. Troy told Elliott to tell John that \"if they ever asked questions,\" he should say that when Allison was in the kitchen doing cartwheels, her \"grandpa was doing stuff that he shouldn't have been doing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Investigator Ashleigh Berg\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Ashleigh Berg, an investigator with the Denton County Sheriff's Office, testified that she went to Lumsden's residence on March 10, 2015, to execute a search warrant. Berg found blankets and a pillow on the couch, which looked like it \"was made up into a bed,\" and were consistent with Allison's statement. Berg also found an empty serving cup of Jell-O on the top of the trash can in the pantry in the kitchen and the pull-off lid was on the countertop in the kitchen, which she testified was consistent with Allison's statement. Berg photographed the Jell-O container and the couch. Lumsden was at the residence during the search and gave Berg permission to take photographs of text messages on his phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    J. Investigator Marco Deleon\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Marco Deleon, who previously worked in criminal investigations with the Denton County Sheriff's Office, testified that on March 10, 2015, he met with Kelly when she brought Allison to the sheriff's office. Deleon described Kelly as \"very distraught, very self-blaming.\" After hearing Kelly describe what had happened to Allison, Deleon made the decision that they should move forward immediately with a sexual assault exam by a SANE at the hospital because he estimated that only twelve to fourteen hours had passed since the alleged sexual assault had occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Deleon testified that afterwards, he met with Nurse Carriker and reviewed her report, which indicated that Allison had a tear in her anus that was consistent with a fingernail; that her anus dilated very quickly, indicating that it had been recently penetrated; and that she had redness in\n   her vaginal area. Based on Nurse Carriker's findings during Allison's physical exam, Deleon obtained an arrest warrant for Lumsden, which was executed at his residence when he arrived home from work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Upon arrest, Lumsden wanted Deleon to look at the text messages between him and Kelly. Deleon described Lumsden's text messages to Kelly as setting the stage to show that someone else was responsible for the sexual assault of Allison. During the search of Lumsden's residence, Lumsden pointed out some legal paperwork that he felt was relevant to show that he was not responsible. Deleon collected the paperwork but did not find Lumsden's defense to be valid. Deleon testified that when he looked into Lumsden's statements that Allison's grandpa or her father had inappropriately touched her, Deleon found that Lumsden was the root of those statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Deleon testified that the day following Lumsden's arrest, he (Deleon) watched Allison's forensic interview from a room that was adjoined to the interview room. Deleon said that Allison provided \"a lot of details\" that they did not know when they executed the search warrant on Lumsden's home. Deleon said that Allison described the clothing she had on during the sexual assault-monkey pajamas and rainbow panties-and the color of the pants and shirt that Lumsden had been wearing. Deleon said that Allison described laying on the sofa with Lumsden and getting cozy with him before the sexual assault occurred. Deleon testified that the statements Allison made during the forensic interview were corroborated by the evidence found at Lumsden's residence and by the findings of the sexual assault examination. Deleon took buccal swabs of Lumsden's mouth to obtain his DNA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Deleon spoke with Kelly again after Allison's forensic interview. Kelly told Deleon about the background of Lumsden's relationship toward children, which reflected preplanning and grooming. Kelly also gave Deleon a box of items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   During the investigation, Kelly told Deleon that she was concerned about a blog called Topics that discussed Kelly and Allison and mentioned paying Kelly some money to make the case go away and to prevent Allison from having to testify in court. Deleon traced several of the usernames that posted about Kelly and Allison and built up Lumsden's character back to a single source-Lumsden's cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Also during the investigation, Deleon was made aware that people were receiving phone calls that were trying to interfere with the investigation. Troy told Deleon that Lumsden was using his (Troy's) name and calling people. Troy was ultimately ruled out as the person who was making the phone calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    K. Lumsden's Son\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   John, who is Lumsden's son, testified that he was not at his dad's house when the events at issue transpired. John said that Allison never told him anything about her grandpa or her father touching her inappropriately. John testified that Allison never touched him inappropriately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    L. Forensic DNA Analyst\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Christina Capt, who is a technical leader and a forensic DNA analyst with the University of North Texas Center for Human Identification, testified that the vaginal swabs that had been taken from Allison were used to develop an unknown Y STR profile. The buccal swabs from Lumsden were used to develop a known Y STR profile. Capt explained that the profile developed for Lumsden was compared to the profile from Allison's vaginal swab, and \"at\n   all nine locations where we obtained data for the vaginal swab, there was an exact match with the alleles detected in Raymond Lumsden's profile.\" Capt testified that she was thus not able to exclude Lumsden from being a contributor to the unknown Y STR profile found in Allison's vaginal swabs. Capt further testified that six out of 10,000 people would have the same nine markers that were located in this case and that no other male contributors were detected on any of the items that were tested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    M. Lumsden\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Lumsden took the stand during the defense's case in chief. Lumsden testified that when he was sixteen years old, he was convicted of fifth-degree burglary in Minnesota and was sentenced to adult prison. While Lumsden was in prison, he saw Troy, whom he had seen before at family get-togethers and understood that he was a relative. Lumsden later learned from his mother that Troy was a cousin on his father's side.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lumsden said that Troy protected him while he was in prison. Because Lumsden felt a debt of gratitude toward Troy, Lumsden housed and fed him once they were released from prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Lumsden testified that due to the kids being home for spring break and Kelly being sick, he had asked Troy to come help out with his kids. Lumsden said that on the night in question, Kelly was in bed when he came home from work, Allison was watching television, and David was playing video games. Lumsden testified that he gave Allison red Jell-O between 8:00 and 9:00 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Lumsden went upstairs and put on a pair of gray sweatpants and a blue shirt. Lumsden said that when he came downstairs, he finished some work and then sat on the couch and watched television with Allison. Lumsden testified that David went to bed about 10:15 p.m. and that he went to bed around 10:30 p.m. after locking the front door and setting the alarm. Lumsden agreed that he was alone on the couch with Allison for a period of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Lumsden said that when he went upstairs to go to bed, Allison was already asleep on the couch. He woke up Kelly and told her that Allison was sleeping on the couch downstairs, and Kelly said that Allison was supposed to be sleeping in her own room. Lumsden said that Kelly went downstairs and dealt with Allison around 10:45 or 11:00 p.m. Lumsden testified that he did not go downstairs in the middle of the night and assault Allison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   When Lumsden went downstairs the next morning, Allison was sitting on the couch eating cereal that David had prepared for her. Lumsden said that he and Kelly had a very explosive fight that morning and that Allison was crying when he left for work. When Kelly sent Lumsden text messages later that morning accusing him of sexually assaulting Allison, he knew that he had not sexually assaulted Allison and told Kelly that she needed to look at Allison's grandpa and father as possible suspects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Lumsden also considered the possibility that Troy could have been a suspect but did not know if he would do something like that. Lumsden said that Troy had a set of keys to the house and had previously stayed in the room that Allison used as her bedroom. Lumsden testified that it was possible that Troy came in the middle of the night, tried to sleep on the couch, assaulted Allison, and then left. Lumsden\n   testified that the only thing Allison had ever said about Troy was that he had tickled her; Lumsden had never heard any allegations about Troy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Lumsden admitted that he could not explain the DNA evidence. Lumsden testified that his son John did not sexually assault Allison and that none of his other patrilineal relatives were in his home on the night in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Lumsden gave a statement to Deleon when he was arrested. When confronted with the statement he gave at that time, which said that Kelly was sick downstairs with Allison and David when he got home from work around 9:00 p.m., Lumsden said it was possible that he had previously said that. Lumsden did not recall telling Deleon that Kelly went to bed fifteen minutes before Lumsden went to bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Lumsden recalled that he had given a statement to someone at Child Protective Services. The prosecutor recounted that Lumsden had told CPS that Kelly was in bed when he got home at 9:00; that she got out of bed, ate, and was groggy; that he and David went to bed; and that Allison was downstairs on the couch. Lumsden testified that was the exact same thing that he had told Deleon, except the fact that she got up and ate. Lumsden testified that he did not really know what he had told Deleon because he had guns pointed at his face, but he recalled telling Deleon specifically that Kelly was in bed when he got home and that she had been in bed all day because she was sick and taking pills that had been prescribed to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   When confronted with the letter that he had written to his ex-wife Lindsey, whom he had told that he and David had gone upstairs together at 10:30 p.m. on the night in question, Lumsden explained that there was maybe a fifteen-minute gap between the time that he and David went to bed that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Lumsden agreed that in the statements he had made to Deleon, the CPS worker, and Lindsey, he had said that at some point, there was a room full of people-including John, David, Elliott, and Kelly-and that Allison had made allegations against her grandpa and her father. When confronted with David, Elliott, and John's trial testimony that Allison had never made that allegation, Lumsden said that maybe they did not hear her say it or did not remember that she had said it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   On cross-examination, Lumsden did not contest the fact that Allison had been sexually assaulted on or about March 10, 2015; that the only people in his home on the night in question were Kelly, Allison, David, and Lumsden; and that there was no testimony that Troy was anywhere near Lumsden's home on the night in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    N.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Here, eliminating Allison's testimony from consideration, we conclude that the State presented other evidence that tends to connect Lumsden with the offense of criminal solicitation of a minor. Kelly noted unusual behavior and a change in Allison's demeanor when she awoke her the morning after the sexual assault. Kelly testified that when she asked Allison if she had touched Lumsden, Allison replied, \"He\n   asked me if I wanted to, but I said no.\" Similarly, Nurse Carriker testified that Allison told her that Lumsden wanted her to touch his private parts, but she said no. And during the forensic interview, Allison said that Lumsden had asked her to touch his pee part, but she told him no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Additionally, Lumsden's description of what he was wearing on the night in question matched the description that Allison had given during her forensic interview. Lumsden admitted that he had given Allison red Jell-O, and the search of Lumsden's residence revealed an empty single-serving carton of Jell-O in the trash, as well as a pillow and a blanket on the couch where Allison had slept. Lumsden's testimony, as well as David's testimony, demonstrated that there was a period of time when Lumsden was alone with Allison on the couch after David went to bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   As the sole judge of the weight and credibility of the evidence, the jury had before it testimony from multiple individuals that Lumsden was not truthful; similarly, the jury had before it evidence that Allison was credible because her allegations of penetration by Lumsden had been corroborated with physical findings during the sexual assault examination and DNA evidence. Moreover, the testimony from Kelly, Nurse Carriker, David, Lumsden, and the investigators who searched Lumsden's residence, as well as the video of the forensic interview, tends to connect Lumsden with criminal solicitation of Allison, who was a minor. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we hold that a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Lumsden solicited Allison, a minor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

What the Record Shows\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The trial court held a pretrial hearing on Lumsden's motion to suppress evidence alleged as DNA. The trial court asked for clarification on the basis for Lumsden's motion, and he agreed that he was arguing under rule 403 that the DNA evidence would be unfairly prejudicial to him because \"it identifies Mr. Lumsden and any of his male heirs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Capt, the State's DNA expert who testified at trial, also testified at the pretrial hearing. Capt testified that the swabs taken from Allison had been compared to the DNA samples from Lumsden for Y chromosome STR markers and that nine of seventeen alleles were found. Capt recognized that those nine alleles would also match Lumsden's male heirs. Capt testified that using the DNA printout scale, evidence of only one male was detected in Allison's sample. On cross-examination, Capt testified that 0.06% of the population would share the Y STR markers in their partrilineal lineage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The trial court stated its conclusion on the record:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   In regards to the objection under 403, while I understand that certainly it could be a valid argument that there's someone else in Mr. Lumsden's line or his heirs on his male side, I do believe that that would be proper cross-examination or proper argument. But in regards to whether or not I would exclude the evidence because the probative value substantially is outweighed by the danger from any type of unfair prejudice or confusing the issues or anything of that nature, I can't find that it would violate 403 and would simply overrule the grounds based upon that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The trial court also signed an order denying Lumsden's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Considering the first factor in the 403 analysis, the probative value of the DNA evidence is high. Lumsden's defensive theory at trial was that because Allison was asleep and because it was dark, she did not see her attacker, whom he\n   claimed was Troy. Because Allison described being alone with Lumsden, her credibility was central to the State's case. The DNA evidence-showing that the DNA found in the swab from Lumsden matched nine of seventeen alleles in Allison's vaginal swab and that only one male was detected as the contributor for the Y STR in Allison's vaginal swab-corroborated Allison's testimony and was therefore probative of Lumsden's guilt. Lumsden's argument-that the probative value of the DNA evidence is minimal because it could not be positively matched only to Lumsden but could match with any male in his patrilineal lineage-is not persuasive; the evidence showed that no other male relative of Lumsden's was in the house on the night in question and that Lumsden affirmatively testified that his son John did not sexually assault Allison. The probative value of the DNA evidence was therefore anything but minimal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   With regard to the second factor, although the DNA evidence in this case is certainly prejudicial, it is not unfairly prejudicial because it provides circumstantial proof of at least one of the charged offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dossett v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8320989\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/216/7/#p22\">\n    216 S.W.3d 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 22 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2006, pet. ref'd) (\"The prejudicial nature of the DNA evidence was no higher than other inculpatory scientific evidence[ ] and was not\n   <em>\n    unfairly\n   </em>\n   prejudicial.\"). Under these circumstances, the DNA evidence presented was not such that it would tempt the jury to come to irrational conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The third factor-the time needed to develop the evidence-does not weigh in favor of Lumsden. The trial transcript demonstrates that Capt's testimony, including cross-examination by Lumsden, spanned only thirty-one pages of the over 600 pages of the guilt-innocence phase of the trial. In its opening statement, the State briefly mentioned that the SANE had obtained vaginal and anal swabs from Allison and later told the jury that Capt would testify that \"she cannot exclude Ray Lumsden or any patrilineal relatives, meaning Ray Lumsden or his dad or his son.\" Lumsden argues on appeal that the State did not qualify its argument in rebuttal to say that the DNA belonged to Lumsden \"or ... a patrilineal relative\" but instead stated that the DNA belonged to Lumsden. Lumsden did not object to that statement, nor would an objection have been sustained because it was a proper summation of what the evidence at trial had shown-that Lumsden's son John did not commit the sexual assault of Allison and that no patrilineal relative of Lumsden's was in the home on the night in question. Moreover, because the DNA evidence linked Lumsden to Allison in a manner consistent with her testimony, the jury would not have been distracted from the indicted offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   With regard to the final factor-the State's need for the evidence-the court of criminal appeals has held that a proponent's need for evidence is great when there is a disputed issue and the proponent has no other evidence to prove the fact at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manning v.

The trial court approved $3,000 for the services of experts without prejudice to additional requests if necessary. Although Lumsden filed motions after this requesting funds for investigators, he did not file any other written motions requesting funds for expert witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   At the pretrial hearing on September 2, 2016, Lumsden made an oral request for the trial court to grant an additional $1,500 for a DNA expert to travel from California to be present at the trial. When the trial court inquired whether there were any experts that Lumsden could hire from Texas to avoid an additional out-of-state fee, Lumsden's counsel responded that there were \"plenty of experts I could have\n   hired\" but that Lumsden had \"specifically demanded that we hire this specific expert from California.\" The trial court stated that it was not going to make a dispositive ruling on Lumsden's oral motion but would take the matter under advisement. The record does not show that the trial court ever ruled on Lumsden's oral request for expert funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The clerk's record contains a handwritten letter addressed to the judge and dated September 14, 2016,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   but filed September 23, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the letter, Lumsden states that his attorney \"refuses to enter the DNA report of our court[-]approved expert, and he failed to have her here to testify....

Both Allison and Kelly testified during the outcry hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Allison testified that her mother, who is over the age of eighteen, was the first person she told. Allison explained that when her mother came in to wake her up the morning after the incident, she told her mother that she and Lumsden had spent some time together the night before and that something was wrong. Allison said that her mother then asked if Lumsden had touched her privates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Kelly testified at the hearing that on the night of the incident, she had a kidney infection, took a muscle relaxer, and went to bed early. When Kelly went downstairs the next morning, she saw that Allison was asleep on the couch, which was unusual because she never slept on the couch. Kelly woke up Allison and asked her if she felt okay. Allison said that she was really tired because she and Lumsden had stayed up really late the previous night and had a lot of fun. Kelly asked Allison what she and Lumsden had done the night before, and Allison said that it was a secret.

She wasn't acting normal.\" Kelly asked Allison what the secret was and promised her that she would not be mad. Allison said that Lumsden had told her that she could never tell Kelly because she would be really mad. Kelly testified that Allison had a look on her face that she had never seen before. Because Kelly had \"a really bad gut feeling that something was really wrong,\" she asked Allison if Lumsden had touched her. In response, Allison held up two fingers and said, \"Two places.\" Allison pointed to her private areas and said, \"My privates and my bum.\" Kelly asked whether the touching was on the inside or the outside of Allison's panties, and Allison said the inside.

Allison's response provided the details about where and how Lumsden had touched her.

Nurse Carriker testified that she had performed a sexual assault examination on seven-year-old Allison at Denton Regional Medical Center. When Nurse Carriker asked Allison why she was at the hospital, Allison said that she was there because Lumsden had touched her privates. Allison said that Lumsden \"always [did] it,\" that she did not know why, and that it had happened the previous night. Allison told Nurse Carriker that Lumsden had touched her \"kidney parts,\" and she pointed to her vaginal area. Allison said that Lumsden had also touched her butt and had put his hands in her pajamas and had \"swirled his hand around\"; during this explanation, Allison kept pointing to her vaginal area. Allison continued by telling Nurse Carriker that Lumsden had\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   kept pushing his finger into her butt and swirling his hand around, and she said it did hurt and that he touched his -- his pee part is what she called it and then she said swirling it around and playing with it. And then he kissed her on the lips and that he always does that and that he tried to get her to touch his private part but she said no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   On cross-examination, Lumsden asked Nurse Carriker if Allison had told her \"when [she] came into the room\" that she had come to see a doctor for an injury or for being hurt or sick, and Nurse Carriker said, \"Not at that time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, Lumsden objected to Nurse Carriker's testimony as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n   [Nurse] Carriker did not have any conversations with [Kelly], the child's mother, saying she's injured, she's hurt, we're seeking medical attention from you, which is what you would do if you were seeking a medical diagnosis or medical treatment. So we would argue that outcry does not come under any medical treatment hearsay exception. It does not come under any first person that's -- she -- this child has made an outcry to because the very reason she's there is law enforcement purposes, Your Honor. This child, by her own words, was not asking for treatment for being hurt or injured or being sick. She was only there at the direction of the police and her mother, and her mother did not tell [Nurse] Carriker that she was seeking her medical attention. It was all an act of the law enforcement, their search for evidence, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n   And for that reason and all of those reasons, [Nurse] Carriker's testimony on outcry or any medical opinions should be suppressed, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   After the State set forth its argument for admission of Nurse Carriker's testimony as an outcry statement and Lumsden responded, the trial court ruled that Nurse Carriker could testify as an outcry witness and postponed its ruling on Lumsden's hearsay objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   When Nurse Carriker testified before the jury, she said that her normal practice was to ask a child if she knew why she was there or if there was something that had happened to her that she was there to discuss or to talk about. When Nurse Carriker started the sexual assault examination of Allison, she was alone in the exam room with Allison because \"a lot of times [children are] more open with us when there is not a parent in the room.\" Nurse Carriker testified that the first thing she did with Allison was obtain a history to help her know where to look for injuries and to help diagnose any medical condition that she may have had. Nurse Carriker described Allison's demeanor during the interview as \"very matter of fact\" and said\n   that she had good eye contact and spoke very clearly. When the State asked Nurse Carriker what Allison had told her, Lumsden made a general hearsay objection. The trial court overruled Lumsden's objection. Lumsden did not request a running objection. Nurse Carriker thereafter testified regarding what Allison had told her and explained the findings she had made during her head-to-toe physical examination of Allison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Lumsden argues that the medical-diagnosis-or-treatment exception to the hearsay rule was inapplicable to Nurse Carriker's testimony because Allison was unaware she was seeking a medical diagnosis and because there is no evidence that Allison understood the importance of being truthful with Nurse Carriker. Lumsden, however, made only a general hearsay objection when the State asked Nurse Carriker what Allison said had happened to her. Because Lumsden had not previously obtained a ruling on his hearsay objection to Nurse Carriker's testimony, it was incumbent on him to repeat his specific objection when she testified at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Geuder v.

The statements at issue were made by a victim to a SANE during the context of a sexual assault examination at a hospital. Nurse Carriker interviewed Allison away from her mother, thus implicitly determining that Allison was sufficiently mature to be interviewed outside her mother's presence.

Additionally, the record reflects that Allison knew that she was talking to a nurse and was able to answer Nurse Carriker's question regarding why she was there-because Lumsden had touched her privates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swofford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%207019762\">\n    2015 WL 7019762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (holding that trial court could have reasonably inferred from the record that victim was aware her statements were made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment because when nurse asked why she was there, victim stated, \"My daddy made me suck his private part to make it bigger\"). Moreover, Allison told Nurse Carriker about being hurt or injured\n   when she informed Nurse Carriker that the tear in her anus bothered her. Although no specific inquiry was made in this case to determine whether Allison appreciated the need to be truthful in her statements to Nurse Carriker, the circumstances under which Nurse Carriker examined Allison are circumstances that the trial court could have reasonably viewed as indicating that Allison would have known that she needed to be truthful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beheler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11554496\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/3/182/#p188\">\n    3 S.W.3d at 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding record supported conclusion that victim appreciated the need to be truthful in her statements to nurse).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   After reviewing the entire record, we conclude that because the record demonstrates that Allison was a child of a sufficient age and apparent maturity and that she understood that she was at the hospital because of the sexual assault, she understood the need to be truthful during the sexual assault examination.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11554496\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/3/182/#p188\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (holding evidence sufficient to support finding that seven-year-old child understood need for veracity in sexual assault examination after process was explained and child was interviewed alone, appeared calm and quiet, and knew why she was there);\n   <em>\n    San German-Reyes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202229873\">\n    2017 WL 2229873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (holding, even without a fully developed record of the conversation between nurse and victim, that victim was a child of sufficient age and maturity, that she was there because of a sexual assault, and that she understood the need to be truthful).

Judge, I believe he has opened the door for us to get in a prior consistent statement to rebut a recent fabrication. Because he went down the line of questioning, especially with Deputy Floyd, that isn't it true that if you ask a child leading questions then this, which opens the door and leaves the impression to the jury that since, I guess, leading questions were asked that it's possible that she was fabricating her story.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-206\">\n   I have a case.

In order to get in a prior consistent statement, there are four things that the Court must look at....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-207\">\n   It also states that there [are] minimal foundation requirements of an implied or express charge of fabrication, so just any -- any kind of implication that we have suggested or any kind of leading -- leading questions have suggested that -- that has tampered with her statement or that it's made her -- her statements different than what it was at the time, that will allow the Court to let the forensic interview in....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   The trial court asked Lumsden what his specific objection was to the forensic interview, and he replied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n   One objection is hearsay. The other one is we have not opened the door. The only question we asked the mother was she asked her a yes or no question. That was really the only thing that was asked, whether she was led with any questions or not. The question that -- to Officer Floyd was a generalization of when he's working with children that sometimes you need to -- is if he's -- if the child is asked leading questions, it can lead to unreliable responses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   [THE PROSECUTOR]: Which that's my point exactly, that he's left the impression with the jury that her responses are unreliable as they were in court today is what he's saying, so that is a recent fabrication. It is implied, if not direct. As that case states, it's -- a minimal foundation has to be laid that there's any impression in front of the jury that her testimony has been somehow fabricated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-211\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-212\">\n   THE COURT: And so the only prior consistent statement that you're wanting to get into is the statement from the witness that it's not fabricated? Is that what[ ] -- the video is going to purport to say?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-213\">\n   [THE PROSECUTOR]: Right. That -- that her testimony today as to what happened is not a fabrication because she told the jury what happened, but it left in the mind of the jury that someone asking leading questions could have fabricated her answers. And so with that, when I was asking [Allison] questions, you know, as -- as a scared witness, I was somewhat leading her, but I want to show the jury because he left that impression with them that she did have prior consistent statements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-214\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I didn't cross-examine the child witness to leave in any impression that she was fabricating any statement or had an ulterior motive or was put up to it, Your Honor, so, you know, that door would be closed there if I didn't cross-examine the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-215\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n   THE COURT: ... [A]fter reviewing Hammons and just taking a specific look at [ rule] 801, I believe that they're entitled to offer the video by virtue of the line of questioning as to saying that an adult was leading them and it would cause her to give a response. I don't know that there's any way, at least by virtue of the rules, that it should be denied. So if the objection is simply hearsay, I think that I'll overrule that objection[,] and the video can be played as a prior consistent statement of the witness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, unfair prejudice to the Defendant, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-218\">\n   THE COURT: If it's simply a prior consistent statement, I can't find that's a [ rule] 403 violation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Relevant Portion of the Record\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   As set forth in the factual background above, Lumsden testified in his case in chief that he was convicted of fifth-degree burglary in Minnesota when he was sixteen years old and that he served time in prison. Lumsden also testified that he pleaded guilty to felony harassment in 1996 and received twenty years' probation. Lumsden's counsel asked if it was correct that Lumsden went back to prison in Minnesota on the felony harassment case,\n   and Lumsden answered, \"Well, not voluntarily[,] but I went back, yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   Prior to the State's cross-examination of Lumsden, the prosecutor alerted the trial court that she planned on getting into Lumsden's \"other priors. He has opened the door to the fake -- the false identity or the identity theft charges.\" Lumsden's counsel stated, \"That was deferred adjudication. That's not a criminal conviction, Your Honor.\" The prosecutor responded that \"[i]t's not a criminal conviction, but he alluded to the fact that he -- he didn't go back willingly to prison. But that's why he went back. I mean, it's -- it's semi-opened the door to that.\" The trial court overruled Lumsden's objection that going into the \"other priors\" would be unfairly prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   During cross-examination, the State questioned Lumsden as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-245\">\n   Q. (BY [PROSECUTOR] ) So it's your testimony that you don't know why you got sent back to Minnesota?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-246\">\n   A.

I don't know if that's why.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   The State then proceeded to ask Lumsden if he had tampered with government documents, such as birth certificates and Social Security cards, to create false identities for himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   Here, Lumsden's statement on direct-that he did not voluntarily go back to prison-did not give the impression that he was a law-abiding citizen. Instead, his statement implies that he had violated at least one of his probation conditions, which resulted in his return to prison. The relevant questions, the answers themselves, and the overall tenor of the cross-examination did not create a false impression with the jury concerning Lumsden's prior criminal history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prescott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9961345\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/744/128/#p131\">\n    744 S.W.2d at 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, through cross-examination, the State maneuvered its questioning to elicit the answer from Lumsden that he did not know why he was sent back to prison in Minnesota. The State's sole reason then for offering the evidence of Lumsden's tampering with government records was to impeach him under rules 608(b) and 609. But the State conceded that this \"other prior\" was not a final conviction. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing the State to delve into the evidence of tampering with government records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v.

(mem. op., not designated for publication) (holding that trial court abused its discretion by allowing the State to impeach appellant with unadjudicated offenses in violation of rules 608(b) and 609 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   Having found error, we proceed to a harm analysis. Because we determine that the error is not constitutional, rule 44.2(b) is applicable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b). First, the bulk of the testimony and physical evidence that was admitted for the jury's consideration focused on the\n   offenses for which Lumsden was on trial. Second, the record contains ample evidence, as set forth in detail in previous analysis sections, supporting Lumsden's guilt. Third, the character of the alleged error in permitting the State to question Lumsden about tampering with government documents was minor and likely played a small role, if any, in the jury's deliberations. After the State asked Lumsden whether he was sent back to prison for tampering with government documents, the State asked several follow-up questions to ascertain if Lumsden had created false identities for himself and why he had a birth certificate and a Social Security card that were not in his name. The State did not, however, dwell on this other offense. During its closing argument, the State mentioned only the Minnesota conviction that Lumsden received at age sixteen; it did not delve into the charge of tampering with government records or mention his creating false identities. Additionally, the court's charge instructed the jury\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-255\">\n   that if there is any testimony before you in this case regarding the defendant's having committed offenses other than the offense alleged against him in the indictment in this case, you cannot consider said testimony for any purpose unless you find and believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed such other offenses, if any were committed, and even then you may only consider the same in determining the state of mind of the defendant and the child; and the previous and subsequent relationship between the defendant and the child, if any, or the intent of the defendant, if any, in connection with the offense, if any, alleged against him in the indictment in this case, and for no other purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   The court's charge further instructed the jury that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-257\">\n   [a]ll persons are presumed to be innocent and no person may be convicted of any offense unless each element of the offense is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The fact, that a person has been arrested, confined, or indicted for, or otherwise charged with, the offense, gives rise to no inference of guilt at his trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   We conclude that, in the context of the entire case against Lumsden, the trial court's error in permitting the State to question Lumsden about tampering with government records did not have a substantial or injurious effect on the jury's verdict and did not affect Lumsden's substantial rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11898525\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/953/266/#p271\">\n    953 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   271 ;\n   <em>\n    West\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928498\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/169/275/#p278\">\n    169 S.W.3d at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that trial court's error in permitting the State to ask appellant whether he had been arrested more than twenty times did not have a substantial or injurious effect on the jury's verdict and did not affect appellant's substantial rights);\n   <em>\n    Owen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%20966323\">\n    2004 WL 966323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (holding that trial court's error in admitting testimony about appellant's possession of fictitious credit cards and driver's licenses was not harmful).

Admission of State's Exhibit No. 30\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   In his twelfth issue, Lumsden argues that the trial court reversibly erred by admitting State's Exhibit No. 30-a binder of documents. The documents included a voter registration card, a driver's license, a Social Security number, school records, a birth certificate, and a college degree for Raymond Robert Marcucci; a driver's license and a certificate of baptism for Raymond Edward Lumsden; a delayed registration of birth form, a birth certificate, a certificate of baptism, and a Headstart completion certificate for Anthony Ray Marcucci; school records and a delayed registration of birth form for Amanda Marie Marcucci; and a document entitled \"Secrets\n   for Getting a New Identity.\" When the State offered the binder into evidence, Lumsden objected as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-322\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We'd object as to the hearsay nature of the contents, Your Honor, unfairly prejudicial to the Defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-323\">\n   THE COURT: Just to make sure that I'm certain, [Prosecutor], I've heard the identification of a notebook and some in there.

Our review of the exhibit reveals that the exhibit contains at least some evidence that the trial court would not have abused its discretion by admitting. Specifically, the birth certificates constitute public records of vital statistics and thus would have been admissible under the exception to the hearsay rule found in Texas Rule of Evidence 803(9), and the certificates of baptism would have been admissible under the exception to the hearsay rule found in Texas Rule of Evidence 803(12).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.08(a). The principal exception to this rule is found in penal code section 3.03(a), which provides that when a defendant is found guilty at a single trial of more than one offense arising out of the same criminal transaction, the sentences for each offense must run concurrently.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%203.03\">\n    Tex.

But section 3.03(b)(2)(A) creates an exception to this exception; that is, it exempts certain offenses, including indecency with a child and aggravated sexual assault of a child, from the application of section 3.03(a), thus allowing the trial court to order the sentences to run concurrently or consecutively.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%203.03\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3.03(b)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-352\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The trial court heard the State's motion before sentencing Lumsden and granted the motion. When the trial court sentenced Lumsden to life on each of the three counts that he was convicted of, the trial court stated, \"As per the judgment, the sentences will run consecutively.\" The judgment states that \"[t]he sentence imposed under Count II of the indictment shall commence when the sentences imposed in Count I and Count III cease[ ] to operate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-354\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-355\">\n   Lumsden was convicted of two of the offenses enumerated in section 3.03(b)(2)(A) : section 21.11 (indecency with a child, as set forth in Count II) and section 22.011 (aggravated sexual assault of a child, as set forth in Count I). The legislature gave the trial court the discretion to have sentences for these crimes run concurrently or consecutively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nguyen v.
