When counsel fail in their duty by filing briefs which are not in conformity with the applicable rules and do not sufficiently advise the court of the contentions asserted and the merit thereof, the court is left with the dilemma of deciding that case (and possibly establishing precedent for future cases) on the basis of inadequate briefing and advocacy or undertaking additional research and briefing to supply the deficiency.

Appellants' brief meets neither of these requirements. Their two-page statement of facts contains no record citations and recites a purported procedural history that fails to include any facts relevant to the issues on appeal. Standing alone, a violation of Rule 84.04(c) constitutes grounds for dismissal of an appeal.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Washington v.
