(EPEI) appeals the trial court's denial of its plea to the jurisdiction in which EPEI asserts that it is immune from the breach of contract suit filed by Appellee, Amex Properties, LLC (Amex). First, EPEI asserts it is immune from suit as the underlying contract that is a basis of the suit was not \"properly executed\" pursuant to the waiver of immunity. Second, even if immunity is waived, EPEI asserts that the statutory waiver of immunity precludes an award of consequential damages and attorney's fees. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The breach of contract claim underlying this appeal stems from a lease agreement between EPEI and Amex. EPEI, doing business as Burnham Wood Charter School District, operates open-enrollment charter schools chartered by the Texas Education Agency. Vista Del Futuro Charter School is one of the charter schools operated by the school district. In early 2008, Iris Burnham, EPEI's president and superintendent of schools, informed EPEI's board of directors that EPEI was searching for sites for the location of Vista Del Futuro Charter School.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After locating a suitable site in east El Paso, Burnham began negotiating with Silvia Martinez Aguirre, part owner of Amex, to lease the property and construct a building for the operation of the school.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Working with EPEI's board of directors, Burnham reviewed a proposal for entering a lease with Amex and presented the board with the projected multi-year rent schedule and budget for the charter school. The minutes from this meeting state that \"Burnham asked the Board's permission to continue to negotiate a lease with Ms. Martinez,\" which the board granted. To construct the building EPEI desired, Amex had contracted with AbM Construction Co., who had begun the construction process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Burnham and Martinez signed a document titled \"Lease Agreement\" after a series of negotiations, which included their respective attorneys, Jerry Wallace for EPEI and Victor Firth for Amex.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On either of two dates, Friday, April 25, or the following Monday, April 28, Martinez verbally informed the charter school's general administrator, Rebeca Perez, and its realtor, Juan Uribe, that she had signed the written Lease Agreement. An email dated April 25 sent from Attorney Jerry Wallace to Administrator Perez states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The lease agreement needs to be signed by both ms. Burnham on behalf of the charter and ms. Martinez on behalf for [sic] the property owner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Our suggesting [sic] is that you contact. ms. Martinez, inform her that the document has been signed by ms. burnham, and ask her to come by and execute the document. You can also inform her that we have transmitted the document to victor firth for his review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   I'm sure that ms. Martinez will want an original executed and notarized lease instrument, so you should either have ms. burnham and ms. Martinez execute two leases, or simply make a copy of the\n   lease after ms. Martinez has signed it and her signature has been notarized. Either method will work just fine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Thanks,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   jerry\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Lease Agreement contained a recital stating that the document was \"[e]xecuted as of 17 April 2008\" and included Martinez's signature as manager of the landlord of the lease (Amex), and Burnham's signature as president of the tenant of the lease (EPEI). It also contained an Entire Agreement provision which specified that \"[s]ubmission of this Lease for examination does not constitute an option for the Leased Premises and becomes effective as a Lease only upon execution and delivery thereof by Landlord to Tenant.\" In addition, the Authority of Signatories provision of the lease stated: \"Each person executing this Lease [Agreement] individually and personally represents and warrants that he/she is duly authorized to execute and deliver the same on behalf of the entity for which he/she is signing (whether a corporation general or limited partnership or otherwise) and that this Lease [Agreement] is binding upon the entity in accordance with its terms.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Contained within the Lease Agreement were also two notarized certificates of acknowledgement. The first, a certificate acknowledging that Martinez's signature, was signed on April 25 by a notary public stating that Martinez, as \"Manager of Amex,\" appeared and acknowledged that Martinez had executed the Lease Agreement \"for the purposes and considerations therein expressed and on behalf of\" Amex. The second, a certificate acknowledging that Burnham's signature, was signed on April 24 by a notary public stating that Burnham, as \"President\" of EPEI, had appeared and acknowledged that she had executed the Lease Agreement \"for the purposes and considerations therein expressed and on behalf of The El Paso Education Initiative, Inc.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Unaware that Burnham and Martinez had signed the Lease Agreement, Firth continued to negotiate the terms and conditions of the agreement with Wallace until Sunday, April 27. On May 13, Wallace sent Amex notice that the charter school was unequivocally rejecting the Lease Agreement and that it no longer desired to lease any property from Amex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Amex sued EPEI, claiming that EPEI anticipatorily breached the lease and sought actual damages, consequential damages, and attorney's fees. EPEI filed its first plea to the jurisdiction, which the trial court denied as to the breach of contract claim and associated claims for consequential damages and attorney's fees. This Court affirmed the trial court's denial of the plea to the jurisdiction in a previous opinion.\n   <em>\n    El Paso Educ. Initiative, Inc. v.

The Texas Supreme Court denied EPEI's petition for review of that decision on March 29, 2013, and the case resumed in the trial court. EPEI filed a second plea to the jurisdiction, and after Amex amended its petition, filed its third plea to the jurisdiction. The trial court dismissed the tort claims Amex added in its subsequent petitions but again denied the plea to the jurisdiction that challenged the breach of contract suit, claims for consequential damages, and attorney's fees. This second interlocutory appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In this interlocutory appeal, EPEI raises three issues contending that the trial court erred in denying EPEI's plea to the jurisdiction. First, it argues that the trial court erred in denying its plea to the\n   jurisdiction because the purported contract was not \"properly executed\" on behalf of EPEI. Second, it argues that the trial court erred in denying its plea to the jurisdiction as it related to EPEI's claim for consequential damages flowing from the breach of contract claim. Third, it argues that the trial court erred in denying its plea to the jurisdiction as it related to EPEI's claim for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review-Plea to the Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A plea to the jurisdiction is a dilatory plea by which a party challenges the court's authority to determine the subject matter of the action.\n   <em>\n    Harris County v.

EPEI challenges the existence of Amex's jurisdictional facts and argues the evidence controverts Amex's factual allegations that the Lease Agreement was \"properly executed.\" Specifically, EPEI directs us to sections in the Texas Administrative Code to argue that the EPEI board did not pass a delegation amendment to its charter, which would have to be approved by the Commissioner of Education, to bind the charter school to the Lease Agreement. 19 TEX. ADMIN. CODE \u00a7 100.1101(c) (\"[a]n open-enrollment charter must specify the powers or duties of the governing body of the charter holder that the governing body may delegate to an officer ... or any other person.\"). We believe that this argument conflates the issue of whether the contract is binding under the law applicable to the charter school-a question that goes to the merits of the case-with the issue of whether it was \"properly executed\" on EPEI's behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In response, Amex directs us to the provisions in the Lease Agreement that Burnham and Martinez signed, including the certificates of acknowledgement, the email sent from Wallace to Perez, and two other provisions in EPEI's charter to argue that Burnham properly executed the Lease Agreement on behalf of EPEI. The first charter provision Amex directs us to is titled \"Indebtedness of Charter,\" which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Charterholder shall not incur a debt, secure an obligation, extend credit, or otherwise make use of the credit or assets of the charter school for any purpose other than operation of the charter school[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The second charter provision is titled Charter School Facility, and states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Charterholder shall have and maintain throughout the term of the charter a lease agreement, title or other legal instrument granting to Charterholder the right to occupy and use one or more facilities suitable for use as the charter school facilities described by the charter. During any period of dormancy granted by the Board, this requirement may be waived by the Board.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In short, the jurisdictional evidence before us relevant to the issue of proper execution consists of (1) the Lease Agreement; (2) the charter and charter amendments of the charter school; (3) a series of emails sent between parties on both sides around April and May of 2008; (4) the EPEI board minutes from the January 28, April 1, and May 28, 2008 meetings; (5) a deposition of Silvia Martinez; (6) an affidavit from Iris Burnham; and (7) an affidavit from Jerry Wallace. EPEI's charter contains Burnham's signature and a provision stating that the charter holder, Burnham Wood Charter Schools, \"represents that the person signing this contract has been properly delegated authority to do so.\" In addition, the charter contains a provision allowing EPEI to incur financial obligations for operations of the charter school and another provision requiring, with an exception not relevant here, that it maintain a lease during the charter school's term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   By its terms, the Lease Agreement does not contain language requiring board approval for the contract to become effective; it only requires the signature of Iris Burnham, President of EPEI. It states that the person \"executing\" the Lease Agreement \"personally represents and warrants that [she] is duly authorized ... and that this Lease [Agreement] is binding upon the entity in accordance with its terms.\" Additionally, the Lease Agreement states that it \"becomes effective as a Lease only upon execution and delivery thereof by Landlord to Tenant.\" The certificate of acknowledgement is acknowledged and states that \"Iris Burnham, known to me [as] President of The El Paso Education Initiative, Inc., a Texas corporation, and the person whose name is subscribed to the foregoing Lease Agreement, and who acknowledged to me that she executed the instrument for the purposes and considerations therein expressed and\n   <em>\n    on behalf of\n   </em>\n   The El Paso Education Initiative, Inc.\" (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In her affidavit, Burnham does not deny that she signed the lease. Instead, she states that she did not believe that the negotiations with Amex and the school district had resulted in final agreed-upon lease terms. Burnham avers she did not present any lease with Amex Properties to the Board of Directors for board approval. In his affidavit, Wallace states that no \"individual,\" including himself and Burnham, \"had the legal authority to bind\" EPEI to a lease of real property and further states that it was his belief that the negotiations with Amex were unsuccessful. Wallace's email to Perez, however, suggested that Burnham and Martinez were to sign the Lease Agreement on behalf of EPEI and Amex. The board minutes at the April 1 meeting state that \"Burnham asked the Board's permission to continue to negotiate a lease with Ms. Martinez,\" which the board approved, whereas the May 28 minutes state that the negotiations with Martinez where \"unsuccessful.\" Lastly, the parties do not allege that Amex, as\n   landlord, did not \"execute and deliver\" the lease to EPEI, the last step in satisfaction of the Lease Agreement's terms to effectuate the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In sum, viewed in the light most favorable to Amex (as we must), the record shows that (1) EPEI's charter authorizes contracts, such as a lease; (2) the board's minutes purport to indicate that Burnham had at least some authority to enter into the Lease Agreement and that the board members were aware of Burnham's discussions with Amex; and (3) Amex delivered the Lease Agreement to EPEI in satisfaction of the contract's terms to finalize the agreement. Given the jurisdictional evidence presented by the parties, we conclude that the resolution of whether the Lease Agreement was \"properly executed on behalf of\" EPEI is an issue for the fact finder on remand, that EPEI did not satisfy its burden in negating the trial court's jurisdiction over the case, and that the trial court correctly denied EPEI's plea to the jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Thus, we conclude that EPEI's first issue is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    Issue Two: Consequential Damages under Chapter 271\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In its second issue, EPEI argues that even if the Lease Agreement satisfies the fifth requirement that the contract be properly executed on behalf of EPEI within Section 271.152, the trial court erred to the extent it denied the plea as to Amex's claim for consequential damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Applicable Law: Chapter 271 &amp; Consequential Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Section 271.152 provides a limited waiver of immunity, and Section 271.153 places limits on recoverable damages when immunity from suit is waived.

Affirming the decision of the Corpus Christi court of appeals, the Texas Supreme Court found that, under a plain reading of the statute, Sharyland could not recover against the City of Alton the costs to repair its system, as they were not a \"balance due and owed\" under the contract, they were not the direct result of owner-caused delays or acceleration, and were the amount owed for change order or additional work the contractor was directed to perform by the local governmental entity in connection with the contract.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7317136\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/354/407/#p409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7317136\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/354/407/#p409\">\n    at 412-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   TEX.

First, as pointed out by Amex, the Lease Agreement perceivably includes at least some of the costs Amex alleges with regard to the AbM agreement. Second, EPEI did not contract with AbM in the same manner that the City of Alton contracted with third parties; rather, AbM contracted with Amex. As alleged by Amex, the Lease Agreement may in fact encompass costs associated with the AbM agreement. A review of a different Texas Supreme Court decision will help to further illustrate these distinctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Kirby\n   </em>\n   , developers sued an area water authority for reimbursement of part of their costs of building water and sewer facilities, which the authority had agreed to pay out of a pool of voter-approved bonds.\n   <em>\n    Kirby Lake Dev., Ltd. v.

The Water Authority contended that nothing was \"due and owed\" under Section 271.153(a)(1), in part, because its obligation to reimburse the developers had not been triggered as no bonds had been approved.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7325987\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/320/829/#p833\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7325987\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/320/829/#p833\">\n    at 839-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It was this reason for which the Water Authority argued that immunity was not waived.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7325987\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/320/829/#p833\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Stated differently, the Water Authority argued that\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   there was no liability, there were no recoverable damages and, therefore, no waiver of immunity. But the premise of no liability was itself disputed, and if the Water Authority had breached the contract by opposing bond approval, then the developers claimed only the reimbursement under the contract as damages. These damages, the Court held, were \"due and owed\" under Section 271.153(a)(1).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7325987\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/320/829/#p833\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Explaining, the Court stated, \"[t]he purpose of section 271.153 is to limit the amount due by a governmental agency on a contract once liability\n   <em>\n    has been established\n   </em>\n   , not to foreclose the determination of whether liability exists.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7325987\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/320/829/#p833\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7325987\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/320/829/#p833\">\n    at 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Based on the limited record before us and viewing the language of the Lease Agreement in the light most favorable to Amex, the Lease Agreement appears to provide for at least some of the damages pertaining to the agreement with AbM. EPEI agreed to \"pay directly to\" Amex's \"contractor the net reasonable additional third-party costs[.]\" The Lease Agreement provides that EPEI will reimburse Amex when Amex \"cure[s] any default on behalf of\" EPEI, defining \"default,\" in part, as a violation of any requirement or covenant of the Lease Agreement. EPEI also agreed to \"pay any and all costs and expenses\" attributable to EPEI's delays. In her deposition, Martinez explained that construction pursuant to the lease negotiations commenced before the parties signed the Lease Agreement. The record before us also includes two invoices from AbM: one dated May 1, 2008, for an amount due of $265,542.47 and one dated May 25, 2008, for an amount due of $362,562.47. Thus, viewed in the light most favorable to Amex, we find that Amex alleged recoverable damages and produced some evidence to establish it incurred damages that fit within the contract at issue as well as \"under the contract\" as provided in Section 271.153.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   We understand EPEI to argue that immunity is not waived for the damages Amex alleges with regard to AbM. But, as in\n   <em>\n    Kirby\n   </em>\n   , the \"no liability\" argument is itself disputed as the parties need to first establish that a contract was properly formed under Section 271.152.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   If EPEI is found to have breached the Lease Agreement, then a claim of reimbursement under the contract may be \"due and owed\" under Section 271.153(a)(1) and therefore constitute recoverable damages. This presents a fact issue as to whether the damages claimed by Amex are direct or consequential, and the trial court did not err in denying Amex's plea to the jurisdiction on the issue of consequential damages flowing from Amex's breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   EPEI's second issue is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    Issue Three: Attorney's Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In its live pleadings, Amex alleges that it is entitled to attorney's fees. On appeal, EPEI contends that the attorney's fees claimed by Amex are precluded under the pre-2009 version of\n   TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODE ANN. \u00a7 271.153(b), which prevented recovery of attorney's fees. In its brief, Amex concedes that, under TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODE ANN. \u00a7 271.153(b) applicable at the time the Lease was executed, Amex is not entitled to recover attorney's fees. Our investigation of this statute and its legislative history yields the same result: attorney's fees related to contractual suits for agreements executed prior to the 2009 amendment of Section 271.153(b) are not recoverable because the amendment did not apply retroactively to those contracts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Act of May 31, 2009, 81st Leg., R.S., ch. 1266, \u00a7 8, 2009 TEX.
