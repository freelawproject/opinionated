[W]hile the act-specific defense in\n    <em>\n     Celis-Garcia\n    </em>\n    helped this Court find that the insufficiently specific verdict directors were prejudicial to the defendant, the Court was\n    <strong>\n     not required\n    </strong>\n    to find prejudice based on her defense. This Court's analysis and holding in\n    <em>\n     Celis-Garcia\n    </em>\n    was not that a defendant like Mr. Hoeber could not suffer prejudice from insufficiently specific verdict directors\n    <strong>\n     just because\n    </strong>\n    he employed a general or unitary defense.
