He recovered $25,000 in noneconomic damages and $2,500 in punitive damages and obtained an injunction. The court also awarded him his \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d However, the court\u2019s calculation of \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d yielded but a small fraction of the total amount plaintiff had been charged by his attorneys. In this appeal, plaintiff challenges the trial court\u2019s methodology in arriving at this amount. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">On January 9, 1991, defendant Gary Lease, the dean of humanities at the University of California at Santa Cruz (hereafter UCSC), sent a copy of a \u201cHumanities Division Six-Year Academic Plan\u201d (Plan) to chairpersons of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the boards, committees and programs within the humanities division. This Plan was stamped \u201cconfidential.\u201d Plaintiff, the coordinator of the legal studies program (hereafter LS), received a copy of this document. The \u201cPlan\u201d contained Lease\u2019s recommendation that LS be essentially abandoned. On January 13, 1991, plaintiff circulated a copy of the Plan to the faculty members who taught in LS.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">On February 5, 1991, Lease sent a letter to plaintiff in which Lease asserted that plaintiff\u2019s circulation of the Plan was \u201ca violation both of divisional confidentiality and of the confidentiality enjoyed by your Humanities chair colleagues.\u201d Lease stated that \u201c[ajfter this action, I find it impossible to maintain the necessary confidence in you as Coordinator of the Legal Studies Program.\u201d He dismissed plaintiff as coordinator of LS \u201ceffective immediately.\u201d Lease sent copies of this letter to a host of faculty members, including every member of the faculty who taught in LS, and to plaintiff\u2019s personnel file. Lease subsequently restated the content of his letter to the UCSC newspaper. In March 1991 and again in May 1991, Lease circulated a \u201cLegal Studies Program - Chronology\u201d to all faculty teaching in LS. This \u201cChronology\u201d repeated the statements made by Lease in his letter to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Plaintiff immediately protested Lease\u2019s circulation of the February 5 letter. He expressly stated that he was not contesting his termination as LS coordinator. He addressed his protest to Michael Tanner, UCSC\u2019s academic vice-chancellor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Tanner referred the matter to the UCSC \u201cCharges Commitr tee\u201d (Committee). In February 1992, the Committee issued a report to Tanner finding that Lease had violated the faculty code of conduct by circulating the letter and the \u201cChronology.\u201d The Committee recommended that Lease be disciplined with a letter of censure. Tanner accepted the Committee\u2019s report and recommended to the chancellor that Lease be censured. The chancellor accepted Tanner\u2019s recommendation and, on July 13, 1992, sent Lease a formal letter of censure.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Plaintiff retained Attorney Gerald Bowden in January 1993. Plaintiff filed a first amended verified complaint on March 8, 1993 naming as defendants Lease and the Regents of the University of California (hereafter the Regents). He alleged that he had been damaged by Lease\u2019s \u201cimproper circulation\u201d of the termination letter because the letter contained \u201cpersonal information\u201d within the meaning of the Information Practices Act of 1977 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>(hereafter the IPA). He also claimed that he had been damaged by Lease\u2019s statements to the campus newspaper and his republication of the information on subsequent occasions. Plaintiff sought damages for this disclosure under Civil Code section 1798.48. In addition, plaintiff alleged that his termination had been for \u201cconstitutionally impermissible reasons and in violation of plaintiff\u2019s [federal and state constitutional] rights\u201d and that there had been a conspiracy to deprive him of his civil rights. Plaintiff sought an injunction ordering defendants to (1) \u201ccease conspiring\u201d to deprive him of his civil rights, (2) stop circulating personal information about him, (3) \u201cpublicly apologize\u201d for their prior circulation of such information, (4) \u201cestablish administrative procedures\u201d that comply with the IPA and (5) \u201cgrant plaintiff administrative relief\u2019 under the IPA. He also prayed for \u201cgeneral damages in excess of $100,000\u201d and requested attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In the summer of 1993, plaintiff retained Attorney Sanford Jay Rosen and his law firm Rosen, Bien &amp; Asaro to act as \u201clead counsel\u201d in his lawsuit. In August 1993, Rosen sent a letter to defendants\u2019 attorney, David Bimbaum, in which Rosen estimated plaintiff\u2019s economic damages at in excess of $200,000. He proposed settlement terms which included a public retraction and apology, disclosure of documents, a pledge by the Regents to cease their \u201charassment\u201d of plaintiff, a promise of no retaliation, $100,000, promotion of plaintiff to \u201cProfessor Step III\u201d and payment of \u201call attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred\u201d by plaintiff. Plaintiff\u2019s then current status was \u201cProfessor, Step 1.\u201d Alternatively, plaintiff proposed a settlement which included the retraction, apology and pledge without the disclosure or promise but with $500,000, promotion to \u201cProfessor, Step V\u201d and payment of all of plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">On October 13, 1993, defendants made a formal written offer to settle the action for $15,000 \u201cplus costs and attorneys fees as provided by law, as of October 13, 1993.\u201d On November 30, 1993, defendants made a second formal written offer to settle the action. Again, they offered a $15,000 monetary component, \u201clegally recoverable costs\u201d and \u201creasonable attorneys fees as determined by the court pursuant to CCP \u00a7 1033.5, as of November 30, 1993.\u201d However, this time defendants also offered to permit an injunction to be entered against them. The proposed injunction would order the Regents to comply with the IPA and remove the offending letter from all UCSC files and order Lease not to violate plaintiff\u2019s rights and not to retaliate against plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">On December 10, 1993, defendants conveyed an oral settlement offer to plaintiff which was a modification of their November 30 written settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>offer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendants substituted an offer of two quarters of paid leave not charged to sabbatical for the $15,000 offered on November 30. The pretax value of this leave was $44,495.54.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendants also agreed that the injunction would require not only Lease but the Regents also not to retaliate against plaintiff. The conveyance of this settlement offer was acknowledged by plaintiff\u2019s attorney, Rosen, in a December 10, 1993, letter to defendants\u2019 attorney, Dennis Howell. None of the settlement offers were accepted by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Settlement discussions continued between the parties throughout 1994 and into early 1995. In November 1994, the court ordered the parties to pursue arbitration. An arbitrator was appointed in January 1995. In March 1995, the parties unsuccessfully pursued mediation. A motion to compel production of documents was brought by plaintiff in May 1995. This motion was granted. On June 30, 1995, the parties placed their dispute before an arbitrator. In the arbitration, plaintiff sought damages for lost wages and harm to his reputation and an injunction prohibiting retaliation by defendants, enjoining defendants from violating his rights, and requiring defendants to comply with the IPA. Defendants did not challenge this request for injunctive relief, and they offered to stipulate to such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The arbitrator issued an award in favor of plaintiff. He found that Lease had violated the IPA by circulating the letter, speaking with the campus newspaper and circulating the \u201cChronology.\u201d The arbitrator concluded that plaintiff had suffered no economic loss, but he decided that plaintiff\u2019s reputation had been damaged and he had suffered mental distress. He awarded plaintiff $25,000 in noneconomic damages against both Lease and the Regents and $2,500 in punitive damages<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> against Lease alone. The award included an injunction to which defendants stipulated. Defendants were ordered not to \u201cconspire to\u201d or \u201cdeprive\u201d plaintiff of his state or federal statutory rights or his state constitutional rights. They were also enjoined from retaliating against plaintiff or publishing personal or confidential information about plaintiff. The arbitrator\u2019s amended award provided that \u201c[pjlaintiff shall also recover his reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and legally recoverable costs from defendants by the filing of a Memorandum of Costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>and pursuant to any appropriate post judgment proceedings taken hereafter.\u201d The amended award was filed on August 11, 1995. The parties agreed that neither of them would seek a trial de novo. On August 31, 1995, the parties stipulated to entry of judgment on the amended arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">On October 20, 1995, plaintiff filed a motion seeking an award of $428,851.17 for his attorney\u2019s fees. He subsequently submitted a supplemental claim for $91,735.91 in attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the litigation regarding his attorney\u2019s fees claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff declared that his \u201cprincipal goal in this lawsuit\u201d was not damages but instead \u201cpublic vindication, adequate injunctive relief, documents and public exposure sufficient to prompt institutional reform . . . .\u201d Plaintiff asserted that his lawsuit was responsible for the continuation of LS at UCSC. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney, Bowden, declared that plaintiff\u2019s \u201cprimary objective\u201d was \u201cinjunctive relief against future reprisals against him.\u201d He also claimed that the discovery of certain documents was critical to plaintiff\u2019s \u201cfuture protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Defendants challenged plaintiff\u2019s request for this amount of attorney\u2019s fees. They asserted that the litigation had not justified such a high level of attorney\u2019s fees, and they submitted an expert declaration which maintained that plaintiff\u2019s attorneys had \u201cchurned\u201d the case so as to extract excessive amounts of attorney\u2019s fees. Among other things, defendant\u2019s expert asserted that \u201c[n]o sensible client would pay such an amount and few, if any, attorneys would reasonably expect to collect\u201d such an excessive amount of attorney\u2019s fees in order to litigate this action. Defendant\u2019s expert opined that reasonable attorney\u2019s fees should not have amounted to more than \u201ca figure substantially less than $100,000.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The trial court appointed a special master \u201cto determine the issue of attorney fees pursuant to C.C.P. Section 639.\u201d Defendants asked the special master to reduce the attorney\u2019s fees to a \u201c \u2018reasonable\u2019 amount\u201d to \u201caccount for [plaintiff\u2019s] lack of success, and the immense number of attorney hours unnecessarily spent on this matter.\u201d Plaintiff attempted to justify his decision to incur substantial attorney\u2019s fees after defendants\u2019 December 1993 oral settlement offer. He claimed that his subsequent discovery of additional documents helped to protect him from future retaliation. He also acknowledged that he \u201calways knew that there was a serious risk that I would <em>not </em>be reimbursed my attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The special master issued his report on May 7, 1996. He found that the judgment obtained by plaintiff was less favorable than the December 1993 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>oral settlement offer. Although the special master found that plaintiff\u2019s \u201ccase\u201d was \u201cone factor\u201d motivating reformation of the mechanisms for faculty discipline at UCSC, he decided that \u201c[pjlaintiff\u2019s case had no catalytic effect that would not have eventuated if he .had settled in 1993.\u201d The special master\u2019s detailed analysis of the attorney\u2019s fees claim concluded that the hourly rates charged were reasonable, but the number of hours devoted to the case was unreasonable. He found that the case was \u201cnot particularly complex\u201d and that the fees reflected \u201cextravagance.\u201d The special master also questioned whether all of the hours charged were \u201cactually spent\u201d on the tasks for which they were billed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Because the more favorable settlement offer had been made \u201cat a time when the attorney\u2019s fees incurred were a small fraction of those ultimately claimed,\u201d the special master recommended that the court \u201cexercise its discretion to cut off the attorney\u2019s fees as of that date.\u201d Alternatively, the special master recommended that the court reduce attorney\u2019s fees to $75,000 in its discretion because of the small monetary judgment obtained and the similarity between the injunctive relief offered on December 10, 1993, and the injunctive relief obtained by means of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">By the time the fee request came before the court nearly $30,000 more was being requested. With a few modifications, the court adopted the special master\u2019s report as its statement of decision. It disagreed with the special master\u2019s finding that plaintiff\u2019s action had been \u201cone factor\u201d in motivating reform of UCSC\u2019s faculty disciplinary process. The court found that plaintiff\u2019s action had merely motivated \u201cdiscussion\u201d and \u201cdebate\u201d which had already been in progress prior to the action, but his action had not \u201cbeen a catalyst for change\u201d in any procedures. The court exercised its discretion to limit attorney\u2019s fees to those incurred through December 10, 1993. This amounted to $75,500.96. It also found \u201c[independently and as a separate ground of decision\u201d that \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d would be in this same amount due to \u201cthe very limited success achieved\u201d and the amount of the monetary component of the judgment. Plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">A. <em>Application of the Lodestar Methodology</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">California\u2019s IPA prohibits the disclosure of \u201cpersonal information,\u201d such as employment history information, by any state agency except under certain circumstances including where the disclosure of the information is \u201crelevant and necessary.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1798.3,1798.24, subd. (d).) The IPA permits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>an individual to bring a civil action for damages against a state agency if the agency fails to comply with the IPA and the individual is adversely affected. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1798.45.) Where the information has been disclosed intentionally by a person acting in other than his or her official capacity as a state employee, punitive damages of at least $2,500 are mandatory. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1798.53.) An individual also may obtain injunctive relief for a violation of the IPA. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1798.47.) Attorney\u2019s fees are statutorily mandated in successful IPA actions. A successful plaintiff under the IPA is entitled to recover \u201c[t]he costs of the action together with <em>reasonable </em>attorney\u2019s fees <em>as determined by the court.\u201d </em>(Civ. Code, \u00a7 1798.48, subd. (b), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In this case, defendants did not challenge plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. They argued only that the amount requested was unreasonable. The trial court agreed, and it awarded an amount which it deemed reasonable. The only question on appeal is whether the trial court\u2019s method of calculating the amount of the attorney\u2019s fee award was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s first contention is that the trial court erroneously failed to follow the \u201ctouchstone\u201d or \u201clodestar\u201d method of calculating a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee award.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The \u201ctouchstone\u201d or \u201clodestar\u201d method of determining reasonable attorney\u2019s fees was endorsed by the California Supreme Court in <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25 [141 Cal.Rptr. 315, 569 P.2d 1303], In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>that case, there was no statutory authority for an attorney\u2019s fee award,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but the California Supreme Court held that an award was proper. The court held that the trial court had properly calculated the award by computing a \u201ctouchstone\u201d amount based on \u201ca careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation\u201d and augmenting or diminishing this touchstone amount based on a number of \u201crelevant factors.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>{Serrano </em>at pp. 48-49.) \u201c \u2018Anchoring the analysis to this [touchstone] concept is the <em>only way </em>of approaching the problem that can claim objectivity, a claim which is obviously vital to the prestige of the bar and the courts.\u2019 . . <em>{Serrano </em>at p. 48, fn. 23, citation omitted, italics added.) None of the \u201crelevant factors\u201d pertinent to augmentation or diminution of the touchstone amount involved a consideration of whether the attorneys had acted reasonably in expending the \u201ctime spent\u201d on the litigation. <em>{Serrano </em>at p. 49.) The California Supreme Court reiterated the long-standing view that \u201c[t]he \u2018experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in his court, and while his judgment is of course subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.\u2019 . . <em>{Serrano </em>at p. 49, citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Subsequently, the California Supreme Court added a few refinements to these standards for setting the amount of an attorney\u2019s fee award. \u201c \u2018[U]nless special circumstances would render such an award unjust,\u2019 \u201d \u201cparties who qualify for a fee should recover for all hours <em>reasonably spent . . . </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\"><em>(Serrano </em>v. <em>Unruh </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 633, 639 [186 Cal.Rptr. 754, 652 P.2d 985], italics added.) \u201cA fee request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to reduce the award or deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>one altogether.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(Serrano </em>v. <em>Unruh, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 635.) The court cited with approval a federal case encouraging a complete denial of fees where the fee request was unreasonably excessive. \u201c \u2018If. . . the Court were required to award a reasonable fee when an outrageously unreasonable one has been asked for, claimants would be encouraged to make unreasonable demands, knowing that the only unfavorable consequence of such misconduct would be reduction of their fee to what they should have asked in the first place. To discourage such greed, a severer reaction is needful. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Serrano </em>v. <em>Unruh, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 635, citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Defendants argue that it was not necessary for the trial court to apply the lodestar method in this case because that method is not applicable to an attorney\u2019s fee award under the IPA. \u201cThe [California] Supreme Court has never held specifically that trial courts must use the lodestar adjustment method when calculating reasonable fees pursuant to a statute other than section 1021.5 [the private attorney general statute]. But <em>Serrano III [Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d 25] itself was not based on any statutory entitlement to fees; instead, it concerned a trial court\u2019s equitable power to award reasonable fees. Moreover, its adoption of the lodestar method of calculating reasonable fees was based on the premise that anchoring the analysis to the lodestar figure \u2018 \u201cis the only way of approaching the problem that can claim objectivity, a claim which is obviously vital to the prestige of the bar and the courts.\u201d \u2019 . . . Thus its pronouncements cannot be read as necessarily limited only to fees awarded under section 1021.5.\u201d <em>(Flannery </em>v. <em>California Highway Patrol </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 629, 640 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 632], citations omitted.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>\n                   We are persuaded by <em>Flannery </em>that the California Supreme Court intended its lodestar method to apply to a statutory attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>fee award unless the statutory authorization for the award provided for another method of calculation. As no other method of calculation was provided for here, the trial court was required to utilize the lodestar method.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">B. <em>Denial of Postoffer Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Plaintiff argues that the trial court\u2019s calculation was not based on the lodestar method but was instead an arbitrary decision that attorney\u2019s fees incurred by plaintiff after defendants\u2019 December 1993 settlement offer had not been reasonably incurred and therefore were not recoverable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As we have already noted, the lodestar method vests the trial court with the discretion to decide which of the hours expended by the attorneys were \u201creasonably spent\u201d on the litigation. <em>(Serrano </em>v. <em>Unruh, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at pp. 633, 635, 639.) The lodestar amount is the product of the number of hours \u201creasonably spent\u201d and the reasonable rate. In this case, the trial court found that the hours expended after the December 1993 oral settlement offer were not \u201creasonably spent\u201d on the litigation because plaintiff could have obtained all of the relief he ultimately achieved, and more, by accepting that offer. Hence, plaintiff\u2019s attorneys achieved nothing by continuing to expend their time after that offer. The trial court\u2019s decision came within the lodestar framework because it was based on the court\u2019s assessment of whether the hours which plaintiff\u2019s attorneys claimed to have expended on this litigation were \u201creasonably spent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Plaintiff contends that the court\u2019s use of the oral settlement offer as a . \u201cfees cut-off\u2019 was invalid because it \u201csubverted the public policy underlying [Code of Civil Procedure] \u00a7 998.\u201d  \u201cSection 998 clearly reflects this state\u2019s policy of encouraging settlements. ... In order to encourage parties to accept reasonable settlement offers made pursuant to the section, subdivisions (c) and (d) of section 998 afford the offeror a remedy against a party who has failed to accept a <em>statutory </em>settlement offer that proves to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>reasonable.\u201d <em>(Poster </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 266, 270 [276 Cal.Rptr. 321, 801 P.2d 1072], citations omitted, italics added.) Basically, Code of Civil Procedure section 998 provides that a plaintiff who failed to accept a defendant\u2019s statutory offer and \u201cfails to obtain a more favorable judgment\u201d will be denied recovery of his or her postoffer costs <em>and </em>must pay the defendant\u2019s postoffer costs. <em>(Poster </em>at p. 270.) Statutory attorney\u2019s fees are an element of costs. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1033.5, subds. (a)(10)(B), (c)(5).)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Code of Civil Procedure section 998 (hereafter section 998) was not applicable in this case, and the trial court did not purport to apply it. Defendants\u2019 December 1993 oral settlement offer was not a statutory settlement offer because it did not comply with the requirements of section 998. However, the inapplicability of section 998 did not prevent the trial court from allowing the underlying policy concerns addressed by that section to guide its exercise of its discretion in this case. The basic premise of section 998 is that plaintiffs who reject reasonable settlement offers and then obtain less than the offer should be penalized for continuing the litigation. The harsh result of section 998 is that the plaintiff not only loses the right to recover his or her costs, but must also pay the defendant\u2019s postoffer costs. The trial court had no authority in this case to require plaintiff to pay defendants\u2019 costs. It did, however, have the discretion to decide whether attorney time spent after defendants\u2019 December 1993 settlement offer was time \u201creasonably spent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">We do not believe that the trial court\u2019s decision was arbitrary or irrational in this regard. Plaintiff relies on federal cases which state that a trial court may not use an informal settlement offer as a basis for determining, in its discretion, the amount of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee award. He chiefly relies on <em>Ortiz </em>v. <em>Regan </em>(2d Cir. 1992) 980 F.2d 138. Ortiz brought an action in which she claimed that she had been deprived of notice and a hearing before her pension benefits were suspended. The district court denied Ortiz her attorney\u2019s fees for attorney time spent after the defendant offered to hold a postdeprivation hearing. The Second Circuit held that denying Ortiz her postoffer attorney\u2019s fees was improper because \u201c. . . Ortiz\u2019s [postoffer] litigation efforts vindicated her pre-deprivation due process rights even though a post-deprivation remedy was available.\u201d <em>(Ortiz </em>at p. 140.) The appellate court pointed out that the district court had explicitly found that the offered postdeprivation hearing \u201cdid not satisfy [Ortiz\u2019s] pre-deprivation due process rights.\u201d <em>(Ortiz </em>at p. 139.) The appellate court concluded that this explicit finding was inconsistent with the district court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees for postoffer litigation. <em>{Ortiz </em>at p. 140.) \u201cIf attorney\u2019s fees are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>provided in situations such as this one, there would be no incentive for private citizens to challenge pre-deprivation due process violations where a post-deprivation remedy exists.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The Second Circuit also found that there was \u201c[a] second problem\u201d with the district court\u2019s denial of postoffer attorney\u2019s fees. <em>(Ortiz </em>v. <em>Regan, supra, </em>980 F.2d at p. 140.) \u201cA district court should not rely on informal negotiations and hindsight to determine whether further litigation was warranted and, accordingly, whether attorney\u2019s fees should be awarded. Otherwise, plaintiffs with meritorious claims may be improperly dissuaded from pressing forward with their litigation.\u201d <em>(Ortiz </em>at pp. 140-141.) The court pointed out that the defendant could have made a formal settlement offer under rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C.). Rule 68, like section 998, mandates that a party who rejects a formal settlement offer and then obtains a less favorable result must pay both its own and the adverse party\u2019s postoffer costs. (Fed. Rules Civ.Proc., rule 68, 28 U.S.C.) Citing <em>Cowan </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America </em>(D.Conn. 1990) 728 F.Supp. 87, the Second Circuit stated that \u201c[ajbsent a showing of bad faith, \u2018a party\u2019s declining settlement offers should [not] operate to reduce an otherwise appropriate fee award.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ortiz, supra, </em>at p. 141.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\"><em>Cowan </em>was a district court opinion in which the district court declined, in its discretion, to base a reduction of an attorney\u2019s fee award on the plaintiff\u2019s rejection of an informal settlement offer which exceeded his ultimate recovery. <em>(Cowan </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America, supra, </em>728 F.Supp. at p. 92.) \u201cI do not believe that a party\u2019s declining settlement offers should operate to reduce an otherwise appropriate fee award. The very existence of Rule 68, with its precise requirements, creates a negative implication as to offers of settlement that do not comply with its terms. Moreover, it is not clear that a rule barring all attorney\u2019s fee awards for post-offer work where the ultimate judgment is below the offer would be consistent with Congress\u2019s purpose of creating incentives to the bringing of meritorious civil rights claims. A rule giving trial judges discretion to deny such fees where the refusal of an offer is shown after the fact to have been unwise might well lead to very uneven results and even misuse in cases in which judges become involved in settlement negotiations. It may be that our legal system badly needs a mechanism to encourage early settlement, but that mechanism ought to emerge either from the rule-making process or directly from Congress.\u201d <em>(Cowan, supra, </em>at p. 92.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The Fourth Circuit <em>(Clark </em>v. <em>Sims </em>(4th Cir. 1994) 28 F.3d 420, 424) and the Tenth Circuit <em>(Cooper </em>v. <em>State of Utah </em>(10th Cir. 1990) 894 F.2d 1169, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>1172) have also stated that a district court may not reduce fees in reliance on a plaintiff\u2019s rejection of an informal settlement offer. The Fourth Circuit relied on <em>Ortiz, </em>while the Tenth Circuit\u2019s opinion contained no analysis of this issue but simply the blunt statement that \u201c. . . downward adjustment of fees based on settlement negotiations is not well-founded.\u201d <em>(Cooper </em>at p. 1172.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Defendant asks us to reject these federal cases. We conclude that these federal cases do not persuasively justify their conclusion. Only <em>Cowan </em>contains substantial analysis of the issue. While the concerns expressed by the district court in <em>Cowan </em>are not invalid, we do not believe that these concerns merit restricting a California trial court\u2019s discretion to consider all of the facts and the entire procedural history of the case in setting the amount of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee award. The existence of section 998 does not, in our view, imply that its inapplicability in a particular case prevents a trial court from considering a nonstatutory settlement offer in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee award. Consideration of a nonstatutory settlement offer by a trial court where appropriate does not involve the creation of a \u201crule\u201d similar to section 998 but without its precise requirements. Instead, a trial court operating within its discretion is simply empowered to take into consideration the fact that a party continued to litigate a matter after a reasonable, albeit informal, settlement offer. Although it involved a rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C.) formal settlement offer, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Marek </em>is applicable here. \u201cIn a case where a rejected settlement offer exceeds the ultimate recovery, the plaintiff\u2014although technically the prevailing party\u2014has not received any monetary benefits from the postoffer services of his attorney.\u201d <em>(Marek </em>v. <em>Chesny </em>(1985) 473 U.S. 1, 11 [105 S.Ct. 3012, 3017, 87 L.Ed.2d 1].) Attorney time spent on services which produce no tangible benefit for the client is not time \u201creasonably spent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">California courts have long held that trial courts have broad discretion in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee award. This determination is necessarily ad hoc and must be resolved on the particular circumstances of each case. Section 998 was enacted to facilitate California\u2019s policy of encouraging parties to accept reasonable settlement offers. <em>(Poster </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Disk, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 270.) This policy is not inconsistent with permitting a trial court to consider informal settlement offers in cases where section 998 does not apply and the trial court has the discretion to set the amount of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee award. We are confident that our trial courts are capable of avoiding \u201cuneven results,\u201d and we can see no justification for <em>Cowan\u2019s </em>belief that \u201cmisuse\u201d is a significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>danger. California trial courts regularly exercise their discretion to determine what is reasonable under particular circumstances. This situation is not so rife with potential for abuse that we cannot trust our trial courts to continue to exercise their discretion in the interests of fairness and justice. Consequently, we do not believe that prohibiting trial courts from considering informal settlement offers in setting the amount of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee award is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Plaintiff argues that the December 1993 settlement offer was not a \u201ctrue offer\u201d because its terms were so uncertain that the offer could not have been accepted and enforced. The evidence before the trial court established that the terms of this offer were sufficiently certain. The offer specified the precise terms of the compensatory element, the injunction, the costs component and the attorney\u2019s fees component. The terms of the offer differed from the previous formal written offer in only two particulars. First, instead of the $15,000 compensatory payment offered in the November written offer, the December oral offer substituted a compensatory element of two quarters of paid leave not charged to sabbatical. Second, the offered injunctive relief was modified to require not only Lease but also the Regents not to retaliate against plaintiff. We do not detect anything remotely uncertain in these terms. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney evidently comprehended these terms to be an offer since he characterized them as such in his letter to defendant\u2019s attorney written on the date of the December offer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Plaintiff attempts to reargue the disputed factual issues which were resolved by the trial court. Since substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s findings, we have no authority to disturb them. <em>(Reddy </em>v. <em>Gonzalez </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 118, 123 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 55].)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Plaintiff contends that the trial court\u2019s comparison of the offer to the judgment was erroneous. First, he claims that the court erred in concluding that the leave offer was more favorable than the $27,500 judgment. Defendants established below that the pretax value of the leave offer was $44,495.54. The trial court took the relevant tax considerations into account in comparing the leave offer to the monetary component of the judgment. There was nothing \u201chypertechnical\u201d or \u201cinherently speculative\u201d about the trial court\u2019s comparison. Because a portion of the judgment was nontaxable, the trial court properly accounted for that distinction in comparing the two amounts. Although plaintiff hotly disputed the court\u2019s conclusion, the record contains substantial support for the court\u2019s finding that leave offer was more favorable to plaintiff than the monetary component of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Second, plaintiff maintains that the court\u2019s comparison of the judgment\u2019s injunctive relief to the injunctive relief component of the December 1993 offer was invalid.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The record supports the court\u2019s finding. The injunctive component of the December offer would have ordered Lease not to violate plaintiff\u2019s rights or retaliate against him and ordered the Regents to comply with the IPA, remove the offending letter from all UCSC files and not retaliate against plaintiff. The judgment\u2019s injunctive relief ordered the Regents and Lease not to violate the IPA and not to violate plaintiff\u2019s rights or retaliate against him. The record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the injunctive relief offered in December 1993 was equivalent to or better than the injunctive relief obtained by stipulation in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Plaintiff takes issue with the trial court\u2019s finding that his lawsuit did not have a \u201ccatalytic effect.\u201d He asserts that the \u201ccatalytic effect\u201d achieved by his lawsuit justified the expenditure of his attorneys\u2019 time in litigating it.  The catalytic effect of a lawsuit can be a \u201cfactor\u201d in setting the amount of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee award because it is pertinent to \u201cthe extent of success\u201d achieved by the lawsuit. <em>(Kilgour </em>v. <em>City of Pasadena </em>(9th Cir. 1995) 53 F.3d 1007, 1011, fn. 4.) The \u201cdegree of success\u201d is one of the factors that a trial court should consider in setting the amount of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee award. <em>(Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, supra, </em>461 U.S. at p. 436 [103 S.Ct. at p. 1941].)  The trial court found that plaintiff\u2019s action had not been a catalyst for reform of UCSC\u2019s faculty disciplinary process. It concluded that plaintiff\u2019s case had merely been a subject of ongoing \u201cdiscussion\u201d and \u201cdebate\u201d about this process which had begun prior to plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit. The evidence supports the court\u2019s findings. While the <em>events </em>upon which plaintiff founded his action were one of the ingredients in the UCSC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>debate about the faculty disciplinary process, substantial evidence supported the trial court\u2019s decision that plaintiff\u2019s <em>lawsuit </em>did not significantly impact this debate or result in any changes in this process.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the December 1993 offer would have afforded plaintiff as good or better relief than the judgment is supported by the evidence. Taking this fact into consideration in setting the amount of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee award was not improper. Because the evidence was in dispute as to whether or not plaintiff\u2019s action had had a catalytic effect, the court did not err in concluding that it had not had such an effect and dismissing catalytic effect as a factor in the calculation of the appropriate attorney\u2019s fee award. The trial court\u2019s calculation of the attorney\u2019s fee award used the correct methodology and did not involve any abuse of the court\u2019s broad discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">C. <em>Denial of Fees Incurred in Fees Litigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The trial court awarded plaintiff no attorney\u2019s fees for the work performed by his attorneys in litigating his request for attorney\u2019s fees. \u201cPrevailing parties are compensated for hours <em>reasonably </em>spent on fee-related issues. <em>A fee request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether.'\u201d (Serrano </em>v. <em>Unruh, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 635, original italics omitted and italics added.) The trial court found, on substantial evidence, that plaintiff\u2019s fee request was unreasonably inflated. In this case, where plaintiff\u2019s attorneys attempted to justify more than $500,000 in fees for a case which achieved a modest financial award and stipulated injunctive relief which required defendants to do little, if anything, more than obey the law in the future, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the attorney\u2019s fees incurred in attempting to justify this unreasonable request were not hours \u201creasonably spent\u201d on the fee litigation. Hence, the trial court was permitted to deny plaintiff any recovery for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the fee litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">D. <em>Denial of Fees for Postjudgment Motions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Plaintiff argues that the trial court was required to award him his attorney\u2019s fees for plaintiff\u2019s opposition to defendants\u2019 postjudgment motions to seal court files and for sanctions. He claims that this work was necessary to achieve the results he sought in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">\u201cCompensable work on post-judgment proceedings must be \u2018useful\u2019 and of a type' \u2018ordinarily necessary\u2019 to secure the litigation\u2019s final result.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number><em>(Stewart </em>v. <em>Gates </em>(9th Cir. 1993) 987 F.2d 1450, 1452.) While it is clear <em>from the </em>record that plaintiff desired full disclosure of all documents, his desire was not \u201cordinarily necessary\u201d for him to secure the result obtained in this litigation. The underlying conduct for which plaintiff sought recompense was the wrongful <em>disclosure </em>of Information about him by defendants. Although plaintiff prevailed on the motion and the trial court denied defendants\u2019 postjudgment request that the court files be sealed, it did so because the documents had already been in public files for some time and therefore could not be considered confidential. It did not find that disclosure of these documents was proper or appropriate. In fact, some of those documents were similar to those which plaintiff\u2019s action claimed had been wrongly disclosed. These documents simply contained information about individuals other than plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the time spent by plaintiff\u2019s attorneys opposing these motions was not \u201cnecessary\u201d for plaintiff to secure the result obtained in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The trial court\u2019s order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Cottle, P.

However, Tanner had not known or approved of Lease\u2019s circulation of the letter to others. Tanner was subsequently absolved of any misconduct. Tanner\u2019s involvement was known to plaintiff at the time of the arbitration and was discussed in the arbitration briefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\"> The December 10 offer did not extend the cutoff for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Plaintiff was billed for over $3,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs between November 30 and the time of the December 10 settlement offer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\"> The monetary value of the settlement offer was arguably greater than the monetary value of the judgment. Although plaintiff claimed that he was taxed at the highest level, he provided no support for this contention, and the court below resolved the issue against him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\"> Punitive damages were mandatory under the IPA, and this was the minimum amount awardable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\"> Plaintiff had in fact paid more than $450,000 of the billed attorney\u2019s fees, and he was obligated to and expected to pay all of those fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\"> Plaintiff argues that the attorney\u2019s fee award was based on more than a violation of the IPA. Because the lodestar method of calculating the appropriate attorney\u2019s fee award has been-accepted as the appropriate method in nearly all state cases, and the federal authorities are not inconsistent on the issues raised herein, we need not decide whether the attorney\u2019s fee award was based solely on the IPA. Were we to consider this issue, we would find that the attorney\u2019s fee award was based- solely on the IPA violation. The arbitrator\u2019s letter to counsel concluded only that Lease had violated the IPA: \u201cBased on my finding of state statutory violations, and due to the constraints of time, I do not reach the is.sue of whether any federally protected rights were violated.\" The only relief in the original award was damages for the IPA violation, and this award included attorney\u2019s fees. The amended award was also based solely on a violation of the IPA. \u201cJudgment is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiff Robert Meister and against defendants Regents of the University of California and Gary Lease by reason of the defendants\u2019 violation of Civil Code Section 1798.24.\u201d The stipulated injunctive relief included an order that defendants \u201c[n]ot conspire to or otherwise deprive plaintiff of his rights protected by California Civil Code \u00a7 52.1, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985, and Article 1, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, and 7 of the California Constitution\u201d in addition to an order that defendants comply with the IPA. The amended award provided that \u201c[p]laintiff shall also recover his reasonable attorney's fees and legally recoverable costs from defendants . . . .\" Judgment was entered by the trial court on the amended award pursuant to a stipulation by plaintiff and defendants. Because the original award, based solely on the IPA, included an award of <em>attorney\u2019s fees, it is </em>clear that the attorney\u2019s fee award was pursuant to the statutory authorization therefor under the IPA rather than under any other legal authority for the award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\"> Such authority was subsequently enacted by the Legislature. \u201cUpon motion, a court may award attorneys\u2019 fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest . . . .\u201d (Code Civ.

This calculation provides an objective basis on which to make an initial estimate of the value of a lawyer\u2019s services. . . . Where the documentation of hours is inadequate, the district court may reduce the award accordingly.

As the federal and state standards both require a consideration of whether hours spent were \u201creasonably expended\u201d and permit reduction of the amount sought where the request is excessive, the question of whether these fees were awarded under the state or federal standard need not be resolved.

There was no reason to doubt that a judgment based on the offer would have vindicated plaintiff\u2019s reputation as cleanly as, and far more expeditiously than, the judgment. As the alleged value of the \u201cdiscovery\u201d plaintiff \u201cachieved\u201d during his lawsuit was disputed, the trial court could have concluded that this discovery had no real value to plaintiff. In his reply brief, plaintiff claims that the offer was not comparable to the judgment because it would have placed at risk his entitlement to his attorney\u2019s fees and costs because the leave offer was worth less than the $25,000 jurisdictional minimum necessary for a superior court action. Because this claim is raised for the first time in plaintiff\u2019s reply brief without any showing of good cause for plaintiff\u2019s failure to raise it earlier, we need not address it. <em>(Reichardt </em>v. <em>Hoffman </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 754, 764 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 770].) However, since the evidence strongly supported the trial court\u2019s finding that the leave offer was worth more than the judgment, and the judgment exceeded this jurisdictional minimum, the trial court did not err in implicitly concluding that plaintiff\u2019s right to recover his fees and costs would not have been imperiled by acceptance of the December 1993 offer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
