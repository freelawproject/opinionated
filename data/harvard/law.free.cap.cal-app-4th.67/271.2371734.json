In this case, a motion requesting that the 180-day period be tolled was filed before the 180 days had expired, but was granted afterward. Summary judgment was then entered. The trial court denied the surety\u2019s subsequent motion to set aside the summary judgment, even though it had been entered during the period contemplated by the tolling order. We do not reach the issue of whether summary judgment may be entered during a tolling period. Rather, we find that the trial court had no jurisdiction to order tolling once the 180-day period had expired. For this reason, we hold that the surety\u2019s motion to set aside the summary judgment was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">On June 17, 1995, the bail agent of appellant National Automobile &amp; Casualty Insurance Company (National) posted a $30,000 bail bond for the release of Humberto Azora Bazur in the matter of People v. Bazur (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 1995, No. KA027813). Bazur failed to appear for arraignment on July 11, 1995, and his bail was ordered forfeited. Notice of the forfeiture was mailed on July 19, 1995. Less than 180 days later, on January 10, 1996, National filed a \u201cmotion to toll time for surety agent investigators to apprehend and return defendant to custody of the court where he fled.\u201d More than 180 days after the mailing of the notice of forfeiture, on February 8, 1996, the motion was granted, and the 180-day period was ordered tolled until May 8, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">On March 28, 1996, the executive officer/clerk of the superior court filed a request to enter summary judgment on the forfeiture of Bazur\u2019s bail, bearing the caption County of Los Angeles v. National (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 1996, No. BS038565). The request was supported by a declaration setting forth the above chronology of events, including the order tolling the 180-day period. On April 1, 1996, the request was granted, and summary judgment on the bail bond forfeiture was entered in favor of the County of Los Angeles (the County). National later moved to set the summary judgment aside, arguing that it had been prematurely entered. On November 27, 1996, National\u2019s motion was denied.  This appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">1. <em>Statutory Scheme</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The trial court is required to declare a forfeiture of bail when the defendant fails to appear in court without a sufficient excuse. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1305, subd. (a) (all further section references are to the Penal Code).) The court is also required to cause notice of the forfeiture to be mailed to the bail agent within 30 days thereafter. (\u00a7 1305, subd. (b).* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) If, inter alia, the defendant appears, is surrendered to custody, or is arrested in the underlying case within 180 days of the date of mailing the notice, the court must vacate the order of forfeiture and exonerate the bond on its own motion. (\u00a7 1305, subd. (c)(l)-(3).) An order of forfeiture may also be vacated on motion. (\u00a7 1305, subd. (c)(4).) \u201cA motion [to vacate forfeiture] filed in a timely manner within.the 180-day period may be heard within 30 days of the expiration of the 180-day period.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>Also, the 180-day period may be tolled if the defendant is unable to appear during that time because of \u201ctemporary disability\u201d by reason of illness, insanity or detention by military or civilian authorities. (\u00a7 1305, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\u201cWhen any bond is forfeited and the period of time specified in Section 1305 has elapsed without the forfeiture being set aside, the court. . . shall enter a summary judgment against [the] bondsman. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1306, subd. (a) .) \u201cIf, because of the failure of any court to promptly perform the duties enjoined upon it pursuant to this section, summary judgment is not entered within 90 days after the date upon which it may first be entered, the right to do so expires and the bail is exonerated.\u201d (\u00a7 1306, subd. (c).) Once summary judgment has been entered, the district attorney or county counsel is required to demand payment within 30 days after finality of the judgment and enforce the judgment if payment is not made within 20 days after the demand. (\u00a7 1306, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">As in <em>People </em>v. <em>Topa Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 296, 300 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 167], \u201cThis case is controlled by [sections 1305 and 1306], the provisions of which \u2018must be strictly followed or the court acts without or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>excess of its jurisdiction. [Citation.] . . . [1D The course set out in a jurisdictional statute must be precisely followed or the court loses jurisdiction and its actions are void. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.] \u2018It is well established in the case law that Penal Code sections 1305 and 1306 are subject to precise and strict construction. . . . \u201c \u2018[W]here a statute requires a court to exercise its jurisdiction in a particular manner, follow a particular procedure, or subject to certain limitations, an act beyond those limitations is in excess of its jurisdiction.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">2. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In proceedings before the trial court, the court and counsel assumed that the 180-day period had been tolled by virtue of the order of February 8, 1996. Nonetheless, summary judgment was entered in favor of the County during the tolling period. The most likely reason for this seeming incongruity stems from an observation made in <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>American Bankers Ins. Co., supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">In <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>American Bankers Ins. Co., supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th 792, the 180-day period expired on February 21, 1994. The bail agent filed a motion to vacate the forfeiture three days late, on February 24, with hearing set for March 15, 1994. The trial court was prepared to entertain the motion on March 15. However, the defendant failed to appear and the trial court \u201c \u2018further tolled\u2019 \u201d the 180-day period to April 22, 1994. When the defendant failed to appear at the April 22 hearing, the court ordered bail to remain forfeited, <em>(Id. </em>at p. 794.) Summary judgment on the forfeiture was entered on July 12, 1994, i.e., within 90 days of the April 22 order denying the motion to vacate forfeiture, but more than 90 days after the February 21 expiration of the 180-day period in which to vacate forfeiture..</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>American Bankers Ins. Co., supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th 792, court concluded that, because the bail agent\u2019s motion was filed three days after the 180-day period had expired, \u201cno hearing on such motion should have been held on March 15, 1994, in the first place, and the court lacked jurisdiction to continue the motion to April 22, 1994. [Citation].\u201d (44 Cal.App.4th at p. 797.) Accordingly, when summary judgment on the forfeiture was entered on July 12, 1994, \u201cthe trial court lacked jurisdiction and the forfeiture was void.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">The <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>American Bankers Ins. Co., supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th 792, court further observed; \u201cAt oral argument counsel represented that some courts in this state avoid the possibility of violating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>jurisdictional mandate of section 1306, subdivision (c) by automatically calendaring and entering summary judgment immediately upon the expiration of the 180 days from the mailing of notice of forfeiture of the bond. Such procedure seems to this court to be a prudent practice and one that would avoid the harsh result we reach in this case.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 797.)</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The \u201cautomatic calendaring\u201d approach appears to have been utilized below. But what the <em>American Bankers </em>court hoped would avoid the potential for harsh results.paved the way for a seemingly illogical outcome in this case. Based on their assumptions that the tolling order was valid, the parties argued in the trial court and briefed to this court the issue of whether summary judgment may be entered during a tolling period. While this question may be of great interest to courts using the automatic calendaring approach, we do not reach it here. This is because, as a result of our review of the record and further briefing filed by the parties at our request, we have concluded that entry of the tolling order was beyond the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction. As such, no impediment existed to entering summary judgment against National following expiration of the 180-day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Our conclusion emanates from the plain language of subdivisions (c)(4) and (e) of section 1305.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The subject of subdivision (c)(4) is motions to vacate forfeiture. In the context of setting forth that subject matter, the statute provides that a motion to vacate forfeiture which is filed within the 180-day period may be heard within 30 days after the period expires. The subject of subdivision (e) is the tolling of the 180-day period in a case of temporary disability. The statute provides, inter alia, that tolling may occur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>based on temporary disability \u201c[if] the defendant is unable to appear in court during the remainder of the 180-day period.\u201d (\u00a7 1305, subd. (e)(2).) However, the statute is silent with respect to the procedure for seeking a tolling order. In other words, it does <em>not </em>provide for a grace period in which to hear a request for tolling after the 180-day period has expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">In response to our request for briefing on this issue, National merely quoted the sentence of section 1305, subdivision (c)(4), which provides: <em>\u201cA </em>motion\u201d timely filed within the 180-day period may be heard within 30 days after expiration of this period. (Italics added.) From this language National concludes ipse dixit that the 30-day grace period of subdivision (c)(4) also applies to subdivision (e). We reject National\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u201cThe goal of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. [Citation.] Ordinarily, the words of the statute provide the most reliable indication of legislative intent. [Citation.] When the statutory language is ambiguous, the court may examine the context in which the language appears, adopting the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>County of Stanislaus </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1143, 1152 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 329, 947 P.2d 291].) Conversely, \u201c[w]hen \u2018 \u201cstatutory language is . . . clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction, and courts should not indulge in it.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(DaFonte </em>v. <em>Up-Right, Inc. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 593, 601 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 238, 828 P.2d 140].)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">As stated, we find the language of section 1305, subdivisions (c)(4) and (e) to be clear in providing that the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear a. motion within 30 days after expiration of the 180-day period applies to motions to vacate forfeiture, not to motions to toll this period. Viewing these subdivisions with an eye toward harmonizing section 1305 internally, we still find them to be discrete.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> National has not offered nor are we able to find any historical or logical reason to permit cloning the 30-day language of section 1305, subdivision (c)(4), and grafting it wholesale onto subdivision (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Although not mentioned by the parties, two cases which have reached a different conclusion than ours must be addressed. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Resolute Ins. Co. </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 249, 254-255 [120 Cal.Rptr. 17], the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>considered, inter alia, whether the 180-day period could be tolled based on a motion by the surety that did not specifically request tolling in its caption. In a prehminary discussion of the requirements of then section 1305, subdivision (a), the court stated: \u201cIf the surety makes a motion within the 180 day-period, <em>which motion can be heard up to 30 days later, </em>and \u2018it is made to appear from the satisfaction of the court that the defendant is temporarily disabled\u2019 [(\u00a7 1305, subd. (a))] from appearing, the period of disability is deducted from the 180 days.\u201d (46 Cal.App.3d at p. 254, italics added.) In <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Surety Ins. Co. </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 16, 21 [199 Cal.Rptr. 351], this language was quoted in a situation where the parties had agreed that tolling could be ordered within 30 days after the 180-day period had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">We respectfully disagree with these dicta pronouncements. The versions of section 1305 in effect at the time of these decisions had a different format than the present version of the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, irrespective of format, the subjects of vacating forfeiture and tolling the 180-day period were still set forth in different portions of the statute and still failed to provide any basis for applying the procedures of one to the other. Thus, to the extent that <em>People </em>v. <em>Resolute Ins. Co., supra, </em>46 Cal.App.3d 249, and <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Surety Ins. Co., supra, </em>152 Cal.App.3d 16, can be read as permitting a motion for tolling to be within 30 days after the expiration of the 180-day period, we decline to follow them.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">3. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">We cannot disagree that there is substantial logic to permitting a motion to toll the 180-day period to be heard within 30 days of the 180-day period, as is the case with a motion to vacate forfeiture. Indeed, it is obvious that hearing a motion to toll within a 30-day grace period is the current practice in some of our trial courts.  Nonetheless, when determining how a statute is to be applied, we \u201c \u2018 \u201cmust follow the language used and give to it its plain meaning, whatever may be thought of the wisdom, expediency, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>policy ....\u201d\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Weidert </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 836, 843 [218 Cal.Rptr. 57, 705 P.2d 380].)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Section 1305 requires that any order for tolling the 180-day period be entered before that period has expired. Since the tolling in this case came by way of order made after the 180-day period had expired, it was void. Under section 1306, subdivision (a), once the 180-day period had expired with the bail remaining forfeited, the County had 90 days within which to have summary judgment entered on the forfeiture. The County did so. Accordingly, National\u2019s motion to set aside the summary judgment was properly denied. (Cf. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>American Bankers Ins. Co., supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th at p. 797.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The order under review is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Vogel (Miriam A.), Acting P.

If at any time within the 180 days after such entry in the minutes or mailing as the case may be, the bail should surrender the defendant to the court or to custody, the court shall direct the forfeiture of the undertaking or the deposit to be discharged upon such terms as may be just.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">\u201cIf within 180 days after such entry in the minutes or mailing as the case may be, it is made to appear to the satisfaction of the court that the defendant is dead or is otherwise permanently unable to appear in court due to illness, insanity, or detention by civil or military authorities, and that the absence of the defendant was not with the connivance of the bail, the court shall direct the forfeiture of the undertaking or the deposit to be discharged upon such terms as may be just. If within 180 days after such entry in the minutes or mailing as the cas\u00e9 may be, it is made to appear to the satisfaction of the court that the defendant is temporarily disabled by reason of illness, insanity, or detention by civil or military authorities and is therefore unable to appear in court at any time during the remainder of such 180 days, and that the absence of the defendant has not been with the connivance of the bail, then the period of time during which the disability continues shall not be deemed part of such 180 days. Upon a finding by the court that a reasonable period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>of time is necessary in order to return the defendant to court upon the termination of the disability, then such period of time, as fixed by the court, shall not be deemed part of such 180 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">\u201cUnless waived by the district attorney or other prosecuting attorney, no order discharging the forfeiture of the undertaking or deposit shall be made without opportunity for hearing and the filing of a notice of motion for such order setting forth the basis for relief, with proof of service upon the district attorney or other prosecuting attorney at least 10 days prior to the time set for hearing of the motion and otherwise in compliance with the provisions of Section 1010 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Such notice may be given by the surety insurer, its bail agent, the surety, or depositor of money, any of whom may give such notice and appear either in person or by attorney. Such notice of motion must be filed within 180 days after such entry in the minutes or mailing as the case may be, and must be heard and determined within 30 days after the expiration of such 180 days, unless the court for good cause shown, shall extend the time for hearing and determination. \u201c(b) <em>99</em></blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-8\"> In posting bail, a surety agrees that judgment may be summarily taken against it following forfeiture in compliance with Penal Code sections 1305 and 1306.

(\u00a7 1305, subd. (b) .) Inasmuch as the difference between 180 and 185 days is of no consequence to the resolution of this case, for the sake of consistency we shall refer to the relevant time span as the 180-day period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b215-7\"> Section 1305 provides, in pertinent part: \u201c(c)(4) Except as provided in paragraphs (1) and (2), the court, in its discretion, may require that the bail provide 10 days\u2019 prior notice to the applicable prosecuting agency, as a condition precedent to vacating the forfeiture. The notice may be given by the surety insurer, the bail agent, the surety, or the depositor of money or property, any of whom may appear in person or through an attorney. A motion filed in a timely manner within the 180-day period may be heard within 30 days of the expiration of the 180-day period. The court may extend the 30-day period upon a showing of good cause. \u00ab&lt; \u201c(e) In the case of a temporary disability, the court shall order the tolling of the 180-day period provided in this section during the period of temporary disability, provided that it appears to the satisfaction of the court that the following conditions are met: [ID (1) The defendant is temporarily disabled by reason of illness, insanity, or detention by military or civil authorities. HD (2) Based upon the temporary disability, the defendant is unable to appear in court during the remainder of the 180-day period. HD (3) The absence of the defendant is without the connivance of the bail. HD The period of the tolling shall be extended for a reasonable period of time, at the discretion of the court, after the cessation of the disability to allow for the return of the defendant to the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d To enable these subdivisions to be read in the context of the entire statute, we have set forth the complete text of the relevant version of section 1305 (Stats. 1995, ch. 434, \u00a7 1) in an appendix, <em>post, </em>at pages 281-283.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b216-8\"> In a pleading that is not part of the record on appeal, National moved to vacate the bail forfeiture and exonerate the bond. That motion was denied on February 7, 1996, the day before the motion for tolling was granted. Thus, the record demonstrates an understanding by National that a motion to vacate forfeiture is not the same as a motion to toll the 180-day period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\"> The complete text of the version of section 1305 in effect when <em>People </em>v. <em>Resolute Ins. Co., supra, </em>46 Cal.App.3d 249, was decided (Stats. 1972, ch. 1114, \u00a7 1, pp. 2124-2126) is also set forth in the appendix, <em>post, </em>at pages 283-285. The statute was substantially the same when considered by the court in <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Surety Ins. Co., supra, </em>152 Cal.App.3d 16, was decided. (Stats. 1979, ch. 873, \u00a7 10.5, pp. 3041-3042.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b217-9\"> The extra 30 days in which to hear a motion to vacate forfeiture has had somewhat of a rocky history, having been deleted from section 1305 in a 1985 amendment (Stats. 1985, ch. 1486, \u00a7 1, pp. 5481-5482), only to be reinstated when the statute was repealed and revised in 1993. (Stats. 1993, ch. 524, \u00a7 2; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Topa Ins. Co., supra, </em>32 Cal.App.4th at pp. 298-299.) Again, we find nothing in these versions of the statute that would affect our conclusion that the 30-day grace period does not apply to a motion to toll the 180-day period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\"> Judge of the Municipal Court for the Long Beach Judicial District, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
