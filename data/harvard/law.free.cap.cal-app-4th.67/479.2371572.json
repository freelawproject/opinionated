(MacFrugals, erroneously sued as PNS Stores, Inc.), entered after the trial court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend. The trial court concluded that the Fair Employment and Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination against pregnant workers (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12945, subd. (a)), does not apply to hysterectomies that are not directly related to pregnancy or childbirth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">\n<em>Facts and Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">In 1996 appellant worked as a part-time cashier at MacFrugals and was denied a leave of absence for a \u201cdiagnostic hysterectomy.\u201d Appellant was terminated after the surgery because she had not worked enough hours to qualify for medical leave. MacFrugals encouraged her to reapply for employment as soon as she was able to resume her duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">Appellant filed suit alleging pregnancy discrimination (\u00a7 12945) and wrongful termination in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). The complaint alleged that MacFrugals discriminated against appellant because of her \u201cmedical condition which was related to pregnancy in violation of \u00a7 12945 of the California Government Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">MacFrugals demurred on the ground that the \u201cdiagnostic hysterectomy\u201d was not a pregnancy-related medical condition protected by the FEHA. The trial court ruled that \u201c[t]here is no case law which supports the position that a female having [a] hysterectomy would come under the broad definition of medical condition relating to pregnancy under [the] FEHA.\u201d The court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">\n<em>FEHA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">Pregnancy discrimination is a form of sex discrimination under the FEHA. <em>(Carr </em>v. <em>Bamabey\u2019s Hotel Corp. </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 14, 17 [28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 127]; 1 Quackenbush, Wrongful Employment Termination Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1998) \u00a7 2.72, p. 51.) Section 12945 states in pertinent part: \u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification: [H] (a) For any employer, because of the pregnancy, childbirth, or <em>related medical condition of any female employee, </em>to . . . discharge her from employment or ... to discriminate against her in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Appellant asserts that the phrase \u201crelated medical condition\u201d includes any medical condition involving a woman\u2019s reproductive organs.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The Fair Employment and Housing Commission defines the phrase \u201crelated medical condition\u201d to be \u201cany medically recognized physical or mental condition that is related to pregnancy or childbirth.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 7291.2, subd. (p).) Appellant has cited no authority, and we have found none, holding that section 12945 applies to medical conditions other than those directly related to pregnancy or childbirth. Appellant, however, contends that \u201crelated medical condition\u201d should be broadly construed to include any medical condition involving a woman\u2019s reproductive organs. The complaint, however, does not allege what \u201cmedical condition\u201d exists. As we shall explain, the phrase \u201cpregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition\u201d limits the reach of section 12945 to medical conditions directly related to pregnancy or childbirth.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\n<em>Statutory Construction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">There is no question but that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(k)) is a remedial statute and should be liberally construed. <em>(Ford Dealers Assn. </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 347, 356 [185 Cal.Rptr. 453, 650 P.2d 328].) \u201c \u2018Related\u2019 is a generous choice of wording, suggesting that interpretation should favor inclusion rather than exclusion in the close case.\u201d <em>(Pacourek </em>v. <em>Inland Steel Co. </em>(N.D.Ill. 1994) 858 F.Supp. 1393, 1402.)  This, however, is not a \u201cclose case.\u201d The phrase \u201crelated medical conditions\u201d cannot reasonably be construed to cover \u201cindirect\u201d related medical conditions, such as a \u201cdiagnostic hysterectomy\u201d performed years after childbirth.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">The general phrase \u201crelated medical conditions\u201d has reference to the specific enumeration of pregnancy and childbirth.  \u201c[W]hen a general term follows a specific one, the general term should be understood as a reference to subjects akin to the one with the specific enumeration.\u201d <em>(Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co. </em>v. <em>Train Dispatchers </em>(1991) 499 U.S. 117, 129 [111 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>1156, 1163, 113 L.Ed.2d 95, 107].) This is a restatement of the rule attributed to Lord Tenterden, i.e., <em>ejusdem generis: </em>\u201c \u2018 \u201c[W]here general words follow the enumeration of particular classes of persons or things, the general words will be construed as applicable only to persons or things of the same general nature or class as those enumerated.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>Capital Growth Investors XIV </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1142, 1160 [278 Cal.Rptr. 614, 805 P.2d 873].)  By reason of this rule of statutory construction, the medical condition must be connected to pregnancy or childbirth, i.e., the condition must flow directly therefrom. This rule of statutory construction controls unless a contrary legislative intent is apparent. <em>(Moore </em>v. <em>California State Bd. of Accountancy </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 999, 1012 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 358, 831 P.2d 798].)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\n<em>Pregnancy Discrimination Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Because appellant\u2019s FEHA claim is analogous to a title VII claim (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e), it may be evaluated under federal law inteipreting title VII cases. <em>(University of Southern California </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1028,1035 [272 Cal.Rptr. 264].) \u201cSection 701 (k) of Title VII, as amended in 1978 by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (\u2018PDA\u2019), makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge or otherwise discriminate against a woman because she is pregnant. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e(k) and 2000e-2(a) (1982).\u201d <em>(E.E.O.C. </em>v. <em>Hacienda Hotel </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 881 F.2d 1504, 1511.)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Section 12945 is based on the PDA. <em>(Pallas </em>v. <em>Pacific Bell </em>(9th Cir. 1991) 940 F.2d 1324, 1327.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>California Federal S. &amp; L. Assn. </em>v. <em>Guerra </em>(1987) 479 U.S. 272, 289-290 [107 S.Ct. 683, 693-694, 93 L.Ed.2d 613, 628-629] <em>(Guerra) </em>the Supreme Court held that section 12945, like the PDA, promotes equal employment opportunity and ensures that pregnant women do not lose their jobs. \u201cWe emphasize the limited nature of the benefits \u00a7 12945(b)(2) provides. The statute is narrowly drawn to cover only the period of <em>actual physical disability </em>on account of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.\u201d (479 U.S. at p. 290 [107 S.Ct. at p. 694, 93 L.Ed.2d at p. 629].)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Generally speaking, the federal courts have limited the PDA to employment discrimination based on pregnancy, the termination of a pregnancy, or childbirth. (E.g., <em>Turic </em>v. <em>Holland Hospitality, Inc. </em>(6th Cir. 1996) 85 F.3d 1211, 1214 [discharge of employee contemplating abortion violates PDA].)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>\u201cThe plain language of the PDA does not indicate that \u2018related medical conditions\u2019 should be interpreted broader than the context of \u2018pregnancy\u2019 and \u2018childbirth.\u2019\u201d <em>(Krauel </em>v. <em>Iowa Methodist Medical Center </em>(S.D. Iowa 1995) 915 F.Supp. 102, 112.) Thus a medical disability is not protected by the PDA unless there is a direct link between the medical condition and the employee\u2019s pregnancy. (E.g., <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Pyro Min. Co. </em>(W.D.Ky. 1990) 789 F.Supp. 867, 869 [denial of personal leave for breast-feeding does not violate PDA]; <em>Barrash </em>v. <em>Bowen </em>(4th Cir. 1988) 846 F.2d 927, 931-932 [same]; <em>Troupe </em>v. <em>May Dept. Stores Co. </em>(7th Cir. 1994) 20 F.3d 734, 738 [PDA does not require employers to offer maternity leave]; <em>Jirak </em>v. <em>Federal Exp. Corp. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1992) 805 F.Supp. 193, 195 [disability caused by menstrual cramps not protected by PDA].)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Pacourek </em>v. <em>Inland Steel Co., supra, </em>858 F.Supp. 1393, <em>Cleese </em>v. <em>Hewlett-Packard Co. </em>(D.Or. 1995) 911 F.Supp. 1312, and <em>Erickson </em>v. <em>Bd. of Governors of State Colleges </em>(N.D.Ill. 1995) 911 F.Supp. 316 is misplaced. There, the employers discriminated against female employees who wanted to become pregnant or intended to become pregnant in the near future. In <em>Cleese </em>v. <em>Hewlett-Packard Co., supra, </em>911 F.Supp. at page 1318, the United States District Court stated: \u201cA claim under the PDA requires that the employer discriminate against the employee <em>because of </em>her pregnancy. It seems to this court that if the employer has the requisite intent to discriminate against an employee because she is currently pregnant or is planning to become so in the near future, it does not matter if she has actually physically conceived at the time of the discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Here, the complaint alleges no facts that appellant intended to become pregnant, was pregnant, or terminated a pregnancy. Appellant argues that the failure to liberally construe section 12945 means that female employees will be punished for having hysterectomies. She asserts that a hysterectomy is related to pregnancy because it stops the ability to be pregnant. The short answer to this claim is that section 12945 and the PDA share one common goal: \u201cto end discrimination against pregnant workers\u201d <em>(Guerra, supra, </em>479 U.S. 272, 286 [107 S.Ct. 683, 692, 93 L.Ed.2d 613, 626]), not to stop pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">It is not within the legitimate power of an appellate court to rewrite section 12945. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Ramos) </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1261, 1271 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 333].)  \u201c \u2018Courts must take a statute as they find it, and if its operation results in inequality or hardship in some cases, the remedy therefore lies with the legislative authority. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.]  Here the language is clear, its application to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>[appellant] is not repugnant to the general purview of the act, and there is no compelling reason to disregard the plain language and underlying purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>(Unzueta </em>v. <em>Ocean View School Dist. </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1689, 1697 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 614].) The Legislature is free to expand section 12945 to include any medical condition involving a woman\u2019s reproductive organs.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Appellant has argued that the hysterectomy was performed because she suffered a miscarriage. But this theory was not alleged in the complaint. Appellant gave birth to a child in 1991, several years before the \u201cdiagnostic hysterectomy.\u201d Appellant, in opposing the demurrer, conceded that she \u201cwas not pregnant\u201d and that \u201cneither \u2018pregnancy\u2019 or \u2018childbirth\u2019 are directly involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">On review, the demurrer admits all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. <em>(Blank </em>v. <em>Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58].) Leave to amend is properly denied where, as here, the facts are not in dispute and no liability exists under the law. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The judgment is affirmed. Costs to MacFrugals.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Stone (S. J.), P. J., and Coffee, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied January 20, 1999.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-15\"> All statutory references are to the Government Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b413-9\"> The PDA states in relevant part that \u201cwomen affected by pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes ... as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work . . . .\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(k).)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
