A petition filed in juvenile court under Welfare and Institutions Code section 602, charged Khonsavanh S. with six counts of attempted murder (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 664, 187) and six counts of assault with a firearm (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)). The court dismissed the two counts related to the first incident, and the petition was amended to allege assault with a firearm (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)) in the second incident. The court made true findings and committed Khonsavanh to the California Youth Authority for a maximum term of 23 years and 4 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">Khonsavanh unpersuasively contends insufficient evidence supports the court\u2019s finding he aided and abetted others in the second incident. We agree, however, that the court erred by ordering Khonsavanh to undergo testing for acquired immunodefiency syndrome (AIDS), and that the correct maximum term of confinement is 18 years and 4 months. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">About midnight on March 13, 1997, Sothan D., an OBS member, was standing outside his apartment building. A Toyota Supra and a Volkswagen Jetta slowly approached, and Sothan saw a handgun pointing from the Supra. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>As numerous shots were fired, Sothan fled. He was not injured, but his dog was shot in the leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The next evening, fellow OKB members Khonsavanh, Monthanny N., the driver of the Supra, and \u201cNasi,\u201d the driver of the Jetta, attended a party. Members of OBS were loitering nearby. Khonsavanh, Monthanny, Nasi and others left to \u201cgo cruising\u201d in OBS territory; Khonsavanh rode in Nasi\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The same night, Sothan was at his neighbor Kathleen O.\u2019s house. Also present were Mao V., another OBS member, Howard S. and Carrie G. Sothan glanced outside and saw the same cars involved in the previous night\u2019s shooting. A young Asian male then peered through the open front door of Kathleen\u2019s house. Someone inside said, \u201c[ijt\u2019s on,\u201d and Sothan and others ducked. As Kathleen straggled to shut the door, three shots were fired at her. Ten to twenty more shots were fired at and into the house, many at head or chest level. No one was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Investigators traced the Supra to Monthanny. He admitted to Detective Stephen Kingkade, of the San Diego Police Department\u2019s Asian Gang Unit, that he was involved in the March 13 and 14 incidents. Monthanny led Detective Kingkade to the shooting sites, and to the home of \u201cLittle Lazy,\u201d later learned to be Khonsavanh\u2019s nickname.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Detective Kingkade and another officer contacted Khonsavanh. After listening to the taped interview with Monthanny, Khonsavanh agreed to talk to the officers. He admitted he and another male he did not know were in Nasi\u2019s Jetta during the March 14 incident. Khonsavanh reported that after leaving the party, they \u201cwent out cruising, and they cruised by where the OBS hang out,\u201d and \u201cstopped where the OBS were . . . .\u201d He said he was in the backseat, sleepy from drinking alcohol at the party, and \u201cthe next thing he remembers is being [awakened] by the sound of gunfire. He then saw his friend, Na [Nasi] get back into his vehicle, and they drove away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">At trial, Khonsavanh testified he believed Nasi would take him straight home from the party. Khonsavanh assertedly got drunk at the party and fell asleep in the backseat of the Jetta before it reached Kathleen\u2019s house. He denied knowing any guns were in the car or any plan to commit a crime. Khonsavanh admitted he was familiar with OBS territory because his grandmother once lived there. He also admitted he told Detective Kingkade that when he got in Nasi\u2019s car he was going to go cruising, and he and his companions \u201cwere cruising around and we stopped where the OBS were[.]\u201d Based on the demeanor and credibility of the witnesses, the court made true findings on the aiding and abetting charges stemming from the March 14 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">I. <em>Aiding and </em>Abetting<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">II. <em>AIDS Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Khonsavanh contends the court erred at the disposition hearing by ordering him to undergo an AIDS test.  The Attorney General claims waiver based on the failure to object below. It relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 353 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 627, 885 P.2d 1040], in which the Supreme Court held the waiver doctrine applies to claims regarding the trial court\u2019s failure to properly make or articulate its sentencing choices. \u201cRoutine defects in the court\u2019s statement of reasons are easily prevented and corrected if called to the court\u2019s attention. As in other waiver cases, we hope to reduce the number of errors committed in the first instance and preserve the judicial resources otherwise used to correct them.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">In its analysis, the court noted in <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott: </em>\u201cThe parties have ample opportunity to influence the court\u2019s sentencing choices under the determinate scheme. As a practical matter, both sides often know before the hearing what sentence is likely to be imposed and the reasons therefor. Such information is contained in the probation report, which is required in every felony case and generally provided to the court and parties before sentencing. [Citations.] In anticipation of the hearing, the defense may file, among other things, a statement in mitigation urging specific sentencing choices and challenging the information and recommendations contained in the probation report. [Citations.] Relevant argument and evidence also may be presented at sentencing. [Citations.]\u201d (9 Cal.4th at pp. 350-351.)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The Attorney General also cites <em>In re Abdirahman S. </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 963, 971 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 402], in which we explained waiver principles \u201care fully applicable to hearings at which conditions of juvenile probation are determined. In both adult and juvenile cases, the time to object is at the pertinent hearing, not for the first time on appeal. [Citation.] . . . Objection and waiver principles \u2018encourage prompt detection and correction of error, and . . . reduce the number of unnecessary appellate claims . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d We noted, \u201cthe juvenile court is vested with broad discretion to select appropriate probation conditions, and thus a minor has ample opportunity to influence the court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>Indeed, there, the minor successfully objected to one condition recommended by the probation officer. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>While this case does not concern sentencing choices or probation terms, we cannot overstress the importance of raising timely objections at juvenile court hearings in order to reduce the number of unnecessary appellate claims. Moreover, \u201c \u2018it is <em>unfair to the trial judge and to the adverse party </em>to take advantage of an error on appeal when it could easily have been corrected at the trial.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Doers </em>v. <em>Golden Gate Bridge etc. Dist. </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 180, 184-185, fn. 1 [151 Cal.Rptr. 837, 588 P.2d 1261], original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Nonetheless, under the peculiar circumstances here, we conclude waiver principles do not preclude appellate review. \u201cInvoluntary AIDS or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing is strictly limited by statute. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guardado </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 757, 763 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 81].) Nothing in the record-even remotely suggests any statutory basis for AIDS testing, or that such testing was being recommended, requested or considered. To the contrary, the issue only arose fleetingly at the close of the disposition hearing, when the court stated: \u201cAlso I think . . . AIDS testing was not included in the recommendation. That\u2019s also included. [H] Anything else? [H] If there is nothing further, we\u2019re adjourned in this matter.\u201d In sum, in stark contrast to <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>and <em>In re Abdirahman S., </em>it appears counsel here was utterly surprised by the court\u2019s ruling and had little opportunity to react. We thus reach the merits of Khonsavanh\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Generally, a person may not be involuntarily tested for \u201cevidence of antibodies to the probable causative agent of AIDS . . . .\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 120990, subd. (a).) The Legislature has declared, however, that the spread of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and AIDS in correctional facilities, including the California Youth Authority and other juvenile facilities, presents a danger to the public peace, safety and health, and a grave danger to inmates and law enforcement personnel, particularly due to the high number of assaults and other illegal activities. (\u00a7\u00a7 7500, subd. (a) &amp; (b), 7502, subd (a).) To ameliorate these dangers, the Legislature has determined that inmates exhibiting clinical symptoms of HIV or AIDS may be ordered to undergo testing. (\u00a7 7512.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Further, inmates who have exposed law enforcement personnel to their bodily fluids may be ordered to undergo testing, if the chief medical officer \u201cfinds that, considering all of the facts and circumstances, there is a significant risk that HIV was transmitted.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a77511, subd. (b), 7510.) Testing may also be ordered where there is a significant risk HIV was transmitted from inmate to inmate. (\u00a7 7512, subds. (a) &amp; (c).) When the subject of a request for testing under section 7512 is in the California Youth Authority or other juvenile facility, permission must be sought from his or her parents. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>denied, the facility may request an order from the juvenile court. (\u00a7 7512, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">In addition to the above, the court shall order a juvenile to undergo AIDS testing if the alleged victim of specified sexual crimes or the prosecuting attorney petitions for it, and the court finds probable cause exists to believe that a possible transfer of bodily fluid took place between the minor and the alleged victim. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 121055.) If the court makes true findings to specified sexual crimes, AIDS testing of the juvenile perpetrator is required. (\u00a7 1202.1.) A juvenile charged with assaulting a peace officer, firefighter or emergency personnel is also subject to involuntary AIDS testing upon a finding of probable cause. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 121060.)</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Here, there is simply no evidence any of the above provisions applies, and the Attorney General does not so contend. Accordingly, we conclude the court erred by ordering Khonsavanh to undergo AIDS testing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">III. <em>Maximum Term of Confinement</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> *</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The trial court\u2019s order that Khonsavanh be tested for AIDS is stricken, and the order of commitment is modified to fix a maximum term of confinement of 18 years, 4 months. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">Work, Acting P.
