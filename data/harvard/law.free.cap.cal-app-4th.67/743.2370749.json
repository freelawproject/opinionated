J.</author>\n<p id=\"AA_\">Like Shel Silverstein\u2019s proverbial Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout, the petitioner in this case, Robert S. Cunningham, would not take the garbage out. So, reminiscent of Sarah\u2019s daddy who, in the famous poem would scream and shout, Cunningham\u2019s homeowners association did the modem equivalent. It instituted litigation. The association\u2019s theory in essence was that Cunningham\u2019s property constituted a fire hazard. Local fire authorities, however, determined that his property posed no fire hazard, either indoors or outdoors. Even so, the lawyers for the homeowners association wrote letters demanding that he clear his bed of all papers and books, discard \u201coutdated\u201d clothing, and remove the papers, cardboard boxes and books from the floor area around his bed and dresser. Books that were \u201cconsidered standard reading material\u201d could, however, remain in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Cunningham is a senior citizen who suffers from Hodgkin\u2019s disease. The letter from the association\u2019s lawyers was, in essence, a demand backed up by threat of litigation telling him to straighten up his own bedroom. So Cunningham found a lawyer and sued the association by filing a cross-complaint for invasion of the right to privacy and breach of the homeowners association\u2019s covenants, conditions and restrictions (commonly referred to as CC&amp;R\u2019s).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The association\u2019s original complaint against Cunningham was soon settled; Cunningham agreed to abide by the rales. His cross-complaint against the association, by contrast, went to trial, with the issue being the <em>reasonableness </em>of the association\u2019s conduct after the litigation started. The trial was bifurcated between liability and damage phases, and the jury found in favor of Cunningham on the liability issue. However, before the damage phase could be heard, the trial judge granted the association\u2019s new trial motion, stating he believed the association had acted reasonably. And he went on to say that he would keep on granting new trial motions as long as the jury returned liability verdicts for Cunningham. Cunningham then petitioned for a writ to set aside the new trial order, which we now grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Treating the new trial order as what it <em>really </em>was\u2014a judgment notwithstanding the verdict\u2014it cannot stand. The association\u2019s behavior, in particular the sheer presumption of telling Cunningham what sort of reading material he could keep in his own home, was easily the sort of conduct that the jury could find was unreasonable and beyond the association\u2019s rights as stated in the CC&amp;R\u2019s. We hasten to add, however, that this is all we decide. We do <em>not </em>hold that a letter from the lawyers for a homeowner\u2019s association <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>threatening litigation unless an adult cleans up his or her own room is necessarily actionable. That issue has not been briefed. It is enough for the moment that we merely hold that, given the actual CC&amp;R\u2019s involved, the demands set forth in the letter were <em>unreasonable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">The homeowners association also sued the Department of Veterans Affairs, hoping to make it also responsible to clean up what it perceived to be Cunningham\u2019s mess. The trial judge ruled in favor of the department on that one, holding that it was, in <em>substance, </em>a lender, not an owner. We affirm the judgment in favor of the department because the applicable statute, Civil Code section 2920, also looks to substance over form.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Robert Cunningham bought an attached home subject to the CC&amp;R\u2019s of the Fountain Valley Chateau Blanc Homeowner\u2019s Association with the help of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The deal was structured as a traditional land sale installment contract, with the department taking title and entering into a recorded contract with Cunningham which showed him as the real purchaser of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">In September 1993 a roofing contractor hired by the association complained that he could not maneuver his equipment in Cunningham\u2019s backyard due to \u201cdebris\u201d there. That, and some previous complaints by neighbors, generated a letter from the association\u2019s lawyers demanding Cunningham not only clear his patio, but also open up the interior of his unit because there had been reports of fire hazards inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">In November 1993 Cunningham allowed association representatives to inspect his home\u2014albeit under threat of litigation. After the inspection Cunningham removed a number of personal items from the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">On December 9, 1993, the association returned for another inspection and decided Cunningham still had not removed enough of his belongings. That inspection generated another letter threatening litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">Litigation came on March 14, 1994, based on alleged fire and safety hazards arising from the junk and paper stored in and about Cunningham\u2019s home. The association named both Cunningham and the department as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">In May 1994, however, housing code and fire inspectors found no hazardous conditions on the property. Still, the association continued with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>litigation. And in early February 1995, the association\u2019s attorneys wrote a lengthy letter to Cunningham detailing the inadequacies of Cunningham\u2019s housekeeping and demanding he undertake a number of actions concerning the <em>interior </em>of his home. He was told to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">\u2014Clear his bed of all paper and books.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">\u2014Remove paper, cardboard boxes and books from the floor area around his bed and dresser.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">\u2014Remove all boxes and papers not currently in use in the living room and dining room because they increased the risk of fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">\u2014Clear all objects, including cardboard boxes, from his interior stairs and stairwells to allow passage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-9\">\u2014Not use his downstairs bathroom for storage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-10\">\u2014Maintain a functioning electrical light in his downstairs bathroom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">On top of these demands, the letter contained this statement: \u201cThe Association suggests that all outdated clothing that has not been worn in the last five years be removed and/or donated to the Salvation Army or similar organization. This would allow the upstairs bathroom to be used for what <em>[sic] </em>designed for. Any other remaining clothes could be stored in a walk-in closet.\u201d The letter further told Cunningham that \u201c[bjooks that are currently in book shelves, and which are considered standard reading material, can remain in place.\u201d It ended by reminding him that the association\u2019s attorney fees had reached over $34,000 and were continuing.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">Cunningham has Hodgkin\u2019s disease and had been, up to that point, representing himself. In February 1996, however, he found an attorney who agreed to represent him. His new attorney then obtained leave to file a cross-complaint against the association based on a variety of causes of action, including violations of the right to privacy, trespass, negligence and breach of contract, predicated on the association\u2019s use of the threat of litigation to gain entry to his home and force him to throw out various of his personal belongings. What the association had characterized as \u201cdebris\u201d now had a name: \u201cfurniture, magazines, books, appliances, bookshelves, plants, bicycles, camping equipment and other personal items.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">The complaint eventually was settled in August 1996, with Cunningham stipulating he was subject to the association\u2019s CC&amp;R\u2019s and agreeing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>such things as keeping his patio clean, maintaining reasonable access through his garage, and not storing gasoline or kerosene in the interior of the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">The complaint against the dpartment then went to a bench trial in September 1996, with judgment entered in favor of the department in December 1996. The judgment declared that the department was <em>not </em>the legal owner of the property or responsible for compliance with the CC&amp;R\u2019s. The association then timely appealed from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Meanwhile, Cunningham\u2019s cross-complaint against the association had been first bifurcated into liability and damage portions, with the liability portion tried separately in March 1996. During the trial, the judge <em>denied </em>the association\u2019s requests for a nonsuit and directed verdict, stating there <em>was </em>sufficient evidence for the case to go to the jury. The case went to the jury on an instruction asking it to determine the reasonableness of the association\u2019s \u201cactivities toward the plaintiff in regard to its alleged requests and/or demands to plaintiff for the removal of items from inside the residence\u201d during the period June 14, 1994, through May 1996. The jury was then told that the association acted reasonably if Cunningham\u2019s activities \u201cactually posed an unreasonable risk of fire danger\u201d <em>or </em>if it \u201csincerely, though mistakenly, believed, under the circumstances known to it, that [Cunningham\u2019s] residence constituted an unreasonable risk of fire danger.\u201d On the other hand, the jury could find that the association was unreasonable if \u201cno reasonable person\u201d would have \u201cbelieved under the circumstances known at the time\u201d that Cunningham\u2019s residence \u201cposed an unreasonable risk of fire danger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">On March 12, 1997, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Cunningham on the liability issue, having specifically found that the association had acted unreasonably. Less than a month later, the association responded with a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">On May 6, the trial judge stated that he believed the association acted \u201ctotally reasonably\u201d and therefore he would \u201cbreach the pure law\u201d and grant the new trial motion even though the damages phase had not yet been tried. Such a trial would be a \u201ccomplete waste of time.\u201d Indeed, said the trial court, \u201cif we try it again on the same facts, you can look for the same ruling.\u201d The court set a new trial for November 1997. Cunningham petitioned for a writ commanding the trial court to set aside the new trial order. We consolidated the writ proceeding with the association\u2019s appeal from the judgment in favor of the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">A <em>Trial Court Cannot Grant a Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict by Perpetually Granting New Trial Motions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">At the outset we must confront a serious anomaly in California\u2019s procedural law regarding attacks on decisions made by juries.  Typically, if a defendant believes that the plaintiff has not presented substantial evidence to establish a cause of action, the defendant may move for a nonsuit if the case has not yet been submitted to the jury, a directed verdict if the case is about to be submitted, or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (jnov) following an unfavorable jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">While made at different times, the three motions are analytically the same and governed by the same rules. (See <em>Beavers </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 310, 327 [274 Cal.Rptr. 766] [\u201c. . . different aspects of the same judicial function and have long been held to be governed by the same rules\u201d].) The function of these motions is to prevent the moving defendant from the necessity of undergoing any further exposure to legal liability when there is insufficient evidence for an adverse verdict. (E.g., <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Willson </em>(1958) 51 Cal.2d 94, 99 [331 P.2d 48].) Put another way, the purpose of motions for nonsuit, directed verdicts and jnovs is to allow a party to prevail as a matter of law where the relevant evidence is <em>already in.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">And naturally, given the constitutional right to jury trial and a policy of judicial economy against willy-nilly disregarding juries\u2019 hard work (even, in the case of a motion for nonsuit, the work of the jury in listening to the case up to that point), the basic rules regarding these motions are predictably strict. Conflicts in the evidence are. resolved <em>against </em>the moving defendant and in favor of the plaintiff; all reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence are drawn against the moving defendant and in favor of the plaintiff. (See, e.g., <em>Nally </em>v. <em>Grace Community Church </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 278, 291 [253 Cal.Rptr. 97, 763 P.2d 948] [for nonsuit, \u201c \u2018 \u201cevery legitimate inference which may be drawn from the evidence\u201d \u2019 \u201d should be drawn in plaintiff\u2019s favor, and the evidence should be evaluated \u201c \u2018in the light most favorable to the plaintiff\u2019 \u201d]; <em>CC-California Plaza Associates </em>v. <em>Paller &amp; Goldstein </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 1042, 1050-1051 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 382] [\u201c \u2018A nonsuit or a directed verdict may be granted \u201conly when, disregarding conflicting evidence and giving to plaintiff\u2019s evidence all the value to which it is legally entitled, herein indulging in every legitimate inference which may be drawn from that evidence, the result is a determination that there is no evidence of sufficient substantiality to support a verdict in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>plaintiff if such a verdict were given.\u201d\u201d\u2019 (italics omitted)]; <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Sunnyside Products, Inc. </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1497, 1510 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 266] [for judgments notwithstanding the verdict, \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018[i]f there is any substantial evidence, or reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, in support of the verdict, the motion should be denied\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">By contrast, the motion for a new trial has a different purpose. As the Supreme Court noted in the famous case of <em>Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 458-459 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937], the function of a new trial motion is to allow a <em>reexamination </em>of an issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The difference in purpose means a difference in standards. Unlike non-suits, directed verdicts, and judgments notwithstanding the verdict\u2014we will call these the \u201cdispositive\u201d motions\u2014granting a new trial does not entail a victory for one side or the other. It simply means the reenactment of a <em>process </em>which may eventually yield a winner. Accordingly, the judge has much wider latitude in deciding the motion (e.g., <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Evans </em>(1970) 4 Cal.App.3d 115, 121 [84 Cal.Rptr. 6]), which is reflected in an abuse of discretion standard when the ruling is reviewed by the appellate court. A new trial motion allows a judge to disbelieve witnesses, reweigh evidence and draw reasonable inferences contrary to that of the jury, and still, on appeal, retain a presumption of correctness that will be disturbed only upon a showing of manifest and unmistakable abuse. <em>(Mercer </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 104, 112 [65 Cal.Rptr. 315, 436 P.2d 315].) Hence, given the latitude afforded a judge in new trial motions, orders granting new trials are \u201cinfrequently reversed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 113.)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Now here is the anomaly. The reason for the \u201cdispositive\u201d motions is that the plaintiff cannot win, because the plaintiff has presented insufficient evidence to support a favorable judgment. Yet a new trial motion may <em>itself </em>be based on insufficient evidence to support a favorable judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 657, clause 6 [\u201c. . . for any of the following causes \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 : [1D \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [ID 6. Insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict or other decision, or the verdict or other decision is against law.\u201d].) Moreover, even though there are some extra requirements on the judge before he or she may grant a new trial on insufficient evidence,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the fact remains that the trial judge may, in granting such a motion, draw inferences and resolve conflicts in the evidence different from that of the jury. (E.g., <em>Widener </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number><em>&amp; Electric Co. </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 415, 440 [142 Cal.Rptr. 304] [\u201c \u2018In passing upon a motion for a new trial made upon the ground of insufficiency of the evidence the trial judge is required to weigh the evidence; and in doing so he may disbelieve witnesses and draw inferences contrary to those supporting the verdict.\u2019 \u201d].) Accordingly, it is natural to ask, if a trial judge is convinced that a litigant has no substantial evidence to justify a favorable judgment, why take the hard and narrow road of granting one of the dispositive motions with the attendant stringent standard of review when he or she can take a much easier and wider path by granting a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The answer is this: Inherent in the new trial statute is the following, but unstated, premise: When a trial judge grants a motion for new trial based on insufficiency of the evidence, it is <em>not </em>because the judge has concluded that the plaintiff <em>must </em>lose, but only because the evidence in the trial that actually took place did not justify the verdict.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Evidence might exist to justify the verdict, but for some reason did not get admitted; perhaps the plaintiff\u2019s attorney neglected to call a crucial witness or ask the right questions. <em>There is still the real possibility that the plaintiff has a meritorious case. </em>Indeed, such a conclusion is a simple corollary from the observation of our Supreme Court in the venerable <em>Auto Equity </em>decision that the essential function of the new trial is to <em>reexamine </em>the evidence. <em>(Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>57 Cal.2d at pp. 458-459.) At the same time, misuse of a new trial motion as a <em>dispositive </em>motion renders surplusage the Legislature\u2019s provisions for nonsuits, directed verdicts, and judgments notwithstanding the verdict. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 581c, 629-630 [providing respectively for dispositive motions].)</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">It is true that we might analyze the judge\u2019s grant of a new trial prior to the trial of the damages issue as a simple error of prematurity. The trial judge himself appears to have recognized that he was legally incorrect\u2014\u201cbreach the pure law\u201d was the telltale phrase\u2014in not waiting for the damages phase to be completed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">.But that wasn\u2019t the real error. The real error was misusing a motion for new trial as a de facto dispositive motion; the trial court signaled its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>intention by stating on the record that plaintiff could <em>never </em>prevail given the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s position.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the trial court pointed to no problem in the process of the trial which warranted a retrial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The bottom line is that the judge might as well have said the association acted reasonably <em>as a matter of law </em>and given judgment for the defendant there and then.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">We will therefore <em>not </em>review the trial judge\u2019s new trial decision according to the usual abuse of discretion standard. It is clear from the record that the granting of the motion was a de facto judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and we will review the order according to those standards.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This resolution is important, because it means that we must conclude the jury rejected the association\u2019s \u201csincere-though-mistaken\u201d belief in the fire danger posed by Cunningham\u2019s unit, and that, as a matter of the technical minutia of combustibility, no reasonable person would believe there really was a risk of fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">There is precedent for looking to the substance of a new trial motion rather than just its title. In <em>Jean </em>v. <em>Collins Construction Co. </em>(1963) 215 Cal.App.2d 410 [30 Cal.Rptr. 149] the defendant moved for nonsuit. The motion was granted, then the plaintiff moved for a new trial on the ground that granting the nonsuit was error. <em>That </em>motion was also granted. On appeal, the court looked to the <em>substance </em>of the so-called new trial motion and determined it wasn\u2019t a new trial motion after all, but simply a request to reconsider the earlier nonsuit. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 414.) Along the same lines, we will treat the trial judge\u2019s order as what it really was: the granting of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. In that sense, this writ proceeding has the <em>substance </em>of an appeal from such a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>\n<em>It Cannot Be Said That the Association Acted Reasonably as a Matter of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The association argues it was perfectly reasonable for the trial judge to grant a motion for new trial after the completion of the liability phase because the trial judge decided \u201call issues\u201d of liability against Cunningham. As we have pointed out above, the logical implication of this argument is that the trial judge did not, in substance, grant a new trial motion but a de facto judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">While we must pass on the propriety of the judge\u2019s decision to grant the de facto jnov, we stress that there are at least two issues which we expressly do not decide in this proceeding: (1) Whether the association can be held liable for gaining access and ostensible voluntary removal <em>of </em>property through no more than a <em>threat </em>of <em>court proceedings. </em>(I.e., whether the mere specter of lawful resort to the courts can ever be the kind of \u201ccoercion\u201d that would violate the CC &amp; R\u2019s.) (2) Whether the jury should have even decided the question of whether the association\u2019s actions were <em>reasonable. </em>It is, of course, one thing for the jury to determine, as factual matters, that there really was no fire danger posed by Cunningham\u2019s unit, or that the association <em>actually believed </em>in a fire danger. Those are matters of fact. It is another to allow <em>the jury </em>(as distinct from the judge) to make the <em>ultimate </em>call that, at the end of the day, the association acted \u201cunreasonably.\u201d However, because the association has not raised these specific points in its defense, we do not address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Turning then to what we must decide, we begin with the now established fact that there was no actual fire danger that a reasonable person would perceive\u2014the relevant city departments had, after all, found no fire hazard. Further, the association did not have a good faith, albeit mistaken, belief in that danger. The jury resolved those questions against the association and, in what is really an appeal from a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, those are the operative facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">In light of those operative facts, it is virtually impossible to say the association acted reasonably. It is true the CC&amp;R\u2019s require \u201cowners\u201d to \u201cmaintain the interiors of their residential units and garages, including the interior wall, ceilings, floors and permanent fixtures and appurtenances in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>clean, sanitary and attractive condition.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is also true that they provide for entry by the board \u201cwhen necessary in connection with maintenance, landscaping or construction for which the board is responsible.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But these sections of the CC&amp;R\u2019s cannot reasonably be read to allow an association to dictate the amount of clutter in which a person chooses to live; one man\u2019s old piece of junk is another man\u2019s objet d\u2019art. The association\u2019s rather high-handed attempt to micromanage Cunningham\u2019s personal housekeeping\u2014telling him how he could and could not use the interior rooms of his own house\u2014clearly crossed the line and was beyond the purview of any legitimate interest it had in preventing undesirable external effects or maintaining property values.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Particularly galling to us\u2014and clearly to the jury as well\u2014was the presumptuous attempt to lecture Cunningham about getting rid of his old <em>clothes, </em>the way he kept his own bedroom, and the kind of \u201creading material\u201d he could have.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To obtain some perspective here, we have the spectacle of a homeowners association telling a senior citizen suffering from Hodgkin\u2019s disease that, in effect, he could not read in his own bed!<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When Cunningham bought his unit, we seriously doubt that he contemplated the association would ever tell him to clean up his own bedroom like some parent nagging an errant teenager.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">If it is indeed true that homeowners associations can often function \u201cas a second municipal government\u201d <em>(Chantiles </em>v. <em>Lake Forest II Master Homeowners Assn. </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 914, 922 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 1]), then we have a clear cut case of a \u201cnanny state\u201d\u2014nanny in almost a literal sense\u2014 going too far. The association\u2019s actions flew in the face of one of the most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>ancient precepts of American society and Anglo-American legal culture. \u201cA man\u2019s house is his castle\u201d was not penned by anonymous, but by the famous jurist Sir Edward Coke in 1628.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The jury could thus find that the association did not act reasonably under the circumstances (and that is all we decide). The de facto judgment notwithstanding the verdict masquerading as a new trial order therefore must be the de facto equivalent of reversed. The case must now proceed to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">\n<em>The Department of Veterans Affairs Was Indeed a Lender, Not an Owner, and Therefore Not Bound by the CC&amp;R\u2019s</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Cunningham purchased his home through the <em>state </em>\u201cCal-Vet\u201d program enacted after World War I\u2014not to be confused with the traditional \u201cG. I. Loan\u201d program operated by the federal government. (See generally, <em>Department of Veterans Affairs </em>v. <em>Duerksen </em>(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 149, 155 [187 Cal.Rptr. 832].)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Cal-Vet program (see Mil. &amp; Vet. Code, \u00a7 987.50 et seq.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is specifically targeted at California veterans. (See generally, <em>Del Monte </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1009 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 826, 824 P.2d 632] [holding that conditioning program on California residency at a \u201cfixed point in the past\u201d violated the federal equal protection clause].) The program is funded by general obligation bonds. (Former \u00a7 987.567.)</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">In keeping with its early 1920\u2019s enactment, and in contrast with the federal program (in which the Department of Veterans guarantees loans to buy homes), the state program operates by having the Department of Veterans Affairs <em>take title </em>to the home the veteran seeks to buy, with the veteran entering into a long term installment contract with the department at a low rate of interest. (138 Cal.App.3d at p. 151; see \u00a7\u00a7 987.69, 987.51.) The device of taking title allows the department to assure that a veteran or a member of his or her family will actually reside on the property until the loan is paid off or the property is sold. (See <em>Nadler </em>v. <em>California Veterans Board </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 707, 712 [199 Cal.Rptr. 546]; \u00a7 987.60.) Of course, there are provisions for a waiver of occupancy requirements under certain circumstances, including reentry into active military service. (\u00a7\u00a7 987.62-987.63.)</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">The installment sales contract obligates the veteran to keep the property \u201cin good order and repair all buildings, fences, and other permanent improvements,\u201d and maintain insurance. (\u00a7 987.75.) In the same vein, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>veteran must pay all taxes and assessments and other charges against the property and keep the buildings on it in \u201cgood order and repair,\u201d and, if he or she doesn\u2019t, the department has the <em>discretionary </em>right to pay the taxes and assessments or even do repair work itself. (\u00a7 987.75; cf. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Department of Veterans Affairs </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 392 [224 Cal.Rptr. 149] [noting Cal-Vet did not have a duty to procure insurance, but could do so at its discretion and assess the cost to the veteran].)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Because Cal-Vet loans involve land sale installment contracts, they are, as a technical matter, loans enforced by a forfeiture rather than a foreclosure. <em>(Department of Veterans Affairs </em>v. <em>Duerksen, supra, </em>138 Cal.App.3d at p. 157 [\u201cThe simple fact is that the Legislature has, by section 987.77, expressly authorized the Department to force a forfeiture when a veteran breaches his Cal-Vet contract.\u201d].) Indeed, the applicable statute, section 987.77, provides for a classic forfeiture remedy. (\u201cAll payments theretofore made shall be deemed to be rental paid for occupancy.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">However, when read in conjunction with section 2920, subdivision (b) of the Civil Code, it is clear that a Cal-Vet sales contract is still, in reality, a mortgage. That statute provides that \u201cany security device or instrument, other than a deed of trust, that confers a power of sale . . . after a breach of the obligation\u201d is a mortgage for purposes of default (see also Civ. Code, \u00a7 2924).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">As Civil Code section 2920 would lead one to believe, the department clearly acts as a lender, as distinct from owner, on a Cal-Vet loan. The veteran retains control and actual possession of the property; he or she has all the indicia of ownership except legal title.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Accordingly, we must agree with the trial court that because the department functions as a lender, not an owner, it is not bound by the CC&amp;R\u2019s.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The department only had options against <em>Cunningham\u2019s </em>poor management of the property, not obligations. The department did not control how Cunningham kept house, he did. The idea that <em>it </em>might be held responsible as a kind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>of backup enforcement arm to the homeowners association is simply a makeweight to support a claim against the department for legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Our conclusion should hardly serve as some novel legal sunburst. Anyone who has ever bought a home would understand that the true legal substance of the veteran\u2019s loan obtained by Cunningham was to make him the owner of the house, with the department being the lender, even if technical legal title were retained in the department as a security device. The law always favors substance over form as a general rule in any event (see Civ. Code, \u00a7 3528), but here we even have a specific statute, Civil Code section 2920, subdivision (b), which mandates that we look to the substance of an installment sales contract as well. The trial judge was, accordingly, correct in rendering judgment for the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The judgment in favor of the department is affirmed. The department is to recover its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the trial court to vacate the order granting the association\u2019s new trial motion and to enter a new and different order denying the motion, and to proceed with the second half of the bifurcated trial on the issue of damages. Cunningham is to recover his costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Because the trial judge predetermined that Cunningham was to lose, we direct the presiding judge of the superior court to reassign the case to another judge for further proceedings. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 170.1, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">Wallin, J., and Bedsworth, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 30, 1998, and the petition of real party in interest for review by the Supreme Court was denied January 27, 1999. Kennard, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-7\"> The 10th paragraph of section 657 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: \u201cA new trial shall not be granted upon the ground of insufficiency of the evidence . . . unless after weighing the evidence the court is convinced from the entire record, including reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>inferences therefrom, that the court or jury clearly should have reached a different verdict or decision.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b618-9\"> The questions arise: Suppose there is evidence to justify the jury\u2019s verdict, but the great weight favors the other side? Would granting a new trial be an abuse of discretion because it represented a substitution of the court\u2019s view for the jury\u2019s? We need not explore these matters. We need only note for the moment that a new trial motion based on insufficient evidence certainly entails the possibility that the plaintiff could still win on retrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b618-10\"> And in that respect he was right: It is well established hornbook law that a motion for new trial is premature where the plaintiff has prevailed on the liability issue if the motion is made before the damages phase has even commenced. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 232.5 (\u201cAny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>motion for a new trial following a bifurcated trial shall be made after all the issues are tried . . . .\u201d); e.g., <em>Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>57 Cal.2d at pp. 458-459; <em>Cobb </em>v. <em>University of So. California </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1140, 1144-1145 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 71]; <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 952, 955-956 [103 Cal.Rptr. 399]; <em>Meyser </em>v. <em>American Bldg. Maintenance, Inc. </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 933, 937 [149 Cal.Rptr. 808].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b619-9\"> That is because the trial judge said so, clearly, on the record. But what is to prevent a trial judge, bound and determined to wear down one of the litigants, from granting a new trial motion on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence and then discreetly keeping mum? The answer is that the granting of a <em>second </em>new trial motion based on insufficient evidence after the plaintiff has again prevailed requires the appellate court to look at the whole record to see if the trial court is up to any sort of unarticulated mischief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b619-10\"> The announced intention to assure that plaintiff never won would mean that granting of the new trial motion in this case would constitute an \u201cabuse\u201d of the trial judge\u2019s discretion, even assuming that were the applicable standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b619-11\"> In support of the grant of the new trial motion, the association makes a \u201cjudicial economy\u201d argument, i.e., there is no reason to waste time with a damage trial if the plaintiff must lose anyway. The irony here is that this very argument underscores the essential nature of the motion not as a new trial motion, but as one for a jnov.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b621-6\"> Article XIII of the CC&amp;R\u2019s states: \u201cThe owners shall maintain the interiors of their residential units and garages, including the interior walls, ceilings, floors and permanent fixtures and appurtenances in a clean, sanitary and attractive condition, reserving to each owner, however, complete discretion as to choice of furniture, furnishings and interior decorating and interior landscaping.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b621-7\"> Article XIV states: \u201cThe Board or its agents may enter any unit when necessary in connection with maintenance, landscaping or construction for which the Board is responsible. Such entry shall be made with as little inconvenience to the owners as practicable, and any damage caused thereby shall be repaired by the Board, at the expense of the maintenance fund.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b621-8\"> At oral argument, counsel for the association was confronted with the letter concerning \u201cappropriate reading material\u201d and what Cunningham could have strewn about his own bed. Counsel conspicuously did not make an argument that the letter was a matter of minimizing combustible materials <em>qua </em>combustible materials. Temperatures must, after all, get pretty high before paper starts burning. (Cf. Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451 (1953).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b621-9\"> Or, to give the association the benefit of the doubt, of telling him that he had to limit the amount of books, newspapers and magazines within easy reach when he did read in bed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b622-10\"> Oxford Dictionary of Quotations (1992) at page 209, referencing The Third Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England (1628).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b622-11\"> The G.

A much harder case, for example, would be one where a homeowner leased out his or her residence with an option to buy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
