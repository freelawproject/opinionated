Quan and Lucita L. Quan (insureds.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">Because the SAC reveals no potential that the insurer could be liable to indemnify its insureds for any of the claims presented in the underlying action, we affirm. In the published portion of this opinion, we explain that the underlying action did not raise any potential for coverage under the insurance policy\u2019s \u201cbodily injury\u201d coverage. In the unpublished portion, we explain that we need not consider the potential for coverage under the insurance policy\u2019s \u201cpersonal injury\u201d coverage in view of the procedural posture of this case, that (in view of the lack of any potential for either \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cpersonal injury\u201d coverage) we need not determine the application of the \u201cwilful act\u201d exclusion created by Insurance Code section 533, and that unpled claims against Lucita Quan do not create a potential for coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">I. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"AyG\">A. <em>The Underlying Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">In 1989, Darlene Bradford (claimant) filed a civil action (the underlying action or underlying complaint) against insured James Quan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The underlying complaint by the claimant asserts four brief causes of action, for \u201cassault and battery,\u201d \u201cintentional infliction of emotional distress,\u201d \u201cnegligence,\u201d and \u201cnegligent infliction of emotion [sz'c] distress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The underlying complaint was not served on the insured until March of 1992, when the insured promptly tendered his defense to the insurer. That same month, the insurer assigned the defense of the insured to defense counsel chosen by the insurer, under a \u201creservation of rights\u201d pending results of the insurer\u2019s coverage investigation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>The insurer defended the action through its selected defense counsel for a period of nine months while it assertedly conducted a coverage investigation. On December 18, 1992, the insurer withdrew from the defense and denied any indemnity obligation.* **<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Although the record does not indicate the manner in which the underlying action was sent to judicial arbitration, the SAC in this action includes as an exhibit a July 1993 letter from the insureds\u2019 subsequently retained defense counsel enclosing a document entitled \u201cAmended Findings and Award of Arbitrator.\u201d Whatever their origin, the findings and award were apparently rendered a nullity by a request for trial de novo, inasmuch as the matter proceeded to two mistrials before the underlying action was finally tried to a judgment in favor of the claimant in May 1995. The insured appealed the underlying judgment, which was reversed by this court on December 3, 1997<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The record does not further disclose the immediate status of the underlying case.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">B. <em>The Coverage Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The allegations of the insureds\u2019 second amended complaint span more than 100 pages, with nearly 200 pages of exhibits. Of necessity, the factual allegations may only be summarized. They fall into two broad categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">First, the insureds allege that The insurer\u2019s refusal to agree to defend and indemnify was not only erroneous, but unreasonable so as to constitute a breach of the implied covenant, in light of: (1) the allegations of the underlying complaint; (2) information the insurer had gathered or learned from other sources by the time it withdrew from the defense after nine months; and (3) information it learned after withdrawing from the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">Second, the insureds allege that the insurer not only conducted itself improperly in withdrawing from the defense, but also in the manner in which it investigated the coverage issues, and in the way it defended the insured for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>the nine-month period in which it was conducting a coverage investigation. The insureds allege that from the very nature of the allegations of the underlying complaint, the insurer knew there was a coverage issue of the type that should give rise to a right to independent counsel under Civil Code section 2860, but deprived the insured of that right for nine months while trying to build the case for a coverage denial, and then cast the insured adrift. In the interim, the insured\u2019s defense was allegedly compromised, and settlement opportunities within policy limits were either not communicated to the insured, or improperly allowed to lapse.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">The insurer demurred to each cause of action on the ground that it failed to state a cause of action. The trial court sustained the demurrers and ordered the action dismissed under Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(1). The insureds appeal from the order of dismissal. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 581d.)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">On appeal, the insureds contend only that their complaint \u201cwas and is legally sufficient to state causes of action against [insurer] for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing arising from [insurer\u2019s] unjustified failure and refusal to defend [insureds] against [claimant\u2019s] action.\u201d Thus, only three of the insureds\u2019 causes of action are potentially pertinent: the first cause of action, for \u201cdeclaratory relief,\u201d the second cause of action (erroneously titled as an \u201cimplied covenant\u201d claim) which alleges that the insurer\u2019s refusal to defend and indemnify is a breach of the insurance contract, and the portion of the third cause of action which alleges that the insurer\u2019s refusal to defend and indemnify further constituted a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">n. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The complaint must be liberally construed with a view to substantial justice between the parties. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 452.)  A demurrer is treated as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not \u201c \u2018contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Blank </em>v. <em>Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Cal.3d 311, 318 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58]). Under <em>Blank, </em>the complaint must be given a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context. When a demurrer is sustained, the court determines whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. And when it is sustained without leave to amend, the court decides whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment. If it can be, the trial court has abused its discretion and the reviewing court will reverse; if not, there has been no abuse of discretion. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The burden of proving the \u201creasonable possibility\u201d of cure by amendment is on the plaintiff, but the showing need not be made in the trial court so long as it is made to the reviewing court. <em>(Careau &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc. </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1381 [272 Cal.Rptr. 387].)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Here, the insureds make no showing of how the SAC could be amended if it is determined not to state a cause of action. The record reflects three ever-lengthening complaints and sets of exhibits comprising hundreds of pages. There is no indication that every fact allegedly known to the insurer at any time with regard to the underlying action is not either expressly alleged and/or substantiated with exhibits to the SAC. Accordingly, there is no reason to consider whether the trial court abused its discretion in light of the possibility of further amendment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (See <em>Michaelian </em>v. <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1105, fn. 4 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 133].)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The interpretation of an insurance policy as applied to undisputed facts (here, the facts alleged by the insureds) is a question of law for the court, which is not bound by the trial court\u2019s construction. <em>(Collin </em>v. <em>American Empire Ins. Co. </em>(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 787, 802 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 391].)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Ayz\">A. <em>Nature of the Duty to Defend</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The parties agree the dispositive issue is whether the insurer had a duty to defend. The principles governing determination of the existence of that duty are oft-stated: \u201c[A] liability insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured against claims that create a potential for indemnity. <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 263 [54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number><em>(Gray).) </em>As we said in <em>Gray, </em>\u2018the carrier must defend a suit which <em>potentially </em>seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 275, italics in original.) Implicit in this rule is the principle that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify; an insurer may owe a duty to defend its insured in an action in which no damages ultimately are awarded. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Horace Mann Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Barbara B. </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1076, 1081 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 846 P.2d 792].) \u201cThe determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy. Facts extrinsic to the complaint also give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal the possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy. <em>(Gray, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 276.)\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Thus the Supreme Court in <em>Montrose Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 287, 300 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153], stated: \u201cTo prevail [on the issue of the duty to defend], the insured must prove the existence of a <em>potential for coverage, </em>while the insurer must establish <em>the absence of any such potential. </em>In other words, the insured need only show that the underlying claim <em>may </em>fall within policy coverage; the insurer must prove it <em>cannot. </em>Facts merely tending to show that the claim is not covered, or may not be covered, but are insufficient to eliminate the possibility that resultant damages (or the nature of the action) will fall within the scope of coverage, therefore add no weight to the scales. Any seeming disparity in the respective burdens merely reflects the substantive law.\u201d The <em>Montrose </em>court reiterated the statement in <em>Gray </em>that \u201c \u2018the insurer need not defend if the third party complaint <em>can by no conceivable theory raise a single issue which could bring it within the policy coverage. </em>\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 300, quoting <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co. </em>(1996) 65 Cal.2d 263, 276, fn. 15 [54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168], italics added by the <em>Montrose </em>court.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Nevertheless, the obligation to defend is not without limits. \u201cRather, such a duty is limited by \u2018the nature and kind <em>of risk covered by the </em>policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>(La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 27, 39 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 100, 884 P.2d 1048], quoting from <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co., supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 275, italics in original.) \u201c \u2018[T]he duty to defend derives from the insurer\u2019s coverage obligations assumed under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>insurance contract.\u2019 [Citation.] Thus, \u2018where there is <em>no potential </em>for coverage, there is no duty to defend.\u2019 \u201d <em>(La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Industrial Indemnity Co., supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th 27, 40, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">In <em>Michaelian </em>v. <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th 1093, the court further explained the proper focus in reviewing the sustaining of a demurrer to a similar action for declaratory relief, breach of insurance contract, and \u201cbad faith\u201d post <em>-Montrose: </em>\u201cA complaint is to be \u2018liberally construed\u2019 in favor of potential coverage. [Citation.] Since pleadings are easily amended, the proper focus is on the facts alleged, rather than the theories for recovery. [Citation.] However, the insured \u2018 \u201cmay not speculate about unpled third party claims to manufacture coverage.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Michaelian, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at p.1106.)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">B. <em>Pertinent Terms of the Policy at Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The insureds\u2019 complaint attaches the policy as an exhibit. The liability coverage of the policy, as pertinent here, states: \u201cWe shall pay all sums for which you may become legally obligated to pay as damages1<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>1 caused by: 1. Bodily Injury, Personal Injuryfc] 2. Advertising Injury ...[;] 3. Property damage ftQ We shall defend any suit against you claiming these damages, even if the allegations of the suit are groundless or false.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\u201cDamages\u201d is defined as \u201cthe cost of compensating those who suffer bodily injury, personal injury, advertising injury or property damage1<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] from an occurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">\u201cBodily Injury\u201d is defined as \u201cphysical injury to, sickness or disease sustained by the body of any person, . . .\u201d For purposes of \u201cbodily injury,\u201d \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which result in bodily injury or property damage you neither expected nor intended. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">C. <em>The Factual Allegations of the Underlying Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">The underlying complaint<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> contains four causes of action, for \u201cassault and battery,\u201d \u201cintentional infliction of emotional distress,\u201d \u201cnegligence,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>\u201cnegligent infliction of emotional distress.\u201d Notwithstanding the assertion of both intentional and negligence-based theories of liability, the facts alleged to give rise to that liability are virtually the same for all four causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">As the factual basis for her claim of assault and battery, the claimant alleges that \u201cOn or about April 7, 1988, . . . Defendant with force and against the consent of Plaintiff, assaulted Plaintiff and raped, ravished, and carnally knew her.\u201d As the factual basis for her claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, claimant alleges that \u201cOn or about April 7, 1988, Defendant James Quan forcibly and without Plaintiff\u2019s consent kissed and had sexual intercourse with Plaintiff. flQ Defendant, James Quan\u2019s conduct was intentional and malicious, and done with the purpose of causing Plaintiff to suffer humiliation, mental anguish, and emotional and physical distress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The claimant\u2019s cause of action for negligence expressly incorporates her prior allegation that the insured \u201cwith force and against the consent of Plaintiff, assaulted Plaintiff and raped, ravished, and carnally knew her,\u201d and her prior description of those acts as \u201cwrongful and malicious.\u201d The claimant then adds that \u201cOn or about April 7, 1988, Plaintiff was seventeen years old and was in the presence of the Defendant upon his request of having her help him with his tax return and vacuuming of a house he owns . . . . flQ At said time and place, Defendant negligently embrassed <em>[sic\\</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>kissed and had sexual intercourse with Plaintiff without her consent so as to cause her to lose her virginity, suffer physical pain and emotional distress . . . .\u201d The claimant\u2019s cause of action for \u201cnegligent infliction of emotional distress\u201d specifically incorporates the same factual allegations, adding that \u201cSaid defendant knew, or should have known, that his failure to exercise due care in his actions with Plaintiff would cause Plaintiff severe emotional distress. RQ Said defendant, by kissing her and forcibly having sexual intercourse with her without her consent breached his duty of care owed to Plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">D. <em>Facts the Insurer Knew in Addition to the Allegations of the Underlying Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The insureds allege, and for purposes of demurrer the court assumes, that the insurer knew the following additional facts at the time it withdrew from the defense. The insurer knew that Quan is \u201cinnocent,\u201d and that he pled not guilty to the original criminal charges, which were later dismissed. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>that dismissal was reversed in yet another appeal, the insurer knew that the insured then accepted a plea bargain solely to buy his peace of mind. Pursuant to the terms of the plea bargain, the insured pled no contest to a \u201cwobbler\u201d offense of \u201csexual battery\u201d under Penal Code section 243.4, which may be sentenced as either a misdemeanor or a felony. The offense was reduced to a misdemeanor, and after he fulfilled the terms of his probation, the insured\u2019s conviction was set aside, a plea of not guilty was entered, and the complaint was dismissed. The insurer also \u201cknew\u201d that the \u201cno contest\u201d plea could not be used to establish liability in the civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Four days after receiving notice of the claim, the insurer conducted a recorded interview of James Quan, a transcript of which is attached to the complaint. The insured told the interviewer that he and his wife owned the apartment building where the incident allegedly took place, but the insured denied paying, hiring, touching or assaulting the claimant. At most, the insured thought the claimant may have \u201cbumped\u201d into him with her chest when they were walking. The insured\u2019s defense counsel in the underlying civil action gave the insurer deposition summaries that tended to indicate the innocence of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The insurer also received correspondence from the insured\u2019s defense counsel that raised an issue as to potential liability based on a distinction between rape and \u201cunpermitted touching.\u201d The claimant\u2019s counsel had sent a letter to the insured\u2019s defense counsel articulating various \u201cnegligence\u201d theories, among which was that the insured may have \u201cmisunderstood\u201d communication from the claimant and mistook it for consent. The claimant\u2019s counsel sent another letter purportedly asserting \u201cnegligence\u201d theories against both James and Lucita Quan. The insureds now assert that claimant\u2019s theory against Lucita Quan was that she was potentially negligent for allowing her husband James to handle maintenance of their co-owned properties. The insurer allegedly knew that the claimant was \u201clooking to\u201d the community property interest of Lucita Quan and seeking to impose liability on her \u201cfor respondeat superior,\u201d and for the negligent hiring and management of her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Various memoranda in the insurer\u2019s claim file, some of which are attached to the complaint, reflect lower-echelon insurer employee opinions that there may be or was an obligation to defend due to the allegations of \u201cnegligence.\u201d An internal insurance company memo near the time of the insurer\u2019s withdrawal from the defense noted the claimant\u2019s \u201cinteresting theory of negligence,\u201d and shows that the claim was \u201creserved\u201d (i.e. that loss reserves were established) for $250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>E. <em>Facts Known to the Insurer After Withdrawal From Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">After the insurer\u2019s withdrawal from the defense, the insured retained new counsel who continued to communicate with the insurer and demanded defense and indemnity. The insurer then learned that the claimant\u2019s counsel was of the opinion that Mrs. Quan might \u201close her property interest.\u201d The claimant\u2019s counsel further surmised that Mr. Quan might be found to be an employee or agent of Mrs. Quan or of their enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The SAC is vague on the details, but a judicial arbitration was apparently subsequently held. The insured\u2019s counsel communicated the results of the arbitration to the insurer, arguing it was \u201ca judicial determination of liability based on a covered activity.\u201d The arbitrator\u2019s \u201cAmended Findings and Award\u201d stated that the insured\u2019s acts \u201cup and until the time of the occurrence of the sexual acts are found to have been negligent. Specifically, those acts include the furnishing of alcoholic beverages to a minor, and any unintended but negligent touching of the plaintiff, including kissing, fondling, and undressing of the plaintiff, are found to have been negligent, as it appears that such conduct was consented to. . . . [IQ It is further found that any unconsented sexual acts, specifically sexual intercourse, which occurred after plaintiff demonstrated to defendant her unwillingness to proceed were oppressive and malicious. . . .\u201d Despite the insurer\u2019s employee\u2019s memo recommending that the insurer resume the defense in light of these \u201cfindings,\u201d the insurer continued to hold to its denial of any defense obligation, although it still \u201creserved\u201d the claim at $250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">F. <em>Neither the Underlying Complaint Nor Facts Known to the Insurer Reveal the Insureds Face Any Potentially Covered Liability for \u201cBodily Injury\u201d Caused by an \u201cOccurrence\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">It is common to hear the argument that if the underlying complaint alleges negligence, there must be a duty to defend. This is not necessarily true. The duty to defend depends upon the coverage provided by the policy\u2014the \u201cnature and kind of risk covered\u201d\u2014which in turn depends upon the wording of the coverage clauses. The \u201cbodily injury\u201d coverage of the policy involved here applies only to \u201cdamages,\u201d defined as the cost of compensating those who suffer \u201cbodily injury\u201d from an \u201coccurrence.\u201d \u201cOccurrence,\u201d in turn, is defined to require an \u201caccident.\u201d Thus, the insureds\u2019 emphasis on <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co., supra, </em>65 Cal.2d 263, is misplaced\u2014here, unlike in <em>Gray, </em>the threshold question is not whether an unclear exclusionary provision applies, \u201cbut rather the scope of coverage itself: whether the conduct in question constitutes an accident within the meaning of the policy provision.\u201d <em>(Merced Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Mendez </em>(1989) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>213 Cal.App.3d 41, 47 [261 Cal.Rptr. 273].) The distinction was discussed in <em>Royal Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Whitaker </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 532 [226 Cal.Rptr. 435]: \u201c[H]ere [unlike in Gray], the insurer only promises to indemnify or defend actions involving bodily injury caused by <em>an accident </em>resulting in bodily injury neither expected nor intended by the insured. . . . An intentional act is not an \u2018accident\u2019 within the plain meaning of the word.

Such arguments misconstrue the \u201caccident\u201d requirement in standard general liability policies. \u201cUnder California law, the term refers to <em>the nature of the insured\u2019s conduct, not his state of mind.\u201d (Collin </em>v. <em>American Empire Ins.

Co. </em>v. <em>Mendez, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.3d 41. In <em>Mendez, </em>the court found an insurer had no duty to defend or indemnify its insured for damages caused by engaging in acts of oral copulation and attempted oral copulation, allegedly against the claimant\u2019s will. The insured admitted the acts of oral copulation, but contended the encounters were consensual. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>policy at issue defined \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201c \u2018an accident, including exposure to conditions, which results . . . in HD . . . bodily injury . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 44.) The <em>Mendez </em>court framed the issue: \u201cThe parties appear to agree that in order for coverage and a duty to defend to exist, the acts of oral copulation and attempted oral copulation must be deemed an \u2018accident\u2019 within the meaning of the policy. They also agree Mendez intentionally engaged in the acts in question. The dispute centers on the meaning of the term \u2018accident.\u2019 Respondent contends the acts do not constitute an accident because they were intentionally performed by Mendez. Conversely, appellants contend an accident occurs even if the acts causing the alleged damage were intentional as long as the resulting damage was not intended. The argument urged by appellants has been repeatedly rejected by the appellate courts.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 48.)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">The <em>Mendez </em>court continued: \u201cIn <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 1199 . . . , the underlying suit against the insured involved an action for wrongful discharge. The court was called on to construe policy language similar to that in the present case: there the policy covered the insured against claims for . . bodily injury or damage to tangible property resulting from an accidental event.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1201.) The court noted: \u2018In its plain and ordinary sense, \u201caccidental\u201d means \u201carising from extrinsic causes [;1] occurring unexpectedly or by chance [; or] happening without intent or through carelessness.\u201d (Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dict. (1983) p. 49.) . . . The court concluded the employee\u2019s termination did not constitute an \u2018unintentional, unexpected, chance occurrence\u2019 <em>(ibid.) </em>and thus there was no potential liability under the policy. Accordingly, the court held the insurer had no duty to defend. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1202-1203.)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\u201cIn <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1205 . . . , the policy provided coverage and a defense for damages as a result of bodily injury or property damaged [szc] \u2018 \u201ccaused by an <em>occurrence.\u201d </em>\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1206, . . .) \u2018Occurrence\u2019 was then defined by the policy as \u2018 \u201can accident, including, continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in <em>bodily injury </em>or <em>property damage. </em>This injury or damage must be neither expected nor intended by <em>you. . . </em>.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1207, . . .) As in <em>St. Paul, </em>the underlying action against the insured involved a claim of wrongful discharge. Relying on <em>St. Paul, </em>the court concluded the trial court erred in applying the \u2018term \u201caccident\u201d to the consequences of the act rather than to the happening of the act itself.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1208.) The court held: \u2018An intentional termination is not an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy because it is not an accident. The definition of \u201caccident\u201d halts any argument that real party intended his act but not the resulting harm.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1209.)\u201d <em>(Merced Mutual Ins.

In terms of fortuity and/or foreseeability, both \u2018the <em>means </em>as well as the result must be unforeseen, involuntary, unexpected and unusual.\u2019 [Citation.] We agree coverage is not always precluded merely because the insured acted intentionally and the victim was injured. <em>An accident, however, is never present when the insured performs a deliberate act unless some additional, unexpected, independent, and unforeseen happening occurs that produces the damage. </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Merced Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Mendez, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.3d at p. 50, second italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Applying these principles to the case before it, the <em>Mendez </em>court noted: \u201cIn the present case, Mendez admits intentionally engaging in sexual activity with Ms. Peery. This sexual activity, which Ms. Peery alleges occurred against her will, forms the basis of her action against Mendez. All of the acts, the manner in which they were done, and the objective accomplished occurred exactly as appellant intended. No additional, unexpected, independent or unforeseen act occurred.\u201d <em>(Merced Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Mendez, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.3d at p. 50.)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Rejecting the insured\u2019s argument that an insured could reasonably expect that \u201cnegligent bodily injury\u201d would be covered, the <em>Mendez </em>court noted: \u201cAppellants\u2019 argument also fails because the construction offered results in a strained interpretation of the word \u2018accident.\u2019 . . . The argument, in effect, is that Mendez\u2019s purported honest but unreasonable belief in consent would constitute negligence. According to appellants, this mistaken belief \u2018alter[s] the very character of the act itself and renders it accidental. . . . [1D We decline to construe the term \u2018accident\u2019 to include conduct constituting the crime of forcible oral copulation and/or assault with intent to commit forcible oral copulation. We further are unable to posit any factual construction where such conduct might be interpreted as accidentally occurring.\u201d <em>(Merced Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Mendez, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.3d at pp. 51-52.)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">In the instant case, the insureds claim that the causes of action for negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress in the underlying complaint \u201cobviously\u201d give rise to a duty to defend, arguing: \u201cthe most obvious theory giving rise to the potential for an award of indemnifiable damages in favor of [claimant] flows from her third cause of action for negligence which alleges that [insured] \u2018negligently embraced and kissed\u2019 [claimant,] causing her bodily harm.\u201d This contention fails the test stated in <em>Mendez. </em>The insured may have \u201cnegligently\u201d embraced and kissed claimant in the sense that he violated some duty of care in doing so, but there is no allegation that his allegedly negligent but nevertheless intentional conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>led to some \u201cadditional, unexpected, independent, and unforeseen happening\u201d constituting an accident. (Cf. <em>Merced Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Mendez, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.3d at p. 50.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Thus, the insureds\u2019 \u201cnegligence\u201d versus \u201cintentional tort\u201d distinction misses the point.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In this context (as opposed, perhaps, to the \u201cwilful acts\u201d exclusion of Insurance Code section 533, discussed in the unpublished portion of this opinion), whether the insured intended the harm that resulted from his conduct is not determinative. The question is whether an accident gave rise to claimant\u2019s injuries. No accident is alleged, nor do the extrinsic facts suggest one. The acts asserted to give rise to the underlying claimant\u2019s injuries were deliberate, regardless of whether any harm was intended or expected to come of them. No \u201cadditional, unexpected, independent and unforeseen happening\u201d produced the alleged injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The insured points out that in the interview with the insurer, he stated that the claimant might have \u201cbump[ed] into me with her chest.\u201d In their reply the insureds explain that this bumping may be a fact indicating that the claimant was flirting, or that the insured could reasonably have thought so, giving rise to a \u201cdefense\u201d of consent. Yet even if a jury was to find that the insured was mistaken in his belief as to whether the claimant \u201cconsented\u201d to the touching, embracing, kissing or sexual intercourse, there was still no additional happening constituting an \u201caccident\u201d which caused the injuries. The other party\u2019s consent, or the lack thereof, cannot change the nature of the insured\u2019s deliberate acts. Assuming, as the insureds insist, that liability could be imposed without a finding of any intent to \u201charm,\u201d the lack of such intent would not convert volitional physical acts into \u201caccidents\u201d within the meaning of that term in the policy under California law. In other words, injurious physical contact may have been a \u201cmistake,\u201d but it was no \u201caccident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The insured claims the fact that he has denied committing any offense at all, and might be vindicated, necessarily gives rise to a defense obligation. This does not follow, and <em>Mendez </em>cannot be distinguished on that basis. Such a claim misconstrues the \u201cgroundless or false\u201d clause common to liability policies. The point of the clause is that an insurer may not rid itself of the burden of defending an action that seeks damages potentially falling within the scope of the policy\u2019s coverage merely by arguing that the suit has no merit. The \u201cgroundless or false\u201d clause does not change the fundamental principle that there is no defense obligation absent potential liability <em>under </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number><em>the policy. </em>\u201cThe \u2018groundless, false, or fraudulent\u2019 clause . . . does not extend the obligation to defend without limits; it includes only defense to those actions of the nature and kind covered by the policy.\u201d <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co., supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 274.)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Contrary to the insureds\u2019 arguments, in this case the availability of exculpatory information indicating that the insured\u2019s conduct may not have risen to the level of a crime does not suffice to distinguish <em>Mendez </em>or to demonstrate a potential for covered liability.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The insureds misapply <em>Horace Mann Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Barbara B., supra, </em>4 Cal.4th 1076, to argue that so long as there remain any \u201cdisputed factual issues,\u201d determinative of the insured\u2019s liability <em>to the plaintiff </em>in the underlying action, a liability insurer must continue to defend. Yet in <em>Horace Mann </em>the insured faced liability to the claimant that, depending on the ultimate facts developed in the underlying action, could have been covered by the policy. Here, by contrast, no matter what develops as to liability or whether liability is imposed at all, the insured will not be obligated to pay damages for, and the insurer thus will not be obligated to indemnify the insured for, physical injury to the claimant caused by an \u201caccident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">An intentional act is not an accident <em>(Dyer </em>v. <em>Northbrook Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1540, 1547 [259 Cal.Rptr. 298]) even if it causes unintended harm <em>(Loyola Marymount University </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1217, 1225 [271 Cal.Rptr. 528]). An accident can flow from an intentional act only if \u201csome additional, unexpected, independent, and unforeseen happening occurs that produces the damage.\u201d <em>(Merced Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Mendez, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.3d at p. 50.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In this case, there is no theory available on the facts expressed in the complaint or made known to the insurer from other sources under which the insured can be liable for physical injuries caused by \u201caccidentally\u201d touching, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>kissing, embracing or having sex with the claimant, nor is there any additional \u201chappening\u201d to combine with these necessarily deliberate acts so as to produce an \u201caccident\u201d giving rise to bodily injury. There is thus no potential liability for \u201cbodily injury\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d and no duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">G. <em>Neither the Arbitrator\u2019s Vacated Findings Nor the Internal Opinions of Insurer Personnel Gave Rise to Any Duty to Defend</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The insureds argue that the vacated \u201cAmended Findings and Award of Arbitrator\u201d \u201cconverted\u201d potentially covered liability \u201cinto reality.\u201d Whatever the unexplained origins of this document prepared on the insured\u2019s counsel\u2019s letterhead, it is a legal nullity.

Moreover, the arbitrator\u2019s findings, if anything, tend to confirm the complete absence of any \u201caccident\u201d as that term is used in the policy at issue and interpreted under California law. The arbitrator\u2019s legal opinions, conveyed to the insurer, did not constitute \u201cfacts\u201d sufficient to give rise to a potential for covered liability and a duty to defend. Again, even if there could be \u201cnegligent\u201d kissing, fondling and undressing of the claimant, the acts upon which such \u201cliability\u201d was based were not \u201caccidents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">For similar reasons, the insureds\u2019 argument that insurance company employee opinions or memos gave rise to a duty to defend in this case must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law, as is whether there is a duty to defend in this context.

These include that the insured \u201chad received a misdemeanor sentence and that his no contest plea and conviction were inadmissible against him in the [underlying] action\u201d; that eventually he was deemed to have entered a \u201cnot guilty\u201d plea and the case was dismissed; that the emergency room physician had testified to the lack of physical evidence of rape (or indeed sex) or force; that appointed defense counsel had pointed out a possible legal difference between an \u201cunpermitted touching\u201d and rape; that the sheriff\u2019s office criminologist had not found evidence of semen or blood; and that the claimant\u2019s story \u201cis shot through with contradictions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\"> For example, a worker mops the floor at a fast-food restaurant, wetting it and reducing the coefficient of friction between that floor and a potential shoe sole. The act of mopping the floor is intentional; it is not an accident. A customer then enters, slips and falls. This second event <em>may </em>be an \u201cadditional, unexpected, independent and unforeseen happening\u201d producing an injury, and hence may be an \u201caccident\u201d giving rise to a duty to defend. However, the intentional act of mopping the floor alone, just as the intentional act of sexual intercourse alone, is not an accident and does not trigger the defense duty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b495-9\"> Indeed, the <em>insureds\u2019 </em>counsel argued below, when the insurer attempted to use the findings in connection with an earlier demurrer: \u201cI think it\u2019s a breach of the ethical responsibilities of defendant\u2019s counsel to put forward to this court that the arbitration award in this case in the underlying action, which was de novoed, which has no legal effect, has any implication for the facts of this case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b496-10\"> Insureds do not squarely argue that insurer has \u201cwaived\u201d or is \u201cestopped\u201d from asserting coverage defenses. Moreover, \u201cthe doctrines of implied waiver and of estoppel, based upon the conduct or action of the insurer, are not available to bring within the coverage of a policy risks not covered by its terms . . . .\u201d <em>(Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Richmond </em>(1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 645, 653 [143 Cal.Rptr. 75].) \u201c[C]overage under an insurance policy cannot be established by estoppel or waiver.\u201d <em>(Manneck </em>v. <em>Lawyers Title Ins. Corp. </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1294, 1303 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 771].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b496-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 583.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
