J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApI\">The underlying issue in this case relates to the right to privacy. Whether that right was violated cannot be determined, however, without the disclosure of relevant evidence. The question before us now is whether such disclosure can be compelled without violence to the First Amendment values requiring protection of a journalist\u2019s confidential sources and information.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Petitioners Anti-Defamation League of B\u2019nai B\u2019rith (ADL) and Roy Bullock seek to set aside a discovery order issued by respondent superior court (Judge Alex Saldamando) on September 19, 1997, granting reconsideration and ordering compliance with certain discovery requests by real parties in interest after finding that they have now met the criteria set forth in <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 268 [208 Cal.Rptr. 152, 690 P.2d 625], to overcome the journalist\u2019s qualified privilege. Respondent court stayed the effect of its order pending final determination of this writ petition. Initially, this court denied the petition without opinion. Thereafter, the Supreme Court directed us to issue an order to show cause and to place the matter on calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">As explained hereafter, we hold that petitioners, as journalists, are immune from liability for violating Civil Code section 1798.53 under the First Amendment as to all but one and possibly two other real parties in interest by virtue of their status as limited purpose public figures. As to the remaining nonpublic figure or figures, petitioners are not protected by the First Amendment from liability and a discovery order.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">Petitioners are entitled to the protection of the First Amendment, however, only insofar as the information sought to be discovered was obtained and used by them for legitimate journalistic purposes. The journalist\u2019s privilege would not protect against discovery directed to whether any nonpublic information gathered about real parties in interest was privately disclosed to a foreign government or others in violation of Civil Code section 1798.53, as claimed, because such usage does not constitute journalism. The discovery order issued by the trial court was not so limited. The order must therefore be vacated and the matter remanded for reconsideration in light of our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">Petitioners ADL and Roy Bullock, along with Richard Hirschhaut and Thomas Gerard, are defendants in an action brought by real parties in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>interest for invasion of privacy in violation of Civil Code section 1798.53. Defendant Hirschhaut was the director of ADL\u2019s office in San Francisco; defendant Bullock has been a paid \u201cfact-finder\u201d for ADL for the past 32 years; and defendant Gerard was employed by the San Francisco Police Department. The complaint alleges that defendants secretly gathered and disclosed personal information about real parties in interest, 17 individuals, in violation of Civil Code section 1798.53 because of their expressed views in opposition to the apartheid policy of the then-government of South Africa and/or Israeli policies vis-a-vis the Palestinians.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Real parties learned of defendants\u2019 activities as a result of an investigation conducted by the San Francisco District Attorney and the police department. The district attorney commenced the investigation in 1993 after the police department learned that one or more of its officers might have been improperly providing confidential government information to Bullock, who was employed by ADL to investigate organizations opposing the aforesaid policies of the governments of Israel and South Africa.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">At the conclusion of his investigation, the district attorney determined that Bullock and/or ADL had solicited and received government information not made public from San Francisco police officers and others. In November 1993, the district attorney commenced a civil action against ADL and Bullock alleging violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That action was settled after ADL agreed to a permanent injunction prohibiting ADL and Bullock from obtaining documents or other information they know could not legally be disclosed to them. Real parties in interest, who commenced this action in April 1993, claim that nonpublic information contained in government records relating to each of them was improperly obtained and disclosed to others by ADL.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Civil Code section 1798.53 is part of the Information Practices Act of 1977, which generally imposes limitations on the right of governmental entities to disclose personal information about an individual. <em>(Nicholson </em>v. <em>McClatchy Newspapers </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 509, 514, fn. 2 [223 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>58].) The statute was designed by the Legislature to prevent misuse of the increasing amount of information about citizens which government agencies amass in the course of their multifarious activities, the disclosure of which could be embarrassing or otherwise prejudicial to individuals or organizations.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, the Legislature made express findings to that effect: \u201c(a) The right to privacy is being threatened by the indiscriminate collection, maintenance, and dissemination of personal information and the lack of effective laws and legal remedies. (b) The increasing use of computers and other sophisticated information technology has greatly magnified the potential risk to individual privacy that can occur from the maintenance of personal information. flD (c) In order to protect the privacy of individuals, it is necessary that the maintenance and dissemination of personal information be subject to strict limits.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1798.1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Civil Code section 1798.53 is a key remedial provision of the Information Practices Act. It provides a civil cause of action for damages against any \u201cperson, other than an employee of the state or of a local government agency acting solely in his or her official capacity, who intentionally discloses information, not otherwise public, which they know or should reasonably know was obtained from personal information maintained by a state agency or from \u2018records\u2019 within a \u2018system of records\u2019 (as these terms are defined in the Federal Privacy Act of 1974) . . . maintained by a federal government agency. . . .\u201d Civil Code section 1798.53 additionally authorizes an award of exemplary damages of at least $2,500 and attorney\u2019s fees and costs to a successful plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">On June 10, 1993, real parties served their first demand for production and inspection of documents. ADL moved for a protective order on the ground that ADL is a journalist protected by the qualified journalist\u2019s privilege set forth in <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d 268. After a lengthy hearing on the motion, the court (Judge Barbara Jones) ruled on November 17, 1993, that ADL, which publishes magazines and newsletters, qualified as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>a journalist, and that ruling is not now disputed. The court granted ADL\u2019s motion for a protective order and denied real parties\u2019 document request as then phrased on the ground that the latter had failed to satisfy the criteria set forth in <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Superior </em>Court, supra, 37 Cal.3d 268. The order stated the court would reconsider the matter if real parties reformulated the document requests and were unsuccessful in obtaining the information from alternative sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Real parties continued their discovery attempts. On November 19, 1993, they served a second document request on ADL. On November 24, 1993, real parties served the San Francisco District Attorney with a subpoena for documents referring to specified persons and organizations that had been seized by the police department during its investigation of ADL. On April 6, 1994, the court granted ADL\u2019s motion to quash the subpoena \u201cwith respect to any documents that originated with ADL or Bullock, or that were obtained, procured or developed by ADL or Bullock.\u201d In September 1994, the court ordered Bullock to appear for deposition to explore only information not within the ambit of the journalist\u2019s privilege set forth in <em>Mitchell </em>and to produce certain documents. Discovery of other categories of documents was stayed \u201cwithout prejudice unless and until plaintiffs have established, pursuant to <em>Mitchell, </em>their entitlement to proceed with discovery of matters protected by the journalist\u2019s privilege.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\"><em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d 268, holds that there is a qualified journalist\u2019s privilege in a civil action to refuse to reveal confidential sources or information obtained from those sources and that the scope of the privilege depends upon a weighing of five factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The first is the nature of the litigation and whether the reporter is a party. \u201cIn general, disclosure is appropriate in civil cases, especially when the reporter is a party to the litigation.\u201d (37 Cal.3d at p. 279.) \u201cA second consideration is the relevance of the information sought to plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. . . . [Mjere relevance is insufficient to compel discovery; disclosure should be denied unless the information goes \u2018to the heart of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 280.) Third, discovery should be denied unless the plaintiff has exhausted all alternative sources of obtaining the needed information. Fourth, the court should consider the importance of protecting confidentiality in the case at hand. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 282.) \u201cFinally, the court may require the plaintiff to make a prima facie showing that the alleged defamatory statements are false before requiring disclosure.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 283.)</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>In June 1996, real parties sought reconsideration of the earlier limitations on discovery, arguing that they had now satisfied the <em>Mitchell </em>criteria.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, they asked the court to order (1) ADL to produce documents in response to their third document request, (2) reissuance of the subpoena duces tecum to the police department, and (3) Irwin Suall to answer certain questions and to produce documents listed in his notice of deposition. Real parties\u2019 memorandum of points and authorities recited the efforts undertaken since the earlier ruling: They took the depositions of defendants Gerard, Bullock and Hirschhaut, San Diego Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Tim Carroll, San Francisco Police Lieutenant Ron Roth, former Israeli Mossad Agent Victor Ostrovsky and ADL\u2019s fact-finding director, Irwin Suall. Real parties had reframed their document requests to seek information solely about plaintiffs and members of the putative class.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Despite an order allowing real parties to ascertain the job assignments of Roy Bullock, ADL refused to produce documents or allow Irwin Suall, who made 95 percent of those job assignments, to identify them.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">In their memorandum of points and authorities in support of the request for reconsideration, respondents characterized the facts that had emerged from their discovery as follows: (1) Bullock, with Hirschhaut\u2019s knowledge and under Suall\u2019s direction, solicited and received confidential information including driver\u2019s license numbers and post office box numbers from law enforcement officers; (2) up to half of ADL\u2019s efforts during 1986 to 1993 were directed to obtaining information about individuals such as real parties in interest and organizations holding views opposing Israel\u2019s policies or apartheid in South Africa; (3) of the ADL files in police possession, some seven and one-half boxes contain illegally obtained confidential information about individuals and organizations; (4) Bullock and/or Hirschhaut admitted that ADL or its agents gave information to the Government of Israel and sold information to the government of South Africa; (5) from 1986 to 1993, Bullock and Hirschhaut transmitted hundreds of reports to Suall and other ADL offices that included information from confidential sources or \u201cofficial friends\u201d (law enforcement officers); (6) ADL routinely provided information on individuals, including real party in interest Yigal Arens, to the greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>community of 12,000 ADL supporters in the Bay Area, characterizing those opposed to Israel as propagandists using their anti-Zionism as a guise for deeply felt anti-Semitism; (7) ADL\u2019s files seized by the police contained information from confidential government files on real parties in interest Steven Zeltzer and Jeffrey Blankfort; (8) information on real party in interest Helen McCloskey in ADL\u2019s files contained information that appeared to have come from the government of Israel; and (9) ADL\u2019s head fact-finder, Irwin Suall, had met with the Israeli intelligence officials in Israel.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Respondent court heard argument on the motion to reconsider on June 27, 1997, and filed its written order on September 19, 1997. The court found that real parties had met the criteria of Mitchell: (1) the newsgatherers are parties to the action; (2) the information goes to the heart of real parties\u2019 case in that it will identify the source of illegally obtained information admittedly obtained by ADL and the dissemination, if any, of such information in violation of Civil Code section 1798.53 and article I, section 1, of the California Constitution; (3) real parties have exhausted all reasonable alternative sources of information and do not have any practical way of obtaining such information from sources other than defendants and the San Francisco Police Department; (4) the nonpublic information to be disclosed does not relate to public figures or refer to matters of great public importance that would justify nondisclosure under <em>Nicholson </em>v. <em>McClatchy Newspaper Co., supra, 111 </em>Cal.App.3d 509; (5) plaintiffs have presented a prima facie case that defendants Bullock, Hirschhaut and ADL have illegally solicited, obtained and transmitted Civil Code section 1798.53 information in the cases of plaintiffs Blankfort and Zeltzer, and there is a reasonable probability that they have done so in the case of the other named plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The court ordered the following discovery: (A) reissuance of the subpoena duces tecum to the San Francisco Police Department and \u201cin response to such subpoena the San Francisco Police Department shall produce for Plaintiffs\u2019 inspection and copying subject to the Protective Order herein all non-public information obtained by ADL from public agents which is contained in the ADL records seized by the Police Department in 1992 and 1993.\u201d The parties are authorized to select a discovery referee or master to be compensated by the parties to supervise and monitor the production of the seized records. (B) ADL is to fully respond to plaintiffs\u2019 third document request within 20 days by producing the following documents: \u201c(1) all memoranda or documents describing or relating to the work assignments of Roy Bullock from Irwin Suall which involve police or other public agents; (2) each document containing illegally-obtained non-public information relating to Plaintiffs and individuals or organizations in their putative class as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>described by Lt. Roth; (3) each item of non-public information gathered or acquired by ADL and/or Bullock which refer or relate to any of the named Plaintiffs; (4) each ADL publication distributed outside the ADL which includes the name of a Plaintiff or spouse; (5) all \u2018pink\u2019 reports [indicating information had come from confidential informant] dating from 1988 to 1993 transmitted from San Francisco as described by Bullock which contain or refer to non-public information about Plaintiffs\u2019 or members of organization in their putative class; (6) any ADL communications to the ADL, \u2018Jewish or larger community\u2019 identified by Mr. Hirschhaut in his deposition which referred to Plaintiffs or their class; and (7) a roster of the ADL \u2018community\u2019 as identified by Mr. Hirschhaut.\u201d (C) Irwin Suall was to answer in writing within 20 days specified questions that had been propounded to him at his deposition in April 1996, and he was to produce any documents demanded of him in his notice of deposition that are in his possession and have not been previously produced. (D) The time for Victor Ostrosky to comply with the request to produce documents not within the journalist\u2019s privilege was extended to 60 days following completion of the deposition of Irwin Suall.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Petitioners mount two challenges to the superior court\u2019s ruling. First they argue that discovery from ADL may not be compelled because ADL cannot, consistent with free press guarantees, be liable under Civil Code section 1798.53.  Petitioners\u2019 second argument is that respondent court erred in finding that real parties in interest had now met the <em>Mitchell </em>criteria to overcome the qualified privilege.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">Turning first to the question of immunity, petitioners maintain that Civil Code section 1798.53 must give way to a journalist\u2019s free press rights, including the right to ask for, receive and publish confidential information from government sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\"><em>Mitchell </em>clearly does not provide journalists an absolute immunity. \u201cWhen called upon to weigh the fundamental values arguing both for and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>against compelled disclosure, the overwhelming majority of courts have concluded that the question of a reporter\u2019s privilege in civil cases must be decided on a case-by-case basis, with the trial court examining and balancing the asserted interests in light of the facts of the case before it. Thus, the courts conclude, there is neither an absolute duty to disclose nor an absolute privilege to withhold, but instead a qualified privilege against compelled disclosure which depends on the facts of each particular case. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 276.)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Petitioners maintain that the weighing undertaken by the trial court in this case cannot be squared with a series of assertedly similar cases in which it was found that disclosure could not be punished. They rely on <em>Nicholson </em>v. <em>McClatchy Newspapers, supra, </em>177 Cal.App.3d 509; <em>Alim </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 144 [229 Cal.Rptr. 599]; <em>Landmark Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>(1978) 435 U.S. 829 [98 S.Ct. 1535, 56 L.Ed.2d 1]; and <em>The Florida Star </em>v. <em>B. J. F. </em>(1989) 491 U.S. 524 [109 S.Ct. 2603, 105 L.Ed.2d 443]. Petitioners also find support in the California Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Shulman </em>v. <em>Group W Productions, Inc. </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 200 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 843, 955 P.2d 469]. Real parties in interest respond that the cited cases are all manifestly distinguishable on their facts; and, indeed, that the cases petitioners rely upon actually support disclosure in the different circumstances presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">In <em>Nicholson, </em>an unsuccessful candidate for Attorney General sued the State Bar, two newspapers, and their reporters for damages arising from the publication of the unauthorized disclosure of the confidential fact that the Commission on Judicial Nominees Evaluation had found him not qualified for judicial appointment. The causes of action asserted against the media defendants included one for breach of Civil Code section 1798.53 and one for breach of the common law right of privacy by intrusion. The trial court found that the publication was constitutionally privileged and sustained the media defendants\u2019 demurrers without leave to amend. The Court of Appeal affirmed, noting that the allegations as to the media defendants were only that they had sought out newsworthy information which they subsequently published. Such allegations were insufficient to avoid the effect of the constitutional privilege. (177 Cal.App.3d at p. 520.) There was no allegation of impermissible reporting techniques.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff was a public figure since he had recently run for statewide office, and the evaluation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>judicial qualifications was a newsworthy subject. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 515.) \u201cWhile the government may desire to keep some proceedings confidential and may impose the duty upon participants to maintain confidentiality, it may not impose criminal or civil liability upon the press for obtaining and publishing newsworthy information through routine reporting techniques.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 519-520.) The court observed that although reporters are not privileged to commit crimes and independent torts in gathering the news, there was no allegation that any such impermissible techniques had been employed. <em>(Ibid).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">In <em>Alim </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.3d 144, Walter Atlee, former chief deputy director of the Department of Veterans Affairs, sued a newspaper reporter, editor and publisher for invasion of privacy under Civil Code section 1798.53 and libel based on an article containing allegedly false and confidential information from federal Veterans Administration records indicating that he had wrongfully received overpayments of a veteran\u2019s disability stipend while employed. The trial court granted the newspaper defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on all causes of action but that under Civil Code section 1798.53 on the ground that Atlee, who was a public figure, could not prove malice under the <em>New York Times </em>doctrine. <em>(New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1964) 376 U.S. 254 [84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686, 95 A.L.R.2d 1412].) The trial court denied summary judgment on the Civil Code section 1798.53 claim on the ground that the constitutional doctrine did not apply to it. The Court of Appeal disagreed, rejecting the claim that an action under Civil Code section 1798.53 is not subject to free press defenses analogous to those available in common law actions for invasion of privacy.  The court held that a cause of action under Civil Code section 1798.53 is subject to the <em>New York Times </em>actual malice standard and that there is a privilege for truthful publication of information bearing on the fitness for office of a public official. (185 Cal.App.3d at pp. 152-153.)</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">In <em>Landmark Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Virginia, supra, </em>435 U.S. 829, the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment did not permit the criminal punishment of a newspaper for publishing truthful information regarding confidential proceedings of the Virginia Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission. \u201cThe operation of the Virginia Commission, no less than the operation of the judicial system itself, is a matter of public interest, necessarily engaging the attention of the news media. The article published by Landmark provided accurate factual information about a legislatively authorized inquiry pending before the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>and in so doing clearly served those interests in public scrutiny and discussion of governmental affairs which the First Amendment was adopted to protect.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 839 [98 S.Ct. at p. 1542].) The court specifically noted, however, that the case did not involve \u201cthe possible applicability of the statute to one who secures the information by illegal means and thereafter divulges it. We do not have before us any constitutional challenge to a State\u2019s power to keep the Commission\u2019s proceedings confidential or to punish participants for breach of this mandate.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 837 [98 S.Ct. at pp. 1540-1541].) The only issue before the court was whether a newspaper could be punished for publishing truthful information about confidential proceedings. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><em>The Florida Star </em>v. <em>B. J. F., supra, </em>491 U.S. 524, held that a newspaper could not be held liable for violating a state statute prohibiting the publishing of a rape victim\u2019s name which it had obtained from a publicly released police report. The court emphasized that its holding was limited to the situation in which the newspaper published truthful information that had been lawfully obtained. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 541 [109 S.Ct. at p. 2613].) The court expressly noted it was not addressing the question of whether a newspaper may ever be punished for publishing information that had been unlawfully acquired. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 535, fn. 8 [109 S.Ct. at p. 2610].)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\"><em>Shulman </em>v. <em>Group W Productions, Inc., supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 200, addressed the common law invasion of privacy torts of public disclosure of private facts and intrusion in an action brought by two automobile accident victims against a television producer that videotaped and broadcast a documentary rescue program showing the plaintiffs\u2019 rescue and transportation to the hospital in a medical helicopter. The court held that summary judgment was proper as to the cause of action for publication of private facts but not as to the cause of action for intrusion. Lack of newsworthiness was held to be an essential element of a cause of action based on a claim that publication has given unwanted publicity to allegedly private aspects of a person\u2019s life. The subject matter of the broadcast as a whole was of legitimate public concern. \u201cAutomobile accidents are by their nature of interest to that great portion of the public that travels frequently by automobile. The rescue and medical treatment of accident victims is also of legitimate concern to much of the public, involving as it does a critical service that any member of the public may someday need.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 228.) Likewise, the victim\u2019s appearance and words as she was extricated from the overturned car, placed in the helicopter, and transported to the hospital were of legitimate public concern. The intrusion cause of action, by contrast, was held not to carry any special immunity or privilege for the press.  \u201cIn contrast to the broad privilege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>the press enjoys for publishing truthful, newsworthy information in its possession, the press has <em>no </em>recognized constitutional privilege to violate generally applicable laws in pursuit of material. Nor, even absent an independent crime or tort, can a highly offensive intrusion into a private place, conversation, or source of information generally be justified by the plea that the intruder hoped thereby to get good material for a news story.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 242, italics in original.) Thus, summary judgment was improper as to the cause of action for intrusion based on the cameraman\u2019s presence in the medical helicopter and the recording and amplifying of the victim\u2019s conversations with medical personnel. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 237-238.)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">The trial court found that the cases just discussed were inapplicable because they involved newsworthy information, plaintiffs who were public figures, or both. According to the trial court, the nonpublic information gathered about real parties was not newsworthy, and real parties were not public figures. Petitioners challenge these determinations, arguing that real parties are political activists visibly engaged in public opposition to policies of the Israeli government and have therefore made themselves limited purpose public figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">Petitioners rely primarily on <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 244 [208 Cal.Rptr. 137, 690 P.2d 610]; <em>Copp </em>v. <em>Paxton </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 829 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 831]; and <em>Lind </em>v. <em>Grimmer </em>(9th Cir. 1994) 30 F.3d 1115. After reviewing these authorities and the information provided in the exhibits relating to the political activities that real parties in interest have undertaken, we agree that at least 14 and possibly 16 of the 17 real parties in interest must be considered limited purpose public figures in relation to this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">The leading California case on public figures is <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at pages 254-255, where Synanon, a rehabilitation program for drug addicts, and Charles Dederich, its founder, were held to be public figures by virtue of their myriad attempts to thrust their case and Synanon in general into the public eye. In reaching that conclusion, the court traced the evolution of the public figure doctrine, noting that it was first recognized in <em>Curtis Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Butts </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 130 [87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094], and subsequently refined in <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974) 418 U.S. 323 [94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789], where \u201c. . . the court provided a two fold rationale for extending the <em>New York Times </em>rule to \u2018public figures.\u2019 First, it recognized that public figures are generally less vulnerable to injury from defamation because of their ability to resort to effective \u2018self help.\u2019 Such persons ordinarily enjoy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>considerably greater access than private individuals to the media and other channels of communication. This access in turn enables them to counter criticism and to expose the fallacies of defamatory statements. (418 U.S. at p. 344 [41 L.Ed.2d at p. 808].) Second, and more significantly, the court cited a normative consideration that public figures are less deserving of protection than private persons because public figures, like public officials, have \u2018voluntarily exposed themselves to increased risk of injury from defamatory falsehood concerning them.\u2019 (418 U.S. at p. 345 [41 L.Ed.2d at p. 808]; see also <em>Curtis Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Butts, supra, </em>388 U.S. at p. 164 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 808] (Warren, C. J., cone, in result).)\u201d <em>(Reader\u2019s Digest Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 253.)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">\u201cHaving thus explained the rationale for the public figure classification, the <em>Gertz </em>decision defined two classes of public figures. The first is the \u2018all purpose\u2019 public figure who has \u2018achiev[ed] such pervasive fame or notoriety that he becomes a public figure for all purposes and in all contexts.\u2019 The second category is that of the \u2018limited purpose\u2019 or \u2018vortex\u2019 public figure, an individual who \u2018voluntarily injects himself- or is drawn into a particular public controversy and thereby becomes a public figure for a limited range of issues.\u2019 (418 U.S. at p. 351 [41 L.Ed.2d at p. 812].) Unlike the \u2018all purpose\u2019 public figure, the \u2018limited purpose\u2019 public figure loses certain protection for his reputation only to the extent that the allegedly defamatory communication relates to his role in a public controversy.\u201d <em>(Reader\u2019s Digest Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior </em>Court, <em>supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at pp. 253-254.)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">In determining that Synanon and Dederich must be accorded public figure status for purposes of their defamation action, the court based its conclusion on their efforts to thrust themselves into the public eye. Synanon and Dederich had been the subject of a full-length commercial movie, four books, favorable magazine articles in <em>Life, Time </em>and even <em>Reader\u2019s Digest, </em>and numerous newspaper articles. \u201cFor many years Synanon engaged in extensive publicity campaigns in which it sought and achieved a favorable reputation as an organization for the rehabilitation of drug addicts.\u201d <em>(Reader\u2019s Digest Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>37 Cal. 3d at p. 255.) The court concluded: \u201cWhile any person or organization has the right to engage in publicity efforts and to attempt to influence public and media opinion regarding their cause, such significant, voluntary efforts to inject oneself into the public arena require that such a person or organization be classified as a public figure in any related defamation actions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 256.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">In <em>Copp </em>v. <em>Paxton, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th 829, a self-proclaimed earthquake expert undertook efforts to organize a worldwide conference on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>disaster mitigation. In connection with his efforts he took issue with the conventional duck-and-cover advice given to schoolchildren and distributed a flyer describing his views. After being subjected to public criticism and attacks on his credentials, Copp brought an action for defamation against a county emergency services officer and others. Our colleagues in Division One of this court concluded that Copp was a limited purpose public figure because he had attempted to thrust himself into the forefront of debate on emergency preparedness by organizing a worldwide conference, passing out flyers and speaking at public meetings. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 846.) In reaching this conclusion, the court observed: \u201cIt is not necessary to show that a plaintiff actually achieves prominence in the public debate; it is sufficient that \u2018[a plaintiff] attempts to thrust himself into the public eye\u2019 <em>(Rudnick </em>v. <em>McMillan </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1183, 1190 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 193]) or to influence a public decision.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 845-846.)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">In <em>Lind </em>v. <em>Grimmer, supra, </em>30 F.3d 1115, a newsletter publisher brought an action challenging the constitutionality of a Hawaii statute prohibiting disclosure of information concerning investigations undertaken by Hawaii\u2019s Campaign Spending Commission. The Ninth Circuit held the statute unconstitutional as applied to Lind who revealed in a newsletter that he had filed a complaint against the University of Hawaii professional assembly alleging it had failed to disclose certain campaign contributions. The court rejected Hawaii\u2019s claim that it was justified in restricting political speech about complaints before the Campaign Spending Commission in order to promote other political speech by candidates and their supporters. The court observed that candidates \u201csurely are public figures, and therefore must be prepared to endure a heightened level of criticism\u2014including charges of campaign spending improprieties\u2014precisely in order to promote First Amendment values. . . . Candidates\u2019 supporters, by injecting themselves into public debate and attempting financially to influence its outcome, also must be prepared to suffer what to them may be unpleasant discussion of their contribution practices.\u201d <em>(Lind </em>v. <em>Grimmer, supra, </em>30 F.3d at p. 1120.)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Petitioners contend that real parties have sufficiently injected themselves into the maelstrom of public debate over Israeli-Palestinian relations and other topical issues to qualify as limited purpose public figures. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>examples, they cite declarations and interrogatory responses submitted by real parties Jeffrey Blankfort and Steven Zeltzer (whom the trial court found to have made out prima facie cases of violation of their rights under the privacy statute) describing their interest and activities in support of Palestine and in speaking out against Israeli policies and against apartheid in South Africa. Blankfort stated: In 1981 he was a charter member of the November 29th Coalition for Palestine; in June 1982 he solicited names and funds for an ad in the San Francisco Chronicle and Examiner protesting the Israeli invasion of Lebanon; in 1983, he spent four months in Israel, Lebanon, Jordan and the West Bank as a free-lance photojournalist; in January 1987, he organized an anti-apartheid demonstration in San Francisco; in May 1987, he and Steve Zeltzer organized a forum on the Middle East at a church; in November 1989, he spoke at a conference in Boston on the connection between Israel and South Africa; he spoke on Israeli censorship in June 1993 at a meeting of the American Library Association; he is the editor of the Middle East Labor Bulletin. Zeltzer recited similar activities: He helped Blankfort form the Labor Committee on the Middle East in 1987 whose purpose was to provide information to the United States workers about the conditions of working people of the Middle East and to counter anti-Arab racism in the United States; in the early 1980\u2019s he helped form the Committee to Free Moses Mayekiso, a South African who had been jailed because of his union activities in defense of Black South African workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">We agree that the activities undertaken by Blankfort and Zeltzer are sufficient to make them limited purpose public figures under the authorities previously discussed. (Accord, <em>Nadel </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1251, 1269-1270 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 188] [public figure status where plaintiffs played leadership role in protesting university\u2019s plan to build volleyball courts in People\u2019s Park by speaking at city council meetings and demonstrations, communicating with news media, and staffing information table at park]; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Ueberroth </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 442 [195 Cal.Rptr. 150] [public figure status where plaintiffs were officers in organization opposing construction of Olympics sports facilities in Sepulveda Basin]; see also Annot., Who is \u201cPublic Figure\u201d for Purposes of Defamation Action (1994) 19 A.L.R.5th 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">We have reviewed the declarations and interrogatory responses prepared by the 15 other real parties in interest and submitted as part of the exhibits to determine whether the level of their activities was such that they may also be found to be limited purpose public figures. We conclude that all but three of the fifteen have described sufficient involvement in Middle East and/or South African causes to be considered public figures for purposes of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>litigation. These 12 individuals<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> are each energetic members of numerous organizations dedicated to advancing human rights in the Middle East or South Africa or have otherwise been actively involved in such political efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Jock Taft, however, does not appear to qualify as a limited purpose public figure. So far as the record reveals, the only pertinent activity in which he is engaged is teaching a class on the Palestinians at U.C. Berkeley between 1984 and 1990. Taft states that his classes were disrupted by students allegedly connected with ADL and may have been monitored by Bullock. Merely teaching a university class does not, in our view, constitute the purposeful political activity that warrants classification as a limited purpose public figure. Taft cannot be said to have voluntarily injected himself into the public arena merely because he teaches at a university.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">The present record does not satisfactorily show whether the remaining two real parties in interest\u2014Paula Kotakis and Margaret McCormack\u2014are limited purpose public figures. The declaration of Paula Kotakis indicates that for an unspecified period of time she has been active in several unidentified organizations allegedly listed as targets of Roy Bullock\u2019s efforts to collect information. The information about McCormack\u2019s activities is even more sketchy. In response to an interrogatory inquiring whether protected information about her was disclosed, she responded: \u201cThe Palestine Human Rights Campaign is no longer active and its office in Washington, D.C. was burned.\u201d The record contains no other information regarding any relevant political activities in which Ms. McCormack may have been engaged. As we shall remand the case, the parties will have an opportunity to augment the record and obtain a ruling from the trial court as to whether Paula Kotakis and Margaret McCormack are limited purpose public figures for purposes of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">Aside from the question of public figure status, real parties in interest still dispute petitioners\u2019 claim of First Amendment immunity under Civil Code 1798.53 by arguing that because their newsgathering techniques were unlawful these activities fell outside the scope of First Amendment protection. We do not believe the alleged unlawfulness of petitioners\u2019 information-gathering activities is dispositive of their right to the protection of the First Amendment. Petitioners would be entitled to that protection even if they did violate the statute, <em>but only if they obtained, used and disseminated the information at issue as journalists.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>One of the unusual aspects of this case is that, unlike most newsgathering organizations, petitioners\u2019 activities are not limited to journalism. ADL is a tax-exempt nonprofit membership organization which describes itself in its pleadings as \u201ca civil rights and human relations organization [which] engages in a broad range of activities designed to combat anti-Semitism, prejudice and bigotry of all kinds. Through its Intergroup Relations Division, ADL works to promote greater understanding of Jews, Judaism and Jewish concerns, as well as intergroup and interreligious understanding. Through its International Affairs Division, ADL seeks to focus attention on the security of Jews around the world and the strategic importance of the State of Israel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Many of the activities through which ADL seeks to achieve the foregoing purposes are unrelated to conventional journalism, which we conceive to be the gathering and editing of material of current interest for presentation through print or broadcast media, or on the Internet, and available to interested members of the public. For example, ADL privately circulates information, some of it \u201cconfidential,\u201d only to certain members and persons affiliated with other groups that share its goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Unfortunately, the cases arising under Civil Code section 1798.53 do not shed a great deal of light on the breadth of constitutionally protected journalistic activities. <em>Nicholson </em>provides some guidance, at least with respect to the gathering (as opposed to the dissemination) of information. That case involved a cause of action for breach of privacy by intrusion based upon newsgathering activities similar to that at issue here, namely, \u201c 1 \u201crequesting and persuading\u201d \u2019 \u201d employees of the State Bar to engage in the \u201c \u2018 \u201cunauthorized and unlawful disclosure\u201d \u2019 \u201d of confidential information. (177 Cal.App.3d at p. 520, see fn. 6, <em>ante.) </em>The court characterized the allegation as simply stating that the media defendants sought out the newsworthy information which they subsequently published in a newspaper of general circulation. The court held that this type of activity was within the news-gathering activities protected by the First Amendment. <em>(Nicholson </em>v. <em>McClatchy Newspapers, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 520.) In reaching this conclusion the court relied upon <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Daily Mail Publishing Co. </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 97 [99 S.Ct. 2667, 61 L.Ed.2d 399], which held that the state could not punish the publication of information obtained through routine newspaper reporting techniques (i.e., asking witnesses, police, and an assistant prosecutor for the youthful offender\u2019s name).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">The <em>Nicholson </em>court distinguished routine newsgathering techniques from those employed in <em>Dietemann </em>v. <em>Time, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1971) 449 F.2d 245, where newsmen gained entrance to the plaintiff\u2019s home by subterfuge and surreptitiously photographed him and recorded his conversations by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>means of a hidden camera and electronic devices. Such activities were not protected by the First Amendment, according to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Likewise, a photographer\u2019s constant surveillance, obtrusive and intruding presence in photographing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was held to be outside the news gathering privilege of the First Amendment. <em>(Galella </em>v. <em>Onassis </em>(2d Cir. 1973) 487 F.2d 986.) Such conduct was contrasted with the routine newsgathering techniques which include \u201casking persons questions, including those with confidential or restricted information. While the government may desire to keep some proceedings confidential and may impose the duty upon participants to maintain confidentiality, it may not impose criminal or civil liability upon the press for obtaining and publishing newsworthy information through routine reporting techniques.\u201d <em>(Nicholson </em>v. <em>McClatchy Newspapers, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 519-520.)</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">In light of the foregoing, it is apparent that, except with respect to Jock Taft and possibly also Paula Kotakis and Margaret McCormack, the manner in which petitioners allegedly obtained information about real parties constitutes legitimate newsgathering. At least 14 real parties are limited purpose public figures engaged in a newsworthy activity. The fact that ADL apparently never published information about these 14 individuals in the magazines and newspapers they publish and make available to the public is of no great moment, as such information may well have been sought in connection with stories that never materialized.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">The problem in this case, however, relates not so much to the manner in which petitioners may have <em>obtained </em>the information in question, but the manner in which they may have <em>used and disseminated </em>that information. The case law does not address this aspect of the journalistic enterprise since the situations it deals with are invariably those in which the defendant published the information in question in a newspaper or magazine available to the public. Here, the complaint alleges that petitioners disclosed protected nonpublic information to foreign governments and other persons and organizations with no compelling need to know such information, in some cases for a fee. As indicated, petitioner Bullock testified at his deposition testimony that he had sold or given undisclosed information to representatives of the government of South Africa. Suall, ADL\u2019s chief \u201cfact-finder,\u201d stated at his deposition that he had met in Israel with agents of the Mossad, the Israeli security agency, presumably for the purpose of sharing information. If Bullock\u2019s disclosures to South African officials involved nonpublic information about real parties, or if Suall\u2019s meetings with Israeli officials also involved disclosures of such information, the protections of the First Amendment would not be available, because private disclosures of. such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>information to foreign governments could not conceivably constitute a legitimate and constitutionally protected journalistic activity. Nor would the private or \u201cconfidential\u201d disclosure of such information to a network consisting of members of ADL and/or affiliated organizations not involved in journalism constitute a protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">To be sure, it has not been shown that any information that may have been gathered by petitioners about real parties in interest was in fact privately disclosed to the governments of Israel or South Africa, or to any other entities or individuals. Nonetheless, real parties have made a showing that ADL was found by the San Francisco Police Department to be in possession of nonpublic information pertaining to certain real parties in interest. The deposition testimony of Bullock and Suall creates a possibility this information was privately disclosed sufficient to justify discovery calculated to lay the matter to rest. Accordingly, we conclude real parties are entitled to discovery specifically tailored to learn whether any information gathered about them by ADL and its agents in violation of Civil Code section 1798.53 was privately disclosed to the government of Israel or South Africa, or to any other agency or individual not a member of or employed by ADL, or to any individual who was then a member or employee of ADL for a nonjournalistic purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Our conclusion that Jock Taft is not a limited purpose public figure (and that Paula Kotakis and Margaret McCormack also may not be such public figures) requires us to address petitioners\u2019 challenge to the trial court\u2019s finding that the <em>Mitchell </em>criteria had been satisfied. Petitioners assert that only one of the five factors set forth in <em>Mitchell </em>has been met\u2014namely, that they are parties to the litigation. According to petitioners, the remaining four factors do not justify disclosure in this case: (1) the importance of the information sought to plaintiffs\u2019 case; (2) exhaustion of all alternative sources of obtaining the needed information; (3) the importance of protecting confidentiality in the case at hand; and (4) making a prima facie showing. (37 Cal.3d at pp. 279-282.)</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">Petitioners dispute that the information sought goes to the heart of real parties\u2019 case. Real parties, on the other hand, claim the information at issue is vital to their case. They emphasize that they cannot prevail without identifying exactly what Bullock illegally learned about them from confidential government sources, from which he illegally obtained the information, and to which he and ADL illegally transmitted it. The complaint alleges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>violation of privacy under article I, section 1, of the California Constitution and under Civil Code sections 1798.53 and 1798.56<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as a result of a spying operation conducted by defendants who secretly gathered personal information about real parties in interest from state and federal agencies and disclosed it to individuals and entities with no compelling need to know such information. Petitioners contend that the discovery order goes well beyond the narrow confines of a Civil Code section 1798.53 claim in that it is not narrowly limited to tracking the language of the statute. Discovery, however, is not confined to the actual issues framed by the pleadings. The information sought need not be in a form that would be admissible at trial. There need only be a reasonable prospect that it might lead to admissible evidence. (See Hogan &amp; Weber, 1 Cal. Civil Discovery (1997) \u00a7 1.5, p. 9.) In any event, petitioners have acknowledged that their complaints about possible over-breadth of certain requests may still be litigated below. (See fn. 5, <em>ante)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Petitioners vigorously dispute the trial court\u2019s finding that real parties have exhausted all reasonable alternative sources of information and do not have any practical way of obtaining such information from sources other than defendants and the San Francisco Police Department. According to petitioners, real parties never made any genuine effort to find alternative sources of the evidence they need. Petitioners argue, for example, that real parties could establish who transmitted the information by seeking discovery from certain governmental agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">The sufficiency of real parties\u2019 discovery efforts was argued below. Real parties deposed defendants Bullock, Hirschhaut, and Suall, and each refused to identify any information obtained about real parties. They deposed Gerard and Carroll, the only police officers Bullock named as sources, who denied transmitting any of the illegally obtained confidential information regarding real parties Zeltzer and Blankfort found in the possession of ADL. Real parties also deposed Lieutenant Roth, who could not provide any useful information due to a protective order earlier entered by Judge Jones. The court agreed with real parties that they had exhausted alternative sources. The finding that real parties here, unlike those in <em>Mitchell, </em>had deposed all known potential alternative sources was justified. (See <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 282.)</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">Petitioners contend the court ignored the factor of the importance of protecting confidentiality in the case at hand. <em>Mitchell </em>directs that \u201c. . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>when the information relates to matters of great public importance, and when the risk of harm to the source is a substantial one, the court may refuse to require disclosure even though the plaintiff has no other way of obtaining essential information.\u201d (37 Cal.3d at p. 283.) The information sought as to Jock Taft does not relate to a public figure or refer to matters of great public importance that would justify nondisclosure under <em>Nicholson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra, 177 Cal.App.3d 509. This case is unlike <em>Mitchell </em>where the information at issue related to criminal or unethical conduct on the part of a powerful private organization. <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 283.) Petitioners do not suggest that the information sought in this case reveals improper conduct on the part of powerful interests, but relates only to political activity on the part of private individuals which, so far as appears, is constitutionally protected. Moreover, petitioners have not persuasively shown that revelation of the information at issue would expose them or their sources to harmful retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Finally, petitioners object to the court\u2019s finding that real parties had satisfied the <em>Mitchell </em>requirement that a prima facie showing be made. The showing that needed to be made in <em>Mitchell </em>related to the falsity of the allegedly defamatory information. The <em>Mitchell </em>court explained that the routine granting of motions seeking compulsory disclosure would emasculate the important principle established in <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>376 U.S. 254, and other cases, unless the substance of the libel charge was first established. A showing that the alleged defamatory statements are false would tend to tip the balance in favor of discovery since there is very little public interest in protecting the source of false accusations of wrongdoing. (37 Cal.3d at p. 283.) Accordingly, <em>Mitchell </em>states that \u201c. . . the court <em>may </em>require the plaintiff to make a prima facie showing that the alleged defamatory statements are false before requiring disclosure.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The <em>Mitchell </em>court\u2019s use of the word \u201cmay\u201d indicates it viewed the prima facie showing as a discretionary requirement. Requiring a prima facie showing that the alleged defamatory statements are false before ordering disclosure of journalists\u2019 sources makes sense in the context of a defamation action. The information needed to show falsity would ordinarily be readily available to the plaintiffs. Thus, requiring such a showing before ordering discovery would not be an onerous burden on such parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">As, unlike <em>Mitchell, </em>this is not a defamation case, the prima facie showing that would be made here relates not to the falsity of petitioners\u2019 statements but the likelihood that, in violation of Civil Code section 1798.53, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>intentionally disclosed information, not otherwise public, which they knew or should reasonably have known was obtained from personal information maintained in the records of one or more government agencies. Such a showing is harder for a plaintiff to make in a suit under Civil Code section 1798.53 than the showing of falsity that may be required in a defamation action. The defendant in a defamation action ordinarily cannot prevent the plaintiff from independently establishing, the falsity of charges, whereas a defendant in an action under Civil Code section 1798.53 often can prevent the necessary showing from being made simply by resisting disclosure. In the latter situation it may be unfair to permit the defendant to resist discovery if, having exhausted other possible sources of the necessary evidence, that is the only way the plaintiff can make the requisite showing. This possible unfairness was one of the reasons the <em>Mitchell </em>court was careful not to say that a trial court must always require the party seeking discovery to make a prima facie showing, stating instead that the trial court <em>\u201cmay\u201d </em>require such a showing. <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 283.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Ignoring the discretionary nature of the prima facie showing requirement, petitioners claim the court imposed such a requirement and found that it had been met only as to two of the seventeen plaintiffs. According to petitioners, the trial court \u201cruled that 15 of the 17 plaintiffs had not made out a prima facie case of any potential Section 1798.53 violation by ADL.\u201d This is not an accurate characterization of the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">In pertinent part, the trial court stated as follows: \u201cPlaintiffs have presented a prima facie case that Defendants Bullock, Hirschhaut and ADL have illegally solicited, obtained and transmitted Civil Code Sec 1798.53 information in the cases of Plaintiffs Blankfort and Zeltzer, <em>and there is a reasonable probability that they have done so in the case of the other named Plaintiffs and members of their class.\u201d </em>The italicized language, which petitioners simply ignore, amounts to a statement that the remaining 15 plaintiffs had either also made a prima facie showing,* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or had at least made a showing that was sufficient under the circumstances. Since it allowed discovery to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>proceed on behalf of all 17 plaintiffs, the trial court must have concluded that all had made the necessary showing that petitioners violated Civil Code section 1798.53. Since imposition of the prima facie showing requirement is not mandatory, the imposition of a somewhat lesser standard\u2014if indeed that is what the trial court had in mind\u2014is certainly permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">We agree with the finding of the trial court that real parties in interest have met the criteria set forth in <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d 268, as to Jock Taft. It is evident, however, that the discovery order itself is too broad and must be tailored to the disclosure of nonpublic information about Jock Taft contained in ADL files and to whom, if anyone, such . information was disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">The discovery order must be vacated. To the extent that the information sought was within the scope of ADL\u2019s function as a journalist, ADL has a First Amendment privilege as to claims by all but one, and possible two others, of the seventeen real parties in interest. As to the real parties who do not have \u201cpublic figure\u201d status, discovery may be ordered, but it must be tailored to obtaining nonpublic information about them in ADL\u2019s files and discovering to whom, if anyone, such information was disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">We have also concluded that, with respect to all real parties, ADL is protected under the First Amendment only to the extent its activities or those of its agents constitute journalism. Thus, allegations that ADL and its agents privately disclosed nonpublic information about real parties in interest to foreign governments or others not acting as ADL journalists are outside the scope of the journalist\u2019s privilege. Accordingly, discovery tailored to reveal whether such private disclosures were made should be permitted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">III.
