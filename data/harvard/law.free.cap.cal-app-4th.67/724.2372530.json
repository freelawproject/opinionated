J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXb\">Marlin Jones challenges his conviction under Penal Code section 136.1 for dissuading a witness from testifying.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the published part of this opinion, we consider appellant\u2019s argument that the jury was improperly instructed that this offense is a general intent crime, and the \u201csame occasion\u201d rule for consecutive sentencing under the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law. We find no prejudicial error on the former, and no error on the latter. We find no error with respect to the other sentencing issues raised by appellant. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Factual and Procedural Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">On December 7, 1995, appellant entered Randy Megrdle\u2019s residence. Appellant took a checkbook, a .357-caliber revolver, a beeper, two watches, a wallet and a gold chain from the residence. One of the checks taken from Megrdle\u2019s apartment was used to purchase a Sega Saturn and other toys at Toys-R-Us. Although Megrdle did not sign the check, it bore his name. Tyla Brown, a cashier at Toys-R-Us, approved the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The revolver was returned to Megrdle by his brother Phillip Megrdle who received it from Darrell Conedy. Conedy was a friend of Randy and Phillip Megrdle, and knew appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">According to Conedy, appellant tried to sell Conedy a watch, a gun, and a chain that he had taken in a burglary. Appellant was wearing the gold chain. Conedy asked for the gun and appellant gave it to him. Conedy later saw an organizer with Megrdle\u2019s checks. Conedy ripped up the checks and disposed of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">On at least four occasions, appellant called Conedy and said, \u201cAre you going to testify? Don\u2019t testify.\u201d Conedy asked, \u201cWhat are you going to do about it?\u201d Appellant replied, \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I have to. Just don\u2019t testify, man. I\u2019m telling you, Darrell, I\u2019ll do whatever I have to, man.\u201d Appellant repeated this four or five times per conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">Appellant was charged with burglary (\u00a7 459); forgery (\u00a7 470); intimidation of a witness (\u00a7 136.1, subd. (c)(1)); and grand theft (\u00a7 487, subd. (d)). Two prior serious or violent felonies were alleged. One enhancement for a prior prison term under section 667.5, subdivision (b) was also alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">Appellant presented a defense that Conedy and Brown committed the robbery. Conedy\u2019s former housemate testified that when Conedy lived with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>her, her checks were stolen from her purse. Brown\u2019s apartment manager testified that she thought Conedy had been living with Brown. Conedy\u2019s friend testified that he and Brown would swim together at Conedy\u2019s house. Both Conedy and Brown denied spending time together. A handwriting expert testified that the handwriting on Megrdle\u2019s check cashed at Toys-R-Us resembled Brown\u2019s more than appellant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The jury convicted appellant on all counts. Appellant waived jury trial on the priors. The court found the priors to be true. The court sentenced appellant to a total of 81 years to life. On the burglary count, the court imposed a twenty-five-year-to-life sentence plus one year for the section 667.5 enhancement and four years for the section 667, subdivision (a)(1) serious felony enhancement. The court imposed a consecutive 25-year-to-life sentence for the forgery count and a third consecutive 25-year-to-life sentence for the dissuading a witness count. Pursuant to section 654, the court stayed a 25-year-to-life sentence for grand theft of a firearm. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Appellant argues, and the Attorney General concedes, that the court erred in instructing the jury that intimidation of a victim in violation of section 136.1 is a general intent crime. The remaining issue is whether the instructional error is harmless under the standard of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065]. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brenner </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 335, 339 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 260].)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">Two cases have considered this question. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Ford </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 985, 989 [193 Cal.Rptr. 684] the trial court concluded the meaning of the statement, \u201c \u2018You punk mother f[-], we\u2019ll get you, you\u2019ve got kids . . . .\u2019\u201d was ambiguous. It could have been either a statement of revenge or of an intent to dissuade a witness from testifying. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">In contrast, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Brenner, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th 335, 339, a witness was told \u201c \u2018if I called the police, he would kill me.\u2019 \u201d That statement is unambigous. <em>(Ibid.) </em>As long as the jury believed appellant made the statement, the words of the statement itself required the jury to believe the appellant intended to prevent the witness from calling the police. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 339-340.) In <em>Brenner </em>the failure to give a specific intent instruction was harmless while in <em>Ford </em>it was prejudicial. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 340; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ford, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d at p. 990; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Bolin </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>297 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 412, 956 P.2d 374] [even ambiguous statement may be basis for violation of terrorist threat statute, section 422].)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">In this case, appellant\u2019s repeated statement was, \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I have to do. Just don\u2019t testify, man. I\u2019m telling you, Darrell, I\u2019ll do whatever I have to, man.\u201d In his opening brief, appellant maintains that there are multiple interpretations of this statement including innocent ones, such as that appellant would defend himself in a courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument is not persuasive. He demonstrated an explicit intent to dissuade Conedy from testifying when he said, \u201c[D]on\u2019t testify, man.\u201d There is nothing ambiguous about that statement. The words unequivocally show appellant was threatening Conedy with some kind of reprisal if he persisted in his intention to testify. Although, appellant did not spell out exactly what consequences Conedy would suffer if he testified, the intent to dissuade is clear. The court\u2019s error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Appellant next maintains that the trial court incorrectly thought it was required to sentence him consecutively based on his convictions for burglary, forgery of a check, and dissuading a witness from testifying. According to appellant, the court had discretion under section 667, subdivision (c)(6) and (c)(7)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or subdivision (e)(2)(B)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to sentence him either to concurrent or consecutive sentences. Appellant argues burglary was his \u201coriginal\u201d crime and the other two offenses were \u201cin furtherance of the objective of the burglary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Section 667, subdivision (c)(6) and (c)(7), and subdivision (e)(2)(B), mandate consecutive sentencing only when the current felony convictions were \u201cnot committed on the same occasion, and do not arise from the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>set of operative facts, . . <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hendrix </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 508, 513-515 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 431, 941 P.2d 64].) Felonies were held to have been committed on the same occasion when a defendant and his confederate struggled to grab the purses of two women who were walking down a street <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bell </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 282, 294 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 415]) and when a defendant robbed three occupants of a house at gunpoint. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Newsome </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 902, 909 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 438].) In contrast, felonies were held not to have been committed on the same occasion when a defendant threatened a witness at two different times in two different locations. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Newsome, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.4th at p. 911.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Our Supreme Court recently has considered the meaning of the phrase \u201csame occasion.\u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Deloza </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 585, 588 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 255, 957 P.2d 945], the appellant entered a furniture store with an armed companion who pointed a weapon at a salesperson. The appellant took money from a cash register and from a person\u2019s wallet. He also took a customer\u2019s purse. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The confederate took money from another person\u2019s wallet. Appellant was convicted of four counts of second degree robbery. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court held that these acts were committed on the \u201csame occasion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 594.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">In reaching this conclusion the court rejected an argument that the test under section 654 for the same act or omission also governs the question of whether consecutive sentences are mandatory under section 667, subdivision (c)(6) and subdivision (c)(7). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Deloza, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 594.) The court also rejected an argument that \u201csame occasion\u201d refers to the definition of \u201cseparate occasion[]\u201d in section 667.6, subdivision (d). (18 Cal.4th at p. 599.) \u201cThe phrase \u2018committed on the same occasion\u2019 is commonly understood to refer to at least a close temporal and spatial proximity between two events, although it may involve other factors as well.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 594.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">In this case appellant\u2019s offenses were not committed on the same occasion, nor did they arise from the same operative facts. The burglary, forgery, and threatening phone calls were neither temporally nor spatially proximate. Instead, they occurred at different times and locations. Nor were the offenses based on the same operative facts. The burglary was based on breaking and entering the residence, the forgery based on cashing the check at Toys-R-Us, and the dissuading a witness on the numerous threatening phone calls appellant made to Conedy. Appellant implicitly recognizes this as he argues the latter two offenses were \u201cin furtherance\u201d of the first. But there is no exception to mandatory consecutive sentences when one offense is in furtherance of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>HI, IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Hastings, J., and <em>Curry, </em>J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-12\"> All further statutory citations are to this code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b594-9\"> Section 667, subdivision (c) provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other law, if a defendant has been convicted of a felony and it has been pled and proved that the defendant has one or more prior felony convictions as defined in subdivision (d), the court shall adhere to each of the following: HO . . .
