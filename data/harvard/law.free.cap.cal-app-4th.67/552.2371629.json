J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aso\">In an action seeking specific performance of an alleged contract for the sale of real property, the would-be buyer, plaintiff John Roth, appeals from summary judgment entered in favor of the property owner, defendant George E. Malson.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Plaintiff buyer made a written offer to buy real property. Defendant seller made a written counteroffer on a standard form adopted by the California Association of Realtors. The form had a signature line, entitled \u201cAcceptance,\u201d whereby plaintiff could accept the counteroffer. Instead of signing the \u201cAcceptance\u201d portion of the form, plaintiff signed a different portion of the form, entitled \u201cCounter to Counter Offer.\u201d In a portion of the form denominated \u201cChanges/Amendments,\u201d plaintiff also wrote in certain terms of the purchase, although it ultimately turned out that these terms did not vary from the terms of defendant\u2019s counteroffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The trial court concluded no contract was formed because plaintiff\u2019s \u201cCounter to Counter Offer\u201d was a qualified acceptance of defendant\u2019s counteroffer. We agree with the trial court and shall affirm the judgment in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">In July 1995, defendant entered into an agreement (\u201cAuthorization to Sell\u201d) with Stromer Realty Company of California (Stromer Realty), authorizing it to serve as his agent to sell a parcel of 23.8 acres of real property in Sutter County for $47,600 in cash or terms acceptable to the seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">On October 25, 1995, plaintiff executed on Stromer Realty\u2019s standard \u201cSales Agreement and Deposit Receipt\u201d form an offer to buy the property for $41,650 cash, escrow to close within 30 days of acceptance. (Plaintiff signed the documents at issue in this case \u201cJohn Roth for Roth Partners.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">On November 2, 1995, defendant executed and transmitted a counteroffer to plaintiff\u2019s original offer. A copy of this key document is attached hereto as appendix A. The counteroffer was made on a California Association of Realtors\u2019 standard form labeled \u201cCounter Offer\u201d and indicated, in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>portion marked \u201cChanges/Amendments,\u201d that \u201cThe Purchase Price Shall Be $44,000.\u201d The form indicated defendant accepted all other terms and conditions of plaintiff\u2019s offer. By its own terms, the counteroffer would expire if not accepted by November 8, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The counteroffer document contained an area called \u201cAcceptance,\u201d with lines for date and signature. Below that was a solid black line and below the line appeared a portion labeled in bold print \u201cCounter to Counter Offer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">On November 6, 1995, plaintiff signed and dated the portion labeled \u201cCounter to Counter Offer\u201d and, on lines provided for \u201cChanges/ Amendments,\u201d handwrote \u201cPrice to be 44,000.00 as above. Escrow to close on or before Dec. 6, 1995. All cash.\u201d (See appen. A.) The line for an expiration date for the counter-counteroffer was left blank. Plaintiff conveyed the form to Stromer Realty by the November 8 deadline for expiration of defendant\u2019s counteroffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Plaintiff never signed the document in the area marked for \u201cAcceptance\u201d of defendant\u2019s counteroffer. His position is that he meant to communicate an acceptance. His deposition suggests he signed in the wrong place by mistake, and his appellate brief also indicates he mistakenly signed on the wrong line.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Defendant never accepted plaintiff\u2019s counter-counteroffer. Instead, on November 16, 1995, defendant through his attorney advised Stromer Realty by telephone that defendant rejected plaintiff\u2019s counter to counteroffer and was taking the property off the market. This conversation was memorialized in a letter defendant sent by fax to Stromer Realty on November 17, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">On December 27, 1995, plaintiff filed a complaint for specific performance and damages. The complaint alleged (1) specific performance, (2) breach of contract as an alternative theory, with respect to plaintiff\u2019s November 6, 1995, signing of the \u201cCounter to Counter Offer\u201d document, (3) breach of contract with respect to the November 17, 1995, document in which plaintiff purportedly accepted a supposed offer reflected in the \u201cAuthorization to Sell\u201d between defendant and Stromer Realty, (4) intentional misrepresentation as an alternative theory, and (5) negligent misrepresentation as an alternative theory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment/summary adjudication. Plaintiff filed a motion seeking summary adjudication of the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>performance claim, arguing that if one looked to the substance rather than the form, his handwritten notes under \u201cChanges/Amendments\u201d in the counteroffer form did not really change anything, and therefore his signature must be treated as an acceptance forming a binding contract. Defendant opposed plaintiff\u2019s motion and filed his own motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication on the basis that plaintiff could not establish an essential element of each cause of action\u2014formation of a contract. Plaintiff opposed defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">The trial court issued a written ruling denying plaintiff\u2019s motion and granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In its formal order, the trial court reiterated that no binding agreement was formed because there was no valid unqualified acceptance of defendant\u2019s counteroffer. Since there was no binding contract, and since all counts in the complaint turned on the existence of a binding contract, defendant was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Plaintiff appeals from the ensuing judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The sole issue presented by plaintiff on appeal is whether plaintiff\u2019s signature on the counteroffer form constituted an acceptance creating a contract. If it did not, then defendant is entitled to summary judgment because he has negated a necessary element of plaintiff\u2019s case\u2014the existence of a contract. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2).) Our review is de novo. <em>(Villa </em>v. <em>McFerren </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 733, 741 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 719] [review of summary judgment is de novo]; <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Bristol Development Co. </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 861, 865 [44 Cal.Rptr. 767, 402 P.2d 839] [interpretation of written instrument is judicial function where interpretation does not turn on credibility of extrinsic evidence].)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Plaintiff contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to defendant because plaintiff gave an absolute, unqualified acceptance\u2014in substance though not in form\u2014to defendant\u2019s counteroffer and thereby formed a binding contract. Plaintiff argues that, because his response to defendant\u2019s counteroffer did not really change any of the terms of the counteroffer, plaintiff\u2019s writing actually constituted an acceptance of defendant\u2019s counteroffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Since the parties have so assumed, we also will assume for the sake of argument that plaintiff\u2019s response to the counteroffer did not vary any terms of the proposal. We disagree with plaintiff\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>It is, of course, basic hornbook law that the existence of a contract is a necessary element to an action based on contract, regardless whether the plaintiff seeks specific performance or damages for breach of contract. (4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Pleading, \u00a7 476, p. 570; 5 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 741, p. 199.) Consent of the parties is essential to the existence of a contract. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1550.) Consent must be free, mutual and \u201cCommunicated by each to the other.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1565.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u201cAn acceptance must be absolute and unqualified, or must include in itself an acceptance of that character which the proposer can separate from the rest, and which will conclude the person accepting. A qualified acceptance is a new proposal.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1585.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Contract formation is governed by objective manifestations, not subjective intent of any individual involved. (E.g., <em>Atlas Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>McCombs Corp. </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 135, 144 [194 Cal.Rptr. 66]; <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Benko </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 937, 942-943 [127 Cal.Rptr. 846].) The test is \u201cwhat the outward manifestations of consent would lead a reasonable person to believe.\u201d <em>(Meyer </em>v. <em>Benko, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.3d at pp. 942-943.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Here, in responding to defendant\u2019s counteroffer, plaintiff\u2019s response on its face presented itself as a counter-counteroffer. Plaintiff\u2019s principal argument is that because his \u201cChanges/Amendments\u201d did not really change or amend anything, his response should be construed as an acceptance rather than a counter-counteroffer. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Defendant\u2019s position (that no contract was formed) finds support in <em>Krasley </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 425 [161 Cal.Rptr. 629] <em>(Krasley). </em>There, after several offers and counteroffers were exchanged, a would-be buyer (the plaintiff) submitted an offer on a standard real estate broker\u2019s form, with additional language providing for subordination of the sellers\u2019 interest to a construction loan and stating the offer expired in two days and time was of the essence. The day after the buyer\u2019s offer lapsed, one of the sellers signed and delivered a boilerplate counter-counteroffer form, which reserved the right of the sellers to accept any other offer prior to receipt of the buyer\u2019s acceptance, and which contained two alternative proposals: either to agree to the previous terms of buyer\u2019s offer with the addition of an acceleration clause, or, alternatively, to enter into a new deal with new terms. The buyer did not communicate his alleged acceptance of the first alternative proposal in the sellers\u2019 counter-counteroffer until the sellers had accepted another offer from a third party. The buyer sued for specific performance, contending the sellers\u2019 counter-counteroffer was an acceptance of the buyer\u2019s lapsed offer. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 429.) The sellers moved for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>summary judgment, which was denied by the trial court. The appellate court issued a writ of mandate directing the trial court to enter summary judgment for the sellers. As concerns us here, the <em>Krasley </em>court held that, even though time was of the essence and the lapse provisions of the buyer\u2019s offer were for his benefit and could have been waived by him, the counter-counteroffer proposed by the sellers was not an acceptance of plaintiff\u2019s offer, but an entirely new offer. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 430.)</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><em>Krasley </em>said: \u201c[Cjredulity is strained to treat a document entitled \u2018Counter Counter Offer,\u2019 which begins by reciting \u2018This is a counter offer,\u2019 as an acceptance of anything. It is argued factual issues exist whether the new term requiring an acceleration clause, so varied the terms of the December 27 offer as to constitute a new offer rather than an acceptance. That approach is hypertechnical and misses the point. Contract law being a question of objective manifestation of intent, the courts should treat a document as what it says it is unless extrinsic evidence supplies notice of ambiguities [citation]. No trade custom or usage evidence is contained in any declaration nor has any been suggested which would tend to show this counteroffer is an acceptance of anything. It is therefore irrelevant whether adding an acceleration clause requirement to the terms of the December 27 offer materially varied its terms. The CCO [Counter Counter Offer] was a new offer.\u201d <em>(Krasley, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.3d at p. 430.) The <em>Krasley </em>court then went on to determine the sellers were also entitled to summary judgment on other grounds, i.e., the original offer was not sufficiently specific to enforce. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 430-431.)</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\"><em>Krasley </em>suggests that a purported acceptance denominated a \u201ccounteroffer\u201d categorically constitutes a qualified and therefore invalid acceptance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We do not have to go so far in this case. Ours is not a case in which plaintiff simply wrote \u201cI accept\u201d in the space denominated \u201ccounteroffer.\u201d Rather, plaintiff inserted express terms (denominated \u201cChanges/Amendments\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>that required the parties to the transaction and their agents to analyze whether the terms of the counter-counteroffer in fact matched up with the terms of the counteroffer. Viewing the counter-counteroffer in its entirety and objectively, the counter-counteroffer called for a response from the seller before a contract would be formed. In the absence of a response from defendant, no contract was formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">This principle is sound. There is no reason to put the parties or the courts in the position of comparing and contrasting terms (described as \u201cChanges/ Amendments\u201d) to determine whether there is any material variance when a response to a counteroffer is on its face presented as a counter-counteroffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">We agree with the trial court in this case, which stated in its ruling on summary judgment: \u201cWisely, the real estate industry has developed standardized forms for the use by the general public in buying and selling real estate. [The form used here] provide[s] easily understood information and procedures to facilitate the transfer of real property between buyer and seller. As an added boon, litigation is, no doubt, minimized. Yet people still manage to create problems, intentionally or unintentionally. This case is a perfect example. The buyer, having deliberately or unintentionally, signed the form in the wrong place, now seeks to enforce the \u2018agreement.\u2019 Can any reasonable person ignore the possibility that a plaintiff who seeks to enforce such an \u2018agreement\u2019 in his favor would not use his actions to avoid the purchase if it were not in his favor. This potential for game-playing must be avoided at all costs. The form was clear. The facts are clear. Plaintiff did not absolutely and clearly accept the counter offer.\u201d (Original emphasis.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Plaintiff considers it significant that his response to defendant\u2019s counteroffer did not give a deadline (as did the original offer and the counteroffer), which assertedly demonstrates that plaintiff was communicating an acceptance rather than a counter-counteroffer. We disagree. The absence of a deadline does not make plaintiff\u2019s response an acceptance rather than a counter-counteroffer. Similarly, we reject plaintiff\u2019s argument that the fact he responded before the counteroffer\u2019s deadline shows he was communicating an acceptance rather than a counter-counteroffer. Also unpersuasive is plaintiff\u2019s argument that his response should be construed as an acceptance because he signed the document at the bottom, vvhich is \u201cwhere most people sign documents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Plaintiff claims California courts have defined a qualified acceptance as one which <em>varies </em>the terms of the original offer, thereby constituting a counteroffer. However, the cited authority, <em>Ten Winkel </em>v. <em>Anglo California S. Co. </em>(1938) 11 Cal.2d 707 [81 P.2d 958], merely said that the written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>acceptance at issue in that case, \u201cin that it varied the terms of the original offer, at most constituted a qualified acceptance and in effect constituted a counter-offer on the part of the original offeree . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 717.) <em>Ten Winkel </em>thus did not make variance of terms a sine qua non of a qualified acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Plaintiff claims Civil Code section 1651<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> supports his case, because it states written clauses prevail over printing, and therefore we must disregard the printing on the document which characterizes plaintiff\u2019s response as a counter-counteroffer rather than an acceptance. According to plaintiff, the handwritten parts show a contract was formed. However, even assuming for the sake of argument that Civil Code section 1651 applies to determinations whether a contract exists, as opposed to interpretation of an existing contract (a point disputed by defendant), the statute does not save plaintiff in this case. Plaintiff asks us to disregard the printed words \u201cCounter to Counter Offer\u201d and \u201cChanges/Amendments.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, Civil Code section 1651 calls for disregard of printed portions only when written and printed portions are repugnant. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1651; e.g., <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Peters </em>(1936) 5 Cal.2d 619, 623 [55 P.2d 1182]; <em>University of South. California </em>v. <em>Bryson </em>(1929) 103 Cal.App. 39 [283 P. 949].) An example of repugnant provisions is where one provision allows prepayment and another prohibits prepayment. <em>(Gutzi Associates </em>v. <em>Switzer </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1636 [264 Cal.Rptr. 538].) Here, plaintiff fails to point to any handwritten provisions which actually conflict with printed provisions. Plaintiff\u2019s signature and handwritten remarks are not so repugnant with the printed portions of the form as to compel disregard of the printed words, even accepting plaintiff\u2019s claim that his handwritten remarks did not vary the terms of the proposed agreement. Moreover, disregard of the printed words in this case would leave the written words in a vacuum. Thus, we conclude Civil Code section 1651 does not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Plaintiff argues our conclusion gives the contract an unreasonable interpretation, in violation of Civil Code section 1643, which provides: \u201cA contract must receive such an interpretation as will make it lawful, operative, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>definite, reasonable, and capable of being carried into effect, if it can be done without violating the intention of the parties.\u201d However, the issue here is not contract interpretation but rather the determination whether a contract exists. The statute itself contains the qualifier concerning the intention of the parties; thus, the statute is not violated if the objective manifestations of the parties\u2019 intent disclose lack of acceptance of an offer to make a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">We conclude the trial court properly entered summary judgment in favor of defendant. We therefore need not address plaintiff\u2019s request that this court grant or direct the trial court to grant plaintiff\u2019s own cross-motion for summary adjudication and a specific performance decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The judgment is affirmed. Defendant shall recover his costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Hull, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-11\"> On appeal, plaintiff raises no issue with respect to his misrepresentation claims. Instead, plaintiff agrees his entire complaint fails if no contract was formed by his original sales agreement and the \u201cCounter Offer\u201d document. He states in his appellate brief \u201cif no contract was formed then [defendant] prevails.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b452-6\"> Plaintiff contends <em>Krasley </em>is distinguishable for five reasons, as follows: (1) the counteroffer in <em>Krasley </em>was a separate document and began by reciting, \u201cThis is a counter offer\u201d; (2) the buyer in <em>Krasley </em>attempted to communicate his acceptance one day after the offer lapsed; (3) the purported acceptance in <em>Krasley </em>included a new condition, inclusion of an acceleration clause; (4) <em>Krasley </em>also found the alleged contract was not sufficiently specific to enforce because it contained a subordination requirement without specifying the terms of subordination; and (5) <em>Krasley </em>said it was obvious the parties would have had to engage in further negotiations, particularly concerning financing, in order to have an enforceable agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"A1E\">However, none of the distinguishing features cited by plaintiff undermine applicability of the underlying principle expressed in <em>Krasley </em>and quoted above, that a counteroffer which on its face says it is a counteroffer, is a counteroffer, and it is irrelevant whether the counteroffer materially varies the terms of the earlier offer. That the <em>Krasley </em>court continued on to discuss other grounds for the judgment (lack of specificity) does not undermine its holding that the counteroffer was a counteroffer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b454-6\"> Civil Code section 1651 provides: \u201cWhere a contract is partly written and partly printed, or where part of it is written or printed under the special directions of the parties, and with a special view to their intention, and the remainder is copied from a form originally prepared without special reference to the particular parties and the particular contract in question, the written parts control over the printed parts, and the parts which are purely original control those which are copied from a form. And if the two are absolutely repugnant, the latter must be so far disregarded.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b454-7\"> In his reply brief, plaintiff says he does not want us to disregard the printed portions but merely weigh them and give them less weight than the handwritten parts of the document. This different spin by plaintiff does not alter our conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b455-9\">RAYE,</author>\n<p id=\"Apd\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">As there are no special rules restricted to real estate contracts or to standard form agreements, the disposition of this matter is controlled by general principles of contract law. The majority accurately summarizes the applicable principles and I have no quarrel with their explication of them. Their opinion falters not in misstating the general principles but in failing to apply them to the standard form agreement before us. Their bright line standard, adopted from <em>Krasley </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 425 [161 Cal.Rptr. 629], is enticing\u2014judicial decisionmaking becomes a simple matter of inspecting boxes on standard forms\u2014but runs counter to the reasonable expectation of the parties, an overarching standard which heretofore has governed our decisionmaking in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">The controlling principles can be easily summarized: A contract requires an offer and acceptance. As a general proposition, an acceptance must manifest an unconditional agreement to all the terms of the offer and an intention to be bound thereby. More particularly, an acceptance must comport with two separate but related principles. First, an acceptance must not change, add to, or qualify the terms of the offer. Second, in manifesting an intent to be bound an acceptance must be clear, positive and unambiguous; an acceptance, though consistent with the terms of the offer, can be so equivocal that it fails to clearly express an intention to be bound. As the majority acknowledges, the acceptance in this case complies with the first principle; though a counteroffer in form, it does not in substance vary from the offer. The only question is whether it is clear, positive and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Language is inherently susceptible to misunderstanding. Ambiguity abounds. For that reason the early common law required particular incantations to make an offer and formulaic expressions to accept. There is virtue in such an approach. However, the modem rule is otherwise. (See Rest.2d, Contracts, \u00a7 2, corns, a &amp; b, p. 9.) Indeed, the trend, as exemplified by the Uniform Commercial Code, is toward even greater liberality in the construction of purported offers and acceptances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Whatever the merit of bright line formulations, the law reflects a preference for case-by-case determinations. Contract formation is not a matter of form but substance; there are no magic words and no magic forms essential to the creation of binding agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Except for their use of a standard form agreement, the parties herein engaged in a classic offer and acceptance transaction. Stripped of the captions, boxes and other adornments, and subject to certain terms and conditions not relevant here, the writing at the heart of this dispute sets forth an offer to sell a 23.8-acre parcel for $44,000 with escrow to close within 30 days. Appellant expressed in writing a willingness to buy the parcel, reaffirming two critical terms: the purchase price (\u201cPrice to be $44,000 as above\u201d) and the date of closing (\u201cescrow to close on or before December 6, 1995\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Relying on <em>Krasley </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.3d 425, a case whose facts are similar to our own, the majority concludes that despite the fact appellant\u2019s acceptance merely reiterated the terms of the offer, it was ineffective. As in <em>Krasley, </em>appellant\u2019s fate was sealed when he elected to convey his acceptance with words written in a box captioned \u201cCounter to Counter Offer.\u201d Under the <em>Krasley </em>rationale, appellant would be in no better position had he written: \u201cI hereby accept your offer unequivocally and without conditions.\u201d To borrow a phrase from <em>Krasley, </em>\u201ccredulity is strained\u201d by such a result. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 430.) The majority in our case wisely avoids such extreme formalism. However, their moderate formalism is equally incredulous.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The majority concludes that by placing the language of acceptance in a preprinted block captioned \u201cCounter to Counter Offer,\u201d appellant\u2019s purported acceptance did not express an intent to be bound but rather called for a response from defendant. The majority is simply wrong. The appellant\u2019s handwritten language merely reaffirms the offer. The only other language in the box is preprinted and also reaffirms the offer: \u201cBuyer accepts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>all other terms and conditions in the above counter offer.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Had appellant\u2019s handwriting been intended as a true counter to respondent\u2019s counteroffer it is reasonable to expect that appellant would have filled in the blank space provided for insertion of an expiration date. That space remains blank. No response was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The majority finds wisdom in the real estate industry\u2019s adoption of standard forms. I agree. Parties who use standardized forms, the provisions of which have been subject to extended judicial scrutiny, are assured some measure of certainty in their transactions. The use of such forms should be encouraged. The Legislature may wish to prescribe a standard form real estate contract and require adherence to the language and boxes contained therein. Indeed, respondent could have specified in the offer that only a signature on the dotted line set aside for that purpose would constitute an effective acceptance. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 1582.)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">However, petitioner was not constrained by statute or the terms of the offer to a particular form of acceptance. Notwithstanding the absence of constraints, the trial court and the majority would treat the forms as sacrosanct and penalize those with the temerity to depart from the boxes provided. As the trial court bemoans, despite the convenience of standardized forms, \u201cpeople still manage to create problems.\" Perhaps so. Nonetheless, our task is to ascertain their intentions from their language and conduct. The language and actions of the appellant clearly reflect an intent to accept respondent\u2019s offer; no other construction is plausible. For that reason, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 23, 1998, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied February 3, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-7\"> See section 2-207 of the Uniform Commercial Code (and corresponding Cal. U. Com. Code, \u00a7 2207) which provides that between merchants an acceptance can be effective even though it sets forth additional or different terms from the offer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b457-8\"> Williston\u2019s observation is instructive: \u201cOccasionally an offeree, out of ignorance or an abundance of caution, will insert a condition in his acceptance which merely expresses what would otherwise be implied in fact or in law from the offer. Because such a condition involves no qualification of the offeree\u2019s assent to the terms of the offer, it is not in truth a conditional acceptance, and it does not preclude the formation of a contract.\u201d (2 Williston, Law of Contracts (4th ed. 1991) \u00a7 6:15, p. 122, fn. omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
