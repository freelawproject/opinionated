Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">Plaintiff and petitioner was employed at a Burger King franchise owned and operated by real party Cimm\u2019s, Inc. (hereafter Cimm\u2019s). Plaintiff sued Cimm\u2019s and her former supervisor at Burger King for sexual harassment and related claims. The supervisor did not respond and his default was entered. Litigation proceeded against Cimm\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Plaintiff served form and special interrogatories on Cimm\u2019s.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cimm\u2019s served responses consisting of a mixture of factual answers and objections. Over five weeks passed without further action in this regard. Then, with approximately 13 days left before a motion to compel had to be filed, plaintiff sent a letter requesting further responses. Nine days later, Cimm\u2019s responded by asserting essentially the same objections as Cimm\u2019s had asserted in response to the original interrogatories. Plaintiff received Cimm\u2019s response one day before the deadline for filing a motion to compel. In light of the short time left before the filing deadline, plaintiff filed her motion to compel without making further contact with Cimm\u2019s. The motion came on for hearing in due course, with Cimm\u2019s opposing on the ground that plaintiff had failed to satisfy the requirement of a \u201creasonable and good faith\" attempt at \u201cinformal resolution.\u201d The trial court agreed that plaintiff\u2019s efforts were inadequate, denied the motion to compel, and imposed sanctions on plaintiff. Plaintiff then filed this writ petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">A. <em>Code of Civil Procedure section 2030 requires a good faith attempt to resolve discovery disputes informally.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Code of Civil Procedure section 2030, subdivision (7), provides that \u201cIf the propounding party, on receipt of a response to interrogatories, deems that (1) an answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete, (2) an exercise of the option to produce documents under paragraph (2) of subdivision (f) is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate, or (3) an objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general, that party may move for an order compelling a further response. This motion shall be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">B. <em>The trial judge permissibly found plaintiff\u2019s informal resolution efforts inadequate under the circumstances.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">As required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2030, plaintiff\u2019s motion was accompanied by a declaration detailing plaintiff\u2019s efforts at informal resolution. Plaintiff\u2019s declaration contended that, after one extension of time to respond, Cimm\u2019s- had provided \u201cincomplete or evasive responses and/or meritless objections as detailed in the Separate Statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>served and filed herewith.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The declaration stated that plaintiff then sent a letter\u2014by both fax and mail\u2014to Cimm\u2019s about 13 days before the motion filing deadline. A copy of that letter was attached as an exhibit. The two-page letter identifies interrogatories by number either individually or in a group, and follows this identification with a commentary and statement of position concerning the nature of Cimm\u2019s prior responses. As to some interrogatories, the letter contends that objections had been waived, and asserts that \u201cfull and complete responses to all these interrogatories should be forthcoming.\u201d The letter concludes with a statement of belief \u201cthat the above-mentioned problems can be resolved cooperatively and informally, without the need of a motion to compel, and I look forward to hearing from you within the next week [in] the hopes that a motion won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d While somewhat abbreviated, the letter is otherwise typical and is cordial in tone throughout.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s declaration continued that one day before the motion filing deadline, plaintiff received Cimm\u2019s responsive letter, which was also attached as an exhibit. Cimm\u2019s sent this letter by mail; there is no indication that it may also have been sent by fax.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cimm\u2019s letter is also cordial in tone, reviewing Cimm\u2019s positions on the interrogatories identified in plaintiff\u2019s letter, but making no concessions other than to state, that Cimm\u2019s was continuing to assemble information. The letter ends: \u201cPlease do not hesitate to call me if you should have any further questions or comments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s declaration concluded by stating that Cimm\u2019s letter \u201calthough explaining defendant\u2019s [Cimm\u2019s] position in greater detail, offered no substantive changes in that position, but merely reiterated the same objections and arguments at greater length the same [ric]. In order to secure the discovery necessary to her case, Plaintiff has no recourse but to bring this motion.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In opposition, Cimm\u2019s pointed out the grossly overbroad nature of plaintiff\u2019s discovery requests, and complained that the extension of time agreed to by plaintiff at Cimm\u2019s request had only been for seven days. Cimm\u2019s declaration stated that Cimm\u2019s had then responded, but had received no further contact regarding the interrogatories until plaintiff\u2019s letter 13 days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>before the motion filing deadline. Cimm\u2019s declaration claimed that Cimm\u2019s responsive letter \u201coffered several alternative solutions to resolve our discovery disputes\u201d and that Cimm\u2019s \u201cfully anticipated that plaintiff\u2019s counsel would contact me regarding my suggestions.\u201d Cimm\u2019s declaration continued that plaintiff \u201cnever responded to my suggestions\u201d and instead immediately filed a motion \u201cwithout any meaningful attempt to meet and confer in good faith regarding our discovery disputes.\u201d Moreover, Cimm\u2019s declaration continued, plaintiff did not request an extension of time within which to file motions even though such extensions had previously been granted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Based on this evidence, Cimm\u2019s argued that plaintiff had failed to attempt an informal resolution in good faith, and that plaintiff\u2019s motion should be denied for that reason. The trial court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">To the extent that the trial court\u2019s ruling that plaintiff had not made \u201ca reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution\u201d was based upon factual determinations, that ruling is subject to the substantial evidence standard of review. (See, e.g., 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Appeal, \u00a7\u00a7 359-364, pp. 408-414; Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs 1 (The Rutter Group 1997) ^ 8:38 et seq., p. 8-14 et seq.) To the extent that the trial court\u2019s ruling regarding the adequacy of plaintiff\u2019s informal resolution efforts was based upon undisputed or determined facts, it is subject to the abuse of discretion standard of review. (See, e.g., Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs 1, <em>supra, </em>^ 8:85 et seq., p. 8-30 et seq.) A reviewing court must therefore first determine whether substantial evidence supports the factual basis on which the trial court acted, and then determine whether the orders made by the trial court were an abuse of discretion in light of those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Although it facially appears that there is no dispute here concerning the facts comprising the immediate effort at informal resolution, a determination of this kind (reasonability and good faith) almost inherently involves the court in considering issues of a factual nature. Here the trial judge had been presiding over discovery and other aspects of this case for some time. She had the opportunity to learn the issues in the case, to observe the practices of the attorneys, and to form judgments on the attorneys\u2019 credibility and motivations. When assessing credibility and motivation, past experience is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>often a prime indicator. An abuse of discovery procedures in one instance can imply a continuing intent to abuse in other instances. Any discovery request, even an initial one, can be misused in an attempt to generate settlement leverage by creating burden, expense, embarrassment, distraction, etc.  It is a judge\u2019s responsibility to control such abuse. (Cf. <em>Calcor Space Facility, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 221 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 567] [discovery abuse is a spreading cancer; judges must be aggressive in curbing abuse; discovery statutes are prone to misuse absent judicial consideration for burden; courts must insist that discovery be used to facilitate litigation rather than as a weapon].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n                   Here the discovery requests were very broad, and their full scope does not appear reasonably related to the issues in the case. Since plaintiff\u2019s motion was denied simply for failing to attempt informal resolution, the trial court never reached the merits of the discovery requests, but the overbreadth of the requests is nevertheless relevant in this connection.  When discovery requests are grossly overbroad on their face, and hence do not appear reasonably related to a legitimate discovery need, a reasonable inference can be drawn of an intent to harass and improperly burden. When a judge evaluates such factors to determine whether a party has acted reasonably and in good faith in attempting informal resolution, a factual component of decision, derived from the trial judge\u2019s knowledge of the case, is inevitably involved. A trial judge\u2019s perceptions on such matters, inherently factual in nature at least in part, must not be lightly disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">A determination of whether an attempt at informal resolution is adequate also involves the exercise of discretion. The level of effort at informal resolution which satisfies the \u201creasonable and good faith attempt\u201d standard depends upon the circumstances. In a larger, more complex discovery context, a greater effort at informal resolution may be warranted. In a simpler, or more narrowly focused case, a more modest effort may suffice. The history of the litigation, the nature of the interaction between counsel, the nature of the issues, the type and scope of discovery requested, the prospects for success and other similar factors can be relevant. Judges have broad powers and responsibilities to determine what measures and procedures are appropriate in varying circumstances. (See, e.g., Gov. Code, \u00a7 68607 [judge has responsibility to manage litigation]; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 128, subd. (a)(5) [judge has power to control conduct of judicial proceeding in furtherance of justice].) Judges also have broad discretion in controlling the course of discovery and in making the various decisions necessitated by discovery proceedings. <em>(Greyhound Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 378 [15 Cal.Rptr. 90, 364 P.2d 266] [\u201cUndoubtedly the discovery statutes vest a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>wide discretion in the trial court in granting or denying discovery.\u201d]; Cf. <em>Hartbrodt </em>v. <em>Burke </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 168, 175 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 562] [court has wide discretion in discovery matters]; <em>Vallbona </em>v. <em>Springer </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 311] [discovery sanctions reversible only for arbitrary, capricious or whimsical action]; <em>Laguna Auto Body </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 481, 487-488 [282 Cal.Rptr. 530] [court has wide discretion in granting and enforcing discovery]; <em>Kuhns </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 982, 988 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 773] [in imposing discovery sanction, court exercises discretion subject to reversal only for manifest abuse exceeding the bounds of reason].) The trial judge\u2019s application of discretion in discovery matters is presumed correct, and the complaining party must show how and why the court\u2019s action constitutes an abuse of discretion in light of the particular circumstances involved. (See, e.g., <em>Hartbrodt, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 175 [discovery orders presumed correct and will not be disturbed except in case of abuse of discretion]; Eisenberg et al, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs 1, <em>supra, </em>^[ 8:15 et seq., p. 8-4 et seq. [trial court orders generally presumed correct].)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Here plaintiff propounded grossly overbroad interrogatories. Upon receiving the expectable objections, plaintiff simply sent a single brief letter, late in the relevant time period. (Cf. <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1431, 1439 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 333] [mere bickering at deposition did not constitute reasonable and good faith attempt at informal resolution].) Plaintiff\u2019s motion to compel, so far as the record on this petition reflects, makes no effort to explain why interrogatories of such breadth are proper in this case, an omission that reasonably suggests lack of a proper discovery objective.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A single letter, followed by a response which refuses concessions, might in some instances be an adequate attempt at informal resolution, especially when a legitimate discovery objective is demonstrated. The time available before the motion filing deadline, and the extent to which the responding party was complicit in the lapse of available time, can also be relevant. An evaluation of whether, from the perspective of a reasonable person in the position of the discovering party, additional effort appeared likely to bear fruit, should also be considered. Although some effort is required in all instances (see, e.g., <em>Townsend, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.4th at p. 1438 [no exception based on speculation that prospects for informal resolution may be bleak]), the level of effort that is reasonable is different in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>different circumstances, and may vary with the prospects for success. These are considerations entrusted to the trial court\u2019s discretion and judgment, with due regard for all relevant circumstances. In the instant case, whether reviewed according to the substantial evidence or the abuse of discretion standard, or an amalgam of the two, the trial judge\u2019s decision that a greater effort at informal resolution should have been made is amply supported by this record. The petition for a writ of mandate is therefore denied to this extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">C. <em>Upon finding a failure to attempt informal resolution, a trial judge must consider the appropriate remedy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Cimm\u2019s relies heavily on <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.4th 1431, to support outright denial of further discovery. <em>Townsend </em>concerned a motion to compel further answers to deposition questions. At the deposition, counsel argued over objections, but no additional effort at informal resolution was made after the deposition adjourned. The trial court found the deposition discussions to be an adequate effort at informal resolution, and granted the motion to compel. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1434.) The Court of Appeal, however, ruled that the informal resolution requirement \u201cis not fulfilled when the proponent, immediately following an objection, merely debates with the deponent\u2019s counsel the propriety of the objection.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1433.) The <em>Townsend </em>court relied on the \u201ccollective experience of lawyers and judges that too often the ego and emotions of counsel and client are involved at depositions.\u201d It noted that counsel can be \u201cblinded by the combative nature of the proceeding,\u201d and that \u201ca brief cooling-off period is sometimes necessary.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1436.) Finding that the heated discussions during the deposition did not constitute a \u201cserious effort at negotiation and informal resolution\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1438), the <em>Townsend </em>court ruled that the trial court\u2019s order for further answers was \u201cin excess of the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1438-1439.) Without discussion of whether other options were available, the <em>Townsend </em>court then ordered that the motion to compel be denied. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\"><em>Townsend </em>might create the impression that the required consequence of an inadequate effort at informal resolution is complete denial of the requested discovery, but it does not compel that conclusion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, <em>Townsend </em>can be seen as an example of a failure to make any real effort at informal resolution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>a failure so egregious as to justify immediate and outright denial of further discovery. But not every finding that additional informal resolution efforts are required can be categorized as a failure so egregious as to justify summary denial of discovery. Such categorical rulings should be reserved for cases of clear intent to burden or harass, cases of clear flaunting of statutory responsibilities, cases of established track records of lack of good faith, and the like. The range of a judge\u2019s discretion is broad, and litigants cannot always predict exactly where on that broad range a particular judge might alight in a particular case. The party who attempts informal resolution, but mispredicts the judge\u2019s location on the reasonable spectrum of possible levels of effort, should not inevitably be penalized by outright denial of possibly critical discovery.* *<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">As <em>Townsend </em>notes, it is a \u201ccentral precept\u201d of the Civil Discovery Act of 1986 that discovery \u201cbe essentially self-executing.\u201d <em>(Townsend </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.4th at p. 1434.) Thus reasonable and good faith efforts at informal resolution of discovery disputes are no doubt a key part of the discovery system. It is also a central precept of the discovery system, however, that \u201c[i]n order to accomplish the various legislative purposes [of the discovery law], the several statutes must be construed liberally in favor of disclosure . . . .\u201d <em>(Greyhound Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>56 Cal.2d at p. 377; <em>Emerson Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1101, 1108 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 883, 946 P.2d 841] <em>[Greyhound </em>rule of liberal construction in favor of discovery remains applicable to current discovery statutes].) Thus discovery statutes have generally been construed to uphold the right to discovery wherever reasonable and possible. (See, e.g., Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial 2 (The Rutter Group 1998) f 8:36 et seq., p. 8B-4 et seq.)  Hence the instant case requires reconciliation of two key principles of California discovery law: the principle of liberal construction in favor of discovery versus the requirement of informal efforts to resolve disputes. Reconciling these principles while recognizing both the broad range of a trial judge\u2019s discretion and the proper judicial goal of minimizing unnecessary expense requires attention to the question of remedy when an effort at informal resolution is found wanting. Thus discovery should not be automatically denied in such circumstances; instead the trial court should consider whether it would be more appropriate to specify additional efforts which will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>required before the court will turn to the merits of the discovery dispute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Relevant factors will include the history of the case and the past conduct of counsel as it reflects upon the bona fides of their efforts, the nature and extent of the actual efforts expended, the nature of the discovery requested and its importance to the case, the size and complexity of the case, the effect of expense upon litigation of the case and whether unfeasible levels of expense might force resolution on a basis other than the merits, the margin by which the moving party deviated from a reasonable and good faith effort at informal resolution under the circumstances, the predictability that an effort of the type made would be found wanting, whether supplemental responses have been served,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and such other factors as are relevant under all the circumstances presented.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Inasmuch as judges are duty bound to manage court calendars with a view to minimizing both delay (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68607) and unnecessary expense (cf. <em>Calcor Space Facility, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th at p. 221), the prospects that further informal efforts would be fruitful should also be considered.  When appropriate, the party whose efforts were found wanting may be assessed with monetary sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">In the instant case we do not know what ultimate resolution would have resulted from application of such considerations, for the trial judge denied the motion simply on the basis that plaintiff\u2019s lone letter was an insufficient effort at informal resolution. Hence we will grant plaintiff\u2019s writ petition to the extent of directing the trial court to consider the proper remedy for plaintiff\u2019s insufficient efforts, and to rule accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>D. <em>The court did not err in requiring notice to plaintiff\u2019s former supervisor in the manner specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 1985.6</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Let a writ of mandate issue directing respondent to vacate that portion of its March 4, 1998, order denying petitioner\u2019s motions to compel further response to form and special interrogatories.

The interrogatory letter was dated on a Friday, and arrived on a Monday, the day before the motion filing deadline.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b359-9\"> Plaintiff moved in separate motions to compel further responses to the form and to the special interrogatories, but the declaration filed with each motion was identical except for a difference in the amount of attorney\u2019s fees requested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b360-6\"> Cimm\u2019s declaration also advises of another letter, sent by Cimm\u2019s to plaintiff in roughly the same time period, concerning the document production dispute covered in the unpublished portion of this opinion. A copy of the document production letter was also attached as an exhibit. That letter bears the notation that it had been sent by both fax and mail. Thus of the three letters from Cimm\u2019s to plaintiff in this record, two had been sent by fax or both mail and fax, while one\u2014Cimm\u2019s response to plaintiff\u2019s letter concerning Cimm\u2019s interrogatory responses\u2014was sent by mail only and dated the Friday before the motion filing deadline on Tuesday.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b361-5\"> Although we deal here with a discovery request by a plaintiff, discovery requests can be similarly misused by defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b362-5\"> Cimm\u2019s opposition contended, correctly so far as the records available in this court show, that \u201cconspicuously absent from plaintiff\u2019s motion to compel is any explanation as to why most of the information sought is relevant or calculated to lead to the discovery of relevant information.\u201d If it is correct that such an explanation was lacking, that would normally be a sufficient basis for denial on the merits. The court in the instant case, however, ruled not on the merits but rather on the basis of the \u201cinformal resolution\u201d requirement. The merits of the discovery requests were never reached.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\"><em> Townsend </em>did note that the presence of counsel at deposition allows for \u201cinstantaneous discussion of an objection and attempts at informal resolution. This proposition has a certain facial appeal and the support of at least one commentator. (Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 1997) f 8:812, p. 8E-97.)\u201d (61 Cal.App.4th at p. 1436.) Whether the moving party in <em>Townsend </em>relied on, or even knew of, this authority for the proposition that no further effort at informal resolution was necessary is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>not stated in the opinion, but the scenario raises the specter that the moving party was denied discovery notwithstanding a possibly reasonable belief that nothing further was required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b364-7\"> If silmmary denial of further discovery were the inevitable consequence, counsel would have no choice but routinely to engage in expensive overkill\u2014measures designed not to facilitate resolution of the discovery dispute, but instead to mollify,the judge, unnecessarily driving up the cost of litigation and consequently damaging the public interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b365-5\"> We do not suggest excessive imposition of such additional requirements. They should be imposed only where the informal resolution efforts in evidence are truly inadequate. We are aware that in the current \u201cfast track,\u201d statistic-driven environment, it sometimes seems that courts impose procedural requirements on litigants not to forward the case toward resolution on the merits, but instead to drive up the cost of obtaining a resolution on the merits to unfeasible levels, thus forcing resolution on a basis other than the merits. Although it is widely accepted that fast track reforms were needed because of the \u201cjustice delayed is justice denied\u201d effect of long time lags to trial, the objective of the court system remains the achievement of justice. A judicial tactic of imposing burdens simply to coerce resolution on a basis other than the merits by driving costs to unfeasible levels would be closely analogous to the tactic of a litigant who abuses discovery with the same objective in mind. Both types of conduct are equally improper, or perhaps that of the judge more so in view of the judge\u2019s role as the guardian of justice. When administering the discovery system, courts should therefore take care to minimize, not maximize, expense.
