Dishong (the Dishongs) appeal a judgment in favor of Leopoldo Rosas for injuries sustained while attempting to trim a tree at the Dishongs\u2019 residence. They contend the court erred in concluding Rosas was acting as their employee rather than as an independent contractor, when engaged in a task for which California requires a contractor\u2019s license. On the facts presented, we conclude the trial court correctly ruled that the unlicensed Rosas is deemed an employee pursuant to Labor Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 2750.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">However, we conclude the trial court erred in finding the Dishongs, by hiring Rosas to trim the tree in the yard of their home, became subject to the extensive safety provisions of California\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA or the Act) set forth in section 6300 et seq. Because we conclude the OSHA requirements do not apply in this noncommercial single tree-trimming transaction, we reverse the judgment which was based on a finding the Dishongs were strictly liable once they conceded they had not complied with certain OSHA safety requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">Rosas provided landscape maintenance services to the Dishongs for 10 years. The Dishongs asked Rosas to trim a tree branch overhanging their roof, agreeing to a price in addition to his regular maintenance fee. Rosas later returned to trim the branch. While attempting to cut the branch, he fell to the ground injuring his back.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Rosas filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim under the Dishongs\u2019 homeowners policy, which was denied by the carrier because Rosas had not met the minimum hours required by section 3352, subdivision (h) to be eligible for such benefits. Rosas thereafter sued the Dishongs to recover damages suffered as a result of the fall, alleging general negligence and premises liability causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Rosas moved <em>in limine </em>to prohibit the Dishongs from arguing or introducing evidence that the relationship between the Dishongs and Rosas was anything other than that of an employer and employee and from asserting the defenses of assumption of risk, contributory or comparative negligence. The parties stipulated that trimming trees exceeding 15 feet in height requires a license under Business and Professions Code section 7026.1, a license Rosas did not possess. The parties further stipulated that Rosas was not an \u201cemployee\u201d entitled to workers\u2019 compensation coverage. (See \u00a7 3352, subd. (h) [household employees not meeting minimum requirements for time worked or wages earned].) Based on section 2750.5 and related case law <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 5 [219 Cal.Rptr. 13, 706 P.2d 1146]; <em>Foss </em>v. <em>Anthony Industries </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 794 [189 Cal.Rptr. 31]), the court ruled as a matter of law that the unlicensed Rosas was an employee, not an independent contractor, for the purposes of this tort litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The parties further stipulated that assuming OSHA applied, the Dishongs had not complied with certain OSHA statutes (\u00a7\u00a7 6400, 6402, 6403) and this noncompliance contributed to Rosas\u2019s injuries. Based on those stipulations and section 2801,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the court struck the Dishongs\u2019 contributory negligence and assumption of risk defenses. There being no defenses to the cause of action for the employer failing to maintain a safe work place, the court entered judgment for $100,000 based on stipulated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The two issues presented are whether section 2750.5 makes Rosas the Dishongs\u2019 employee as a matter of law and, if so, whether OSHA applies to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>homeowner employers under the circumstances of this case. Both issues present pure questions of law (statutory interpretation based on stipulated facts) entitled to de novo review. <em>(Dawson </em>v. <em>East Side Union High School Dist. </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 998, 1025 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 108].) As discussed below, we conclude Rosas is the Dishongs\u2019 employee, but that OSHA does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Section 2750.5 and Related Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Section 2750.5<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> contains a presumption that a worker performing services for which a license is required is an employee rather than an independent contractor. The presumption may be rebutted by proof of certain specified factors which traditionally demonstrate independent contractor status. Additionally, the statute in its penultimate paragraph provides that \u201c. . . any person performing any function or activity for which a license is required . . . shall hold a valid contractors\u2019 license as a condition of having independent contractor status.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>In <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at pages 11-12, 15, our Supreme Court interpreted the penultimate paragraph as requiring an unlicensed contractor injured while constructing an addition to the defendant\u2019s home to be deemed an employee entitled to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The court placed the burden of determining the worker\u2019s license status squarely on the homeowner and in the absence of a misrepresentation by the contractor as to license status, the unlicensed contractor cannot be estopped from denying independent contractor status and claiming benefits as an employee. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 13, 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The court noted the fundamental policy underlying the workers\u2019 compensation laws is \u201cthat those hiring others to perform services should bear the risk of injuries incurred in the undertakings.\u201d <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 13.) Thus, it found it reasonable for a person hiring a licensed independent contractor to anticipate the contractor will insure against the risk and pass the cost of insurance along in the contract price. However, in the case of an unlicensed contractor performing work for which a license is required, the likelihood that the contractor will obtain insurance is greatly reduced. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court therefore concluded: \u201cIt is not unreasonable for the Legislature to conclude that effective implementation of a system of providing for workers\u2019 injuries requires liability on the part of the ultimate hirer and that he should not be able to avoid liability on the ground that he dealt with a contractor when the contractor lacked a required license. . . . While it may seem anomalous to hold that the hirer is liable for compensation only if the contractor lacks the required license, and that he would not be liable if the contractor were licensed, the justification is apparent in that the Legislature has sought to assure that both licensed and unlicensed contractors and their employees will have compensation should they be injured on the job.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\"><em>Foss </em>v. <em>Anthony Industries, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.3d 794, arose out of a truck and motorcycle accident in which the motorcyclist was killed. The truck was driven by the employee of Jo\u2019Dee Enterprises (Jo\u2019Dee), an unlicensed contractor hired by Anthony Industries (Anthony) to perform work for which a license was required. The trial court concluded section 2750.5 applied in workers\u2019 compensation cases only and granted Anthony\u2019s motion for nonsuit because the plaintiff had not shown Jo\u2019Dee was an employee rather than an independent contractor. <em>(Foss </em>v. <em>Anthony Industries, supra, </em>at p. 797.) Applying rules of statutory construction and examining the public policy behind the section, this court reversed and held section 2750.5 applies in civil tort cases. <em>(Foss </em>v. <em>Anthony Industries, supra, </em>at pp. 797-799.) The court found application of the section in such cases furthered public policy by: 1) imposing liability on the party who is benefited by the labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>and is capable of spreading the risk through obtaining insurance; and 2) encouraging those who employ others to hire workers who have demonstrated the competence and financial responsibility necessary to obtain a contractor\u2019s license. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 799.)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Section 2750.5 as Applied to Rosas</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">In concluding Rosas was an employee rather than an independent contractor, the trial court accepted a multistep statutory analysis advocated by Rosas, whereby the interaction of section 3352, subdivision (h), and section 2750.5 resulted in Rosas being denied workers\u2019 compensation recovery but being entitled to potential civil tort recovery.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the analysis, Rosas is excluded as an \u201cemployee\u201d for workers\u2019 compensation purposes because he had not worked the minimum hours necessary for coverage of household employees. (\u00a7\u00a7 3352, subd. (h), 3351, subd. (d).) However, as an unlicensed contractor performing work for which a license is required, he is deemed to be an employee for civil tort purposes and potentially entitled to recovery. (\u00a7 2750.5.)  We must therefore determine whether in enacting section 2750.5, the Legislature intended that an unlicensed contractor should be deemed an employee under the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The primary goal of statutory construction is to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent to effectuate the purpose of the law. <em>(DuBois </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 382, 387 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 523, 853 P.2d 978].) To do so, a court looks first to the words of the statute. <em>(Ibid.) </em>If the words are clear, the statute is enforced according to its terms. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 387-388.) A court considers the provision in the context of the entire statute and the purpose of the statutory scheme of which it is part. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 388.)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>Here, the meaning of section 2750.5 is clear. By making a license a condition of independent contractor status, the Legislature was unequivocal that a person lacking the requisite license could not be an independent contractor. <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Additionally, the position of section 2750.5 within the statutory scheme indicates the Legislature intended to provide a potential tort remedy to unlicensed workers injured while performing a job for which a license is required. The section is placed in division 3 (\u00a7 2700 et seq.) of the statutes, dealing with the general obligations and liability of an employer to an employee rather than divisions 4 and 4.5 (\u00a7 3200 et seq.) dealing with workers\u2019 compensation. Section 2700 provides that the provisions of division 3 shall fully apply to all cases where the provisions of divisions 4 and 4.5 are not applicable. Section 3602, subdivision (c) provides that where the conditions of workers\u2019 compensation liability set forth in section 3600 do not concur, the liability of the employer is the same as if division 4 had not been enacted. Section 3600, subdivision (a)(1) conditions workers\u2019 compensation coverage on both the employer and the employee being subject to the workers\u2019 compensation provisions at the time of the injury. Where a worker is excluded from workers\u2019 compensation coverage under section 3352, subdivision (h), the statutory scheme provides for potential liability under division 3, including section 2750.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Moreover, finding Rosas to be an employee under section 2750.5 furthers the policies identified in <em>Foss </em>v. <em>Anthony Industries, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.3d 794, i.e., 1) imposing liability on the one benefited by the labor and capable of spreading the risk through insurance; and 2) encouraging the hiring of workers with the competence and financial responsibility necessary to obtain a license. It is evident that potential tort liability for hiring an unlicensed worker to do a job requiring a license encourages a homeowner to hire a licensed worker. As to spreading the risk through insurance, all California comprehensive personal liability insurance policies must provide coverage for workers\u2019 compensation claims as well as general liability insurance. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11590.) Whether an injured worker recovers through workers\u2019 compensation coverage or through general liability coverage, liability is still imposed on the homeowner benefiting from the work and able to spread the risk through the purchase of a comprehensive homeowners\u2019 liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The Dishongs contend imposing tort liability under section 2750.5 would impose an unfair burden on unsuspecting homeowners. Based on the availability of workers\u2019 compensation insurance, our Supreme Court has rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>an argument that application of section 2750.5 in workers\u2019 compensation proceedings would subject unsuspecting homeowners to an undue burden. <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at pp. 13-15.) Because comprehensive homeowners policies include both workers\u2019 compensation and liability coverage, the interaction of sections 3352, subdivision (h) and 2750.5 to allow an unlicensed worker who is excluded from workers\u2019 compensation coverage to sue in tort is unlikely to subject a homeowner to any greater burden than that envisioned by the Supreme Court in <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Although the Dishongs also contend applying section 2750.5 to subject a homeowner to potential tort liability for hiring an unlicensed worker is bizarre and unforeseen, we \u201cpresume that the Legislature intended all the consequences which flow from the plain meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>(Neighbours </em>v. <em>Buzz Oates Enterprises </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 325, 333 [265 Cal.Rptr. 788].) Section 2750.5 does not purport to punish or penalize unlicensed contractors, but rather purports to determine the status of persons as independent contractors or employees. <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 15.) The section does not reflect legislative intent that an unlicensed contractor is an independent contractor for some purposes, but not for others. <em>{Ibid.) </em>If the statute results in a \u201cwindfall\u201d to unlicensed contractors or an \u201cundue burden\u201d to unsuspecting homeowners as the Dishongs claim, \u201c[i]t is for the Legislature, not the courts, to pass upon the social wisdom of. . .an enactment. And, if there is a flaw in the statutory scheme, it is up to the Legislature, not the courts, to correct it.\u201d <em>(Neighbours </em>v. <em>Buzz Oates Enterprises, supra, </em>at p. 334.)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">OSHA Application to Homeowners</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">OSHA was enacted in 1973 to assure safe and healthful working conditions for California working men and woman. (\u00a7 6300.) Rosas contends the Dishongs are subject to OSHA regulation and their failure to comply with sections 6400, 6401, 6402, and 6403 contributed to his injury. The Act, however, was not intended to apply to all employment or places of employment. Under OSHA, a \u201c[p]lace of employment\u201d is any place and its appurtenant premises where employment takes place. (\u00a7 6303, subd. (a).) \u201cEmployment\u201d is the \u201ccarrying on of any trade, enterprise, project, industry, business, occupation or work ... in which any person is engaged or permitted to work for hire <em>except household domestic service.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 6303, subd. (b), italics added.) OSHA does not define \u201chousehold domestic service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>The question presented is whether OSHA was intended to apply to individuals hired to trim a tree in a homeowner\u2019s yard.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since 1917, California has consistently regulated safety in employment and places of employment where industry, trade, work or business are conducted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The state, however, has consistently excluded \u201chousehold domestic service\u201d from such regulation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We have located no legislative history on the intended scope of the household domestic service exclusion. Nor have we located any case law interpreting the exclusion. For purposes of regulating wages, hours and working conditions, however, \u201chousehold occupations\u201d means all services relating to maintenance of a private household or its premises including gardening. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 11150, subd. 1(2)(C).)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">California is not alone in excluding household domestic service from OSHA coverage. Federal OSHA defines an employer as \u201ca person engaged in a business affecting commerce who has employees.\u201d (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 652.) As a policy matter, federal OSHA excludes \u201cdomestic household employment activities in private residences\u201d from coverage. (29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1975.6 (1998).) We have located no cases interpreting the extent of the federal exclusion. However, in <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Cordero </em>(D.P.R. 1981) 508 F.Supp. 324, 325, the court considered the term \u201c \u2018domestic service employee\u2019 \u201d within the context of the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq.), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>found the generally accepted meaning to be employees who perform home-related, noncommercial labor in private homes and whose work would normally be done by members of the family unit, but for the availability of outside paid help and the homeowner\u2019s ability to pay. \u201cIn other words, these are persons paid to do chores that are normally carried out in most homes by the family members themselves, without formal pay.\u201d <em>(Marshall </em>v. <em>Cordero, supra, </em>at p. 325.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Of the states which conduct occupational safety and health programs under 29 United States Code section 667(b), many have explicitly excluded household domestic services from coverage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Still others have implicitly limited coverage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Courts in other jurisdictions have concluded OSHA does not apply to homeowners. The Washington Court of Appeals concluded the Legislature had intended the term \u201c \u2018employer\u2019 \u201d defined in Revised Code of Washington, section 49.17.020(3) to be synonymous with \u201c \u2018business entity,\u2019 \u201d where the general term \u201c \u2018any person\u2019 \u201d began a list of entities summarized at the end by the phrase \u201c \u2018or other business entity.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Rogers </em>v. <em>Irving </em>(1997) 85 Wn.App. 455, 462-463 [933 P.2d 1060, 1063-1064].) The court noted that a homeowner building his own home with the assistance of others did not engage in business and was typically ill-equipped to assume OSHA duties. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1064.) In Minnesota, the court of appeal held the Legislature could not have intended OSHA to apply to the casual contracting presented and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>concluded that to apply OSHA to a situation it equated with hiring a youngster to mow the grass would subject nearly every conceivable work arrangement to its provisions and chill the willingness to hire others to work. <em>(Stenvik </em>v. <em>Constant </em>(Minn.Ct.App. 1993) 502 N.W.2d 416, 420.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">California, as well as much of the nation, has historically emphasized business, industry and trade in defining OSHA coverage, while at the same time excluding coverage for household domestic services. It is unlikely average homeowners expect that OSHA requirements would apply when they hire someone to trim a tree for their own personal benefit and not for a commercial purpose. Tree trimming is a task often performed by members of a household. Moreover, homeowners are ill-equipped to understand or to comply with the specialized requirements of OSHA. We conclude the Legislature intended to exclude private residence yard maintenance work, including tree trimming, from OSHA coverage under the \u201chousehold domestic service\u201d exclusion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Rosas contends that an activity requiring a contractor\u2019s license could not possibly be considered \u201cdomestic\u201d or \u201chousehold\u201d in nature. Without citation to authority, he implies that licensing statutes were enacted to ensure the safety of individuals either licensed or unlicensed who perform the \u201cserious\u201d work for which a licensed is required. The Contractors\u2019 State License Law was enacted to protect the public from dishonesty and incompetence in the business of contracting. <em>(Elliott </em>v. <em>Contractors\u2019 State License Bd. </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 1048, 1055 [274 Cal.Rptr. 286].) Work for which a license is required is not necessarily more dangerous than other tasks for which no license is required. The work performed by plumbers, painters and carpet installers, all work requiring a license (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7026, 7026.3; <em>Howards v. State of California </em>(1948) 85 Cal.App.2d 361, 364 [193 P.2d 11]; <em>Kirman </em>v. <em>Borzage </em>(1944) 65 Cal.App.2d 156, 158 [150 P.2d 3]), cannot be said to be more dangerous and in need of safety protection than wood chopping, a task requiring no license.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Had the Legislature intended that OSHA apply as Rosas suggests, it could have so provided. Instead, it excluded \u201chousehold domestic service\u201d from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>coverage. As previously discussed, we conclude the exclusion applies where a homeowner hires someone to trim a tree. The fact that the exclusion applies, however, does not mean homeowners are shielded from liability for injuries their negligence might cause. It simply means that failure to comply with the provisions of OSHA will not result in presumptive negligence and the deprivation of affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The judgment is reversed. The Dishongs are entitled to costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Kremer, P.

A bona fide independent contractor status is further evidenced by the presence of cumulative factors such as substantial investment other than personal services in the business, holding out to be in business for oneself, bargaining for a contract to complete a specific project for compensation by project rather than by time, control over the time and place the work is performed, supplying the tools or instrumentalities used in the work other than tools and instrumentalities normally and customarily provided by employees, hiring employees, performing work that is not ordinarily in the course of the principal\u2019s work, performing work that requires a particular skill, holding a license pursuant to the Business and Professions Code, the intent by the parties that the work relationship is of an independent contractor status, or that the relationship is not severable or terminable at will by the principal but gives rise to an action for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"ArW\">\u201cIn addition to the factors contained in subdivisions (a), (b), and (c), any person performing any function or activity for which a license is required pursuant to Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 7000) of Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code shall hold a valid contractors\u2019 license as a condition of having independent contractor status.</p>\n<p id=\"ATZ\">\u201cFor purposes of workers\u2019 compensation law, this presumption is a supplement to the existing statutory definitions of employee and independent contractor, and is not intended to lessen the coverage of employees under Division 4 and Division 5.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b675-8\"> The full analysis accepted by the court follows: 1) under section 3352, subdivision (h), Rosas is excluded from coverage under the workers\u2019 compensation scheme; 2) under sections 3600, subdivision (a)(1) and 3602, subdivision (c), the Dishongs have personal liability as Rosas\u2019s employers, as if division 4 of the Labor Code (workers\u2019 compensation provisions) had not been enacted; 3) applying division 3 of the Labor Code (\u00a7\u00a7 2700-2807) to the stipulated facts, Rosas may sue his employer for personal injuries; 4) under section 2750.5, Rosas is the Dishongs\u2019 employee as a matter of law because his lack of a license while performing work for which a license is required prevents the presumption of employee status from being rebutted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b675-9\"> The Dishongs refer us to <em>Furtado </em>v. <em>Schriefer </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1608 [280 Cal.Rptr. 16], concerning the interaction of sections 2750.5 and 3352, subdivision (h). They contend the case implies that while Rosas cannot be deemed to be an independent contractor for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation law, he should not as a matter of law be deemed to be an employee for purposes of tort law. Rosas on the other hand contends <em>Furtado </em>holds that if a plaintiff is excluded as an employee for workers\u2019 compensation coverage, he may pursue his civil suit as an employee. The question whether Furtado was an employee or an independent contractor for purposes of the civil suit was not at issue in <em>Furtado. </em>It provides us with no guidance for the questions raised here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b678-5\"> The record presented demonstrates the Dishongs hired Rosas solely in their capacity as homeowners.

In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>ACandS, Inc. </em>(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 77 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 457], Pacific Gas and Electric Company had power plants built using asbestos insulation. Under the then applicable Labor Code provisions, an owner could be deemed to be a statutory employer simply by virtue of its ultimate custody and control of its property. Case law, however, limited application of the safety regulations to owners exercising control over the operative details of the work. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 89-92.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b681-8\"> Judge of the San Diego Superior Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
