Code, \u00a7 1043, subd. (b)(3)) in that he failed to provide a \u201cspecific factual scenario\u201d establishing a \u201cplausible factual foundation\u201d for his allegations of police misconduct. <em>(City of Santa Cruz </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 74, 85-86 [260 Cal.Rptr. 520, 776 P.2d 222].) We will therefore issue a writ of mandate commanding the trial court to vacate its order releasing the peace officers\u2019 personnel records and to issue a new order denying defendant\u2019s discovery motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Defendant was charged with receiving stolen property (Pen. Code, \u00a7 496) and possession of a firearm by a felon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12021, subd. (a)(1)) after a search of his residence by four officers of the San Jose Police Department: Officers Knox, Ramirez, Berry and Brooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">According to the police report, on July 12, 1996, Officers Knox and Ramirez conducted follow-up investigation on an assault which reportedly had occurred the previous day. They identified defendant as a possible suspect in the assault and discovered defendant had an outstanding arrest warrant. Officers Knox, Ramirez, Berry and Brooks went to defendant\u2019s residence, where the officers contacted M\u00e1sele Taeleifi, the mother of defendant\u2019s children. Taeleifi initially stated that she was a friend of the family and explained that defendant rarely stayed at the house. Taeleifi gave the officers permission to search the residence for defendant. While searching, Officer Knox noticed photographs of defendant, Taeleifi, and their children. When he asked Taeleifi about the photographs, Taeleifi admitted she and defendant were involved in a relationship. Taeleifi then gave the officers permission to search the house for anything indicating defendant\u2019s whereabouts. Officer Ramirez located a man\u2019s jacket in a bedroom closet. He picked up the jacket and felt something heavy in one of the pockets. He recovered a .38-caliber revolver. Taeleifi stated that the jacket belonged to defendant, and that he had placed it in the closet several days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">Defendant was subsequently arrested. He filed a pretrial discovery motion in which he requested records relating to complaints filed against the four officers \u201cfor any instance of relevant conduct, including: illegal search and seizure, improper handling of evidence, failure to follow standard and/or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>outlined police procedure, neglect of duty, dishonesty or deceit in the performance of duty, false arrest, fabrication of evidence or charges, or untruthfulness in the preparation of offense reports or while testifying under oath\u201d and \u201cfor any act involving morally lax character.\u201d The information requested included: the names, addresses, phone numbers and custody status of persons filing such complaints; copies of police reports of the underlying incidents; statements and notes made during the investigation of the complaints; the names of persons investigating the complaints; investigation procedures; and the results of any investigations relating to the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">Defendant\u2019s discovery motion was accompanied by the police report, as well as the declaration of defense counsel, which stated: \u201cDefendant disputes the truthfulness of the allegations as set forth in the police report. At a motion to suppress and at trial if necessary, defendant intends to show the following: HQ a. That knowing and voluntary consent to enter was not in fact obtained by the officers; and HQ b. That material misrepresentations in the police report and/or in court testimony were made in order to conceal that fact; and HQ c. That evidence disclosed during that search was mishandled by the officers to such an extent as to deny [defendant] a fair trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Defense counsel\u2019s declaration asserted that the peace officers\u2019 personnel records would be \u201crelevant and admissible to show a propensity to act in such manner in the course of duty on this occasion,\u201d that the records \u201cmay be used to refresh the recollection of defense witnesses called to testify regarding such traits of character and/or to effectively cross-examine witnesses called by the People\u201d and that the records \u201cmay also lead to additional admissible evidence through the efforts of the defense investigation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">The City filed opposition to defendant\u2019s discovery motion. The City first argued the trial court should summarily deny defendant\u2019s discovery motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>as to Officers Berry and Brooks because the police report was written by Officer Knox and it indicated only Officer Ramirez conducted the search. The City further argued that defendant failed to make a showing of \u201cgood cause for the discovery or disclosure sought\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1043, subd. (b)(3)), in that he failed to provide adequate factual allegations to support the motion, and in that his request was overbroad and vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">At the hearing on defendant\u2019s discovery motion, held January 28, 1998, the trial court found \u201cgood cause shown to go ahead and conduct an in camera [review]\u201d of the peace officers\u2019 personnel records to determine whether any of the records were relevant and should be released. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 1045, subd. (a).) The trial court rejected the City\u2019s argument that the discovery motion should be limited to Officers Knox and Ramirez, ruling that defendant\u2019s \u201callegation of untruthfulness with regard to the consent issue . . . would apply to all of the officers.\u201d The trial court also denied the City\u2019s request to limit its in camera review of the peace officers\u2019 personnel records to \u201cthe illegal search and seizure issue,\u201d ruling that the records \u201cwould relate to credibility issues.\u201d The trial court explained: \u201cEssentially it\u2019s failure to follow proper procedures, and it\u2019s credibility issues to the extent there are complaints on those areas, and I think they are included.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">After conducting the in camera review of the peace officers\u2019 personnel records, the trial court ruled that it would release \u201cthe names and telephone numbers of certain complaining] witnesses . . . with regard to four separate cases,\u201d as well as \u201cthe results of internal investigation\u201d with regard to those four cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>On March 12, 1998, the City sought review of the trial court\u2019s order in this court, by way of petition for writ of mandate or, in the alternative, a writ of prohibition. On March 24, 1998, we filed an order staying the trial court\u2019s order requiring disclosure of the peace officers\u2019 personnel records. We ordered the trial court to transmit to this court a complete copy of the reporter\u2019s transcript of the January 28, 1998, proceedings, including the sealed transcript of the in camera hearing as well as copies of all records it had ordered disclosed. We ordered the City to file under seal copies of all records that the trial court had been provided with at the in camera hearing. On June 19, 1998, we issued an alternative writ of mandate and order to show cause to real party in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">\n<em>Statutory Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">In <em>Pitchess </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 531 [113 Cal.Rptr. 897, 522 P.2d 305], the defendant was charged with battery against four deputy sheriffs. Prior to trial, he moved for discovery of records of investigations of citizens\u2019 accusations of excessive force by the four deputies. The defendant asserted that at trial he would claim that he acted in self-defense in response to the deputies\u2019 use of excessive force and argued that the requested records were necessary as character evidence regarding the deputies\u2019 tendency for violence supporting his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">The California Supreme Court held that a criminal defendant has a limited right to discovery of peace officer personnel records \u201cbased on the fundamental proposition that he [or she] is entitled to a fair trial and an intelligent defense in light of all relevant and reasonably accessible information.\u201d <em>(Pitchess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 535.) The court noted that \u201cin contrast to the formal requirements of civil discovery, an accused in a criminal prosecution may compel discovery by demonstrating that the requested information will facilitate the ascertainment of facts and a fair trial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 536.) The court explained that \u201c[t]he requisite showing may be satisfied by general allegations which establish some cause for discovery other than \u2018a mere desire for the benefit of all information which has been obtained by the People in their investigation of the crime.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 537.)</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">The <em>Pitchess </em>court further noted that \u201c[e]ven upon a showing of good cause, however, the right of an accused to obtain discovery is not absolute.\u201d <em>(Pitchess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 538.) The court explained that a court considering an accused\u2019s discovery motion \u201c \u2018retains wide discretion to protect against the disclosure of information which might unduly hamper the prosecution or violate some other legitimate government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>interest.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting <em>Joe </em>Z. v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 797, 804 [91 Cal.Rptr. 594, 478 P.2d 26].)</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">The guidelines specified in <em>Pitchess </em>were articulated \u201c \u2018in the absence of legislation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Pitchess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 536.) Thus, in 1978, the Legislature \u201ccodified the privileges and procedures surrounding what had come to be known as <em>\u2018Pitchess </em>motions\u2019 \u201d by enacting Penal Code sections 832.7 and 832.8 and Evidence Code sections 1043 through 1045. <em>(City of Santa Cruz </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 81; Stats. 1978, ch. 630, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3, 5, 6, pp. 2082-2083.)</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Penal Code section 832.7 provides that \u201c[p]eace officer personnel records ... are confidential and shall not be disclosed in any criminal or civil proceeding except by discovery pursuant to Sections 1043 and 1046 of the Evidence Code.\u201d Penal Code section 832.8 specifies that peace officer personnel records include \u201cany file maintained under that individual\u2019s name by his or her employing agency and containing records relating to ... HQ \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [1D (d) Employee advancement, appraisal, or discipline; HQ (e) Complaints, or investigations of complaints, concerning an event or transaction in which he or she participated, or which he or she perceived, and pertaining to the manner in which he or she performed his or her duties; or [1Q (f) Any other information the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Evidence Code sections 1043 and 1045 set out a two-step process for discovery of peace officer personnel records. Evidence Code section 1043<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> specifies that the moving party must submit a written motion which contains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>\u201c[a] description of the type of records or information sought,\u201d supported by \u201c[ajffidavits showing good cause for the discovery or disclosure sought, setting forth the materiality thereof to the subject matter involved in the pending litigation and stating upon reasonable belief that such governmental agency identified has such records or information from such records.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1043, subd. (b).) The moving party must also provide notice to the governmental agency which possesses the records, and the agency must, in turn, notify the person whose records are sought. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1043, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">Evidence Code section 1045* *<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> specifies that once the moving party has made a showing of good cause for disclosure of peace officer personnel records, the trial court proceeds to an in chambers examination of the records to determine whether they have any relevance to the issues presented in the current proceedings. During this examination, the trial court must exclude \u201ccomplaints concerning conduct occurring more than five years before the event or transaction which is the subject of the litigation in aid of which discovery or disclosure is sought,\u201d \u201cthe conclusions of any officer investigating a complaint,\u201d and \u201c[fjacts . . . which are so remote as to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>disclosure of little or no practical benefit.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1045, subd. (b)(1), (2), (3).) Evidence Code section 1045 also provides the governmental agency and the peace officer whose records have been requested with the right to move for a protective order, thus assuring the officer of due process and protecting him or her from \u201cneglect on the part of his or her employer.\u201d <em>(City of Fresno </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1459, 1472 [253 Cal.Rptr. 296].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">As the California Supreme Court recognized in <em>City of Santa Cruz </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at page 84, this statutory scheme \u201ccarefully balances two directly conflicting interests: the peace officer\u2019s just claim to confidentiality, and the criminal defendant\u2019s equally compelling interest in all information pertinent to his [or her] defense.\u201d The court further explained: \u201cThe relatively relaxed standards for a showing of good cause under section 1043, subdivision (b)\u2014\u2018materiality\u2019 to the subject matter of the pending litigation and a \u2018reasonable belief\u2019 that the agency, has the type of information sought\u2014insure the production for inspection of all potentially relevant documents. The in camera review procedure and disclosure guidelines set forth in section 1045 guarantee, in turn, a balancing of the officer\u2019s privacy interests against the defendant\u2019s need for disclosure.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Memro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 658, 680 [214 Cal.Rptr. 832, 700 P.2d 446], the California Supreme Court recognized that in adopting the above provisions of the Evidence Code and Penal Code, the Legislature \u201cnot only reaffirmed but expanded\u201d the principles of <em>Pitchess. </em>Thus, while <em>Pitchess </em>arose in the context of a defendant charged with battery upon four deputy sheriffs who sought to discover the deputies\u2019 personnel records in order to support his claim of self-defense, the Supreme Court concluded that the above statutes \u201cdo not limit discovery of such records to cases involving altercations between police officers and arrestees.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 679.)</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">The City contends that the trial court abused its discretion by granting defendant\u2019s <em>Pitchess </em>motion because defendant failed to make a showing of \u201cgood cause for the discovery or disclosure sought,\u201d as required by Evidence Code section 1043, subdivision (b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\">\u201cA motion for discovery of peace officer personnel records is \u2018addressed solely to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u2019 <em>(Pitchess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 535.) A review of the lower court\u2019s ruling is subject to an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gill </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 743, 749 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 369]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Memro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 684.)</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">\n<em>Good Cause Showing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">As explained above, under Evidence Code section 1043, subdivision (b)(3), a party moving for discovery of peace officer personnel records must include \u201c[affidavits showing good cause for the discovery or disclosure sought, setting forth the materiality thereof to the subject matter involved in the pending litigation . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">At the outset, we reject the City\u2019s contention that defendant failed to make a showing of \u201cgood cause for the discovery or disclosure sought\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1043, subd. (b)(3)) because he failed to attach a declaration from Taeleifi, the percipient witness.  Our Supreme Court has made it clear that \u201c[s]ection 1043 contains no requirement of \u2018personal knowledge\u2019 on the part of the affiant\u201d and that affidavits supporting motions for discovery of peace officer personnel records may be based merely on \u201cinformation and belief.\u201d <em>(City of Santa Cruz </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 86, 89.) The court explained: \u201c[T]he legislative history demonstrates that the notion of requiring a showing of materiality based on \u2018personal knowledge\u2019 and \u2018full detail\u2019 of the relevant facts was considered and expressly <em>rejected </em>by the legislative draftsmen. The legislative history, the case law background, and the statutory language all point to the same conclusion: the \u2018materiality\u2019 component of section 1043, subdivision (b) may be satisfied by affidavits based on information and belief.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 89, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">The City argues that because the rule that an affidavit in support of a criminal defendant\u2019s discovery motion need not be based on personal knowledge protects a criminal defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination (see <em>City of Redding </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1181, 1187 [246 Cal.Rptr. 417]), the rule should not apply where the defendant is not the percipient witness. However, as stated above, the Supreme Court\u2019s rationale for concluding that an affidavit may be based on information and belief rather than personal knowledge was not based on the Fifth Amendment. Moreover, we find no basis for reading the <em>City of Santa Cruz </em>opinion as limiting the rule to situations where the defendant is the percipient witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>We next consider the City\u2019s contention that defendant failed to make a showing of \u201cgood cause for the discovery or disclosure sought\u201d because defense counsel\u2019s supporting declaration failed to set forth a \u201cspecific factual scenario\u201d which provided sufficient information to allow the trial court to assess whether the records were material \u201cto the subject matter involved in the pending litigation.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1043, subd. (b)(3).) The \u201cspecific factual scenario\u201d language upon which the City relies is found in <em>City of Santa Cruz </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at page 85. In that case, the defendant was charged with resisting arrest (Pen. Code, \u00a7 148) and exhibiting a knife (Pen. Code, \u00a7 417). He moved for discovery of complaints regarding the arresting officers\u2019 use of excessive force in effecting arrests. His motion was supported by police reports and the declaration of defense counsel. The police reports indicated that the defendant resisted arrest and that in order to effect the arrest, one of the officers struck the defendant with his fist and wrestled him to the ground. The declaration alleged that the officers handcuffed the defendant, threw him to the ground, and stepped on his head, thereby using excessive force and rendering the arrest illegal. The declaration stated that complaints of similar behavior by the officers would show the officers\u2019 propensity to use excessive force in effecting arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">The court in <em>City of Santa Cruz </em>concluded that the defendant had made a showing of good cause for discovery of such records: \u201cThe police reports make clear that considerable force was used to effect the arrest. Counsel\u2019s declaration asserts that the officers used excessive force \u2018so as to make said arrest illegal and otherwise improper.\u2019 The declaration sets forth, on the basis of information and belief, a specific factual scenario to support that assertion. Counsel avers that she seeks the information relating to prior complaints of excessive force against the arresting officers to \u2018show a tendency or propensity on the part of the arresting officers [s] herein to engage in the use of unlawful and excessive force in the execution of the arrests.\u2019 HQ Viewed in conjunction with the police reports, counsel\u2019s averments establish a plausible factual foundation for an allegation of excessive force, put the court on notice that the officers\u2019 alleged use of excessive force will likely be an issue at trial, and articulate a valid theory as to how the information sought might be admissible. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(City of Santa Cruz </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 85-86.)</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">In this case, counsel\u2019s declaration, considered in conjunction with the police report, failed to make a showing of \u201cgood cause for the discovery or disclosure sought\u201d under Evidence Code section 1043, subdivision (b)(3) because it did not provide a \u201cspecific factual scenario\u201d establishing a \u201cplausible factual foundation\u201d for the three allegations of police misconduct and therefore did not set forth the materiality of \u201cthe discovery or disclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>sought\u201d to \u201cthe subject matter involved in the pending litigation.\u201d (See <em>City of Santa Cruz </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 85-86; Evid. Code, \u00a7 1043, subd. (b)(3).) We will consider each of defense counsel\u2019s three allegations separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">Defense counsel first declared that \u201cknowing and voluntary consent to enter was not in fact obtained by the officers.\u201d The declaration did not specify whether the officers coerced Taeleifi into consenting (and if so, what means of coercion the police employed), or whether the officers simply failed to obtain Taeleifi\u2019s consent. The police report sheds no further light on this issue. The only relevant statements in the police report were \u201cTaeleifi gave us permission to look around the house for the suspect\u201d and \u201cTaeleifi gave us permission to look around the house for anything that might indicate [defendant\u2019s] whereabouts.\u201d Without a \u201cspecific factual scenario\u201d establishing a \u201cplausible factual foundation\u201d for the allegations of police misconduct, the trial court could not properly determine whether the \u201cdiscovery or disclosure sought\u201d was material to \u201cthe subject matter involved in the pending litigation.\u201d (See <em>City of Santa Cruz </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 85-86; Evid. Code, \u00a7 1043, subd. (b)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Defense counsel\u2019s second allegation was that \u201cmaterial misrepresentations in the police report and/or in court testimony were made in order to conceal\u201d the fact that \u201cknowing and voluntary consent to enter was not in fact obtained by the officers.\u201d Again, the declaration failed to provide a \u201cspecific factual scenario\u201d establishing a \u201cplausible factual foundation\u201d for this allegation. <em>(City of Santa Cruz </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 85-86.) Defendant did not specify which particular statement or statements in the police report or in the officers\u2019 testimony contained material misrepresentations, nor did he explain in what respect the statements were incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Defense counsel\u2019s third allegation was that \u201cevidence disclosed during that search was mishandled by the officers to such an extent as to deny [defendant] a fair trial.\u201d As with the previous two allegations, defendant\u2019s motion did not provide a \u201cspecific factual scenario\u201d establishing a \u201cplausible factual foundation\u201d for this assertion. <em>(City of Santa Cruz </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 85-86.) The police report stated that the officers took as evidence the jacket in which they discovered the gun, the gun itself, the bullets, a phone bill, and defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license, and that the seized evidence was booked at \u201ccentral supply.\u201d Defendant not only failed to specify which item or items of evidence were mishandled but also failed to specify how the evidence was mishandled. The declaration did not assert that booking evidence at central supply was an improper procedure, or that the evidence was not in fact booked at central supply, or that the evidence was mishandled in some other respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>In arguing that he did make a showing of good cause for discovery of the peace officers\u2019 personnel records, defendant points out that defense counsel made additional factual allegations during the hearing on the discovery motion. At the hearing, defense counsel asserted; \u201cThe facts as adduced at the preliminary [hearing] on this matter show that this search happened around 11:30 at night. HQ The house in question was surrounded by two officers at the rear door and Officers Ramirez and Knox at the front door. HQ It was also adduced that subsequently, those two officers at the rear door came around and did enter the house, they occupied the house for about two and a half hours at the time of night in the house occupied by [Taeleifi], I believe, and her two children as well. HQ Our contention is that the failure of the lack of consent was ongoing throughout that two and a half hour period</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Our record does not contain the preliminary hearing transcript. However, even if the trial court could properly consider defense counsel\u2019s oral argument based on the preliminary hearing transcript, we conclude defendant still did not make a showing of \u201cgood cause for the discovery or disclosure sought.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1043, subd. (b)(3).) While defense counsel provided additional facts relating to the search, he did not clear up any of the ambiguities in his declaration. His reference to \u201cthe failure of the lack of consent\u201d did not help clarify whether the officers coerced Taeleifi into giving consent or whether they simply failed to obtain her consent, and none of his comments clarified the ambiguities relating to the allegations that the officers mishandled evidence and made misstatements in the police reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Defendant cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Memro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d 658 in support of his claim that defense counsel\u2019s declaration was sufficient to make a good cause showing under Evidence Code section 1043, subdivision (b)(3). In <em>Memro, </em>the defendant was charged with murder after he confessed to two killings. He moved to suppress his confession and moved for discovery of records of complaints relating to the interrogating officers\u2019 use of excessive force, aggressive behavior, and violence. Defense counsel\u2019s declaration asserted that the defendant\u2019s confession \u201c \u2018came after an illegal arrest, promises of leniency, and threats of violence by the officers present\u2019 \u201d and that the requested materials would be admissible to show it was the officers\u2019 habit or custom to engage in violent behavior and to show the officers\u2019 common plan, motive or intent to coerce confessions. (38 Cal.3d at p. 680; see Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1101, subd. (b), 1105.) The court concluded that defense counsel\u2019s declaration \u201csatisfied <em>Pitchess </em>and Evidence Code section 1043.\u201d (38 Cal.3d at p. 682.) The court reasoned that while \u201cthe factual allegations could have been more specific,\u201d the declaration at least \u201carticulated a theory as to how the information would be used\u201d in litigating the question whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>confession was coerced, which \u201cwent far beyond expressing \u2018a mere desire for the benefit of all information\u2019 which was in the prosecutor\u2019s hands.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\"><em>Memro </em>is clearly distinguishable from the instant case. There, by asserting that his confession was coerced by promises of leniency and threats of violence, the defendant provided a \u201cspecific factual scenario\u201d establishing a \u201cplausible factual foundation\u201d for the allegations of police misconduct and which thereby enabled the trial court to determine the materiality of \u201cthe discovery or disclosure sought\u201d to \u201cthe subject matter involved in the pending litigation.\u201d (See <em>City of Santa Cruz </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 85-86; Evid. Code, \u00a7 1043, subd. (b)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Here, defendant asserted that \u201cknowing and voluntary consent to enter was not in fact obtained,\u201d without explaining in what respect the search was illegal. Similarly, defendant only asserted that the police reports contained \u201cmaterial misrepresentations\u201d and that the police had \u201cmishandled\u201d evidence, without explaining what the misrepresentations were, what items of evidence were mishandled, or how the evidence was mishandled. He therefore failed to provide a \u201cspecific factual scenario\u201d establishing a \u201cplausible factual foundation\u201d for the allegations. <em>(City of Santa Cruz </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 85-86.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Without some notice of the specifics of the allegedly improper police conduct, the trial court could not determine whether \u201cthe discovery or disclosure sought\u201d was material to \u201cthe subject matter involved in the pending litigation.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1043, subd. (b)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Gill, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th 743 is consistent with the principle that, in order to make a showing of \u201cgood cause\u201d under Evidence Code section 1043, the defendant must provide a \u201cspecific factual scenario\u201d establishing a \u201cplausible factual foundation\u201d for allegations of police misconduct. In <em>Gill, </em>the defendant was charged with possession of cocaine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350, subd. (a)). According to the arresting officer, the defendant attempted to remove certain items from his jacket pocket while the officer was searching him. The officer stated that he then placed the defendant in a \u201ctwist lock,\u201d and then took the defendant to the ground and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>handcuffed him. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gill, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at p. 746.) The defendant asserted, through counsel, that he planned to show that the arresting officer had planted the cocaine on defendant to cover up his use of excessive force, and he moved for discovery of confidential personnel file materials relating to the arresting officer\u2019s prior use of violence and excessive force, his fabrication of probable cause, and his planting of evidence to cover up his violence or use of excessive force. The Court of Appeal concluded the defendant\u2019s assertions were sufficient to make a showing of good cause under Evidence Code section 1043, subdivision (b)(3). (60 Cal.App.4th at p. 750.)</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Here, by contrast, defendant alleged only that the police failed to obtain \u201cknowing and voluntary consent to enter,\u201d made \u201cmaterial representations in the police report,\u201d and \u201cmishandled\u201d evidence. He did not provide a \u201cspecific factual scenario\u201d establishing a \u201cplausible factual foundation\u201d for such allegations. <em>(City of Santa Cruz </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 85-86.) The allegations were too general to allow the trial court to properly determine whether \u201cthe discovery or disclosure sought\u201d would be material to \u201cthe subject matter involved in the pending litigation.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1043, subd. (b)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">In addition, defendant\u2019s discovery request was overly broad. Defendant did not simply request peace officer personnel records pertinent to a specific factual scenario (i.e., complaints that the officers had coerced consent to search or complaints that the officers had failed to obtain consent to search). Instead, he requested peace officer personnel records relating to \u201cillegal search and seizure\u201d and complaints of \u201cneglect of duty, dishonesty or deceit in the performance of duty, false arrest\u201d and acts \u201cinvolving morally lax character.\u201d In this respect, the instant case is similar to <em>People </em>v. <em>Memro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d 658. In <em>Memro, </em>the defendant requested all complaints of excessive force by the officers present during his interrogation. The court concluded the request was overly broad, reasoning: \u201cSince appellant sought \u2022the information to bolster his claim of involuntariness in the interrogation setting, only complaints by persons who alleged coercive techniques in questioning were relevant.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 685.)</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">We conclude, under the guidance of the California Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Pitchess, Memro, </em>and <em>City of Santa Cruz, </em>that the trial court abused its discretion by finding that defendant made a showing of \u201cgood cause for the discovery or disclosure sought\u201d pursuant to Evidence Code section 1043, subdivision (b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue commanding respondent court to vacate its January 28, 1998, order requiring production of peace officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>personnel records, and to issue a new order denying defendant\u2019s motion for discovery.

I am a Deputy Public Defender for the County of Santa Clara and have been assigned to represent the defendant, ... in the above-entitled case. Defendant has been charged with violations of Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 12021(a)(1) and 496. [1J] 2. A copy of San Jose Police Department offense report #96-194-1524, describing the search of 1741 Foley Avenue, San Jose, is attached to this motion as exhibit A. It alleges that while looking for [defendant] regarding another matter, the officers gained consent to perform a search of that residence. During that search, a handgun was allegedly found in a bedroom allegedly occupied by [defendant], fl[] 3. Defendant disputes the truthfulness of the allegations as set forth in the police report. At a motion to suppress and at trial if necessary, defendant intends to show the following: [1[] a. That knowing and voluntary consent to enter was not in fact obtained by the officers; and [f] b. That material misrepresentations in the police report and/or in court testimony were made in order to conceal that fact; and HQ c. That evidence disclosed during that search was mishandled by the officers to such an extent as to deny [defendant] a fair trial. flQ 4. In order to establish these defenses, the defense seeks to discover evidence of prior citizen complaints \u2022against the officers regarding previous acts of misconduct involving illegal search and seizure, improper handling of evidence, failure to follow standard and/or outlined police procedure, neglect of duty, dishonesty or deceit in the performance of duty, false arrest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>fabrication of evidence or charges, untruthfulness in the preparation of offense reports or while testifying under oath or other acts indicating morally lax character. The information sought is material and relevant and is necessary in order to properly prepare the case for trial. Such evidence, whether in the form of opinion, reputation or specific instances of conduct, is relevant and admissible to show a propensity to act in such manner in the course of duty on this occasion. Further, this information, may be used to refresh the recollection of defense witnesses called to testify regarding such traits of character and/or to effectively cross-examine witnesses called by the People. The information may also lead to additional admissible evidence through the efforts of the defense investigation. HQ 5.1 am informed and believe and therefore allege that the San Jose Police Department maintains records, documents and other evidence in officers\u2019 personnel files and/or elsewhere regarding complaints filed by private citizens and other law enforcement personnel alleging illegal, unethical, dishonest, improper or unprofessional conduct of the nature requested herein. Said department may also have in its possession records and information regarding the investigation of such complaints and the results thereof conducted by the department\u2019s Internal Affairs Bureau or other investigators at the direction of the department.
