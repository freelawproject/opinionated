Defendant pled nolo contendere, resulting in his conviction on one count of perjury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 118) and four counts of making a false financial statement (Pen. Code, \u00a7 532a, subd. (1)). Defendant was sentenced to a total term of two years eight months in state prison. Defendant has appealed from the judgment and has filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, which have been consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>In the appeal, defendant contends: (1) the trial court erred in denying his motion to continue; (2) the trial court erred in denying his Marsden<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> motion; and (3) he was denied effective assistance of counsel. In the petition for writ of habeas corpus, defendant contends he was denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">In his ineffective assistance of counsel argument, defendant contends the following: the two counts of making a false financial statement (Pen. Code, \u00a7 532a, subd. (1)) involving renting apartments were legally insufficient; since his counsel did not properly advise him of the legal insufficiency of the two counts, his plea was based upon this erroneous understanding of the law and cannot stand. In the published portions of this opinion (pts. I, II.A, and HI), we find this contention persuasive, grant the petition for writ of habeas corpus and remand to provide defendant the opportunity to withdraw his plea. In the unpublished portion of this opinion (pts. II.B and II.C), we reject defendant\u2019s other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">A. <em>Facts.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">In March 1996, John Argiris reported to the police that someone had been impersonating him and using his credit history to purchase items. This ruined Mr. Argiris\u2019s credit rating. Defendant was a boyhood friend of Mr. Argiris. Defendant had visited Mr. Argiris two years prior and during that visit had taken Mr. Argiris\u2019s Social Security card.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">Based upon the information provided by Mr. Argiris, the police searched defendant\u2019s residence in Studio City. During the search, a driver\u2019s license in the name of Mr. Argiris was discovered; it bore a photograph of defendant. Additionally, an automated teller card, checks, a birth certificate, a Social Security card and credit cards in the name of John Argiris were discovered. The original application for the driver\u2019s license was obtained from the Department of Motor Vehicles; it bore defendant\u2019s photograph.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">The police investigation revealed the following four incidents in which defendant had used Mr. Argiris\u2019s identity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>(1) On July 3, 1995, defendant filled out a \u201cResident Credit Application\u201d seeking to reside in an apartment in Sherman Oaks. On the application, defendant used the name of John Argiris. He provided a Social Security number, personal and work history, and bank account and credit card information. The property manager relied on the application and defendant\u2019s fraudulent credit history to lease an apartment to defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-4\">(2) In October 1995, defendant went to Magic Lincoln Mercury in Valencia where he completed a credit application using the name of John Argiris. Based upon the information he provided, defendant obtained 100 percent financing to purchase a car. Comerica financed the transaction. Comerica relied upon the fraudulent information to issue a loan in excess of $20,000. Defendant left the dealership with a car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-5\">(3) In October 1995, defendant went to Bartel\u2019s Harley Davidson dealership in Marina del Rey where he completed a credit application using the name of John Argiris. Defendant showed the dealership\u2019s financial manager a driver\u2019s license in that name. Defendant secured credit for the purchase of a motorcycle. He put no money down. The lender, Green Tree Financial, relied upon the application to loan defendant sufficient funds to purchase the motorcycle. Defendant left the dealership with a motorcycle worth more than $25,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-6\">(4) On February 24, 1996, defendant, using the name of John Argiris, completed and signed a rental application for a one-bedroom apartment located in Studio City. On the form, defendant provided a work history and stated he resided in Sherman Oaks. Defendant also provided credit and personal references, a Social Security number, and a driver\u2019s license number. Subsequently, defendant used the name of John Argiris to enter into a rental agreement to reside in the one-bedroom apartment in Studio City. Defendant was able to rent the apartment predicated upon the fraudulent information he provided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">B. <em>Procedure.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Defendant was charged in count I with perjury, in violation of Penal Code section 118. The pequry charge was based upon the submission of false information under penalty of perjury in applying for a California driver\u2019s license. In counts II, III, IV and V, defendant was charged with making a false financial statement, in violation of Penal Code section 532a, subdivision <em>(1). Count </em>II involved making false statements on July 3, 1995, with regard to applying to reside in the apartment located in Sherman Oaks. Count III and count IV concerned making false statements enabling defendant to purchase the motorcycle and the car. Count V involved making false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>statements on February 24, 1996, in applying to reside in the apartment located in Studio City.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The trial court advised defendant that if he pled guilty to all five counts, defendant would be sentenced to two years eight months in prison. Defendant pled nolo contendere on all counts. Defendant was sentenced to a total prison term of two years eight months.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A judgment was entered. A certificate of probable cause was issued by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Defendant appeals from the judgment. He has also filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus. We have consolidated the petition and appeal and have issued an order to show cause. The People filed a return and defendant filed a traverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">A. <em>Defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">In his appeal and petition for writ of habeas corpus, defendant contends he did not receive effective assistance of counsel. This argument relates to counts II and V in which defendant was convicted of violating Penal Code section 532a, subdivision (1) for submitting false financial information in applying to rent two apartments. Defendant argues it is not a violation of Penal Code section 532a subdivision (1) to provide false information on a rental application; his trial counsel should have advised him of this fact; his counsel should have taken steps to prevent defendant from pleading nolo contendere to counts II and V, such as filing a motion to dismiss these two counts; and he would not have pled nolo contendere to all charges had he been properly advised. Since this contention has merit, we grant the petition for habeas corpus and remand to provide defendant with an opportunity to withdraw his pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">1. <em>Defendants are entitled to effective assistance of counsel when entering a plea.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">\u201cThe pleading\u2014and plea bargaining\u2014stage of a criminal proceeding is a critical stage in the criminal process at which a defendant is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the federal and California Constitutions.\u201d <em>(In re Alvernaz </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 924, 933 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 713, 830 P.2d 747].) \u201cAlthough [the decision as to whether to plead guilty pursuant to a plea bargain is a decision ultimately made by the defendant], it is the attorney, not the client, who is particularly qualified to make an Informed evaluation of a proffered plea bargain. The defendant can be expected to rely on counsel\u2019s independent evaluation of the charges, applicable law, and evidence, and of the risks and probable outcome of trial. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Defense counsel have the obligation to investigate all defenses, explore the factual bases for defenses <em>(In re Neely </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 901, 919 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 203, 864 P.2d 474]) and the applicable law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Plager </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1537, 1543 [242 Cal.Rptr. 624].) \u201cIf counsel\u2019s failure to perform these obligations results in the withdrawal of a potentially meritorious defense, defendant has not had the assistance to which he is entitled.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 537, 545-546 [223 Cal.Rptr. 66].)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">\u201cIt is well settled that where ineffective assistance of counsel results in the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty, the defendant has suffered a constitutional violation giving rise to a claim for relief from the guilty plea. [Citations.] [When the contention is that incompetent advice led to a defendant pleading guilty], ... a defendant must establish not only incompetent performance by counsel, but also a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s incompetence, the defendant would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on proceeding to trial. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Alvemaz, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 934.)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Plager, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d 1537, Plager was convicted by jury of robbery. There\u00e1fter, in a bifurcated proceeding, Plager admitted he had previously suffered two <em>residential </em>burglaries. However, based upon the law at that time, the prosecution would not have been able to prove the two prior burglary convictions were of residences. The appellate court concluded Plager received ineffective assistance of counsel when he admitted the prior allegations because his counsel had failed to investigate the applicable law and failed to advise him the priors could not have been proven. (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1351 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 48]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McCary </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 1 [212 Cal.Rptr. 114].)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>2. <em>Making a false financial statement, Penal Code section 532a.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel argument is based upon his claim that, as a matter of law, using false information in completing apartment rental applications does not violate Penal Code section 532a, subdivision (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">In pertinent part, Penal Code section 532a, subdivision (1) reads: \u201cAny person who shall knowingly make or cause to be made, either directly or indirectly . . . any false statement in writing, with intent that it shall be relied upon, respecting the financial condition, or means or ability to pay, of himself, ... for the purpose of procuring in any form whatsoever, either the delivery of personal property, the payment of cash, <em>the making of a loan or credit, the extension of a credit, </em>the execution of a contract of guaranty or suretyship, the discount of an account receivable, or the making, acceptance, discount, sale or indorsement of a bill of exchange, or promissory note, for the benefit of . . . himself . . . shall be guilty of a public offense.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">Since other provisions of Penal Code section 532a, subdivision (1) are not applicable, the People argue that when defendant furnished false information on the two rental applications, defendant unlawfully procured \u201ccredit.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">Penal Code section 532a does not define the term \u201ccredit.\u201d In context, however, its meaning is evident.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It means one is guilty of a crime when one is granted rights by a creditor to defer payment of a debt. When a creditor \u201cextends credit,\u201d or one procures the \u201cmaking of credit\u201d the creditor has granted the right to the \u201cdebtor to defer payment of debt or to incur debt and defer its payment.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dict. (5th ed. 1979) p. 331, col. 1.) In this context, \u201ccredit\u201d is \u201c[t]he ability of a . . . person to borrow money, or obtain goods on time, in consequence of the favorable opinion held by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>particular lender as to solvency and reliability.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>This definition is consistent with the definition of \u201ccredit\u201d found in other statutes. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1812.30, subd. (g) [\u201c \u2018credit\u2019 means obtainment of money, property, labor, or services on a deferred-payment basis\u201d]; Civ. Code, \u00a7 2957, subd. (d) [\u201c \u2018[c]redit\u2019 means the right granted by a vendor to a purchaser to purchase property and to defer payment therefore\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Here, the two questionable counts of violating Penal Code section 532a subdivision (1) were premised upon defendant being able to rent two apartments by falsely providing financial information on rent applications. While the fraudulent financial information established a false \u201ccredit history\u201d or \u201ccredit rating,\u201d and induced the landlords to lease the apartments to defendant, it did not result in defendant obtaining \u201ccredit,\u201d nor was \u201ccredit\u201d extended to him. When one rents an apartment or signs a lease, one does not obtain \u201ccredit.\u201d A renter does not defer the payment on property acquired. A renter acquires temporary rights through a leasehold.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">We also note, that other Penal Code provisions addressing theft and fraud (e.g., Pen. Code, \u00a7 532) specifically include the procurement of property, both personal and real. In contrast, Penal Code section 532a, does not specifically mention real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Having concluded that submitting false financial information to a potential landlord does not result in a violation of Penal Code section 532a, subdivision (1), we must conclude the performance of defendant\u2019s trial counsel fell below the objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s evaluation of the law should have revealed that there was no factual basis to support counts II and V. Defendant\u2019s counsel should have taken appropriate steps to challenge the legal sufficiency of these two counts, such as filing a motion to dismiss them. At a minimum, defendant\u2019s counsel should have provided defendant with an accurate evaluation of the law, thereby affording defendant a clear means of assessing the disposition being offered to him by the trial court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th 1351; <em>People </em>v. <em>McCary, supra, </em>166 Cal.App.3d 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>The People note that neither <em>People </em>v. <em>Vincent, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th 696 (see <em>ante, </em>fn. 5), nor any other case discussing Penal Code section 532a involved an issue similar to the one before us. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Breyer </em>(1934) 139 Cal.App. 547 [34 P.2d 1065].) The People then argue defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance could not have been deficient because defendant\u2019s trial counsel could not have anticipated our ruling. (Cf. <em>In re Alvernaz, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 937 [simple misjudgment, without more, does not give rise to claim of ineffective assistance of counsel].) However, we are not suggesting defendant\u2019s counsel should have anticipated this ruling. Rather, our conclusion is premised upon the obligation of defendant\u2019s trial counsel to inform defendant of the dearth of legal authority, and to inform defendant that the legal evaluation of the case was based thereon. Further, as the People seem to concede, at a minimum, defendant\u2019s trial counsel could have discussed with defendant the potential for filing a motion pursuant to Penal Code section 995, and the potential consequences of a motion to challenge the pleading.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The People also argue that even if defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance fell below the acceptable standards, defendant has not shown prejudice because defendant has failed to demonstrate he would have benefited from the receipt of accurate information or from a successful motion to dismiss (Pen. Code, \u00a7 995). The People argue, \u201c[defendant] was sentenced to actual prison time only with respect to the perjury count and one count of making a false financial statement. The fact that [defendant] entered a plea of nolo contendere as to the perjury count and one of the four false financial statement counts precludes any serious contention that [defendant] would not have so pled on the basis of the same proffered bargain had he been facing three potential sentences instead of five.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">By this argument, the People ignore trial court realities. In the declaration of defendant\u2019s trial counsel attached to the petition for writ of habeas corpus, he declared that after evaluating the law, he believed there was legal merit to all five counts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court advised defendant that if he pled to all five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>counts, defendant would be sentenced to two years eight months in prison. In defendant\u2019s declaration, he asserted that based upon advice of counsel, he understood he was \u201cstuck with all five charges and could not make any kind of motion or request to have any counts dismissed.\u201d Further, had he known of the legal insufficiency of counts II and V, defendant declared, he would have contested the truth of those charges and \u201cwould not have entered the plea to either count knowing the prosecutor could not prove the charges. I would have demanded a trial despite the judge\u2019s sentence bargain.\u201d We cannot assume, as do the People, the disposition offered to defendant would have been the same, had there been three rather than five counts. In resolving cases, the number and types of charges are considered. Defendant was prejudiced by the actions of his counsel.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">The People further argue defendant cannot show prejudice because, had a motion been brought, the charging document would have been amended to include other charges relating to the two leaseholds. This argument is based upon speculation; it assumes amendments would have been made and, inherently, it assumes the potential consequences of such amendments would have been more severe.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel when he entered his plea.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Defendant must be given the opportunity to withdraw his plea. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCary, supra, </em>166 Cal.App.3d 1; <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, 36 </em>Cal.App.4th 1351.)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">B\u201e C.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">The petition for habeas corpus is granted.
