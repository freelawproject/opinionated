This was an ejectment brought in that Court by the plaintiff in error against the defendants. Upon the first trial of the cause, a judg-. ment was rendered in the Circuit Court in favour of the defendants, and upon th\u00e1t judgment a writ of error was taken out, and the judgment reversed by this Court, at February Term, 1815; and the caus\u00e9 was sent back to be tried according to certain directions, prescribed by this Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AO-\">As the opinion given by this Court upon the reversal of the first judgment contains a statement of the facts given in evidence upon the first trial, it is deemed proper to insert the opinion in this place. It is as. follows: On the trial of this cause, the plaintiff produced two patents for 5,000 acres each, from the State of . North Carolina, granting to Stokely Donel^on, (from whom the plaintiff derived his title,) two several tracts of land lying on Crow creek, the one No. ,12. beginning at a box elder standing on a ridge corner t\u00f3\u00bbNo. 11. &amp;c. <em>as, by the plat hereunto annexed will appear. </em>. The plat and certificate of survey were, annexed to the grant. The plaintiff proved that there were eleven other grants of the same date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>for 5,000 acres each, issued from the State of North Carolina, designated as a chain of surveys joining each other from No. 1. to No. 11. inclusive', each calling for land on Crow creek as a general call, and the courses and distances of which, as described in the grants, are the same with the grants produced tq the jury, it was also proved that the beginning of the first grant was marked and intended as the beginning corner of No. 1. but no other tree was marked, nor was any survey ever made, but the plat was made out at Raleigh, and does not express on its face that the lines were run by the true meridian. It was also proved that the beginning corner of No. 1. stood on the north west side o\u2019f Crow creek, and the line running thence dovVn the creek, called for in the plat and patent, is south forty degrees west. It further appeared that Crow creek runs through a valley of good land, which is on an average about three miles wide, between mountains unfit for cultivation, and which extends from the beginning of survey No. 1. iii the said chain of surveys, until it reaches- below survey No. IS. in nearly a straight line, the course of which is nearly south thirty-five degrees west by the needle, and south forty degrees, west by the true meridian, that .hr the'face of the plats annexed to the grants, the creek is. represented as running througlr and across- each grant. The lines in the certificate of survey do not expressly call for crossing the creek ;- but each certificate and grant calls generally for land lying on Crow creek. If the lines of the tracts herein before mentioned, No. 12. and 1&amp; in the said chain of surveys,, be run- according to the course- of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the needle and the distances called for, they will not include Crow creek, or any part of it, and will not include the land in possession of the defendants. If they be run according to the true meridian, or so as to include Crow creek, they will include the lands in possession of the defendants. Whereupon, the coun-. sel for the plaintiffs moved the Court to instruct the jury, 1st. That the lines of the said lands ought to be run according to the true meridian, and not according to the needle. 2d. ThaCthe lines ought to be run so as to include Crow creek and the lands in possession of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-5\">The Court overruled both these motions, and instructed the jury that the said grant must be run Recording to the course of the needle and the distances called for in the said grants, andthatthe same could not legally be run so as to include Crow creek, and that; the said grants did not include the lands in possession of the defendants. To this opinion an exception was taken by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. A verdict and judgment were rendered for the defendants, and that judgments now before this Court on a writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-6\">It is undoubtedly the practice of surveyors, and the practice was proved in this cause, to express in their plats and certificates of survey, the courses which are designated by the needle; and if nothing exists to control the call for course and distance, the land must be bounded by the. courses and distances of the patent, according to the magnetic meridian.. But it is a general principle, that the course and distance must yield to' natural objects called for in the patent. All lands are supposed to be actually sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>veyed, and the intention of the gr\u00e1nt is to convey the land according to that actual survey; consequently, if marked trees and marked corners be found, conformably to the calls of the patent, or if water courses be called for in the patent, or mountains, or any other natural objects, distances must be lengthened or shortened, and courses varied so as to conform to those objects. The reason of the rule is, that it is the intention of the grant to convey the land actually, surveyed, and mistakes in courses or distances are more provable, and more frequent, than in marked trees, mountains, rivers, or other natural objects capable of being clearly designated, and accurately described. Had the survey in this case been actually made, and the lines had called to cross Crow creek, the courses and distances might have been precisely what they are, it might have been impracticable to find corner, or other marked trees, and. yet the land must have been so surveyed as to include Crow creek. The call in the lines of the patent to cross Crow creek, would be one to which course, and distance must necessarily yield. This material call is omitted, and from its omission arises the great difficulty of the cause. That the lands should not be described as lying on both sides of Crow creek, nor the lines, call for crossing that creek, \u00e1re such extraordinary omissions jas to create considerable doubt with the Court in deciding whether there is any other description given in the patent; of sufficient strength to control the call for course and distance. The majority of the./C.ourt. is of opinion, that there is such a description,. ; The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>patent closes its description of the land granted by a reference to the plat which is annexed. The laws of the State require this annexation. In this plat thus , \u25a0 r annexed to the patent, and thus referred to as desertbing the land granted, Crow creek is laid down \u00e1s passing through the tract! Every, person having knowledge of the grant, would also have knowledge of the plat, and would by-that plat be instructed, that the lands lay on both sides the creek. There would; be nothing to lead to a different conclusion but a difference of about five degrees in the course, should he run out the whole chain of surveys in order to find the beginning of No. 12.; and he would know that such an error in the course would be corrected by such a great natural object as a creek laid down by the surveyor in the middle of his plat. This would prove, notwithstanding the error in the course, that' the lands on both sides of Crow creek were intended to be included in the survey, and intended to be granted by the patent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-8\">It is the opinion of the majority of this Court, that there is error in the opinion of the Circuit Court for the district of East Tennesee, in. this, that the said Court instructed the jury that the grant under which the plaintiff claimed, could not be legally run so as io include Crow creek; instead of directing the jury that the said grant must be so run as to include Crow creek, and to conform as near as may be to the plat annexed to the said grant; wherefore, it it is considered by this Court that the said judgment be reversed and annulled, and the cause be remanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>to the said Circuit Court, that a new trial may be had according to law.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aj9N\">Upon this cause being remanded to the Circuit 0ourt for a new trial, the plaintiff gave in substance the same evidence which he gave upon the first trial, and proved, or offered to prove, these additional facts \u2014-That it was the <em>express </em>and declared intention of the surveyor to locate the land upon Crow creek\u2014 That his field notes called for crossing Crow creek, and that he supposed the courses inserted in the grants would-place the lands upon Crow creek. Upon the former trial it was proved, and admitted by the parties, that the beginning of lot No. 1. was marked as a corner, but that no survey had ever been made of that lot or of the lots of land in dispute. Upon the last trial the witness- gave the same testimony, and further, stated that a corner was marked for the beginning of lot No. 1. That the compass was set at this corner, and a chain or two might have been stretched upon the first course of the grant; but of this he. was not certain. During the last trial various .objections were made by the defendants to the testimony offered by the plaintiff; especially to that which tended to prove that it was the intention of the surveyor to locate the land upon Crow creek, and that his field notes called for crossing Crow creek. These objections were sustained by the Court, and the testimony declared inadmissable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-4\">Upon the evidence given in the cause, various instructions were prayed by. the plaintiff, all of which the Court refused to give ; but charged the jury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>if, from the testimony then adduced, they should find that M\u2018Coy, the deputy surveyor, when he went upon the ground to survey the land, did mark the beginning corner of lot No, 1. upon two poplars, and set his compass a given course, and that the chain carriers stretched one or two chains upon that course, and that M(Coy made his field notes in conformity thereto, and that those field notes were transmitted to James W. Lachey, the surveyor, who made out the plats annexed to the grants, and that he made out the said plats in conformity with the said field notes, and that he marked down Crow creek by guess upon the plats, that t.his was so much of a legal and actual survey, as to show that the surveyor committed no mistake in what he did upon the ground, notwithstanding it might not be according-to what he wished or intended in his own mind; and, in that case, the lessor of the plaintiff would be barred by the courses and distances called for in the grant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-5\">Under this instruction of the Court, a verdict was found for the defendants, and judgment rendered accordingly, upon which the cause was again brought to this Court by writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b459-6\">This cause was argued, \u00e1t the last term, by Mr. <em>Swann </em>and Mr. Campbell, for the plaintiff in error, and by Mr Williams, for the defendants in error, and. was re-argued at the present term, by Mr. <em>Sioann </em>for the plaintiffs jn-errof, and by Mr. <em>Jones </em>and Mr.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b459-8\">Williams, for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b458-7\"><em> </em>S.
