That the plaintiff below was appointed collector on the 16th of March,T811, and remained in office until the 15th of February, 1813, when he was removed from office by the president, and the defendant below appointed to the same office; and received the proceeds of the goods condemned. That various other parcels of goods were seized, and libelled while the plaintiff below was collector, but were condemned after his.removal from office, and the proceeds received by the def\u00e9ndant below. The Court below charged the jury, that the defendant in error was entitled to recover a moiety of the seizures so made by him during his continuance in office, and condemned after his removal. The jury found a verdict, and judgment was rendered for the plaintiff below; and a bill of exceptions having been taken to the charge of the Court below, the'cause was brought by writ of error to this Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-3\">The cause was submitted without argument.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b83-4\">Mr. Justice Story</author>\n<p id=\"Aap\">delivered the opinion of the Court. This case differs from that of Jones v. Shore\u2019s Executors,<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> in two circumstances ; first, that this is the case of a <em>seizure </em>of goods for an asserted forfeiture ; and secondly, that before the proceedings <em>in rein </em>were consummated by a sentence, the collector who made the seizure was removed from office. In our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>judgment, neither of these facts affords any ground i0 exccpt this case from the principles which were established in Jones v. Shore\u2019s Executors. It was there expressly held, that the collector acquired an inchoate right by the seizure, which by the subsequent decree of condemnation gives him an absolute vested title to his share in the forfeiture.<footnotemark>b</footnotemark> Without overturning the doctrine of that case, the present is \u2022not susceptible of argument; and we, therefore, unanimously affirm the decision of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b83-10\"><em> </em>1 <em>Wheat, </em>462,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"b\">\n<p id=\"Ahd\"><em> </em>Under the collection act of the 2d of March, 1799, c. 128. and other laws adopting the provisions of that act, the 89th section of which enjoins the collector, within whose district a seizure shall be made or forfeiture incurred, to cause suits for the same to be commenced without delay, and prosecuted to effect; and authorizes him to receive from the Court, in which a trial is had, or from the proper officer thereof, the stuns so received, after deducting the proper charges, and on receipt thereof, requires hiih to pay, and distribute the same without delay, according to law, and to transmit, quarterly or yearly, to the treasury, an account of all the moneys received by him for fines, penalties, and forfeitures, during such quarter.
