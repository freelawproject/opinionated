The facts , are fully stated in the opinion of the Court.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b516-14\">Mr. Justice Washington</author>\n<p id=\"Apy4\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The only : question certified by the Circuit Court for the District of Delaware to this Court is, whether certain depositions taken under a commission issued from that Court to Philadelphia, could, under the circumstances of the case, be given in evidence to the Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\">. This question arises out of the following facts: On the 25th of October, 1817, a consent rule was entered in this cause, \u201cfor a commission to issue to' take depositions on both sides, to be directed to Thomas Bradford, jun. and William J. Duane, of Philadelphia; interrogatories to be filed on ten days notice.\u201d The agreement of the counsel, under which this rule was entered, was filed in Court, on the llth of November, of the same year.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">On the 27th of October, 1817, an <em>ex parte </em>rule was entered, on the motion of the defendants\u2019 counsel, \u201c for a commission to issue to the city of Philadelphia, on the part of the defendants, to be directed to George Yaux and William Smith, or either of them, commissioners on the part of the defendants, on ten days notice of filing interrogatories, with liberty to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to name a commis-. sioner or commissioners, if they should choose to do so, at any time before issuing the commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">After the counsel for the lessor of the plaintiff had opened his case, and gone through his evidence, the counsel for the defendants having opened his case, offered to give in evidenc\u00e9 to the jury sundry depositions of witnesses taken under a commission to Philadelphia, bearing date the 31st of October, 1817, directed to George Yaux and William Smith, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>either of them, and to George M. Dallas and Richard Bache, or either of them.. This evidence was \u00bfkjected to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, on the ground that the depositions so taken were to be, considered, in point of law, as taken <em>de bene esse.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">In support of this evidence, the defendants stated, aqd the opposite counsel admitted, that previous to the execution of this commission,, an agreement had been entered into, thatth\u00e9 same should be executed by George M.-Dallas, one of the commissioners on the part, of the plaintiff, and George Vaux,-another of the commissioners on the part of the defendants; and that it was further agreed, and so endorsed on the commission, that the said George Vaux might be permitted to take a solemn affirmation, instead of an oath, and that the commissioners, who should act, might be .qualified by any alderman of Philadelphia, and their clerk by the commissioners; and which agreements were entered into upon the application of the defendant\u2019s counsel. He further gave in evidence, that commissions had heretofore issued , to Philadelphia, and other places within 100 miles of the place of trial, from the Circuit Court for that District, upon motions made for that purpose; and that upon motion,- commissions had : issued to Philadelphia and to other -places without the State, from the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware, previous and subsequent to the year, 1789. That upon the return of the commission in this case, publication -thereof. was ordered by the Court; and, lastly, that all the witnesses examined in the execution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>said commission, resided in Philadelphia, distant 33 miles from the place of holding the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae-\">. It is contended by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that, as by the 6th section of the act of the 2d of March, 1793, subpoenas for witnesses may run into any other district than that in which the Court is holden, provided, that in ciyil causes, the witnesses do not live at a greater distance than ! 00 miles from the place of holding the Court, the deposition in this case ought not to have been received, unless it had appeared to the Court that the witnesses had been duly summoned, and were unable to attend. This, argument appears to be founded upon the. provision of the 30th section of the judiciary act of 1789, c. 20. to which this case has no relation. That section authorizes the taking of depositions in the specified cases, without the formality of a commission, but declares that the depositions so taken, shall be <em>de bene esse ; </em>and to prevent any conclusion from being drawn against the power of the Courts to grant commissions for taking depositions by reason of the above provisions, this section goes on to provide, that nothing in the said section contained shall be construed to, prevent any Court of the. United States from granting a <em>dedimus potestat\u00e9m </em>to take depositions according to common, usage, when it may be necessary to prevent a failure, .or delay of justice, which power it is declared they shall severally ppssess.</p>\n<p id=\"AfO\">, The only question then is, whether depositions:tak;ed under a <em>dedimus poiestatem, </em>according to com-: 'mein, usage, are, under any circumstances, to be considered.as taken <em>de bene.esse f </em>And it is the opinion' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>of this Court that they cannot he so considered. What might be the effect of the agreement of the parties, or of an order of the Court to the contrary, need not be decided in this case, as the rule, as well as the commission which issued under it, was abso-. lute and unqualified. Whenever a commission issues for taking depositions according to common usage, whether the witness reside beyond the process of the Court, or within it, the depositions are absolute, the above section of the act of Congress relating to depositions <em>de bene </em>esse, being most obviously confined, to those taken under the enacting part of that section. But it is contended by the.'plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that this commission to t\u00e1ke depositions of witnesses living within 100 miles from the place at which the Court was to sit, although in another district, was improvidently issued, and that, the rule under which it issued was. erroneously made.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Whether this objection ought, or ought not, to have been made at the time, or during the term when the rule was entered, is a question which does not occur in this case ; because it is most obvious from the con-, duct of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in the Court below, that if. they did .not agree to the rule, the commis-1 sion was issued with their consent. A consent rule was entered on the 25th of October, differing from the <em>ex parte rule, </em>entered two days afterwards, in no other respect, but as to the names of the commissioners. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel afterwards joined in the commission, removed every possible objection as to the commissioners, by naming one on the part of the plaintiff, to act with one : of the .defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>commissioners, and filed his cross interrogatories, to be propounded to the witnesses. The commission Was executed by the commissioners so named, and. the witnesses were regularly examined, as well ou the cross interrogatories, as on those in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">After such unequivocal evidence of consent to the 'issuing of the commission, it is not competent to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to object, that.it issued improvidently, or that the rule was improperly obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">It is to be certified to the Circuit Court for the district of Delaware, that the depositions taken under the commission, referred to in the transcript of the record sent to this Court, dated the 31st day of October, 1817, ought to be given in evidence to the jury, upon the trial of the cause in which they were taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Certificate accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
