C., who had previously, In July, 1784, covenanted to convey the same to M. G., the ancestor of the lessor of the plaintiff, and on the 23d June, 1786, M. G. made an agreement with R. B., the defendant in ejectment, to convey to him 750 acres, part of the tract of 1,000 acres, under which agreement R. B. entered into possession of the whole tract: and'on the 11th of April, 1787, J. C., by direction of M. G. conveyed to R. B. the.750 acres in fulfilment of said agreement, which w\u00e9re severed by metes - and bounds from the tract of 1,000 acres. J. C. and his wife, on the. 26 th of April, 1791, made a convey apee in trust of all his property, real and personal, to R. J. and E. C. On the 12th of February, 1818, R. J., as <em>surviving trustee, </em>conveyed to the heirs of M. G., under a decree in equity, that part of the 1,000 acres not previously oonveyed to R. B., and'in the part eo conveyed, tinder the decree, was inoluded the land claimed in the ejectment. R. B. (the defendant) claimed the land in. controversy under a patent .for 400 acres issued on the 15th of September, 1795, founded on a .survey made for B. N., May 12th, 1782: arid under a deed of 'the 13th of December, 1796, from one Coburn, who had, in the winter and spring of 1791, entered into and fenced a field within the hounds of the original patent for 1,000 acres to J. C., claiming to hold' the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>same under B. N.\u2019s survey of 400 acres. <em>Held, </em>that upon the issuing of the patent to J. C., in November, 1784, the possession then being vacant, he became by operation of law vested with a constructive actual seizin of the whole tract included in his patent; that his whole title passed by his' prior conveyance to' M. G. (the ancestor of the lessor of the plaintiff;) and that when it .became complete at law by the issuing of the patent, the actual constructive seizin of J. C. passed to M. G., by virtue of that conveyance.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AyY\"><em>Held, </em>that when subsequently, in virtue of the agreement made in June, 1786, between M. G. and R. B. (the defendant) the latter entered into possession of the whole tract, under this equitable title, his possession being consistent with the title of M. G., and in common with him, was the possession of M. G. himself, and enured to the. benefit of both, according to the nature of the respective titles. And (that when subsequently, in April, 1787, by the direction of M. \u25a0 G., J. C. conveyed to the defendant 750 acres in fulfilment of the agreement between M. G. and the defendant, and the same were severed by metes and bounds in the deed from the-tract of 1,000 acres, the defendant became sole seized in his own right of the 750 acres so conveyed. But as he still remained in the actual possession of the residue of the tract, within the bounds of the patent, which possession was originally acquired under M. G., the character of his tenure was not-changed by his own act, and, therefore, he was <em>quasi </em>tenant to M. G., and, as such, continued the actual - -seizin of the latter, over this residue at least, up to the deed from, Coburn to the defendant, in 1796.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b222-12\"><em>Held, </em>that if Coburn, in 1791, when he entered and fenced a field,, &amp;c. had been the legal owner of B. N.\u2019s survey, his actual, occupation of a part would not have given him a constructive actual seizin of the residue of the tract included in that survey, that residue being at the time of his entry and occupation in the adverse seizin of another person, (M. G.) having an older and better title'.' But there. being no evidence that Coham was the legal owner of B. N.\u2019s survey, his entry must be considered -as an entry without title,- and consequently his disseizin was limit\u00e9d to the bounds of his actual occupancy.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b222-13\">The deed of the 16th of July, 1784, from J.

On the 16th of July, 1784, John Craig convey\u00e9d, by deed, the said tract of land to Michael Gratz, the ancestor of the lessors of the plaintiffs, and covenanted to cause a patent to issue to said Gratz, or if it could not issue in his name, that said Craig would stand seized to the use of Gratz, and' make such other conveyances as should be necessary to confirm the title. On the 23d of June, 1786, Gratz'made an agreement with Robert Barr, the defendant in ejectment, to convey to him 750 acres of land,, part of the said 1,000 acres; the defendant entered, into posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>sion of the whole tract,, and settled a quarter and farm thereon, and on the 11th day of April, 1787, J\u00b0hn Craig, by the direction of said Gratz, conveyed to the defendant, Barr, 750 acres, in fulfilment of said agreement, which were severed by metes and bounds from the said tract of 1,000 acres. On the 26th of April, 1791, John Craig and his wife, made a conveyance in trust to Robert Johqson and Elijah Craig of all his property, real and personal. On the 12th of February, 1813, Robert Johnson, as <em>surviving </em>trustee, under a decree in equity of the Circuit Court for the district of Kentucky, conveyed to the lessors of the, plaintiffs that part of the 1,000 acres not previously conveyed to the defendant, Barr, and in the part so conveyed was included. the land claim\u00e9d in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-4\">The defendant, Barr, claimed the tract of land , in controversy under a patent for 400 acres issued, by the State of Kentucky; on the l\u00f3th of September, 1795, founded on a survey made for Benjamin Nether land, May 12th, 1782.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-5\">On the trial of the cause, the plaintiffs read in evi-. dence to the jury the patent to John Craig for 1,000 acres of land; copies of two other surveys for John Craig; the deed of the 16th July, 1784, to Michael Gratz, the ancestor of the lessors of the plaintiffs; the deed , of trust of the 26th of April, 1791, from John Craig and wife to Robert Johnson and Elijah Praig ; the deed of the 12th February, 1813, from Robert Johnson (as surviving trustee to the lessors of the plaintiffs ; the decree in the chancery suit between Michael Gratz and John Craig and others, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>under which that deed was made; the surveys, plats, and reports of the 14th of January, 1783, signed by John Price, and the agreement between the said Gratz and Barr. The plaintiffs also introduced parol testimony establishing the boundary of the land patented to John Craig, and proving the defendant\u2019s possession of the whole tract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-3\">The defendant gave in evidence a deed from one Coburn to him, dated the 13th of December, ! 796 ; the deed from Craig to him of the 11th of April, 1787; the plat and certificate of Netherlands survey ; a certificate of its conveyance by Ann Shields to the defendant; and gave parol testimony that,\u2019 in the winter and spring of 1791, Coburn entered into, and fenced a field within the boundary of Craig\u2019s patent, claiming to hold the same'under the title of Netherland, as part of the land included in his. survey of 400 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-4\">The defendant objected to the admission in evidence of the record and proceedings of the Circuit Court in the Chancery suit between Michael Gratz and John Craig and others ; but the decree was permitted to be read to the jury, to which the defendant excepted. The defendant also excepted to the admission in evidence of the deed from John Craig to Michael Gratz, dated the 16th of July, 1784, because the same was not proved by the subscribing witnesses, nor their absence accounted for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-5\">The Court instructed the jury as follows : 1. That if they should be of opinion that neither the defendant, nor John Coburn, under whom he claims, were in actual possession of the land now in dispute prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>to the 18th day of November, 1784, the date of the patent to Johii Craig for the land now in dispute, that the emanation of the. said grant gave possession to the said John Craig of the whole of the said land ; and that the present plaintiffs were entitled to the benefit of that possession. 2. That if the jury should be of opinion that Robert Barr, the defendant, entered upon, and took possession of the land in contest under a contract with the ancestor of the plaintiffs, and was so possessed at the time of the settlement of Coburn, under whom the defendant now pretends title, that the possession of Coburn, when taken, did not extend within the patent lines, under which the lessors of the plaintiffs claim, be-beyond his actual occupancy. <em>3. </em>That Coburn\u2019s claiming and fencing a part of the land in 1791, or whenever the jury should be of opinion he took possession and fenced within the patent limits aforesaid, did not give to him \u00e1 legal possession to any other part of the land within the patent to Craig, than that of which he had the actual occupancy. <em>4. </em>That the possession of Coburn, attempted to be proved, more than twenty. years before the bringing this suit, did not bar the plaintiffs\u2019 right to sue, further than he showed an actual possession for twenty ye\u00e1rs, or upwards, next before bringing this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-4\">The defendant objected to the instructions so given the jury, and moved that the Coxirt should give ceiv tain other instructions' to the jury, which were refused.

That the Court below erred in refusing the motion for a new trial. 2. That the decree in the Chancery suit between Michael Gratz and John Craig and others, was not admissible in evidence in this case. 3. That there- was error in admitting in evidence the deed from John Craig to Michael Gratz of the 16th of July, 1784, without the regular proof of its execution by the subscribing witnesses. 4. That the deed of the 13th of February, 1813, from Robert Johnson, as surviving trustee, to the lessors of the plaintiff, under the decree in chancery, was not admissible in evidence, without preliminary proof that Elijah Craig was dead. 5. That the said deed was not approved by the Court, nor recorded as required by the statute of Kentucky of the 16th of February, c. 453. 6. That the deed of the 26th of April, .1791, from John Craig and wife, in trust, to Robert Johnson and Elijah Craig, was void under the statute of champerty and maintenance, the land being at the time in the adverse possession of Co-burn. 7. That the Court below erred in the instructions it gave to the jury.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b227-8\">Mr. <em>Talbot </em>and Mr. Sergeant, contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b227-9\">Mr. Justice Stoky</author>\n<p id=\"Akx\">delivered the opinion of the <em>Feb. 191%, </em>Court. In this case, it is unnecessary to travel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>through all the exceptions taken by the defendant in the Court below, because; upon the fact? stated in the bill of exceptions, some of the opinions required of the Court upon points of law, do not arise from the evidence ; and as to others, the opinion of the Court, if in any respect erroneous, was so in favour of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\">The first error assigned is, that the Court refused to grant a new trial; but it has been already decided, and is too plain for argument, that such a refusal affords no ground for a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Another error alleged is, that the Court allowed the decree of the-Circuit . Court, in the Chancery suit between Michael Gratz and John Craig and ethers, to be given in evidence to the jury. In our \u2022opinion this record was clearly admissible. It is true that, in general, judgments and decrees are evidence, only in suits between parties and privies. But the doctrine, is wholly inapplicable to a case like the present, where the Recree is not introduced as <em>per se </em>-binding upon any rights of the. other party, but as an introductory fact to a link in the/chain of the plaintiff\u2019s title, and constituting a,part of the. muniments of his estate; without establishing the existence of the decree, it would be impossible to establish the legal, validity of the deed from Robert Johnson, to the lessors of the plaintiffs, which was made under the authority of that decree ; arid under such, circumstances to reject the proof of the decree* would be, in effect, to declare that no title derived under a decree in Chancery, was of any validity \u00e9xeept in a suit between parties and privies,-so that in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>a suit by or against a stranger, it would be \u00e1 mere nullity. It might with as much propriety.be argued, that the plaintiff was not at liberty to prove any other title deeds in this suit, because they were <em>res inter alios acta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">Another error alleged is, the admission in evidence of the deed of John Craig to Michael Gratz, dated the 16th of July, 1784, without the regular proof of its execution by the subscribing witnesses. But as that deed was more than thirty years old, and was proved to have been in the possession of the lessors of the plaintiff, and actually asserted by them as the ground of their title in the Chancery suit, it was, in the .language of the books, sufficiently accounted for j and on this account, as well as because it was a part of the evidence in support of the decree, it was admissible, without the regular proof of its execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Another error alleged is, that the deed from Robert Johnson to the plaintiffs, under the decree in Chancery, was not admissible in evidence without proof that. Robert Johnson was the surviving trustee, and that Elijah Craig was dead. But upon examining the bill of exceptions of tfie defendant, no point of this sort arises ; for it is there stated that the plaintiff gave in evidence \u201c the deed from Robert Johnson the <em>surviving trustee </em>to the lessors of the plaintiffand no objection appears to have been made to its admissibility on this account. -</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Having disposed of these minor objections, we may advance to the only points of any real importance in the caus\u00e9, but which, in &lt;our opinion, are of no intrinsic difficulty. - Upon the issuing of the pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>tent to John Craig, in November, 1784, the posses*\" sion then being vacarit, he became, by operation of law, vested. with a constructive actual seisin, of the whole tract of land included in his patent. His whole title (such as it ivas) passed by his prior conveyance in July, 1784, to Michael Gratz, the ancescestor of the lessor of the plaintiff, and the moment it became complete at law by the issuing of the patent,' the actual constructive seisin of Craig was transferred to Gratz, in virtue of that conveyance.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> Wh\u00e9n subsequently, in Virtue of the agreement made in June, 1786, between Michael Gratz, and the defendant, for the purchase of 750 acres of the tract of 1,000 acres, the defendant entered into possession of the whole tract, under this equitable title, his pos-' session being consistent with the title of Gratz, and in. common with him, was the possession of Gratz himself, and enured to the benefit of both, according to the nature of their, titles. When subsequently, in April, 1787, by the direction of Gratz, Craig conveyed to the defendant a large'portion of the' land in fulfilment of the agreement between Gratz and Barr, and the same was severed by the metes and bounds in the deed from the ,tract of 1,000 acres, the defendant became sole seized in his own right of the portion so conveyed.\" But as he still remained in the actual possession of the residue of the tract within the bounds of the patent, and this possession was originally taken under Gratz, the character of his tenure was not changed by his own act, and there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>fore he was <em>quasi </em>tenantto Gratz; and as such, continued the actual seisin of the latter over the whole of this residue, at least up to the period of the deed from Coburn to the defendant in 1796. This brings us to the consideration of the period when the evidence first establishes any entry pr possession in John Co-burn. It appears by the evidence, that in the winter and spring of 1791, Coburn entered into, and fenced, a field within the boundary of Craig\u2019s patent, claiming to hold the same under the title of Netherland, as part of the land included in his survey of a tract of 400 acres. If Coburn at this time had been the legal owner of Netherland\u2019s survey, his actual occupation of a part, would not have given him a constructive actual seisin of the residue of the tract included in that survey, if at the time of his entry and occupation that residue was in the adverse seisin of another person having an older and better title. .For where two. persons are in possession of land at the same time,, under different titles, the law adjudges him to have the seisin of the estate who has the better title. Both cannot be seised, and, therefore, the seisin follows the title. Now it is clear that the title of Craig, and, of course, of his grantee Gratz, was older and better than 'Netherland\u2019s; and the possession of Barr under that title, being the possession of Gratz, the legal seisin of the land which was not sold to Barr, was by construction of law in Gratz; and the disseisin of Coburn under a junior title, did not extend beyond the limits of his actual occupancy. This reasoning proceeds upon the supposition that Coburn had a good title to Netherland\u2019s survey. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Bat, in fact, no such title was shown in evidence, there being no proof that Ann Shield, from whom Coburn derived his title, was the legal owner of the title of Netherland. So that the entry of Coburn must be considered as an entry without title, and, consequently, his disseisin was limited to the bounds of his actual occupancy. This view of. the case disposes, of the objection to the deed from Craig and wife to Robert Johnson and Elijah Craig, in 1791, upon the ground that it was within the statutes of champerty and maintenance, the land being at the time in the adverse possession of Coburn; for as to all the l\u00e1nd not in his actual occupancy (and to this alone the charge of the Court applied) the deed was not, at all events, operative; the grantors, and persons holding-under them, having at all times had the legal seisin.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\">Another objection taken is, that the deed from Robert Johnson to the lessors ,of the plaintiff, under the decree in Chancery, wa^ not approved' by the Court, nor recorded in the Court iti conformity with the statute of Kentucky of the \u00cd8th of February, 1818, ch. 453. In our judgment no such approval was necessary; and upon examination of the statute in question, it is clear that it is not imperative in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Upon the\u2019whole, without going more minutely into the case, we are all of opinion that the judgment of the Court below ought to be affirmed. No error has been committed which is injurio\u00fcs to the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>ant. He has had the full benefit of the law, so far as the facts of his case would warrant the Court in applying it in his favour.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b230-8\"><em> Vide </em>Green v.
