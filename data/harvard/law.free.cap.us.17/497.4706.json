A claim- was interposed by Salvador Bages, and others, Spanish subjects, domiciled at St. Jago, the*, island of Cuba, alleging that the ship was a Spanish ship, and* with the goods, their property, was captured on the high seas, by an armed vessel cruizing under.-the pretended colours of Carthagena, the commander of which produced no commission, nor did the claimants know, or admit, he had one, and who detained the Caridad as prize, and put a prize crew on board. That having separated from the capturing vessel, they were met with and boarded by the privateer Harrison. That the . said privateer captured, and took possession of the Caridad, and the captors Unladed the cargo from on board of her, into the Harrison, and having brought the same into the port of Wilmington, North Carolina, proceeded against it as prize of war.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-4\">A cross claim was filed by Pedro Brugman, master and commander of the Carthagenian armed schooner Neustra Se\u00f1ora de la Popa, in behalf Of himself, and others, the owners of said privateer, to the' goods thus proceeded against as prize of war by the cof'mander, officers^ and crew of the Harrison. This claim pleaded, that the goods Were not at the time of the proceedings, nor at the tim\u00e9 of capture by the Harrison, the property of any British subjects, or of any persons domiciled in the dominions of Great Britain, nor of any of the enemies of the United States, but that the same then were, and yet are, the property&lt; of the owners,'officers, and crew of th\u00e9La Popa, from- whose lawful possession the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>had been violently and wrongfully taken, on the high seas, by the Harrison, as before mentioned. That the La Popa,. having been duly commissioned by the sovereign authority of the independent State of Carthagena, and furnished with letters of marque and reprisal, authorizing her to capture, on the high seas, the property of the enemies of said State, left the port of Carthagena in the month,of December, .1814,, on, a cruise. - That on the'21st of January, 1815, while cruising'off St. Jago de Cuba, the said privateer La Popa, commanded by the claimant, .seized and captur\u00e9d the ship La- Caridad, sailing from Jamaica to Cuba, loaded With, drygoods, and belonging,-with the cargo, to the enemies of the said independent State of. Carthagena, as the papers on board, and the. information of the master and crew, convinced the claimant to be the fact. That the claimant put a prizemaster and crew x on board the captured vessel, and ordered her to proceed to the said port, of Carth\u00e1gena. That the said prizemaster and crew, retained the possession for four days, and while they were proceeding to Carthagena, the\u00a1 Caridad was forcibly taken by- the Harrison-from. their, possession, the goods taken out, and... brought' into the port of Wilrpington, as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-6\">An order was made by the Court below,-, that the claimant, Pedro.

Province ; that the witnesses were acquainted with the hand writing of the said Governor and Secretary, the wit-s nesses having often seen them write, as well as seen their public and acknowledged writings, and verily believed the same to be their signatures. And the commission was also proved to be genuine, and to have regularly issued, by the certificates and declarations of the officers ofstate of the Province of Carthagena.

This; case arose out of a capture made la the late war. The La Popa, a commissioned cruiser of. the Province of Carthagena, had made prize of the Caridad, a Spanish vessel, in a voyage1 from Jamaica, to Cuba. The American private armed vessel Harr rison fell'in. with the Caridad, then in'possession of the prize crew of the La Popa, anfi suspecting her cargo to be British, took possession of it, and transhipped it into their own vessel.. \u2018 Oh the arrival of the Harrison in \u00e1 port of North Carolina, the cargo was claimed both by the Caridad and La Popa, and' finally restored to the La=Popaj</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">This.is an appeal from the decision of the Circuit Court of North Carolina, made by the original Spar, nish ownerj and the case has been submitted on the evidence and the grounds taken in the argument be- - lo^. ''</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">There is no doubt \u2019that the property was Spanish, nor that the privateer La Popa was commissioned as a cruiser, whilst the Province of Carthagena had an organiz\u00e9d government; and there' is/ the fullest evidence that her armament and equipment was unaffected by any charge of having' been made-in violar tion of our laws. ' ' \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u00bb'*\u2022*</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">. The only question in the case isj whether an ori-' , ginal Spanish owner is entitled to the aid of the ,,Courts of-this country, to restore to him property of which he has been dispossessed by capture, under, a commission derived from the revolted colonies ? and this question is considered, by this court, as having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>been fully decided by the principles assumed in the case of the United States v. Palmer,<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> at the last term, and by the decisions in the cases of the Estrella<footnotemark>b</footnotemark> and Divina Pastora<footnotemark>c</footnotemark> at the present term.</p>\n<p id=\"AEVp\">War notoriously exists', and is recognized by our government to exist, between Spain and her colonies. This is an appeal to the highest of all tribunals on a question of right. No neutral nation can act against either, without taking part with the other in the war, All that, the law of nations requires of us, is strict arid impartial neutrality. And no friendly nation ought to demand of the Courts of this country to do an act which may involve it in a war with the victor. \u25a0 Our duty is, where the property of either is brought innocently within our jurisdiction, to leave things as we find them; much more to restore them to that state from which they, have been forcibly removed by the act of our own citizens. The* treaty with Spain can have.no bearing upon the case,.as. this Court cannot recognize such captors as pirates, and the capture was not made within pur jurisdic-tional. limits. In- those two cases only dues the treaty enjoin restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Decret\u00e9 affirmed, with costs.,,</p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"AF_\"><em> </em>3 <em>Wheat. </em>610.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"b\">\n<p id=\"Ari\"><em> </em>Ante, p. 298.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"c\">\n<p id=\"ArG6\">\n<em> Ante, p. 52.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
