The circumstance of the vessel having been sent into an enemy\u2019s port, for adjudication, and afterwards permitted to resume her voyage, held to raise a vior lent presumption that she had a license, which the Claimant not having repelled by explanatory evidence, condemnation was pronounced.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-10\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Rhode-Island.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-11\">This cause was argued by Mr. .Hunter, and Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>Wheaton </em>for the appellant and claimant,<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> and by <em>the Attorney General </em>for the United States.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b112-8\"><em> </em>They cited the Imina, 3 <em>Rob. 167. </em>The Lisette, 8 <em>Rob. 387. </em>The Joseph, 8 Crunch, 451. to show, that the <em>delictum, </em>of contraband, of trading with the enemy, and navigating under his license, are all purged by the termination Of the voyage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AzP\">Mr. Justice Story</author>\n<p id=\"AVL\">delivered the opinion of the Court. This case differs in no essential respect, from, that of the Caledonian. The'brig sailed from the United States on a voyage to Lisbon, with a cargo of provisions, in May, 1813, and was captured by a British sloop of war, and sent into Bermuda, where she was either not proceeded against as prize, or was acquitted on trial; and after a detention of about six weeks, was permitted to resume her original voyage; and on the return, voyage from Lisbon, with a cargo of salt, was, on her arrival at Newport, on the 16th of December, 1813, seized by the collector of that port, as forfeited tp the United States <em>jure </em>belli, for using a British license, and trading with the enemy.</p>\n<p id=\"Afz6\">There is no positive proof, that the brig had a British license on board; but, we think, that under the. circumstances, there arises a violent presumption that she had such a license, and'that the burthen of proof to repel this presumption rests on the claimant. He has not attempted this in the slightest degree, there being a total absence of all evidence in his favour; and, therefore, as the case remains with all its original imperfections, the decree of the Circuit Court is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Decree affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
