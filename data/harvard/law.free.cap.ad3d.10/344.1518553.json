The plaintiff pleaded and submitted proof that \u201cspecial design-related circumstances\u201d inherent in the decedent\u2019s vehicle necessitated the installation of a passenger restraint system different from the system actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>installed, notwithstanding compliance with FMVSS 208 <em>(cf. Geier v American Honda Motor Co., </em>529 US 861, 885 [2000]; <em>Hurley v Motor Coach Indus., </em>222 F3d 377, 382 [2000], <em>cert denied </em>531 US 1148 [2001]). The plaintiffs expert opined that the structural design particulars of the decedent\u2019s car required the installation of a three-point lap-shoulder belt occupant restraint system. This raised an issue of fact as to whether this is a special design-related circumstance that is an exception to federal preemption of the plaintiffs common-law causes of action <em>(see Chevere v Hyundai Motor Co., </em>4 AD3d 226, 227 [2004]; <em>Korthas v Suzuki Motor Co., </em>289 AD2d 1093, 1094 [2001]; <em>cf. Hurley v Motor Coach Indus., supra; Carrasquilla v Mazda Motor Corp., </em>166 F Supp 2d 169, 177 [2001]).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Accordingly, if the plaintiff fails to prove that the special design exception exists, then the Supreme Court would be devoid of subject matter jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs common-law causes of action. However, it properly denied the defendant\u2019s cross motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (2) at this time <em>(cf. Oxford Health Plans [NY] v BetterCare Health Care Pain Mgt. &amp; Rehab, </em>305 AD2d 223, 224 [2003]). Santucci, J.P., Smith, Crane and Fisher, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
