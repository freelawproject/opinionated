He claimed that his attorney had failed to call as alibi witnesses the mother and sisters of his one alibi witness, Andre Grier, as well as defendant\u2019s girlfriend, although the rest of Grier\u2019s family had been present with him in the Grier\u2019s apartment at the time of the shooting, and although defendant\u2019s girlfriend had notified defense counsel of their existence and willingness to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">In contrast to cases such as <em>People v Ford </em>(46 NY2d 1021 [1979]) and <em>People v Sussman </em>(298 AD2d 205 [2002], <em>lv denied </em>99 NY2d 585 [2003]), in which such motions lacked proper evidentiary support, defendant\u2019s motion was fully supported by affidavits of the witnesses which contained the substance of their proposed testimony, and an affidavit swearing that trial counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>had been informed of their existence and willingness to testify; these papers are sufficient to avoid the application of CPL 440.30 (4) (b). While the People submitted an affirmation by trial counsel contradicting the claim that he was informed of these potential witnesses, this affidavit does not amount to the type of \u201cunquestionable documentary proof\u2019 which conclusively refutes the affidavits submitted by defendant, as required for application of CPL 440.30 (4) (c); it merely leaves a question of fact to be addressed at a hearing. Nor does Andre Grier\u2019s failure to mention in his testimony that other members of his family were present in the apartment that day amount to a conclusive refutation of the substance of the affidavits submitted by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Although counsel may have proceeded appropriately based upon the information made known to him, or, alternatively, it may have been an appropriate strategic decision for defense counsel to decline to call additional alibi witnesses <em>(see e.g. People v Brooks, </em>283 AD2d 367 [2001], <em>lv denied </em>96 NY2d 916 [2001]), the issue presented here is whether a hearing should have been conducted on the defendant\u2019s CPL 440.10 motion, not whether the motion should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">As in <em>People v Park </em>(211 AD2d 828 [1995], <em>lv denied </em>86 NY2d 739 [1995]), it was error to summarily deny defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment of conviction. Issues of fact requiring a hearing exist as to the extent of counsel\u2019s knowledge of the proposed alibi witnesses and whether counsel\u2019s omission to contact and call the witnesses to testify at defendant\u2019s trial constituted ineffective assistance of counsel <em>(see People v Smith, </em>301 AD2d 471 [2003]).
