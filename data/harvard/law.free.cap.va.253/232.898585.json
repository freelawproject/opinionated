Alice L. Ward recovered a judgment \u00e1gainst Waverly Leon Charity on October 23, 1986. Ward filed a motion for judgment against Insurance Company of North America and its successor in interest, CIGNA Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company, on October 23, 1991. Ward alleged that Charity was insured pursuant to the provisions of an automobile liability insurance policy issued by Insurance Company of North America. Ward asserted that she is a statutory beneficiary of the insurance policy and that the defendants breached the policy by failing to satisfy her judgment against Charity. Ward nonsuited that action on June 10, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">On December 12, 1994, Ward commenced the present proceeding by filing another motion for judgment based on the same cause of action. The defendants filed a special plea in bar, asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that Ward\u2019s cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations because her 1991 motion for judgment was not filed within five \u201c365-day periods\u201d from the date she obtained her judgment against Charity. The trial court entered an order sustaining the plea, and we awarded Ward an appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">The litigants agree that the plaintiff\u2019s alleged cause of action is governed by the five-year statute of limitations contained in Code \u00a7 8.01-246, which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">\u201c[Ajctions founded upon a contract. . . shall be brought within the following number of years next after the cause of action shall have accrued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>2. In actions on any contract which is not otherwise specified and which is in writing and signed by the party to be charged thereby, or by his agent, within five years whether such writing be under seal or not. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Ward asserts that her motion for judgment is timely because she filed her original motion for judgment within the five-year statute of limitation period and, when she took her voluntary nonsuit pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-380, she was entitled to recommence her action within six \u00a1months from the date of the nonsuit order, June 10, 1994. Code \u00a7 8.0.1-229(E)(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Continuing, Ward contends that December 10, 1994, which is six months from the date of the nonsuit order, was a Saturday and, therefore, Code \u00a7 1-13.3:1 permitted her to file her motion for judgment on Monday, December 12, 1994.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The defendants, relying upon <em>Frey </em>v. <em>Jefferson Homebuilders, Inc., </em>251 Va. 375, 467 S.E.2d 788 (1996), assert that Ward was required to file her action within five \u201c365-day periods\u201d from the date she obtained the October 23, 1986 judgment against Charity. The defendants state that, because \u201cthe year 1988 was a leap year[,] Ward actually filed her suit [within] four 365 day periods plus one 366 day period. ... Since Ward filed suit on October 23, [1991,] she did not file within the five years provided in . . . Code ... \u00a7 8.01-246(2).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">We disagree with the defendants. <em>Frey </em>simply has no application here. In <em>Frey, </em>the primary issue we considered was whether a statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>tory extension of time in Code \u00a7 1-13.3:1 applied to Rule 3:3 which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-4\">\u201cNo judgment shall be entered against a defendant who was served with process more than one year after the commencement of the action against him unless the court finds as a fact that the plaintiff exercised due diligence to have timely service on him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Michael B. Frey and Patricia A. Frey filed a motion for judgment against Jefferson Homebuilders, Inc. on November 12, 1993. One year and ftvo days later, counsel for the Freys requested the clerk to issue process, which was delivered to Jefferson\u2019s registered agent. Jefferson filed a motion to dismiss the action on the ground that Rule 3:3 precluded the entry of a judgment against it because Jefferson had been served with process more than one year after the action was commenced. The trial court sustained the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">On appeal, the Freys argued that the clerk\u2019s office was closed on Friday, November 11, 1994, a legal holiday, and did not reopen until Monday, November 14, 1994, and, therefore, they were entitled to the statutory extension specified in Code \u00a7 1-13.3:1. Agreeing with the Freys, we stated that \u201cRule 3:3 effectively \u2018fixe[s]\u2019 the 365th day after commencement of the action as the \u2018last day\u2019 for the motion for judgment \u2018to be served [or] delivered,\u2019 thereby subjecting the one-year period of Rule 3:3 to the saving provision in Code \u00a7 1-13.3:1.\u201d 251 Va. at 378-79, 467 S.E.2d at 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The defendants misinterpret our statements in <em>Frey. </em>We did not hold in <em>Frey, </em>as the defendants suggest, that one year is equivalent to 365 days. Indeed, such an interpretation ignores the fact that a leap year contains 366 days. Furthermore, the defendants\u2019 interpretation of our statement in <em>Frey </em>is contrary to Code \u00a7 1-13.33, which defines the word year: \u201cUnless otherwise expressed, the word \u2018year\u2019 shall be construed to mean a calendar year. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Applying Code \u00a7 1-13.33, we hold that courts in this Commonwealth must utilize calendar years and not \u201c365-day periods\u201d when computing whether a statute of limitations has expired. As Ward points out, her motion for judgment was filed within five calendar years from the date her cause of action against the defendants accrued, and she was entitled to both the tolling provision in the non-suit statute, Code \u00a7 8.01-229(E)(3), and the statutory time extension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>contained in Code \u00a7 1-13.3:1. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-11\"> We find no merit in the defendants\u2019 argument that Ward\u2019s appeal should be dismissed because she failed to object to the entry of the trial court\u2019s order. The record is clear that Ward argued to the trial court that her cause of action was not barred by the statute of limitations. Ward was not required to make a formal exception to the trial court\u2019s order because the court was aware of her objections.
