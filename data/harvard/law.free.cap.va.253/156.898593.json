Wilkins, Appellant, against Commonwealth of Virginia, Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"AKW\">Record No. 961235</docketnumber>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"A-L\">Court of Appeals No. 1242-95-4</docketnumber>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b174-11\">Upon consideration of the record, the briefs, and argument of counsel, the Court is of opinion that no error exists in the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">On March 31, 1995, a jury in the Circuit Court for the County of Fauquier returned a verdict convicting Donald L. Wilkins of attempted possession of phencyclidine, a controlled substance, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-257. As appears from an order entered by the trial court, \u201c[wjhereupon the jurors received further evidence and were instructed by the Court as to punishment and heard evidence and argument of counsel and were sent back to their room to consider their verdict as to punishment.\u201d Authorized by the statute to impose a sentence upon conviction of \u201cnot less than one nor more than ten years,\u201d the jury returned its second verdict fixing the penalty at five years in the penitentiary. Upon consideration of the report of a probation officer, the trial court confirmed the two verdicts and entered final judgment on May 30, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">In the course of argument made at the penalty phase of the trial, the prosecutor told the jurors that \u201cyou have an opportunity as the conscience of this community to deal with this person\u201d and that \u201cin considering what is the appropriate verdict, you can indeed send the message to Mr. Wilkins . . . [and] to people similarly situated to Mr. Wilkins that we will not tolerate the sale and purchase of drugs in this county.\u201d Wilkins objected to those statements and, in a petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>for appeal addressed to the Court of Appeals of Virginia, challenged the trial court\u2019s ruling denying his motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Holding that \u201cthe argument was proper,\u201d the Court of Appeals of Virginia denied the petition, and this Court awarded Wilkins an appeal limited to consideration of that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Wilkins notes on brief that \u201c[n]othing should be done or permitted to . . . obscure the minds of the jurors on the question of whether or not [the accused] is guilty of the offense charged.\u201d That rule is fully supported by the precedents. This Court, upon finding a manifest probability that a deterrence argument by a prosecutor had been a contributing cause of the defendant\u2019s <em>conviction, </em>has consistently reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court. <em>See e.g., Kitze </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 283, 435 S.E.2d 583 (1993); <em>Hutchins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 17, 255 S.E.2d 459 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">As an element of its rationale in <em>Hutchins, </em>this Court emphasized the need to avoid confusion between \u201cthe use of punishment and conviction for deterrent purposes,\u201d 220 Va. at 20-21, 255 S.E.2d at 461, and, citing <em>Hutchins </em>in <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 460, 468, 357 S.E.2d 500, 505, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 933 (1987), the Court explained that \u201cwhile considerations of deterrence should not be the basis for a finding of guilt of the offense, such considerations may be argued in connection with the punishment to be assessed for the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Here, the deterrence argument in issue was made in the penalty phase of the bifurcated trial. The Court finds no merit in the assignment of error, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Virginia is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Justices Stephenson and Koontz took no part in the consideration or disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">The defendant will pay to the Commonwealth thirty dollars in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">It is ordered that the said circuit court allow counsel for the appellant a fee of $725 for services rendered the appellant on this appeal, in addition to counsel\u2019s costs and necessary direct out-of-pocket expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">The Commonwealth shall recover of the appellant the amount paid court-appointed counsel to represent him in this proceeding, counsel\u2019s costs and necessary direct out-of-pocket expenses, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>fees and costs to be assessed by the clerk of this Court and the clerks of the courts below.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">This order shall be certified to the Court of Appeals of Virginia and the Circuit Court of the County of Fauquier and shall be published in the Virginia Reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">A Copy,</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Teste:</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">David B.
