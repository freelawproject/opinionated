We accepted the certification by order entered in June 1996. The question involves statutory interpretation and a motor vehicle insurance coverage issue arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>from an uninsured/underinsured motorist endorsement to an insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The record establishes the following facts. Thomas M. Stone was a part-time employee of Tidewater Pizza, Inc., in Virginia Beach, for which he delivered pizzas. In making deliveries, Stone was responsible for providing his own transportation and used his own vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">In October 1992, while Stone was lawfully operating his vehicle in the scope of his employment, a collision occurred between his vehicle and one operated by Carol Drye. Stone sustained serious personal injuries in the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Later, he recovered a judgment against Drye in the Circuit Court of the City of Virginia Beach for $250,000 plus interest and costs. At the time of the collision, only $25,000 of liability or other coverage was applicable to Drye\u2019s use of her vehicle and available to satisfy Stone\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">In effect at the time of the collision was a \u201cBusiness Auto\u201d policy of insurance issued by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company to \u201cTidewater Pizza, Inc.,\u201d as the named insured. The coverage afforded under the policy included motor vehicle liability insurance with a limit of $350,000 and, by endorsement, uninsured motorist insurance, which included underinsured motorist coverage, carrying the same limit. For clarity, we shall use the term \u201cuninsured\u201d to include both underinsured and uninsured coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">Subsequently, Stone filed in the Virginia Beach circuit court a declaratory judgment action against Liberty Mutual seeking a declaration that the insurer was liable to him for $225,000 under the uninsured motorist coverage. Following removal of the case by the insurer to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, the parties stipulated to the facts and submitted the coverage issue to the district court on cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">The district court sustained Stone\u2019s contention that the insurer\u2019s policy issued to Tidewater conflicted with Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, the uninsured motorist statute. When the provisions of an insurance policy conflict with the requirements of the uninsured motorist statute, the statute controls and die policy provisions are void and ineffective. <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>205 Va. 897, 900, 140 S.E.2d 817, 819 (1965). Thus, the district court granted Stone\u2019s motion for summary judgment and held he was entitled to uninsured coverage in the sum of $225,000 plus interest and costs. The district court rejected an alternative theory of coverage offered by Stone.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The insurer appealed the former ruling of the district court and Stone appealed the latter. The Fourth Circuit agreed with the district court on the latter ruling and has affirmed that portion of the district court\u2019s order. The issue generating the former ruling is the subject of this certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">According to the policy\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage, the insurer agrees to pay, up to the limit of liability, \u201call sums the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or driver of an uninsured motor vehicle. The damages must result from bodily injury sustained by the insured . . . caused by an accident.\u201d Of course, Stone can recover against the insurer only if he qualifies as an \u201cinsured\u201d under the uninsured coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The uninsured motorist endorsement provides coverage to two classes of potential insureds. First, the term \u201cinsured\u201d is defined as the named insured (Tidewater) \u201cor any family member\u201d of the named insured. Second, the term \u201cinsured\u201d includes \u201c[ajnyone else occupying a covered auto.\u201d For purposes of the uninsured motorist coverage, the term \u201ccovered auto\u201d is defined to include \u201c[ojnly those autos [Tidewater owns] which, because of the law in the state where they are licensed or principally garaged, are required to have and cannot reject uninsured motorists insurance.\u201d There are two such vehicles listed in the policy, a Ford and a Honda; Stone\u2019s vehicle is not listed in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">According to the policy\u2019s liability coverage, the insurer agrees to pay, up to the limit of liability, all sums \u201cthe insured legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury ... to which this insurance applies, caused by an accident and resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of a covered auto.\u201d The term \u201ccovered auto\u201d for liability purposes is defined to include certain non-owned automobiles, that is, automobiles Tidewater \u201cd[id] not own, lease, hire or borrow which [were] used in connection with [Tidewater\u2019s] business.\u201d Stone\u2019s automobile was not owned, leased, hired, or borrowed by, Tidewater, but it was being used in Tidewater\u2019s business. However, the definition of the term \u201cinsured\u201d in the liability portion of the policy does not include Stone. In fact, according to the order of certification, Stone \u201cstipulated that he is not covered under the liability provisions of the policy, and indeed, the exclusions defining the term \u2018insured\u2019 clearly operate to exclude him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Stone does not dispute that his automobile is not a \u201ccovered auto\u201d under the uninsured motorist provisions of the policy; the only automobiles covered under those provisions are those vehicles owned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>by Tidewater. Stone argues, however, consistent with the district court\u2019s ruling, that he was operating an automobile to which the Liberty Mutual policy applied because he was operating a \u201ccovered auto\u201d under the liability provisions. Thus, he says, the insurer was required under Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(A), <em>infra, </em>to provide him uninsured motorist coverage since, according to Stone, he was an \u201cinsured\u201d under Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B), <em>infra. </em>Stone contends that the policy violates subsection (A) because although it specifically insures non-owned automobiles under the liability provisions of the policy, it does not provide uninsured motorist coverage to anyone occupying the same non-owned automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">The insurer recognizes that it must provide uninsured motorist insurance pursuant to subsection (A), but argues it can limit who is an \u201cinsured\u201d without violating the provisions of subsection (B) of the statute. Alternatively, the insurer maintains that Stone is not entitled to benefits under the policy because benefits are excluded under the liability provisions of die policy given the fact that Stone was not legally liable for the collision with Drye.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Thus, the following question is framed for us by the Fourth Circuit: \u201cWhether, under these facts, Stone was an insured as defined in subsection 38.2-2206B; that is, does subsection 38.2-2206B mandate that Stone is an insured under the uninsured motorist endorsement of Tidewater\u2019s automobile policy notwithstanding the policy\u2019s language?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Elaborating, the Fourth Circuit states that the issue to be decided is whether \u201cTidewater\u2019s policy with Liberty violated subsection 38.2-2206A, as the district court concluded, because Stone is an \u2018insured\u2019 under subsection 38.2-2206B.\u201d Continuing, the Fourth Circuit observes that \u201c[i]f Stone is an insured, then he is entitled to receive uninsured benefits under the policy. If the policy does not violate subsection 38.2-2206A and Stone is not, therefore, entitled to receive uninsured motorist benefits under the policy, then the judgment of the district court will be reversed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Virginia\u2019s uninsured motorist statute, recently amended, contained the following pertinent provisions at the time of this controversy. Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 (Repl. Vol. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">Subsection (A) provided that \u201cno policy or contract of bodily injury . . . liability insurance relating to the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle shall be issued or delivered in this Commonwealth to the owner of such vehicle or shall be issued or delivered by any insurer licensed in this Commonwealth upon any motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>vehicle principally garaged or used in this Commonwealth unless it contains an endorsement or provisions undertaking to pay the insured all sums that he is legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle\u201d within certain monetary limits. Subsection (A) further provided that \u201c[t]hose limits shall equal but not exceed the limits of the liability insurance provided by the policy. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">Subsection (B) provided that the term \u201c <em>\u2018Insured\u2019 </em>as used in subsection[ ] A ... of this section means the named insured and, while resident of the same household, the spouse of the named insured, and relatives of either, while in a motor vehicle or otherwise, and any person who uses the motor vehicle to which the policy applies, with the expressed or implied consent of the named insured, and a guest in the motor vehicle to which the policy applies or the personal representative of any of the above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">We must consider how far subsection (B) extends to insureds of the second class under the policy, that is, \u201c[a]nyone else occupying a covered auto.\u201d This is purely a question of statutory interpretation: Does Stone qualify under the statute as an insured, notwithstanding the limiting language of the policy? We hold that he does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">An analysis of the statute in question must be made against the following settled background. The Virginia uninsured motorist statute \u201cis meant to protect an insured motorist, his family and permissive users of his vehicle against the peril of injury by an uninsured wrongdoer, not to provide \u2018insurance coverage upon each and every uninsured vehicle to everyone.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bayer </em>v. <em>Travelers Indem. Co., </em>221 Va. 5, 8, 267 S.E.2d 91, 93 (1980) (quoting <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Harleysville Mut. Cas. Co., </em>203 Va. 600, 603, 125 S.E.2d 840, 843 (1962)).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Turning to the statute, we construe the plain language of subsection (A) as merely reciting those circumstances under which policies providing bodily injury liability insurance, issued in the Commonwealth upon vehicles principally garaged or used in the State, must contain endorsements agreeing to pay \u201cthe insured\u201d certain sums that such insured is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle. As the insurer contends, nothing in that subsection purports to require that all the same vehicles and insureds be covered under both liability and uninsured motorist coverages of the same policy. The subsection does expressly recite that the <em>limits </em>of uninsured motorist coverage shall be equal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>but not exceed the limits of liability insurance, but it does not require other similarities of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The focus in this case must be on subsection (B) of the statute. Given the facts, the crucial statutory language, which defines the term \u201cinsured,\u201d describes the extent to which uninsured motorist coverage is mandated by the statute to insureds of the second class. An insured is \u201cany person who uses the motor vehicle to which the policy applies, with the expressed or implied consent of the named insured, and a guest in the motor vehicle to which the policy applies or the personal representative of any of the above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Dissecting the clauses, we look first to the term \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d The language does not say \u201ca,\u201d \u201cany,\u201d \u201cevery,\u201d or \u201call.\u201d In two places, it provides \u201cthe\u201d motor vehicle to which the policy applies. Stone was not using either of \u201cthe\u201d motor vehicles to which the policy applies, the Ford or the Honda; he was using his own motor vehicle. Thus, the statute only requires, as to insureds of the second class, that uninsured motorist coverage be provided to those who are in either of <em>the </em>motor vehicles listed in the policy, as opposed to \u201cany\u201d vehicle to which the policy might apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Second, and more importantly, we look to the language providing that the person who uses the motor vehicle must do so \u201cwith the expressed or implied consent of the named insured.\u201d Obviously, when the General Assembly employs this language, it is resorting to language relating to the omnibus clause found in Code \u00a7 38.2-2204(A), which deals with liability insurance covering motor vehicles (policy must contain a provision insuring any person using the motor vehicle \u201cwith the expressed or implied consent of the named insured\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">When construing such language, we repeatedly have held that a named insured generally cannot give permission to use a vehicle that the named insured does, not own. For example, in <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>203 Va. 337, 341, 124 S.E.2d 203, 206 (1962), the Court said that \u201cin order for one\u2019s use and operation of an automobile to be within the meaning of the omnibus coverage clause requiring permission of the named insured, the latter must, as a general rule, own the insured vehicle or have such an interest in it that he is entitled to the possession and control of the vehicle and in a position to give such permission.\u201d <em>Accord Virginia Auto Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Brillhart, </em>187 Va. 336, 343, 46 S.E.2d 377, 380 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">But Stone contends that because he was operating a \u201ccovered auto\u201d within the meaning of the liability provisions of the policy, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>therefore qualified as an \u201cinsured\u201d under the uninsured motorist statute in that he was using a motor vehicle to which the policy applies within the mandate of subsection (B). Stone argues that the employer, Tidewater, impliedly gave Stone permission to operate Stone\u2019s vehicle when he was using it in the scope of the employer\u2019s business. We reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">The \u201cexpressed or implied consent\u201d language of the subsection modifies \u201cthe motor vehicle to which the policy applies\u201d clause. If the legislature, in the uninsured motorist statute, had meant to include as insureds of the second class occupants of non-owned vehicles, then the General Assembly surely would have used language like it uses at the end of Code \u00a7 38.2-2204(A), which deals with the sort of permission needed when one is operating a non-owned vehicle. That statute refers to \u201cpermission or consent of the owner\u201d of a non-owned vehicle, and deems permission or consent of \u201cthe custodian\u201d to be the permission of the owner. The uninsured motorist statute contains no such expansive language.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Simply put, \u201cthe vehicle\u201d referred to in subsection (B) includes only owned, not non-owned vehicles. Thus, there is no statutory mandate that requires the courts to ignore the insurer\u2019s policy language as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Accordingly, the certified question is answered in the negative.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b37-7\">JUSTICE KOONTZ,</author>\n<p id=\"AI\">with whom JUSTICE LACY joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">I respectfully dissent. The Virginia uninsured motorist statute is remedial in nature and is to be liberally construed so that its intended purpose, to protect the innocent victims of negligent uninsured/ underinsured motorists, may be accomplished. <em>See Lipscombe </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>213 Va. 81, 83, 189 S.E.2d 320, 322-23 (1972); <em>Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Sours, </em>205 Va. 602, 606, 139 S.E.2d 51, 54-55 (1964). We are required to look to the words used in the statute to determine its meaning and to give effect only to the meaning so determined. <em>See Rose </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>209 Va. 755, 758, 167 S.E.2d 339, 342 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">When the accident in question occurred, Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 provided in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-10\">A. [N]o policy or contract of bodily injury or property damage liability insurance relating to the ownership, maintenance, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>use of a motor vehicle shall be issued or delivered in this Commonwealth to the owner of such vehicle <em>or shall be issued or delivered by any insurer licensed in this Commonwealth upon any motor vehicle principally </em>garaged or <em>used in this Commonwealth </em>unless it contains an endorsement or provisions undertaking to pay the insured all sums that he is legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle with limits not less than the requirements of \u00a7 46.2-472. <em>Those limits shall equal </em>but not exceed <em>the limits of the liability insurance provided by the policy. . . .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">B. \u201cInsured\u201d as used in [subsection] A . . . means the named insured and, while resident of the same household, the spouse of the named insured, and relatives of either, while in a motor vehicle or otherwise, <em>and any person who uses the motor vehicle to which the policy applies, with the expressed or implied consent of the named insured </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">There is no dispute that the liability provisions of Liberty\u2019s policy extended liability coverage to Stone\u2019s vehicle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, subsection (A) required Liberty\u2019s policy to also provide uninsured motorist coverage with limits equal to those of the liability policy, if Stone, as a user of that vehicle at the time of the accident, met one of the definitions of an \u201cinsured\u201d contained in subsection (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">On the facts of this case, the majority correctly identifies the crucial statutory language in subsection (B) defining \u201cinsured\u201d to be \u201cany person who uses the motor vehicle to which the policy applies, with the expressed or implied consent of the named insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">Contrary to the initial conclusion reached by the majority, however, this phrase does not limit \u201cthe motor vehicle\u201d to one \u201clisted in the policy.\u201d The express language \u201cto which the policy applies\u201d modifies \u201cthe motor vehicle.\u201d There can only be two interpretations of the phrase \u201cthe policy\u201d when subsection (B) is read, as it must be, in context with subsection (A). This phrase can only mean \u201cthe uninsured motorist policy\u201d or \u201cthe liability policy.\u201d The former interpretation must be rejected because it would render the entire statute meaningless. This is so because the mandate of subsection (A) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>for uninsured motorist coverage for an \u201cinsured\u201d would never be invoked by a definition of insured under subsection (B) that is restricted to a user of a motor vehicle that already has uninsured motorist coverage. Rather, it is manifest that the legislature intended this phrase to refer to the liability coverage provision described in subsection (A), so that the phrase means \u201cthe motor vehicle to which the <em>liability </em>policy applies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">Finally, the majority suggests that the statute\u2019s requirement that use of the vehicle must be \u201cwith the expressed or implied consent of the named insured\u201d eliminates non-owned vehicles from subsection B because a named insured cannot give permission to use a vehicle that the named insured does not own. Nothing in the statute suggests that such an interpretation was intended by the legislature to limit the mandate of subsection (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">To accomplish the mandate that the insurer issue no liability insurance policy upon any motor vehicle principally used in this Commonwealth unless it contains an endorsement or provisions for uninsured motorist coverage in equal limits, the legislature expressly used the phrase \u201cwith the express or implied consent of the <em>named </em>insured\u201d to modify the definition of insured in subsection (B). Thus, the legislature recognized that there are instances, such as the present case, where a \u201cnamed insured,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the person or entity contracting for liability coverage, would not be the owner of all the vehicles to which the policy applies. Here, Stone was using a vehicle to which Liberty\u2019s liability policy applies because he was using it in connection with Tidewater\u2019s business, and he was doing so with the consent of Tidewater, the \u201cnamed insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">For these reasons, in my view, at the time of the accident in question, Stone was an \u201cinsured\u201d as defined by subsection (B) of the statute and, thus, notwithstanding the limiting provisions of the uninsured motorist endorsement of Tidewater\u2019s automobile policy with Liberty, Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 mandated that Stone be provided coverage as an insured under the uninsured motorist endorsement of that policy. Accordingly, I would answer the certified question in the affirmative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-10\"> Subsequent amendments to this statute are not pertinent to the issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b38-11\"> The declarations page of the liability policy specifically identifies non-owned vehicles while being used in Tidewater\u2019s business as \u201cCOVERED AUTOS.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
