On August 1, 1992, Julian David Harman, Jr., was driving Tracy Lee Sweeney and two of his friends home from the Franklin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>County Speedway about 11:00 p.m. when a second vehicle, driven by Mark Brian Harris, approached Harman\u2019s vehicle from the rear. For some distance, Harris \u201ctailgated\u201d the Harman vehicle; that is, the Harris vehicle \u201cwould get \u2018real close\u2019 \u201d to the rear of the Harman vehicle. The two vehicles were traveling at speeds estimated at 40 to 60 m.p.h., well above the 30 m.p.h. speed which was safe for that stretch of road. As the vehicles approached a sharp curve, Harman glanced in his rearview mirror to check Harris\u2019 position. When Harman turned his eyes back to the road, his truck was almost in the curve. He applied the brakes, but lost control of the vehicle. The vehicle slid off the road and down into a creek embankment. Harris\u2019 car followed Harman\u2019s vehicle off the road at approximately the same point. There was no contact between the vehicles, but Harman and Sweeney, among others, were injured in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Sweeney filed a motion for judgment against Harman and Harris seeking recovery for his injuries. Harman sought recovery for his injuries in a motion for judgment he filed against Harris. The two cases were consolidated. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Sweeney and against Harman and Harris jointly and severally for $25,000, and a verdict against Harris in favor of Harman for $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Harris appealed both judgments maintaining that, as a matter of law, his actions were not a proximate cause of the accident and Harman was contributorially negligent. Harris also challenged the verdicts as inconsistent. Harman assigned cross-error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on Harris\u2019 willful and wanton negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\n<em>Proximate Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Harris argues that he is entitled to final judgment in both actions because the evidence established, as a matter of law, that his actions were not a proximate cause of Harman\u2019s vehicle skidding off the road. Harris does not challenge the jury\u2019s determination that his actions were negligent, but argues that the evidence shows that Harman\u2019s admitted excessive speed and inattention were the sole proximate cause of the accident as a matter of law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Harman testified that just before the accident, he was \u201c[n]ot focusing on what [he] was doing\u201d because he was paying attention to the Harris vehicle. He also testified that Harris\u2019 actions frightened, scared, and distracted him. The state trooper investigating the acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>dent testified that when he interviewed Harman two months after the accident, Harman stated that he \u201cdidn\u2019t pay much attention to the vehicle being behind him.\u201d The conflicting testimony in this record presents a classic jury issue of whether Harris\u2019 tailgating was a proximate cause of the accident, and the trial court was correct in submitting the issue to the jury for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\n<em>Contributory Negligence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Harris argues that Harman\u2019s admissions that he was driving at an excessive speed and failed to maintain a proper lookout require a determination that Harman was contributorially negligent, as a matter of law, and, therefore, that Harris is entitled to final judgment in Harman\u2019s action against him. Harman replies that the issue was properly submitted to the jury because Harris\u2019 tailgating placed Harman in a position of sudden peril, and, thus, the jury could find that Harman\u2019s actions were reasonable under the circumstances.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Harman bases his position on our cases which have excused otherwise negligent acts, such as <em>Perlin </em>v. <em>Chappell, </em>198 Va. 861, 96 S.E.2d 805 (1957), in which we held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">[i]f the circumstances are such as would reasonably cause a normal person to become greatly excited or frightened, he is not required to exercise the coolness and sound judgment that he would be required to exercise under ordinary circumstances. One who negligently places another in a position of sudden peril may not complain that the other fails to react with wisdom and promptness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 866, 96 S.E.2d at 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">In <em>Perlin, </em>the plaintiff faced a runaway 1,100 pound heifer, and was \u201cso frightened that \u2018he could not move.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 863-64, 96 S.E.2d at 808. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff\u2019s failure to take reasonable steps to avoid injury was not negligent. Like <em>Perlin, </em>all the cases relied on by Harman in which the sudden peril doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>has been applied involved situations in which the actor engaged in some activity which could be considered negligent under normal circumstances, but was not because the actor was faced with immediate peril. <em>Norfolk &amp; Portsmouth Belt Line R.R. Co. </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>152 Va. 484, 500-01, 147 S.E. 461, 466 (1929) (failing to draw arm in car before collision with train); <em>Richmond Traction Co. </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>101 Va. 394, 404-05, 43 S.E. 622, 626 (1903) (boy jumping off moving street car when ordered to do so by conductor); <em>South West Improvement Co. </em>v. <em>Smith\u2019s Adm\u2019r, </em>85 Va. 306, 319, 7 S.E. 365, 371 (1888) (young boy opening door of mine chamber when faced with runaway coal train).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In this case, Harris\u2019 tailgating did not present Harman with immediate peril. While the record is not precise, it does establish that Harman was aware of Harris\u2019 tailgating for four to five miles before the two vehicles approached the curve and that Harman\u2019s speed was consistent throughout that four to five mile stretch. Harman was familiar with the road, knew he was approaching the curve, and knew he had to slow down to negotiate it. Harman was not put in sudden peril by Harris\u2019 tailgating, but he had been aware of, and had reacted to, the situation for a period of time. During that time, Harman, by his own admission, drove at an excessive speed and failed to keep a proper lookout. Accordingly, Harman was contributorially negligent as a matter of law, and the trial court erred in submitting that issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">m.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\n<em>Willful and Wanton Negligence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Harman assigned cross-error asserting that the trial court should have instructed the jury on willful and wanton negligence and that Harman\u2019s contributory negligence would not bar his recovery from Harris if Harris was guilty of willful and wanton negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Willful and wanton negligence is one of three levels of negligence. Simple negligence is the failure to use the degree of care an ordinary person would exercise to avoid injury to another. The second level of negligence, gross negligence, is action which shows indifference to others, disregarding prudence to the level that the safety of others is completely neglected. Gross negligence is negligence which shocks fair-minded people, but is less than willful recklessness. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Shively, </em>227 Va. 317, 321, 315 S.E.2d 210, 212-13 (1984). Willful and wanton negligence, the third level, is \u201cacting consciously in disregard of another person\u2019s rights or acting with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>reckless indifference to the consequences, with the defendant aware, from his knowledge of existing circumstances and conditions, that his conduct probably would cause injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321, 315 S.E.2d at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Harman argues that the evidence showed that Harris intended to tailgate Harman, had prior knowledge of the road and curve, and knew that his speed was in excess of the speed required to safely negotiate the curve. These facts, Harman contends, would support a finding by the jury that Harris\u2019 acts were conscious, intentional acts, in \u201cdisregard of another person\u2019s rights,\u201d and that Harris was aware, \u201cfrom his knowledge of existing circumstances and conditions, that his conduct probably would cause injury to others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Harman applies the phrases we have used to describe willful and wanton negligence in characterizing Harris\u2019 conduct. But adopting his analysis would turn every intentional moving traffic violation into a case of willful and wanton negligence. Traffic laws are established for the safety of those who are on the public roads. Every time a driver intentionally violates a traffic law, by definition, the violator is on notice that other users of the road may be injured as a result of his violation. Such conduct alone, however, does not have the characteristics of conduct generally classified as willful and wanton. <em>See Baker </em>v. Marcus, 201 Va. 905, 910, 114 S.E.2d 617, 621-22 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">While each case must be resolved on its own facts, willful and wanton negligence generally involves some type of egregious conduct \u2014 conduct going beyond that which shocks fair-minded people. Such conduct has ranged from a driver with a significantly high blood alcohol content involved in an accident after a prior collision with another car, exceeding the speed limit, driving in the wrong lane, and leaving the scene of the accident, <em>Huffman </em>v. <em>Love, </em>245 Va. 311, 313, 427 S.E.2d 357, 359 (1993), to a driver intentionally chasing and running into a bicyclist in a dispute over money, <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>166 Va. 65, 68, 184 S.E. 186, 187 (1936), but has not included the actions of a drunk driver who was speeding, took no evasive action to avoid a rear-end collision, and tried to leave the scene of the accident, <em>Puent </em>v. <em>Dickens, </em>245 Va. 217, 218-19, 427 S.E.2d 340, 341-42 (1993). The conduct complained of in this case, Harris\u2019 speed and tailgating, falls far short of the egregious conduct we have previously found necessary to support a finding of willful and wanton negligence. <em>See Clohessy </em>v. <em>Weiler, </em>250 Va. 249, 253, 462 S.E.2d 94, 97 (1995), and the cases discussed therein. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>ingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on willful and wanton negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\n<em>Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">In summary, we conclude that the trial court properly submitted the issue of whether Harris\u2019 actions were a proximate cause of the accident to the jury and that the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on willful and wanton negligence. Therefore, we will affirm that part of the judgment awarding Sweeney $25,000 for which Harris is jointly and severally liable with Harman. Because we conclude that Harman was contributorially negligent, as a matter of law, we will reverse that part of the judgment awarding Harman $50,000 damages, and enter final judgment in favor of Harris on that issue. In light of this disposition, we need not address Harris\u2019 challenge that the verdicts were conflicting.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-11\"> Harman also argues that his excessive speed and failure to keep a proper lookout were put into operation by Harris\u2019 tailgating and, therefore, the tailgating \u201centirely supersede^] the operation\u201d of Harman\u2019s negligence. The jury instruction upon which Harman relies, however, refers to whether Harris\u2019 negligence was superseded by Harman\u2019s, not vice versa. Harman did not offer a jury instruction on Harris\u2019 negligence as a superseding cause of the accident and we will not consider that argument here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
