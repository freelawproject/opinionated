We also consider whether the trial court erred by imposing sanctions against the employee and her attorney for filing a frivolous lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">Appellant Bridgette Jordan filed this action against Clay\u2019s Rest Home, Inc., an adult residential facility in Blackstone, seeking recovery of both compensatory and punitive damages. The plaintiff alleged that she is a black female hired in May 1993 by the defendant \u201cas a full time office employee,\u201d that she sustained \u201can on-the-job injury\u201d in June 1993, and that defendant terminated her employment in July 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">In a count labelled \u201cWrongful Discharge - Retaliation,\u201d plaintiff alleged defendant \u201cwillfully and wantonly discharged\u201d her \u201cbecause of her on-the-job injury and her filing of a claim for compensation under the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d In another count labelled \u201cWrongful Discharge - Race Discrimination,\u201d plaintiff alleged defendant \u201cwillfully and wantonly discharged\u201d her \u201cbecause of her race in violation of the public policy of Virginia . . . prohibiting race discrimination in employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">In a grounds of defense, the defendant denied the allegations of wrongful discharge and denied indebtedness to the plaintiff in any amount. With the grounds of defense, the defendant filed a motion for sanctions against the plaintiff and her attorney. The defendant asserted that the plaintiff evinced in the past an intent to \u201cget\u201d the defendant and that the filing of the action was \u201cirresponsible.\u201d The defendant asked the court to assess a monetary penalty against the plaintiff and her counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">Subsequently, and following some discovery proceedings, the action was tried to a jury. At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case-in-chief, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to strike the evidence upon both counts, and entered summary judgment for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Later, the court held a hearing on the sanctions motion and granted it. The court ordered the plaintiff and her attorney each to pay $5,000 to defendant \u201cas sanctions for filing and pursuing a claim that was not well grounded in law &amp; fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The plaintiff appeals from the summary judgment order. The plaintiff and her attorney, pro se, appeal from the sanctions order.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Initially, we shall address the plaintiff\u2019s action for damages. Because the trial court struck the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the sufficiency of that evidence to sustain a recovery is challenged. Therefore, we shall consider the evidence, and all reasonable inferences drawn from it, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Page </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>227 Va. 74, 76, 314 S.E.2d 57, 58 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s case was presented through the testimony of two witnesses, the assistant administrator of defendant\u2019s facility and the plaintiff herself, as well as through a number of documents. This evidence showed that plaintiff had been \u201chired\u201d by Barbara T. Daniel, the local assistant administrator, with the approval of the \u201cowner\u201d of the facility, who resided in Newport News. The plaintiff first reported to work on May 5, 1993 at a wage of $5 per hour as \u201ca new employee\u201d on a 90-day \u201cprobationary period.\u201d She \u201cwas hired on a part-time basis,\u201d although she worked eight-hour shifts and typically 40 hours per week. The defendant\u2019s policy was to evaluate probationary employees\u2019 performance during and at the end of the 90-day period to determine whether the employee qualified for further employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">The plaintiff was hired as an \u201coffice person.\u201d Her duties included washing and ironing the residents\u2019 clothes and delivering these items to residents\u2019 rooms. In addition, she would \u201ccheck\u201d on the residents every hour during her shift, count medicine, count money, and \u201c[d]o a little book work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">In the course of evaluating plaintiff\u2019s performance, Daniel, without advising plaintiff, noted in plaintiff\u2019s personnel file \u201ca couple of instances\u201d relating to her conduct. A file entry dated June 11, 1993 states plaintiff \u201cmade several inappropriate remarks about a male, resident\u2019s back side\u201d and plaintiff was \u201cextremely loud and used profanity on several occasions.\u201d Daniel testified that the \u201cbad language\u201d had been used in the presence of residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">On June 28, 1993, plaintiff was running up stairs in the facility and fell because of \u201ca nail hanging out of a step,\u201d injuring her knee. Daniel knew on the day the injury occurred that plaintiff was \u201creporting\u201d it. as a \u201cwork claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>On July 1, 1993, Daniel notified the plaintiff by telephone \u201cthat she should not come back to work.\u201d No reason for the discharge was given by Daniel; she advised the plaintiff that \u201cshe would get a reason from [defendant\u2019s attorney] explaining why she was being terminated.\u201d Plaintiff testified that, prior to this time, no one on behalf of defendant had warned her she was \u201cin danger of being fired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">On August 2, 1993, defendant\u2019s attorney wrote plaintiff the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">\u201cAt the request of John H. Graham, President of Clay\u2019s Rest Home, I am advising you that your dismissal from employment was due to the following facts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">1. You were employed on a 90 day trial basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">2. It became apparent that you did not or could not perform up to the standards they expect at Clay\u2019s Rest Home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-9\">3. You were an employee at will and as such your employer may terminate at anytime without cause, which was done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">The evidence showed that during the time plaintiff worked for defendant, it employed approximately 22 persons at the facility. Over half of those persons were black, several of them acting in a supervisory capacity. The record also shows that during the period January 1 - December 31, 1993, 20 of defendant\u2019s 32 employees were black. Plaintiff was the only employee terminated by defendant during 1993, 1994, and 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">Following her discharge, the plaintiff was \u201creplaced\u201d by a white female. The replacement was \u201chired after me,\u201d according to the plaintiff. The record does not show the replacement\u2019s qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">At the time of trial in January 1996, there were approximately 55 residents at the facility, of which one was black. In 1993, none of the residents was black. This situation resulted from \u201cchance\u201d because defendant has a nondiscriminatory admissions policy, according to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">Following plaintiff\u2019s accident, she filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim; as a result, she was awarded benefits for lost wages, medical expenses, and attorney\u2019s fees. Plaintiff testified she could not remember the date of filing the claim, and the record does not establish it.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-14\">When asked how she had been subjected to racial discrimination, the plaintiff testified \u201cbecause there\u2019s no black residents there.\u201d Elaborating, the plaintiff explained: \u201cI recall a long time ago when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>my mother called there and tried to get her mother in Clay\u2019s Rest Home, but they would not accept her.\u201d The plaintiff also testified that because Daniel, who is white, \u201cjust didn\u2019t have very much to say to\u201d her, plaintiff felt she was a victim of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">During argument of the defendant\u2019s motion to strike, the plaintiff urged the trial court to adopt an indirect, burden shifting method of determining whether plaintiff had established a prima facie case of wrongful discharge. Under this theory, the plaintiff argued, once an employee proves a \u201cbare-minimum type case,\u201d the employer \u201cwould have to come forward on their case to articulate a legitimate explanation of the reason for the discharge.\u201d Refusing to adopt the plaintiff\u2019s theory, the trial court ruled \u201cthe plaintiff has not proven a prima facie case,\u201d and struck the plaintiff\u2019s evidence on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff says the \u201cfundamental issue presented in this case is whether the law of Virginia permits a plaintiff such as Jordan, who lacks direct evidence in support of her claims of wrongful discharge, to prove her claims circumstantially, pursuant to the indirect, burden shifting method of proof recognized in <em>McDonnell Douglas [Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>411 U.S. 792 (1973)] and subsequent case law.\u201d Continuing, the plaintiff submits that this model should apply \u201cto statutory wrongful discharge actions, such as Jordan\u2019s action under [Code] \u00a7 65.2-308\u201d (employer shall not discharge employee solely because employee \u201cintends to file or has filed\u201d a workers\u2019 compensation claim). The plaintiff says the model should also apply to \u201ccommon law wrongful discharge actions [for race and gender-based discrimination] under the principles set forth in <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Education Systems Corp., </em>247 Va. 98, 439 S.E.2d 328 (1994).\u201d The plaintiff, injecting facts on brief that have no support in the testimonial or documentary evidence presented during the jury trial, then proceeds to argue that the trial court erred in ruling she failed to prove a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">In <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>the Supreme Court considered \u201csignificant questions as to the proper order and nature of proof in actions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, ... 42 U.S.C. \u00a72000e <em>et seq.\" </em>411 U.S. 793-94. The Court said: \u201cThe critical issue before us concerns the order and allocation of proof in a private, non-class action challenging employment discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 800. In that case, an employer was charged with a violation of the Civil Rights Act for refusing to rehire a former employee who was black.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>There, the Court held that a Title VH complainant \u201cmust carry the initial burden under the statute of establishing a prima facie case of racial discrimination.\u201d This may be done, the Court said, if the employee shows \u201c(i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant\u2019s qualifications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Continuing, the Court said the \u201cburden then must shift to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee\u2019s rejection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court did not attempt to detail \u201cevery matter which fairly could be recognized as a reasonable basis for a refusal to hire.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 802-03. The Court did, however, rule that the employer\u2019s showing that the employee participated in wrongful conduct against it sufficed to discharge the employer\u2019s \u201cburden of proof at this stage\u201d and to meet the employee\u2019s prima facie case of discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In <em>Texas Department of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248 (1981), the Supreme Court again addressed \u201cthe nature of the evidentiary burden placed upon the defendant in an employment discrimination suit\u201d brought under the Civil Rights Act. <em>Id. </em>at 249-50. That case involved a refusal to promote and a subsequent decision by the employer to terminate an employee allegedly based on gender discrimination in violation of Title VII. <em>Id. </em>at 251. There, the Court summarized the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>\u201cbasic allocation of burdens and order of presentation of proof in a Title VII case alleging discriminatory treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Again, in <em>United States Postal Service Board of Governors </em>v. <em>Aikens, </em>460 U.S. 711 (1983), the Court applied the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework in a Title VH action brought by a black postal service worker who claimed his employer had discriminatorily refused to promote him to a higher position. And, more recently, in <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502 (1993), a Title VII action by a black employee who charged his employer with demoting him and then discharging him because of his race, the Court summarized <em>McDonnell Douglas, Burdine, </em>and <em>Aikens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">From these decisions, and citing state-court decisions adopting the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>rationale, the plaintiff in the present case fashions four elements that she says Virginia should embrace when a plaintiff alleges wrongful discharge based on race. According to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>argument, a \u201cplaintiff may establish a prima facie case sufficient to shift the burden of production to the defendant\u201d if the plaintiff establishes by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) that \u201cthe plaintiff was black\u201d; (2) that \u201cthe defendant discharged the plaintiff from employment\u201d; (3) that \u201cthe plaintiff was satisfactorily performing the job,\u201d that is, she \u201cwas qualified for the job\u201d; and (4) that \u201cthe plaintiff was replaced with a white employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Given the Commonwealth\u2019s strong commitment to the employment-at-will doctrine, and because we conclude that Virginia\u2019s procedural and evidentiary framework for establishing a prima facie case is entirely appropriate for trial of wrongful discharge cases, we reject plaintiff\u2019s invitation to adopt the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>indirect, burden shifting idea. The <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>outline, refined in later cases, was adopted by the Supreme Court in the context of Title VTI actions under the federal Civil Rights Act. There was no focus, as here, on the employment-at-will doctrine. Indeed, in none of the Supreme Court cases is there even a passing reference to the doctrine, except in <em>Burdine </em>where there is a mention of \u201ctraditional management prerogatives.\u201d 450 U.S. at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Furthermore, Virginia law is settled that in trial of civil actions generally, and in the trial of wrongful discharge cases specifically, a plaintiff may prove a prima facie case by circumstantial as well as direct evidence. <em>See Charlton </em>v. <em>Craddock-Terry Shoe Corp., </em>235 Va. 485, 490, 369 S.E.2d 175, 177-78 (1988). Thus, there is no necessity for the Commonwealth to provide a special framework for trial of wrongful discharge cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">And, contrary to plaintiff\u2019s contention, the fact that Virginia uses a burden shifting procedure relating to jury selection when there is a constitutional claim of racial discrimination does not prompt us to embrace such a method here. See <em>Buck </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 449, 450-51, 443 S.E.2d 414, 415 (1994); <em>Barksdale </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>17 Va. App. 456, 459, 460 n.3, 438 S.E.2d 761, 763, 764 n.3 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Therefore, applying conventional procedural principles, we must determine whether the plaintiff presented evidence sufficient to survive a motion to strike. We agree with the plaintiff\u2019s statement on brief that, given the rejection of the indirect, burden shifting method of proof, she cannot \u201cprevail in this action, as she lacked direct evidence of wrongful discharge.\u201d We accept that concession, but add that the plaintiff also lacked circumstantial evidence of wrongful discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>First, we address the question whether there is circumstantial evidence to establish, prima facie, the retaliatory discharge count. As we have noted, Code \u00a765.2-308(A) provides, as pertinent, that no employer \u201cshall discharge an employee solely because the employee intends to file or has filed\u201d a workers\u2019 compensation claim. The record is devoid of evidence that plaintiff was fired because she had \u201cfiled\u201d a claim. We do not know from the evidence when the plaintiff\u2019s claim was filed; if, as the record seems to indicate, the claim was filed weeks or months after she was discharged, then, under this evidence, the discharge could not have been proximately related to the filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Moreover, the circumstantial evidence is insufficient to establish, prima facie, that plaintiff was fired \u201csolely\u201d because she <em>intended </em>to file a claim. The evidence merely shows the date of injury, that plaintiff thought she had been performing her duties satisfactorily, that supervisor Daniel then knew plaintiff was \u201creporting\u201d the injury as work-related, and that plaintiff was discharged three days later. Every employee injured in an accident arising out of and in the course of her employment presumably will make a claim for compensation benefits. So the timing of these events and the employer\u2019s knowledge that the employee was \u201creporting\u201d the injury, without more, does not raise an inference that the plaintiff was fired solely because she intended to file a workers\u2019 compensation claim. Otherwise, a question of fact on this issue would arise in every case merely upon proof that an employee had been fired after a work-related injury. We refuse to establish such a precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Second, we address the question whether there is circumstantial evidence sufficient to establish, prima facie, the race discrimination count. We hold there is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The evidence shows that the plaintiff is black; that her white supervisor \u201cjust didn\u2019t have very much to say to\u201d her; that \u201ca long time ago\u201d plaintiff\u2019s grandmother was refused admission to defendant\u2019s facility for some unknown reason; that plaintiff was discharged; and, that a white female with unknown qualifications, who was hired after the plaintiff had been employed, \u201creplaced\u201d her. And, the race of the facility\u2019s various residents is irrelevant, particularly in view of the fact that a majority of defendant\u2019s employees were of the same race as plaintiff. This evidence is utterly insufficient to prove, prima facie, that defendant intentionally discriminated against plaintiff on the basis of race.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Finally, we address the correctness of the sanctions order. As pertinent, Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1 provides that the signature of an attorney on a pleading constitutes the attorney\u2019s certificate that \u201cto the best of his knowledge, information and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry,\u201d the pleading \u201cis well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\u201d The court, upon violation of the statute, \u201cshall impose\u201d upon the attorney or his client, or both, \u201can appropriate sanction,\u201d as specified in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff and her attorney contend the trial court erred in finding that they lacked a reasonable basis for the filing of the motion for judgment. Elaborating, they \u201csubmit that their mistake in believing that Jordan could try her wrongful discharge claims on the basis of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>model was reasonable and a good faith argument.\u201d They contend that in a case like this \u201cof first impression under Virginia law,\u201d they should be permitted to argue \u201cin support of the adoption of a method of proof set forth in more than 20 years of case law in the United States Supreme Court . . . without running an unacceptable risk of being found in violation of \u00a7 8.01-271.1.\u201d They contend that no violation of the statute was shown. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">In considering whether an attorney\u2019s conduct violates the foregoing provisions of \u00a7 8.01-271.1, \u201cwe apply an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d in order to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in imposing sanctions. <em>Nedrich </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>245 Va. 465, 471-72, 429 S.E.2d 201, 204 (1993). Thus, we must determine whether, after reasonable inquiry, the attorney could have formed a belief that the motion for judgment was warranted by a good faith argument for modification of existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Our research has disclosed that appellate courts in at least 20 states have adopted the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework. It has been discussed in employment-law treatises. One author labels it a \u201cpopular paradigm.\u201d 2 Henry H. Perritt, Jr., <em>Employee Dismissal Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 7.22, at 98 (3d ed. 1992). Thus, we believe the plaintiff and her attorney could have formed a belief, after reasonable inquiry, that the motion for judgment was warranted by a good faith argument for modification of existing law. Accordingly, we hold the trial court abused its discretion in imposing sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Consequently, the order entering summary judgment on the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s action will be affirmed, the order assessing sane<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>tions against the plaintiff and her attorney will be reversed, and final judgment will be entered here.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b213-6\">JUSTICE HASSELL,</author>\n<p id=\"A3h\">with whom JUSTICE LACY and JUSTICE KEENAN join, concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">I do not join the majority\u2019s opinion for three significant reasons. First and foremost, the majority seems to suggest that Virginia\u2019s strong adherence to the employment-at-will doctrine is more important than Virginia\u2019s strong public policy which prohibits gender and/ or racial discrimination in the work place. Such a suggestion is inconsistent with precedent of this Court. We have already determined that termination of employment based on racial discrimination violates clear state policy against such discrimination and gives rise to a cause of action for wrongful discharge, notwithstanding the employment-at-will doctrine. <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Education Systems, </em>247 Va. 98, 439 S.E.2d 328 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Second, I disagree with the majority\u2019s opinion because I do not believe that this is an appropriate case to decide whether Virginia should accept or reject the indirect burden shifting method of proof recognized in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>411 U.S. 792 (1973). Here, the plaintiff\u2019s evidence of racial discrimination was so deficient that she would not have been able to establish a viable cause of action under any recognized burden of proof. Additionally, even though the majority says that when the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>principles were enunciated, \u201c[tjhere was no focus ... on the employment-at-will doctrine,\u201d the majority neglects to acknowledge that the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden of proof principles are applied by federal trial and appellate courts in Virginia. See <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Phipps, </em>67 F.3d 1137, 1141-42 (4th Cir. 1995). I believe that there may be instances where the application of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>principles may be proper, and I would reserve that determination for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Finally, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that a retaliatory discharge claim under Code \u00a7 65.2-308 is insufficient, as a matter of law, if a plaintiff alleges only that she incurred a job-related injury and was discharged after notifying her employer that she intended to file a workers\u2019 compensation claim. Although the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>tiff here failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge, the factual allegations and evidence in any other case are not before this Court. The sufficiency of the evidence of each case must be reviewed on its own merit, and I believe that the majority\u2019s placement of a blanket restriction on future cases is inappropriate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
