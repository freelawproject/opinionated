Basepoint, Inc., the subcontractor, entered into an agreement with Moore &amp; Moore General Contractors, Inc., the general contractor, to supply casework, including cabinets, and interior trim items for the facility, which was owned by General Mills Restaurants, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">Moore &amp; Moore, the buyer, refused to pay for cabinets delivered by Basepoint, the seller. Thereafter, the seller timely filed a memorandum of mechanic\u2019s lien in the sum of $28,080 and the present bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>of complaint to enforce the lien. Named as defendants to the bill were the buyer and the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">In its answer, the buyer denied indebtedness to the seller, claiming the materials supplied were defective. In addition, the buyer filed a cross-bill seeking recovery of approximately $47,000 to cover the cost of removing the \u201cdefective\u201d casework, rebuilding the casework, and finishing the remaining work under the seller\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Subsequently, by order, the property was released from the lien upon the filing of an appropriate bond as provided by Code \u00a7 43-70. The owner then was dismissed from the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The cause was referred to a commissioner in chancery, who conducted an evidentiary hearing. The facts were presented through ore tenus testimony, a de bene esse deposition, and documentary exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The commissioner submitted a report finding that the lien was valid, that the seller was entitled to judgment against the buyer in the sum claimed, and that the buyer was not entitled to judgment on its cross-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The trial court overruled the buyer\u2019s exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s report and confirmed it. The buyer appeals from the March 1996 final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Upon appellate review, a commissioner in chancery\u2019s factual findings based on ore tenus evidence that are confirmed by the trial court are given great weight. These findings will be reversed only if they are plainly wrong or without evidence to support them. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>249 Va. 511, 518, 457 S.E.2d 88, 92 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">The commissioner made the following factual findings. In connection with the bidding process for the Red Lobster project, the buyer provided the seller, which makes and sells woodwork, with plans and specifications prepared by Vision HI, an architect, dated in November 1990. The seller made a proposal in December 1990 to the buyer \u201cto furnish millwork items in accordance with plans and specifications, prepared by Vision HI, dated 11-30-90.\u201d These items included custom-made cabinets such as bar cabinets, food service cabinets, overhead office cabinets and restroom vanity cabinets. Shop drawings then were prepared and accepted by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">The Vision HI plans provided that all cabinets would be made of wood. The approved shop drawings made reference to the use of \u201cmelamine.\u201d There was a dispute in the evidence over the meaning of \u201cmelamine.\u201d The seller offered evidence to show that \u201cmelamine,\u201d as used in the shop drawings, referred to a composite product <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>with a particular type of hard finish. The buyer presented evidence that the word \u201cmelamine\u201d referred only to a finish, which can be placed on composite material or wood. According to the buyer, reference in the shop drawings to \u201cmelamine\u201d meant that the seller was authorized to provide wood covered with \u201cmelamine,\u201d not a composite material covered with a hard surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">In making his factual findings, the commissioner principally relied upon the ore tenus testimony of Donnie Ray Hall. Called as a witness by the seller, Hall had been the buyer\u2019s job superintendent for the Red Lobster project. Hall, a contractor who was experienced in millwork and carpentry, worked under the buyer\u2019s field superintendent, Allen L. Lyle.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">According to Hall, he and Lyle were aware of the reference to \u201cmelamine\u201d in the shop drawings and that the Vision m plans called for the use of plywood cabinets. Describing \u201cmelamine\u201d as \u201ca product with a particle board core in it,\u201d Hall testified that Lyle \u201cknew\u201d that particle board was to be used instead of plywood, that he and Lyle concluded the owner \u201cwould not know the difference\u201d were it used in place of plywood, and that the particle board was a product that would perform \u201cjust as well\u201d as wood in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Upon delivery of the cabinets to the jobsite between March 19, 1991 and April 12, 1991, Hall and Lyle inspected them and \u201cdid see it was particle boards.\u201d Hall found the product to be \u201cin A-l shape . . . other than . . . what it was made of.\u201d According to Hall, Lyle \u201chad to get\u201d the exposed ends of the work \u201ccovered up\u201d with drop cloths before installation so that the owner\u2019s inspector would not see \u201cthese products prior to\u201d installation. Hall testified that Lyle \u201cthought he was saving money\u201d by accepting the cabinets as delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Lyle then directed installation of all the cabinets and every one was installed prior to the inspection by the owner\u2019s representative. On May 1, 1991, the owner\u2019s inspector examined the installed millwork. He rejected the cabinets, stating they did not conform to the plans and specifications. On May 2, 1991, the buyer sent a letter to the seller stating, \u201cOn Wednesday, May 1, 1991, it was discovered that most of your casework is constructed of particle board. Since the plans [ ] we provided you for the above referenced job [ ] call for plywood, all of the casework that has particle board does not conform and must be replaced.\u201d In the letter, the buyer set the following Tuesday as the deadline for delivery of the replacement material, not<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>ing that the seller already had notified the buyer\u2019s field superintendent it could not meet the deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Later, Hall was told by one of the buyer\u2019s executives \u201cthat Allen Lyle had made a big mistake and they had used the wrong products, they had approved the wrong products to be used in the cabinets.\u201d According to Hall, the executive \u201cfelt that his man was really at fault and had made a mistake in this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Upon removal of the cabinets made of particle board, the buyer immediately procured plywood replacements from another subcontractor. The new cabinets were installed promptly and the project was completed nearly on time.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">UCC \u00a7 8.2-601, dealing with a buyer\u2019s rights on improper delivery, provides, as pertinent, that if \u201cgoods . . . fail in any respect to conform to the contract, the buyer may (a) reject the whole; or (b) accept the whole; or (c) accept any commercial unit or units and reject the rest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">UCC \u00a7 8.2-606, dealing with what constitutes acceptance of goods, provides, as pertinent, that \u201c(1) Acceptance of goods occurs when the buyer . . . (c) does any act inconsistent with the seller\u2019s ownership. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The buyer\u2019s installation of the nonconforming cabinets constituted an \u201cact inconsistent with the seller\u2019s ownership\u201d and thus amounted to an acceptance of the goods under \u00a7 8.2-606(l)(c). The buyer does not dispute this conclusion. Instead, the buyer contends that it properly revoked its acceptance of the cabinets because of their nonconformity to the plans and specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">The buyer had no right, however, to revoke the acceptance. The buyer, through its field superintendent and job superintendent, had full knowledge that the cabinets supplied by the seller did not conform to the plans and specifications. The consequences of an \u201cacceptance\u201d under these circumstances is clearly set forth in UCC \u00a7 8.2-607(2). The statute provides that a buyer\u2019s acceptance of goods \u201cprecludes rejection of the goods accepted and if made with knowledge of a nonconformity cannot be revoked because of it. ...\u201d In other words, revocation is unavailable for a nonconformity known to the buyer at the time of acceptance, except under circumstances not present here. <em>See </em>Official Comment 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">But \u00a7 8.2-607(2) also provides that \u201cacceptance does not of itself impair any other remedy provided by this title for nonconformity.\u201d The buyer contends that while acceptance of the cabinets entitles the seller to payment of the contract price of approximately $28,000, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>nonconformity of the goods entitles the buyer to judgment on its cross-bill for approximately $47,000 for the cost incurred to remove and replace the nonconforming cabinets. Thus, the issue arises whether the buyer is entitled to recover under its cross-bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">The buyer based its cross-bill on only the \u201ccover\u201d remedy available under UCC \u00a7\u00a78.2-711 and -712, which allow a buyer to recover for procurement of substitute goods. Under \u00a78.2-711, the \u201ccover\u201d remedy is available in four situations: when the seller \u201cfails to make delivery;\u201d when the seller \u201crepudiates\u201d the contract; when the buyer \u201crightfully rejects\u201d the goods; and when the buyer \u201cjustifiably revokes acceptance\u201d of the goods. None of those situations exists in this case, as the commissioner and the trial court properly ruled in denying the cross-bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Finally, we summarily reject the buyer\u2019s contention that the mechanic\u2019s lien was unenforceable. The buyer contends that because the materials were removed from the building before the memorandum was filed, the goods did not enhance the value of the building, thus making the lien invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Code \u00a7 43-3 authorizes a lien in favor of \u201c[a]ll persons performing labor or furnishing materials ... for the construction ... or improvement of any building.\u201d The seller furnished materials for this budding project, and the cabinets were delivered, accepted, installed, and added value to the structure. The fact that the cabinets were removed before the memorandum was filed is irrelevant. The legislature could not have intended that a supplier\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien may be avoided simply by removing from the building the materials furnished and incorporated in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Consequently, we hold that the commissioner\u2019s factual findings confirmed by the trial court are not plainly wrong but are supported by credible evidence, and that the court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. Thus, the judgment of the trial court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
