Matyiko, John Matyiko, Jr., and Jerry B. Matyiko (the defendants), alleging that they were former directors of Matyiko Investment Corp. (the Corporation), which had been dissolved, and that they were jointly and severally liable for an unlawful distribution of assets under Code \u00a7 13.1-692.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commissioner sought recovery of $137,965, representing the excess resulting when commissioners in the condemnation proceeding awarded less than the amount previously paid the Corporation pursuant to a certificate of take.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-8\">In a bench trial, the trial court entered judgment in favor of the defendants. We awarded the Commissioner this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-9\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b21-10\">In 1985, the Corporation, which was closely held, owned a 99.52-acre tract of land in Chesterfield County, constituting the Corporation\u2019s only asset. On February 13, 1985, William S. Lee, right-of-way agent for the Department of Highways and Transportation, offered the Corporation $327,140 for an 8.05-acre parcel needed for highway construction, including $221,375 as the value of the needed land and $105,765 as damages to the 91.47-acre residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-11\">The Corporation rejected the Highway Department\u2019s offer. On March 28, 1985, the Commissioner filed a certificate of take in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Clerk\u2019s Office of the Circuit Court of Chesterfield County, certifying that the amount of $327,140 was estimated to be the fair value of the 8.05-acre parcel taken plus damages to the residue and that this amount would be paid by the Treasurer of Virginia pursuant to the order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\">On April 15, 1985, the Corporation entered into a contract with the Midlothian Company for the sale and purchase of the 99.52-acre tract, less that portion covered by the Commissioner\u2019s certificate of take, for a price of $32,000 per acre. On April 19, 1985, the Corporation\u2019s directors and stockholders voted to dissolve the Corporation and distribute all its assets. The Corporation directed its counsel, N. Leslie Saunders, Jr., to file a statement of intent to dissolve the Corporation with the State Corporation Commission, in accordance with the provisions of Code \u00a7 13.1-81.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prepared by a member of Saunders\u2019 law firm, the statement of intent to dissolve was filed on June 4, 1985. It listed Joseph G. Matyiko, Sr., James E. Matyiko, John Matyiko, Jr., Jerry B. Matyiko, and Saunders as directors of the Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">Some time prior to May 13, 1985, the Corporation filed a petition with the trial court for leave to draw down the sum of $327,140, set forth in the certificate of take as the estimated value of the 8.05-acre parcel and damages to the residue. An order was entered on May 13 directing payment of $327,140 to Saunders on behalf of the Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">The check for the \u201cdrawdown\u201d was issued to the Corporation on June 10, 1985. Shortly thereafter, the Corporation disbursed to its shareholders all its assets, including the proceeds of both the \u201cdrawdown\u201d and the sale of the 91.47-acre residue. Joseph Matyiko held 45% of the Corporation\u2019s stock, James, John, and Jerry Matyiko each held 15%, and Saunders held 10%. In the disbursement, Joseph Matyiko received $1,376,869, James, John, and Jerry Matyiko each received $458,956, and Saunders received $305,970.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">Saunders had received his stock in return for his agreement to represent the Corporation in matters involving the Corporation\u2019s land. Saunders and Richard Paul Pontynen (Pontynen), the Corporation\u2019s certified public accountant, recommended the dissolution in order to take advantage of \u00a7 337 of the Internal Revenue Code and avoid double taxation of the gain derived from sale of the Corporation\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>land. According to Pontynen\u2019s testimony, \u00a7 337(a) allows such tax avoidance</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-4\">[i]f within a 12 month period beginning on the date on which a corporation adopts a plan of complete liquidation, all of the assets of a corporation are distributed in complete liquidation, less assets to meet claims, then no gain or loss should be recognized from such corporation from sale of or exchange by it of property within such 12 month period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">In addition, Saunders expressed the opinion that there was \u201cno chance of. . . getting less than the certificate in a condemnation case and . . . not . . . any risk in dissolving the Corporation.\u201d Saunders also opined that he \u201cthought they were looking realistically at [$]400,000\u201d as a condemnation award.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">After the Corporation distributed its assets, Saunders continued to negotiate with Lee, the right-of-way agent for the Department of Highways, in an effort to settle the condemnation case. The amount initially offered by the Highway Department was based upon an appraisal of $27,500 per acre for the Corporation\u2019s land. When the Corporation contracted to sell the residue for $32,000 per acre, or $4,500 per acre more than the Department\u2019s initial appraisal, the Department took the position that the value of the Corporation\u2019s land had been enhanced by the highway project, rather than damaged. Accordingly, Lee advised Saunders that the Department was willing to offer no more than $350,000 to settle the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">The $350,000 offer was rejected, and Saunders ceased representing the Corporation. With different counsel representing the Corporation, the condemnation case went to trial before commissioners in March 1993, resulting in an award of $189,175, or $23,500 per acre, with no damages to the residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">By order dated March 10, 1994, the trial court confirmed the condemnation commissioners\u2019 report and also entered judgment in favor of the Commissioner against the Corporation in the amount of $137,965, plus interest, representing the excess of the amount previously drawn down by the Corporation over the amount of the condemnation award. In the meantime, the Corporation had been terminated by order of the State Corporation Commission entered April 15, 1986, and, therefore, there were no corporate assets remaining to satisfy the judgment. The Commissioner then filed the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>motion for judgment against James, John, and Jerry Matyiko seeking to have them held personally liable for the amount of the excess.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">\n<em>Applicable Statutory Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">As noted earlier, Code \u00a7 13.1-692(A) provides that \u201c[u]nless he complies with the applicable standards of conduct described in \u00a7 13.1-690, a director who votes for or assents to a distribution made in violation of [Chapter 9 of Title 13 of the Code] is personally liable to the corporation <em>and its creditors </em>for the amount of the distribution that exceeds what could have been distributed without violating [Chapter 9].\u201d (Emphasis added.) Under Code \u00a7 13.1-653, a violation of Chapter 9 may occur if, as a result of distributions made to shareholders, the corporation \u201cwould not be able to pay its debts as they become due,\u201d Code \u00a7 13.1-653(C)(1), or its \u201ctotal assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities,\u201d Code \u00a7 13.1-653(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">However, because Code \u00a7 13.1-692(A) conditions its imposition of personal liability upon a director\u2019s failure to comply with the standards of conduct described in Code \u00a7 13.1-690, a \u201csafe harbor\u201d is provided to a director who does comply with those standards. <em>See Curley </em>v. <em>Dahlgren Chrysler-Plymouth Dodge, Inc., </em>245 Va. 429, 433, 429 S.E.2d 221, 223 (1993). Code \u00a7 13.1-690, embodying Virginia\u2019s \u201cBusiness Judgment Rule,\u201d provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-7\">A. A director shall discharge his duties as a director ... in accordance with his good faith business judgment of the best interests of the corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-8\">B. Unless he has knowledge or information concerning the matter in question that makes reliance unwarranted, a director is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>2. Legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the director believes, in good faith, are within the person\u2019s professional or expert competence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-4\">C. A director is not liable for any action taken as a director, or any failure to take any action, if he performed the duties of his office in compliance with this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-5\">D. A person alleging a violation of this section has the burden of proving the violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">In finding for the defendants, the trial court reviewed the evidence and applicable statutory provisions and stated in a letter opinion, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-8\">Defendants obtained legal and accounting advice with regard to dissolution of the corporation. They acted in good faith upon the recommendations of an attorney skilled in corporate, real estate and condemnation matters and upon the recommendations of a certified public accountant skilled in taxation matters. Consequently, the Defendants are protected from liability for the debts of [the Corporation].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">Quoting <em>Quantum Development Co. </em>v. <em>Luckett, </em>242 Va. 159, 161, 409 S.E.2d 121, 122 (1991), the defendants contend that a \u201c \u2018trial court\u2019s findings of fact are binding upon [this Court] unless they are plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence.\u2019 \u201d Here, the defendants maintain, \u201cthe trial court\u2019s <em>findings of fact </em>that the directors \u2018acted in good faith upon the recommendations of an attorney . . . and ... a certified public accountant\u2019 . . . [are] clearly supported by the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-10\">However, we are of opinion that resolution of one of the assignments of error made by the Commissioner is dispositive as a matter of law of the question whether the defendants were entitled to rely upon the recommendations of the Corporation\u2019s attorney and accountant. That assignment states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>The trial court erred by ruling that a corporation\u2019s directors, who made large cash distributions to themselves and to the corporation\u2019s attorney, were entitled to rely on professional advice to make those distributions even though the funds the corporation had received from [the Commissioner] were, by order of the court endorsed by the corporation\u2019s attorney, subject to being refunded to [the Commissioner] upon final resolution of the condemnation case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">With respect to this assignment of error, the Commissioner points to the following paragraph of the \u201cdrawdown\u201d order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-5\">It is further ORDERED that in the event of an award in a condemnation proceeding being of a lesser amount than that deposited with the Court, the State Highway and Transportation Commissioner of Virginia shall receive the amount of such excess, and if any person has been paid a greater sum than that to which it is entitled as determined by the award, judgment shall be entered for the State Highway and Transportation Commissioner against such person for the amount of such excess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">The wording of the order tracks the language of Code \u00a7 33.1-128, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-7\">In the event of an award in a condemnation proceeding being of a lesser amount than that deposited with the court, the Commissioner shall recover the amount of such excess and, if any person has been paid a greater sum than that to which he is entitled as determined by the award, judgment shall be entered for the Commissioner against such person for the amount of such excess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">The Commissioner contends that \u201cthe directors of a corporation that receive condemnation proceeds pursuant to an order of court that the funds are being drawn down subject to the outcome of the condemnation proceeding [may not] rely on a professional\u2019s recommendation that the corporation distribute all of its assets even though the condemnation proceeding is still pending.\u201d The Commissioner argues that in this case the \u201cdrawdown\u201d order placed the Corporation \u201con notice of the risks of receiving the drawdown money in advance of [the] trial on the matter,\u201d meaning \u201cthat if the condemna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>tion award at trial is less than the amount drawn down, judgment will be entered against the landowner for the difference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">Yet, the Commissioner complains, \u201c[t]he directors ignored the drawdown order\u2019s language admonishing [the Corporation] of the risk\u201d and \u201cdistributed all of [the Corporation\u2019s] assets to themselves and their attorney.\u201d If directors can do \u201cwhat these directors have done,\u201d the Commissioner cautions, \u201cthe drawdown order is completely meaningless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">This argument brings into focus Code \u00a7 13.1-690(B), which, as noted previously, provides that a director is entitled to rely upon the recommendations of experts \u201c[u]nless he has knowledge or information concerning the matter in question that makes reliance unwarranted.\u201d The defendants insist, however, that they \u201cdid not know .. . there was even a legal possibility of any payback liability to [the Commissioner],\u201d that \u201cthey were not on notice of the possibility of a payback liability,\u201d that they \u201cdid not sign the drawdown order,\u201d and that their signatures appear \u201con no documents [reflecting] imputed knowledge of any payback liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">But uncontradicted testimony at trial showed that the defendants had <em>actual </em>knowledge of the provisions of the \u201cdrawdown\u201d order. During trial, the Commissioner\u2019s counsel asked Saunders what advice he had given the \u201cMatyiko brothers sitting here about the drawdown,\u201d obviously referring to the present defendants. Saunders replied: \u201cWe <em>went over the drawdown, the drawdown order, what it said and so forth.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) While Saunders went on to express the opinion, as recited previously, that \u201cthere was no chance of . . . getting less than the certificate in a condemnation case and [no] risk in dissolving the Corporation,\u201d it is clear that the defendants were made aware of the existence of the contingent liability of the Corporation for a possible payback in the event the condemnation award was less than the amount paid pursuant to the \u201cdrawdown\u201d order. And, although it is not necessary for a corporation to satisfy contingent liabilities upon dissolution, it is required to make provision for the discharge of such liabilities before distributing its remaining assets to its shareholders. 16A William M. Fletcher, <em>Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations </em>\u00a7 8126 (perm. ed. rev. vol. 1995). Yet, the defendants voted for or assented to a distribution of all the Corporation\u2019s assets without making provision for payment of the contingent liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">In an apparent effort to excuse their failure to make such provision, the defendants introduced the testimony of Neil H. Demchick, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>an accountant and financial consultant. He testified that in 1985 the payback liability of the Corporation was contingent only and that under generally accepted accounting principles, this contingent liability could not have been properly recorded in financial statements. But whether it is necessary to report a contingent liability in financial statements begs the question whether a corporation may dissolve and distribute all its assets to shareholders without making provision for the payment of a liability, albeit contingent, that is imposed as the result of a statutory provision and a court order. It should not be necessary to say that general accounting principles cannot render meaningless the provisions of a statute and a court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">We conclude that, at the time they voted for or assented to the distribution of the Corporation\u2019s assets, the defendants had, within the meaning of Code \u00a7 13.1-690(B), \u201cknowledge or information\u201d that the condemnation award possibly would be less than the amount distributed under the \u201cdrawdown\u201d order. And this knowledge or information was sufficient as a matter of law to make the defendants\u2019 reliance upon the opinions of Saunders and Pontynen unwarranted. Since such reliance was the sole basis for the trial court\u2019s ruling that the defendants acted in good faith with respect to the distribution of the Corporation\u2019s assets, it follows that the ruling was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">This results in reversal of the judgment of the trial court. The defendants say that we should not enter final judgment in the event of reversal but should remand because a question remains whether James and Jerry Matyiko were directors of the Corporation. However, no such question remains.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">In their brief in opposition, the defendants assigned cross-error asserting only that \u201c[t]he trial court erred in receiving as <em>prima facie </em>evidence against appellee Jerry Matyiko\u201d the Corporation\u2019s statement of intent to dissolve, but we refused that assignment of cross-error at the time we awarded the Commissioner an appeal. So Jerry Matyiko is seeking to revive a dead issue. No cross-error was assigned with respect to James Matyiko, which is understandable. In his capacity as corporate secretary, he signed the statement of intent to dissolve, which listed him as a director. So, beside being late, James Matyiko seeks to raise what, in the most charitable of terms, may be described as a meritless claim. In any event, none of this offers any reason for this Court to refrain from entering final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">In his motion for judgment, the Commissioner sought recovery of $137,965, which equals the amount of the excess payment in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>\u201cdrawdown,\u201d plus 8% interest from March 28, 1985, the date the certificate of take was filed, until paid, plus costs. However, the Commissioner now asks for judgment in the lesser amount of $105,765, which equals the amount included in the \u201cdrawdown\u201d for damages to the residue, plus the same provisions for interest and costs. Accordingly, we will enter final judgment against the defendants in favor of the Commissioner for $105,765, plus 8% interest from March 28, 1985, until paid and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b21-12\"> Code \u00a7 13.1-692 provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b21-13\">Liability for unlawful distribution. \u2014 A.
