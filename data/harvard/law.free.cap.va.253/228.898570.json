Davenport, Jr., and Suzanne S. Davenport (the taxpayers) have five minor children who periodically have received cash gifts from their grandparents. The grandparents made the gifts to Bradfut\u00e9 W. Davenport, Jr., as custodian for each child as permitted by the Virginia Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 31-37, <em>et seq. </em>The taxpayers have no ownership interest in, or use of, the gifts or any investment income thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">The taxpayers filed joint income tax returns with the federal government and the Commonwealth of Virginia for the years 1992 through 1994. In each of these taxable years, the taxpayers\u2019 children had income subject to federal taxation. As permitted by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1(g)(7), the taxpayers elected to include their minor children\u2019s unearned income in the taxpayers\u2019 federal adjusted gross income for federal income tax purposes rather than file a separate tax return for each child. When the taxpayers submitted their Virginia income tax returns for the years 1992 and 1993, the taxpayers subtracted the unearned income of their minor children from their federal adjusted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>gross income to determine the quantum of the taxpayers\u2019 Virginia adjusted gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Taxation issued, a notice of assessment to the taxpayers for their 1992 Virginia income tax return. The Department asserted that the taxpayers should not have subtracted the children\u2019s unearned income from the taxpayers\u2019 federal adjusted gross income, and the Department assessed tax and interest on the income which was not reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The taxpayers paid the additional tax assessment under protest and filed an application for correction of erroneous or improper assessments of state income taxes in the circuit court, seeking a determination that they were entitled to subtract their children\u2019s unearned income from the taxpayers\u2019 federal adjusted gross income. The trial court agreed with the taxpayers, and we awarded the Department an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Code \u00a7 58.1-301 provides that \u201c[a]ny term used in this chapter [which governs Virginia\u2019s income tax] shall have the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in the laws of the United States relating to federal income taxes, unless a different meaning is clearly required.\u201d Code \u00a758.1-322 states in relevant part: \u201cA. The Virginia taxable income of a resident individual means his federal adjusted gross income for the taxable year . .. with the modifications specified in this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The taxpayers argue that they are entitled to deduct their children\u2019s unearned income from the taxpayers\u2019 federal adjusted gross income because, they say, the word \u201chis\u201d found in Code \u00a7 58.1-322(A) refers to the taxpayers\u2019 income and does not include their children\u2019s unearned income, which was less than $5,000 and would otherwise not be subject to state income taxation. The Department argues that in determining a taxpayers\u2019 Virginia income tax liability, Code \u00a7 58.1-322(A) requires that the taxpayers include all income included in the taxpayers\u2019 federal adjusted gross income subject only to those modifications contained in \u00a7 58.1-322.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">We agree with the Department. The plain language in Code \u00a7\u00a7 58.1-301 and -322 clearly and unambiguously requires the taxpayers to report their federal adjusted gross income as taxable income on their Virginia tax returns. Code \u00a758.1-322, which also prescribes numerous modifications to a resident individual\u2019s federal adjusted gross income, contains no provision which authorizes the taxpayers to subtract their children\u2019s unearned income. The taxpayers elected to include their children\u2019s unearned income in the taxpayers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>federal adjusted gross income for federal taxation purposes, and, having made such election, the taxpayers may not change that election in computing their state income tax. Moreover, we are of opinion that the phrase \u201chis federal adjusted gross income\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 58.1-322 does not refer to only one taxpayer\u2019s income, but refers to the amount of federal adjusted gross income that the taxpayers specified on their federal income tax return, subject to any modification authorized by Virginia statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and enter final judgment here in favor of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
