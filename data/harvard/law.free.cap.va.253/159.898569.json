Schwartz, M.D. (Dr. Schwartz), removed Brownlee\u2019s prostate gland in an operation which resulted in the successful excision of the cancer. Following this type of surgery, a patient normally suffers tempo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>rarily from incontinence, but Brownlee encountered serious difficulties during his post-operative treatment by Dr. Schwartz and became totally incontinent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">In an amended motion for judgment filed below, Brownlee sought damages from Dr. Schwartz, a licensed health care provider, and his wholly owned corporation, Metropolitan Medical Care, Inc. (MMC), a non-health care provider (the defendants). Brownlee alleged that he had sustained injuries as a result of Dr. Schwartz\u2019s post-operative negligence while acting as the agent of MMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In a trial before a jury, the trial court ruled as a matter of law that Dr. Schwartz was the agent of MMC \u201cduring the relevant times\u201d and instructed the jury accordingly. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Brownlee against Dr. Schwartz and MMC jointly and severally in the sum of $1,850,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The trial court ordered a remittitur of the verdict against Dr. Schwartz to $1 million, the medical malpractice cap established by Code \u00a7 8.01-581.15. However, the court refused to order a remittitur in favor of MMC and entered judgment against it in the full amount of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The defendants filed a petition for appeal, which this Court refused. Later, this Court granted the defendants\u2019 petition for rehearing and awarded them this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">In their petition for appeal, the defendants assigned three errors, the first alleging that Brownlee had \u201cfailed to prove a proximate cause relationship between the negligence alleged and his injury to a reasonable degree of medical certainty or probability.\u201d The gist of the defendants\u2019 argument on this point is that Brownlee\u2019s counsel failed to incorporate the phrase \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d or \u201creasonable degree of medical probability\u201d into the questions posed to Brownlee\u2019s expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">However, in their petition for rehearing, the defendants made no mention of their first assignment of error or of any deficiency in the proof of causation, relying solely on the two remaining assignments of error in requesting that \u201cthis Court grant the Petition for Rehearing and grant a writ in this case.\u201d In our opinion, the failure to include the first assignment of error in the petition for rehearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>constitutes an abandonment of that assignment of error. We will consider, therefore, only the two remaining assignments of error. They are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">2. The trial court erred when it denied defendant MMC\u2019s Motion to Dismiss as to it as a matter of law and instead directed a verdict for the plaintiff on the issue of whether Dr. Schwartz\u2019s performance of medical services was as an agent of MMC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">3. The trial court erred when it allowed a judgment in excess of the Virginia Medical Malpractice Cap to stand as to MMC, Dr. Schwartz\u2019s wholly owned corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">a. MMC\u2019s liability, which was predicated wholly on a theory of respondeat superior[,] cannot be greater than that of Dr. Schwartz, MMC\u2019s alleged agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">b. Plaintiff is limited to the malpractice cap for damages arising from a single indivisible injury, even when there are multiple defendants jointly and severally liable for same, where at least one of the defendants is a \u201chealth care provider\u201d as defined in the Virginia Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\">c. The trial court[\u2019]s refusal to remit as to MMC violates the mandate of Va. Code \u00a7 8.01-581.15.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">\n<em>Agency.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">The defendants argue that there was a conflict in the evidence concerning the agency question and, therefore, that the question should have been submitted to the jury for decision. The defendants\u2019 position is stated succinctly in their reply brief, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-12\">Dr. Schwartz and MMC maintained [that] Dr. Schwartz was not acting as MMC\u2019s agent at the time he rendered services to Brownlee. . . . There was admittedly significant evidence to the contrary. This issue should have been submitted to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">However, while there may have been a conflict in the <em>positions </em>taken by the parties with respect to the agency question, there was no conflict in the <em>facts </em>with respect to that question. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u201c[t]here is no substantial conflict in the facts and circumstances disclosed by the evidence,\u201d it becomes \u201ca question of law to be decided by the court whether [one party] was the agent of [another].\u201d <em>Creech </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bonding Co., </em>160 Va. 567, 576, 169 S.E. 545, 548 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Here, the following facts were undisputed. Dr. Schwartz was MMC\u2019s president and sole shareholder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> MMC leased from landlords and paid the rent on and otherwise managed the three offices Dr. Schwartz occupied in his medical practice. MMC billed Dr. Schwartz\u2019s patients for services rendered and collected his fees for those services. All the income Dr. Schwartz earned from his medical practice was assigned to MMC. The only income Dr. Schwartz received was in the form of rent paid to him by MMC for one of the offices he occupied in his practice. MMC paid all the expenses of Dr. Schwartz\u2019s practice, including the cost of advertisements \u201cdesigned to solicit patients for [his] medical practice\u201d as well as the cost of his medical supplies, automobile, legal work, licensing, continuing education, and membership in professional associations. MMC deducted all these expenses on its tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The defendants cite <em>Hadeed </em>v. <em>Medic-24, Ltd., </em>237 Va. 277, 288, 377 S.E.2d 589, 594-95 (1989), for the proposition that in the context of medical malpractice, the crucial factor for determining whether a physician is the agent of another is the power of control. The defendants then argue that MMC did not control Dr. Schwartz, he controlled MMC. Therefore, the defendants conclude, it was for the jury to say whether Dr. Schwartz was the agent of MMC, acting within the scope of the agency at the time he rendered post-operative treatment to Brownlee.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">We disagree with the defendants. As the defendants themselves point out, it is the <em>power </em>of control that is crucial to the determination whether an agency relationship existed between Dr. Schwartz and MMC. The evidence shows that the extensive authority Dr. Schwartz indisputably granted to MMC over his affairs, including MMC\u2019s dominion over the purse strings, clearly vested MMC with the power of control sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding, as a matter of law, that an agency relationship did exist between Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Schwartz and MMC at the time Dr. Schwartz rendered post-operative treatment to Brownlee. Hence, the trial court did not err in its finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\n<em>Remittitur.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The defendants argue that the trial court erred in refusing to order a remittitur of the verdict against MMC to $1 million, the medical malpractice cap established by Code \u00a7 8.01-581.15. That Code section reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">In any verdict returned against a health care provider in an action for malpractice where the act or acts of malpractice occurred on or after October 1, 1983, which is tried by a jury or in any judgment entered against a health care provider in such an action which is tried without a jury, the total amount recoverable for any injury to, or death of, a patient shall not exceed one million dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">In interpreting this section, the definitions found in \u00a7 8.01-581.1 shall be applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Code \u00a7 8.01-581.1 defines the term \u201chealth care provider\u201d in pertinent part as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">a person, corporation, facility or institution licensed by this Commonwealth to provide health care or professional services as a physician or hospital, dentist, pharmacist, registered or licensed practical nurse, optometrist, podiatrist, chiropractor, physical therapist, physical therapy assistant, clinical psychologist, [or a] health maintenance organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">The defendants concede that MMC \u201cdid not fall within the definition of health care provider in \u00a7 8.01-581.1 effective at the time of Brownlee\u2019s injury.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the defendants say, \u201cbecause MMC was jointly and severally liable with Dr. Schwartz, a health care provider subject to protection of The Cap, for a single and indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>visible injury, . . . Brownlee\u2019s total recovery against all defendants is limited to what he is allowed to recover against Dr. Schwartz.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Quoting <em>Bulala </em>v. <em>Boyd, 239 </em>Va. 218, 389 S.E.2d 670 (1990), the defendants say that \u201c \u2018a single limit . . . applie[s] to an indivisible injury to a plaintiff, even though it was caused by the concurring negligence of two or more defendants.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228, 389 S.E.2d at 675. However, unlike the present situation, where one defendant is a health care provider and the other is not, both the defendants in <em>Bulala </em>were health care providers. Therefore, <em>B\u00falala </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Further, quoting <em>Fairfax Hospital System </em>v. <em>Nevitt, </em>249 Va. 591, 457 S.E.2d 10 (1995), which involved joint tortfeasors, the defendants state that \u201c \u2018in any judgment entered against a health care provider, the quantum of the recovery for a medical malpractice injury cannot exceed the aggregate amount capable of recovery.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598, 457 S.E.2d at 14. The defendants also quote from <em>Nevitt </em>to the effect that it is \u201c \u2018wholly immaterial\u2019 \u201d that one of the tortfeasors was not a health care provider. <em>Id. </em>However, <em>Nevitt </em>presented a different issue. That case involved the interplay between Code \u00a7 8.01-581.15, which contains the medical malpractice cap, and Code \u00a7 8.01-35.1, which provides that the amount recovered against one tortfeasor shall be reduced by the amount paid in settlement by another tortfeasor. The issue in <em>Nevitt </em>was whether the amount paid in settlement by one tortfeasor should be deducted before or after the medical malpractice cap was applied to an excessive verdict against the other tortfeasor. It was in this context, differing substantially from the present situation, that we said it was \u201cwholly immaterial\u201d that the settling tortfeasor was not a health care provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The most analogous case is <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Mobil Corp., </em>248 Va. 101, 444 S.E.2d 705 (1994). There, the negligent physician had allowed his license to lapse. Yet, he and his employer, a non-health care provider, both claimed entitlement to the protection of the medical malpractice cap from a $4 million verdict returned against them. The trial court ordered a remittitur of the verdict to $1 million with respect to both defendants. We said that \u201c[sjince [the physician] was not licensed in the Commonwealth when he rendered the services to [the patient], he was not a health care provider within the purview of the statute,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 109, 444 S.E.2d at 709, and we held that \u201cthe trial court erred in its application of the medical malpractice cap to the verdict,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 110, 444 S.E.2d at 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\"><em>Taylor </em>is clear authority for the proposition that one who is unlicensed as a health care provider in this Commonwealth, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>principal or agent, is not entitled to the protection of the medical malpractice cap. MMC was not licensed as a health care provider in this Commonwealth. Hence, it is not entitled to the protection of the cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The defendants argue, however, that \u201cthe only theory on which MMC could conceivably have been held liable for any injury to Brownlee is upon the derivative liability arising from the <em>respondeat superior </em>doctrine.\u201d Under the common law, the defendants continue, the amount of a judgment against a principal cannot be greater than the amount of the judgment against the agent tortfeasor. Hence, the defendants conclude, the trial court erred in refusing to order a remittitur of the verdict against MMC to $1 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">We have no quarrel with the defendants\u2019 argument that, at common law, the liabilities of principals and agents are coterminous. That view has been recognized in Virginia. In <em>Monumental Motor Tours </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>184 Va. 311, 35 S.E.2d 105 (1945), we said that when a master and servant are sued together and the master\u2019s liability rests solely upon the servant\u2019s negligence, \u201ca verdict which in terms finds for the servant and against the master or is silent as to the servant and finds against the master, is . . . predicated upon a misapprehension of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314-15, 35 S.E.2d at 106 (quoting <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Ashworth, </em>154 Va. 218, 229, 153 S.E. 711, 713 (1930)).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The common law continues in full force in Virginia except as altered by the General Assembly. Code \u00a7 1-10. The General Assembly may abrogate the common law, but its intent to do so must be plainly manifested. <em>Wackwitz v. Roy, </em>244 Va. 60, 65, 418 S.E.2d 861, 864 (1992). \u201cStatutes in derogation of the common law are to be strictly construed and not to be enlarged in their operation by construction beyond their express terms.\u201d <em>Blake Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Alley, </em>233 Va. 31, 34, 353 S.E.2d 724, 726 (1987) (quoting C. <em>&amp; O. Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Kinzer, </em>206 Va. 175, 181, 142 S.E.2d 514, 518 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">We are of opinion that in the enactment of Code \u00a7 8.01-581.15, the General Assembly has abrogated the common law and that its intent to do so is plainly manifested. By making the medical malpractice cap applicable only to licensed health care providers and denying the protection of the cap to non-health care providers, the General Assembly has provided in medical malpractice cases an exception to the rule that the liabilities of principals and agents are coterminous.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>In the medical malpractice context, the exception is a rule of reason. The General Assembly enacted the medical malpractice cap for the purpose of enabling licensed health care providers to secure medical malpractice insurance at affordable rates. <em>See Etheridge </em>v. <em>Medical Center Hospitals, </em>237 Va. 87, 93-94, 376 S.E.2d 525, 527-28 (1989). It would not serve that purpose to extend the protection of the cap to non-health care providers, and we will not ascribe to the General Assembly an intent to make such an extension. Rather, as indicated <em>supra, </em>we think it was the legislative intent, clearly manifested, to except such non-health care providers from the protection of the cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">For the reasons assigned, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-11\"> Both sides to this controversy recognize that a small percentage of prostatic surgery patients may suffer total incontinence despite the absence of negligence on the part of the physician in performing the surgery. Brownlee claims here, however, that his total incontinence resulted from the post-operative negligence of Dr. Schwartz and not as an incident of the surgery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\"> MMC is an S corporation chartered in Delaware. \u201cAn S corporation is a small business corporation for which an election under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code ... is in effect I.R.C. \u00a7 136(a)(1).\u201d <em>Durando </em>v. <em>United States, </em>70 F.3d 548, 549 n.2 (9th Cir. 1995).
