Because we agree with the district court that the county commissioner\u2019s decision is executive, we affirm that court\u2019s decision to dismiss the landowners\u2019 complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-12\">Earle B. Lewis, Button Lewis, and Terry Lewis jointly own 272 acres of land in unincorporated Bartow County, Georgia. When they purchased the land it was zoned by Bartow County as agricultural.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-13\">The Lewises filed an application with Bartow County to re-zone the 272 acres as residential. They wanted to develop the property as single family homes, which was consistent with the County\u2019s land-use plan but not with the existing zoning of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-15\">Clarence Brown, as the sole member of the Bartow County Commission, denied the Lewises\u2019 request to re-zone the property. The Lewises allege that this decision was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and \u201cdoes not bear a substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare, and is therefore an invalid exercise of the police power.\u201d (R.l:4:3-4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-16\">The Lewises filed this lawsuit seeking an injunction against Brown \u201cdirecting [him] to re[-]zone the Property in a constitutional manner consistent with the Bar-tow County land use plan.\u201d (R.l:4:4). The district court granted Brown\u2019s motion to dismiss the suit for failure to state a claim. The Lewises appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-18\">The Lewises contend here, as they did before the district court, that Brown violated their substantive due process right to be free from arbitrary, capricious, and irrational legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-19\">\u201cThe substantive component of the Due Process Clause protects those rights that are \u2018fundamental,\u2019 that is, rights that are \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u2019 \u201d <em>McKinney v. Pate, </em>20 F.3d 1550, 1556 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc) (quoting <em>Palko v. Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 325, 58 S.Ct. 149, 152, 82 L.Ed. 288 (1937)). The Supreme Court \u201c \u2018has always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this uncharted area are scarce and open-ended.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Collins v. City of Marker Heights, </em>503 U.S. 115, 125, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 1068, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-20\">In particular, \u201careas in which substantive rights are created only by state law (as is the case with tort law and em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>ployment law) are not subject to substantive due process protection under the Due Process Clause because \u2018substantive due process rights are created only by - the Constitution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, </em>474 U.S. 214, 229, 106 S.Ct. 507, 515, 88 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985) (Powell, J., concurring)). The list of state-created rights is not limited to tort and employment law, and has been held by this Court to include land-use rights like the zoning restrictions at issue here. <em>See Greenbriar Village, L.L.C. v. Mountain Brook, City, </em>345 F.3d 1258, 1262 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201c \u2018Property interests are not created by the Constitution. Rather they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2709, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972))).</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">To this general rule that \u201careas in which substantive rights are created only by state law are not subject to substantive due process protection,\u201d there is an exception which the Lewises contend applies to them: Where an individual\u2019s state-created rights are infringed by \u201clegislative act,\u201d the substantive component of the Due Process Clause generally protects him from arbitrary and irrational action by the government. <em>See McKinney, </em>20 F.3d at 1557 n. 9. The legislative nature of the act is key. \u201c[N]on-legislative,\u201d or executive, \u201cdeprivations of state-created rights, which would include land-use rights, cannot support a substantive due process claim, not even if the plaintiff alleges that the government acted arbitrarily and irrationally. Constitutional due process is satisfied for these deprivations when proper procedures are employed.\u201d <em>Greenbriar Village, L.L.C., </em>345 F.3d at 1263 (citing <em>McKinney, </em>20 F.3d at 1559). Thus, this case turns on whether Brown\u2019s decision was a legislative act or an executive act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-6\">While the actions of some government officials can easily be categorized as legislative or executive, for others, like county commissioners who act in both a legislative and executive capacity, sorting out which hat they were wearing when they made a decision can be difficult. In <em>McKinney, </em>we established a test, culled from prior Supreme Court precedents, to help distinguish executive from legislation acts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-7\">Executive acts characteristically apply to a limited numbers of persons (and often to only one person); executive acts typically arise from the ministerial or administrative activities of members of the executive branch. The most common examples are employment terminations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-8\">Legislative acts, on the other hand, generally apply to larger segments of\u2014 if not all of \u2014 society; laws and broad-ranging executive regulations are the most common examples.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1307-9\"><em>McKinney, </em>20 F.3d at 1557 n. 9 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-10\">Applying the <em>McKinney </em>test, Brown\u2019s decision affects only a limited class of persons, namely, the Lewises. The decision to deny the Lewises\u2019 application to re-zone their property does not \u201cgenerally apply to larger segments of \u2014 if not all of \u2014 society.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Rather, it was an administrative decision by Brown to enforce the current property designation to the economic detriment of the Lewises. This is a textbook \u201cexecutive act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-11\">We are unpersuaded by the Lewises\u2019 contention that we should ignore our precedent and find that county zoning decisions are legislative acts because the Georgia courts characterize such decisions as legislative acts. They offer no precedent for the conclusion that we should defer to the <em>state </em>court characterization of \u00e1 government act as executive or legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>where such characterization is dispositive of a party\u2019s substantive due process rights under the <em>federal </em>Constitution. And, in fact, <em>McKinney, </em>and its progeny, suggest otherwise; that is, it is the duty of federal courts to independently determine whether a government act is executive or legislative for the purposes of applying substantive due process principles. <em>Cf id. </em>(Underscoring that, for federal courts to determine whether a plaintiff is entitled to substantive due process protection, \u201cit is crucial to note the distinction between legislative acts and non-legislative or executive acts.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">While state law may inform our independent inquiry, it is not determinative of it. In situations like the Lewises\u2019, we have explicitly held, for the purposes of substantive due process analysis, \u201cthat enforcement of existing zoning regulations is an executive, not legislative act .... Acts of zoning enforcement rather than rulemak-ing are not legislative.\u201d <em>DeKalb Stone, Inc. v. County of DeKalb, Ga., </em>106 F.3d 956, 959 (11th Cir.1997) (quotation omitted); <em>see also Greenbriar Village, L.L.C., </em>345 F.3d at 1262-63 (\u201c[N]on-legislative deprivations of state-created rights, which would include land-use rights, cannot support a substantive due process claim .... \u201d); <em>Crymes v. DeKalb County, </em>923 F.2d 1482, 1485 (11th Cir.1991) (\u201cActs of zoning enforcement rather than rulemak-ing are not legislative.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-8\">Because Brown\u2019s decision was executive, not legislative, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision granting Brown\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">. The Lewises cite <em>South Gwinnett Venture v. Pruitt, </em>491 F.2d 5 (5th Cir.1974) (enbanc), for the proposition that the decisions of zoning commissions are \"quasi-legislative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. This characterization by the former Fifth Circuit, however, was only meant to distinguish legislative decisions, which are \"entitled to a presumption of validity,\u201d from judicial decisions, which are reviewed by the court <em>de novo. See id. </em>It was not intended to distinguish legislative acts from executive acts for the purposes of substantive due process analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-6\">But, to the extent that <em>South Gwinnett Venture </em>can be so interpreted, the en banc Court has decided on a different approach in the more recent <em>McKinney </em>case. In <em>South Gwin-nett Venture, </em>the former Fifth Circuit classified the decisions of the county zoning commission as \"quasi-legislative\u201d because of the <em>\"functions </em>involved in ... the reclassification of a piece of property under an existing plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>McKinney, </em>we shied away from a \"functions\u201d test, and instead adopted an \"impact\u201d test \"[wjhen discussing substantive due process protection.\u201d 20 F.3d at 1557 n. 9. The crucial distinction between executive acts and legislative acts, we said in <em>McKinney, </em>was the impact an act of the government had on the public. If the act applied \"to a limited number of persons,\u201d then it is an executive decision; if it \"generally appl[ies] to a larger segment of \u2014 if not all of \u2014 society,\u201d then it is legislative decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ajp\">Applying the <em>McKinney </em>impact test here, as we have already done above, Brown's decision on behalf of Bartow County impacted only three people \u2014 the owners of the 272 acres \u2014 and therefore is executive in nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
