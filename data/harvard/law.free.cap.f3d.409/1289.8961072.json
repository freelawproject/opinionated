We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-14\">Mathenia pleaded guilty. He admitted in his plea agreement to knowingly possessing and distributing over 25,000 images of child pornography, including those that depicted \u201cthe molestation, penetration, and rape of infants.\u201d (R.1:18:3). At sentencing, the district court imposed a base offense level of seventeen for \u201ctrafficking in material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(a). The court then enhanced Mathenia\u2019s offense level by fifteen for trafficking in materials involving minors under twelve, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l), for distributing child pornography through peer-to-peer file sharing groups, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2)(E), for distributing images that depict the sadomasochistic abuse of minors, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3), for using a computer to receive the images, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5), and for trafficking in more than 600 images, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(6)(D). Finally, the court reduced Mathenia\u2019s offense level by three for accepting responsibility for his crimes. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3El.l(a), (b). When totaled, Mathenia had an offense level of twenty-nine and a criminal history category of I, resulting in a guidelines range of 87 months to 108 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-15\">Mathenia filed a written objection, and made an oral objection at his sentencing hearing, that the application of the sentencing guidelines to his case violated the Sixth Amendment as interpreted by <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The district court overruled his <em>Blakely </em>objection, noting that this Court had held in <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number><em>States v. Reese, </em>382 F.3d 1308 (11th Cir.2004), <em>vacated by </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1089, 160 L.Ed.2d 1058 (2005), that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely </em>did not apply to the federal sentencing guidelines. The court then sentenced Mathenia to 96 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-7\">The district court ended the sentencing hearing by stating that it was mindful that the Supreme Court had granted certiorari in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>375 F.3d 508 (7th Cir.2004), and <em>United States v. Fanfan, </em>No. 03-47, 2004 WL 1723114 (D.Me. June 28, 2004), and would hear oral argument in those cases a few days after Mathenia\u2019s sentencing hearing. Given this development, and in a fit of extrasensory perception, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-8\">I should also note that, if the Supreme Court affirms the decision in <em>Booker </em>and holds that, under <em>Blakely, </em>the United States Sentencing Guidelines are unconstitutional, then I would nonetheless consider the guidelines as \u2014 for their persuasive value or as advisory, and the sentence I would impose would be the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1325-9\">(R.4:19).</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-10\">About four months later, the Supreme Court rendered its decision in <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan. </em>In the resulting opinions, the Supreme Court held \u201cthat the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where <em>under a mandatory guidelines system </em>a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 749-56, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)). We have found, based on this holding, that the district courts could have made both a constitutional and a statutory error in sentencing defendants <em>pre-Booker. </em>\u201c\u2018The constitutional error is the use of extra-verdict enhancements to reach a guidelines result that is binding on the sentencing judge; the error is in the mandatory nature of the guidelines once the guidelines range has been determined.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1331 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1300). The statutory error occurs when the district court sentences a defendant \u201cunder a mandatory [guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330-31. This case, like <em>Shelton, </em>concerns <em>Booker </em>statutory error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-14\">Mathenia properly preserved his <em>Booker </em>error claim. <em>See United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1245 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>406 F.3d 1261, 1262-63, 2005 WL 895174, *1 (11th Cir.2005) (Carnes, J., concurring in the denial of rehearing en banc). In his written objection to the presentence investigation report, Mathenia wrote: \u201cDefendant, Phillip Wayne Mathenia, moves this Court to find the United States Sentencing Guidelines violate the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution on the basis of the decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington.\u201d </em>(R.1:24:1). Then, at the sentencing hearing, Mathenia reminded the court of his <em>Blakely </em>objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-15\">Where there is a timely objection, we review the defendant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim in order to determine whether the error was harmless. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1331 n. 7; <em>see also United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948-49 (11th Cir.2005). There are two harmless error standards. One of them applies to <em>Booker </em>constitutional errors, the other to <em>Booker </em>statutory errors. In <em>Paz, </em>a <em>Booker </em>constitutional error case, 405 F.3d at 947, we explained that constitutional errors are harmless where the government can show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s ultimate sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>tence, <em>id. </em>at 948^49. <em>Booker </em>statutory errors, on the other hand, are subject to the less demanding test that is applicable to non-constitutional errors. <em>See United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 2005 WL 1083487 (11th Cir. May 10, 2005). A \u201cnon-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the [sentence], \u2018or had but very slight effect.\u2019 If one can say \u2018with fair assurance ... that the [sentence] was not substantially swayed by the error,\u2019 the [sentence] is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>United States v. Hornaday, </em>392 F.3d 1306, 1315-16 (11th Cir.2004) (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 762, 763, 66 S.Ct 1239, 1246, 1248, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)). Because this is a <em>Booker </em>statutory <em>error case </em>we will apply that standard, instead of the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d test, in determining whether the government has shown that the error is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">The non-constitutional harmless error standard is not easy for the government to meet. It is as difficult for the government to meet that standard as it is for a defendant to meet the third-prong prejudice standard for plain error review. <em>See, e.g., Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948-49; <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>405 F.3d 1260, 1275-76, 2005 WL 845532, *12 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cf. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1331-32 (\u201c[T]he plain error test is difficult to meet, and in particular, the burden of showing prejudice to meet the third-prong requirement is anything but easy.\u201d (quotations omitted)). The reason for that parity of difficulty is that the standard is the same in those two situations; the difference is the party that has the burden. <em>United States v. Olgno, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1778, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-5\">There are cases where the government was able to demonstrate that the statutory error of applying the guidelines in a mandatory fashion did not have an affect on the sentence the defendant received. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Marcussen, </em>403 F.3d 982 (8th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>403 F.3d 533 (8th Cir.2005). In fact, in <em>Robles, </em>a <em>Booker </em>constitutional error case, this Court affirmed a defendant\u2019s sentence under the more stringent \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d harmless error standard. There, the district court enhanced Robles\u2019s sentence because it found by a preponderance of the evidence that he had the equivalent of 52 kilograms of marijuana as relevant conduct. In rejecting Robles\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>objection, the district court said that: \u201c[M]y sentence would be the same regardless of whether <em>Blakely </em>had invalidated the guidelines or not, because I would apply them as guidelines and reach the same conclusion that I will here today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-7\">The district court made a materially indistinguishable comment here. In the course of rejecting Mathenia\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>objection and sentencing him to 96 months in prison, the district court said that if the Supreme Court in <em>Booker </em>held that the guidelines were unconstitutional as mandatorily applied, \u201cI would nonetheless consider the guidelines as \u2014 for their persuasive value or as advisory, and the sentence I would impose would be the same.\u201d (R.4:19). We know because the sentencing judge told us that whether the guidelines were mandatory as they were <em>pre-Booker, </em>or advisory as they are post <em>-Booker, </em>Mathenia\u2019s sentence would be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-8\">Given that the government met the more difficult constitutional harmless error standard in <em>Robles, </em>we have no trouble concluding that the government has met the less stringent statutory harmless error standard in this case where the judge made comments virtually identical to those in <em>Robles. </em>Thus, the government has demonstrated with fair assurance that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>district court\u2019s error of applying the guidelines in a mandatory fashion did not affect, or had but a slight affect, on Mathenia\u2019s ultimate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
