Gallegos-Aguero argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by imposing a 16-level increase in his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> based on the fact of his prior conviction for \u201can alien smuggling offense\u201d which was neither admitted by him nor proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Gallegos-Aguero argues that <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) has cast doubt on the continued validity of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Gallegos-Aguero also argues that his case is distinguishable from <em>Almendarez-Tor-res, </em>because he never stipulated to the characterization of his prior offense as a qualifying offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii) and because he objected to the court\u2019s use of the preponderance of the evidence standard to find the existence of that aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-14\">Because Gallegos-Aguero objected to the enhancements to his sentence in the district court, we review his sentence <em>de novo. United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). We will reverse the district court only if the error was harmful. <em>Id. </em>We find that the district court\u2019s use of prior convictions to enhance Gallegos-Aguero\u2019s sentence did not violate the Sixth Amendment. Subsequent to the filing of the briefs in this case, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), in which it held that <em>Blakely </em>applies to the federal Sentencing Guidelines and reaffirmed its <em>Apprendi </em>holding that, \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Post-<em>Booker, </em>this Court has reaffirmed that there is no Sixth Amendment violation when a district court enhances a sentence based on prior convictions, including those specified in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number><em>States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 961 (11th Cir.2005). Similarly, we find no merit in Gallegos-Aguero\u2019s argument that the Sixth Amendment requires that a jury, not a judge, must determine whether his prior conviction is within the category of offenses specified in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii). <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1262-63, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-7\">However, because Gallegos-Aguero was sentenced under the <em>pre-Booker </em>mandatory sentencing scheme, there is error in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s remedial holding in <em>Booker. See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1300 (11th Cir.2005). The use of the guidelines as mandatory was error, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment violation. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005). Because Gallegos-Aguero preserved his <em>Blakely/Booker </em>claim at sentencing, we review for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-8\">Non-constitutional error is harmless when it does not affect the substantial rights of the parties. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111; <em>United States v. Guzman, </em>167 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.1999). Under this standard, we must reverse \u201conly if [the error] resulted in actual prejudice because it had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the [result].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). The burden is on the government to show that the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-9\">Having carefully reviewed the presentence investigation report and the transcript of Gallegos-Aguero\u2019s sentencing hearing, we find that the district court\u2019s use of the guidelines as mandatory constituted harmless error. The district court judge sentenced Gallegos-Aguero to the highest sentence available under the applicable guideline range, and considered sentencing Gallegos-Aguero to 20 years, the maximum allowable under the statute of conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We thus find that the use of the mandatory guideline scheme resulted in no actual prejudice to Gallegos-Aguero. Therefore, his <em>Blakely/Booker </em>challenge must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1310-9\">. The presentence report cites the 16-level enhancement as one under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vi), which governs enhancement for a prior \u201chuman trafficking offense.\u201d Because the PSI describes Gallegos-Aguero\u2019s prior conviction as an \"alien smuggling offense,\u201d we presume the reference to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vi) is a typographical error, and will treat the enhancement as having been made under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii). This distinction is irrelevant to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-11\">Compounding the confusion, however, Gallegos-Aguero's brief repeatedly states his complaint as directed towards what he identifies as a 16-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), which he claims was applied based on the characterization of his prior conviction as an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d In reality, \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) provides for enhancement for a \"crime of violence\u201d and does not appear to have been applied here. We therefore construe Gallegos-Aguero\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>argument as being directed to the 16-level enhancement based upon his prior conviction for an alien smuggling offense, pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii), as that is the only cognizable target for his objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AmxY\">. We do not consider whether the district court judge would actually have had the authority to impose such a sentence. We note his comments only because they provide an indication as to whether Gallegos-Aguero might have received a lower sentence had the judge been working with the greater discretion of the advisory scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
