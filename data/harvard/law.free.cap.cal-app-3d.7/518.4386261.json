On March 7, 1969, defendant filed notice of motion to vacate default and default judgment. Plaintiff appeals from order granting the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">The following background was presented to the trial court by way of supporting declarations of defendant and his counsel, Mr. Hansen. Plaintiff was incorporated in 1966; defendant was a director and secretary-treasurer and owned 50 percent of the stock, D\u2019Anfrasio owned the other 50 percent; the board of directors consisted of defendant, D\u2019Anfrasio and Terrence W. Cooney, attorney for plaintiff who kept all records and upon whom the parties relied for advice. Differences arose between defendant and D\u2019Anfrasio and in April 1968 they met informally in Mr. Cooney\u2019s office where D\u2019Anfrasio orally agreed to buy defendant\u2019s stock in plaintiff corporation and Mr. Cooney was to prepare the papers; the papers were never prepared, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>the agreement never reduced to writing and D\u2019Anfrasio never complied, thus defendant continued to act as secretary-treasurer, countersigning all corporate checks. In August 1968 defendant consulted his lawyer, Mr. Hansen, about the corporate affairs and on August 28, Mr. Hansen wrote Mr. Cooney requesting certain corporate information, including the status of stock issued, copies of bylaws and corporate minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">On September 3, 1968, defendant was served with copy of summons and complaint which bore no date, case number or other confirmation showing an action had been filed, and appeared to be a copy of an unfiled lawsuit (attached to defendant\u2019s declaration is copy of unnumbered, undated summons served on him [Exh. A]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, in the light of his differences with D\u2019Anfrasio and the fact that he had received no notice of any board meeting at which the filing of a lawsuit was discussed and knew of no corporate action authorizing the same, defendant believed that no lawsuit had actually been filed and that the papers were served on him solely as a threat to force him to agree to less favorable terms for the sale to D\u2019Anfrasio of his interest in plaintiff corporation. He immediately advised Mr. Hansen who explained to him that there was no necessity for filing an answer to an unfiled lawsuit. During this time Mr. Hansen had several telephone conversations with Mr. Cooney and a letter from him dated September 9, 1968, but at no time did Mr. Cooney make any reference to a lawsuit. Thus, based upon his knowledge of defendant\u2019s differences with D\u2019Anfrasio, the fact that the papers served on defendant appeared to be copies of an unfiled lawsuit, the absence of corporate action for authority to file an action and Mr. Cooney\u2019s silence concerning the same knowing he represented defendant, Mr. Hansen did not believe any lawsuit had in fact been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">It was not until the end of October<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or early November 1968 when his bank account was levied upon that defendant learned of the lawsuit and advised Mr. Hansen who immediately contacted Mr. Cooney, informed him of the purported service and suggested that they attempt a settlement of the ownership of plaintiff corporation; Mr. Cooney agreed. To that end the principals met in Mr. Cooney\u2019s office on December 6, 1968, but after subsequent telephone conversations, it became evident that settlement negotiations had failed. Mr. Cooney, who had not furnished the corporate books requested in August, finally made them available to Mr. Hansen for inspection around the middle of December 1968; they disclosed one board meeting on October 11, 1966, but no others except a purported meeting not noticed and attended only by Mr. Cooney and D\u2019Anfrasio on April 11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>1968, at which, on the assertion that defendant \u201cdeclined\u201d to perform his duties as secretary-treasurer, Mr. Cooney was purportedly elected as secretary and the president purportedly authorized to sign all checks alone. The facts of this purported meeting and its outcome were withheld from defendant and no notification was ever given to him of his alleged removal; defendant continued to sign the corporate checks. The foregoing was largely uncontroverted by the brief affidavit of Mr. Cooney.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">A motion for relief from default under section 473, Code of Civil Procedure, is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling thereon will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a clear showing of abuse of discretion. <em>(Weitz </em>v. <em>Yankosky, </em>63 Cal.2d 849, 854 [48 Cal.Rptr. 620, 409 P.2d 700]; <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>55 Cal.2d 622, 625 [12 Cal.Rptr. 668, 361 P.2d 244]; <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>16 Cal.2d 645, 647 [107 P.2d 385]; <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>11 Cal.2d 566, 567 [81 P.2d 566].) It is well settled that appellate courts have always been and are favorably disposed toward orders excusing defaults and permitting coiitroversies to be adjudicated upon their merits. Such orders are rarely reversed and neVer unless it clearly appears that there has been a plain abuse of discretion. <em>(Lynch </em>v. <em>Spilman, 67 </em>Cal.2d 251, 257-258 [62 Cal.Rptr. 12, 431 P.2d 636]; <em>Weitz </em>v. <em>Yankosky, </em>63 Cal.2d 849, 854-855 [48 Cal.Rptr. 620, 409 P.2d 700]; <em>Benjamin </em>v. <em>Dalmo Mfg. Co., </em>31 Cal.2d 523, 525 [190 P.2d 593].)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The issues before the trial court were whether defendant\u2019s neglect to file an answer within the statutory time was excusable <em>(Weitz </em>v. <em>Yankosky, </em>63 Cal.2d 849, 855 [48 Cal.Rptr. 620, 409 P.2d 700]), he had a meritorious defense <em>(Lynch </em>v. <em>Spilman, 61 </em>Cal.2d 251, 259 [62 Cal.Rptr. 12, 431 P.2d 636]) and he acted seasonably to set aside default after discovering it had been entered <em>(Benjamin </em>v. <em>Dalmo Mfg. Co., </em>31 Cal.2d 523, 528 [190 P.2d 593]).  Since the issues raised by defendant\u2019s motion were tried on affidavits, we are \u201c \u2018bound by the same rule as where oral testimony is presented for review.\u2019 [Citations.] When an issue is tried on affidavits, the rule on appeal is that those affidavits favoring the contention of the prevailing party establish not only the facts stated therein but also all facts which reasonably may be inferred therefrom, and where there is a substantial conflict in the facts stated, a determination of the controverted facts by the trial court will not be disturbed.\u201d <em>(Griffith Co. </em>v. <em>San Diego College for Women, </em>45 Cal.2d 501, 508 [289 P.2d 476, 47 A.L.R.2d 1349]; <em>Luz </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>55 Cal.2d 54, 62 [10 Cal.Rptr. 161, 358 P.2d 289]; <em>Beckett </em>v. <em>Kaynar Mfg. Co., Inc., 49 </em>Cal.2d 695, 699 [321 P.2d 749].) The rule is applied to orders made on motions for relief from default under section 473, Code of Civil Procedure. <em>(Lynch </em>v. <em>Spilman, 61 </em>Cal.2d 251, 259 [62 Cal.Rptr. 12, 431 P.2d 636].)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>In granting the motion the trial court necessarily concluded that default had been taken against defendant through his \u201cinadvertence and excusable neglect\u201d; inherent in this conclusion is the factual finding either that defendant was served one day (September 3, 1968<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) before the summons was in fact issued (September 4, 1968) or that he was served on September 4, 1968, with copy of summons and complaint not conformed to the original. It is undisputed that the copy served on defendant bore neither stamp, date nor other confirmation that a suit had actually been filed. Whether the conduct of Mr. Cooney in either situation amounted to the \u201cmisconduct, concealment and deceit\u201d charged by respondent, at the very least it reflects carelessness on his part. If, as Mr. Cooney declares, in his experience as a lawyer his clients on \u201cnumerous occasions\u201d have been served with unnumbered and undated copies of summons and complaint, it is a \u201cpractice\u201d condemned and any lawyer who engages therein stultifies his conscience by swearing under oath that defendant was \u201cregularly served with process\u201d knowing that the same was not a conformed copy. Further, there is no denial that during discussions and correspondence with Mr. Hansen subsequent to September 3, 1968, even though he knew Mr. Hansen represented defendant, Mr. Cooney failed to mention the existence of the lawsuit or his intention to take a default. As said in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Bookbinders Union, </em>133 Cal.App.2d 486, 500 [284 P.2d 194], \u201cThe quiet speed of plaintiffs\u2019 attorney in seeking a default judgment without the knowledge of defendants\u2019 counsel is not to be commended.\u201d <em>(Lynch </em>v. <em>Betts, </em>198 Cal.App.2d 755, 758 [18 Cal.Rptr. 345].)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Appellant claims that four and one-half months elapsed after entry of judgment before defendant filed the notice of motion and he failed to sustain his burden of showing due diligence.  The application for relief \u201cmust be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after such judgment, order or proceeding was taken\u201d (\u00a7 473, Code Civ. Proc.), and the moving party has the burden of showing not only an excuse for his default but diligence in making the motion after discovery of the default. <em>(Benjamin </em>v. <em>Dalmo Mfg. Co., </em>31 Cal.2d 523, 528-529 [190 P.2d 593].) Thus, under section 473 what constitutes \u201ca reasonable time\u201d presents a question of fact for determination of the trial court unless circumstances are such as to demonstrate unreasonable delay as a matter of law. <em>(Baxter v. Prescott, </em>158 Cal.App.2d 531, 534 [322 P.2d 1008].)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In <em>Benjamin </em>v. <em>Dalmo Mfg. Co., </em>31 Cal.2d 523 [190 P.2d 593], relied on by appellant, in which there was a delay of three and one-half <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>months, \u201cdefendant furnished no explanation in the trial court, either by affidavit or testimony, for its dilatory procedure.\u201d (P. 528.) Here the defendant\u2019s declarations offer sufficient explanation to support the implied finding of diligence. Mr. Cooney conceded that there were settlement negotiations but limited the same to \u201cthe latter part of October 1968 and about the first of November 1968\u201d and asserted that he \u201crepeatedly told [Mr. Hansen] that he would have to move to vacate the default and the judgment and that [their] discussions should in no way delay him in filing such motion.\u201d However, Mr. Hansen\u2019s declaration, which under the appellate rule of <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>San Diego College for Women, </em>45 Cal.2d 501, 508 [289 P.2d 476, 47 A.L.R.2d 1349], establishes the facts herein, reveals that defendant discovered the default around the first of November after which settlement negotiations continued until approximately the middle of December when Mr. Cooney produced the records for his inspection. The pendency of negotiations for settlement were deemed significant in <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>16 Cal.2d 645, 647 [107 P.2d 385]; <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>158 Cal.App.2d 531, 533 [322 P.2d 1008]; and <em>Dahlin </em>v. <em>Moon, </em>141 Cal.App.2d 1, 5 [296 P.2d 344]. Deferring to the immediate subsequent holidays, we compute the time here from the first of January 1969, a period of two months and seven days. We cannot say under the totality of the circumstances of this case that the facts are not so unexplained and unreasonable as to bar defendant from relief. (See <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>55 Cal.2d 622, 625 [12 Cal.Rptr. 668, 361 P.2d 244] [two and one-half months\u2019 delay]; <em>Hallett </em>v. <em>Slaughter, </em>22 Cal.2d 552, 554 [140 P.2d 3] [two months\u2019 delay]; <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>271 Cal.App.2d 282, 287 [76 Cal.Rptr. 572] [two months\u2019 delay]; <em>Hammel </em>v. <em>Lindner, </em>224 Cal.App.2d 426, 429 [36 Cal.Rptr. 656] [six months\u2019 delay]; <em>Arnke </em>v. <em>Lazzari Fuel Co., </em>202 Cal.App.2d 278, 280 [20 Cal.Rptr. 762] [two months\u2019 delay].) Certainly the evidence does not demonstrate unreasonable delay as a matter of law. <em>(Baxter </em>v. <em>Prescott, 158 </em>Cal.App.2d 531, 534 [322 P.2d 1008].) There is no clear showing that there has been a plain abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Wood, P.
