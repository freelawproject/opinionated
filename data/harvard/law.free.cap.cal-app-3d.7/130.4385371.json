Code, \u00a7 34200 et seq.) Both as originally enacted,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and as later codified in Health and Safety Code section 34321, the statute provided that each housing authority formed under its provisions \u201cshall manage and operate its housing projects in an efficient manner so as to enable it to fix the rentals for dwelling accommodations at the lowest possible rates consistent with its providing decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling accommodations. . . .\u201d In the same section it is declared that \u201c[n]o housing authority shall construct or operate any such project for profit, or as a source of revenue to the city or the county.\u201d Section 34321 contains no exemption applicable to facilities acquired in one way as opposed to another (e.g., by gift, purchase or lease, whether or not implementation of any federal public housing program is involved).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">In 1955, the \u201cTemporary Housing Projects Law\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 35450) was enacted for the purpose of specifically empowering \u201c[a]ny city, county, or housing authority [to acquire through purchase or gift any federally owned temporary housing project].\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 35480.) Pursuant thereto, in 1954, the United States Government sold to the City of Pleasanton a housing development known as \u201cKottinger Village\u201d and to respondent housing authority another development known as \u201cKomandorski Village.\u201d Respondent housing authority operates both properties, Kottinger Village under lease from the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">It was determined by the pretrial conference order that the housing authority \u201chas paid to the City of Pleasanton since 1954 the sum of $347,103 as revenue received greater than expenditures incurred from the operations of the projects.\u201d Appellants contend that this past practice, and threatened future rent increases while the projects are being operated at a profit, are unlawful. It is undisputed that under Health and Safety Code section 34401 the housing authority made payments to the city, in lieu of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>taxes, for services furnished by the city. The propriety of those payments is not questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Respondent points out that the two projects in question were originally built by the United States as temporary war housing and were acquired by the city and the housing authority under the Defense Housing Act of 1950 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581 et seq.) upon terms which arguably did not impose obligations, running to the United States government, to operate the properties on a nonprofit basis. But it has not been suggested that the housing authority is under a <em>duty, </em>imposed by federal law, to operate at a profit. Accordingly no conflict with paramount federal law is presented and the housing authority\u2019s conduct regarding profit-making may be regulated by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The housing authority claims the right to operate these facilities on a profit-making basis under the provisions of Health and Safety Code section 35489<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (part of the Temporary Housing Projects Law). It is claimed by the housing authority that the provision in section 35489 requiring it to levy \u201crents which shall be <em>ample </em>to cover all costs of operation\u201d (italics added) implies an intention to authorize profit-making operations as to temporary housing. But the quoted language discloses no intention partially to repeal the explicit provisions of section 34321, which by their terms are applicable to all properties, without regard to source, which may be operated by a housing authority formed under the Housing Authorities Law.  A reasonable construction of section 35489 is that it is intended to insure that the housing authority will not operate <em>at a loss </em>property which it has received under terms of the Temporary Housing Projects Law. So construed, the provision would prevent a subsidy of such housing at the expense of general fund taxpayers. The section says nothing about profit-making; it affords no basis for finding an implied partial repeal of section 34321.  Implied repeal of one code section by another is\" not favored; such repeal should be found only when the second enactment is in irreconcilable conflict with the first. (45 Cal.Jur.2d, Statutes, \u00a7 85.)  No such conflict exists between section 34321 and section 35489. Section 34321 establishes a rent \u201cceiling\u201d applicable to all properties operated by an affected housing authority while section 35489, entirely con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>sistently, establishes a rent \u201cfloor\u201d applicable to properties acquired under the Temporary Housing Projects Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">There is no basis for distinguishing between the property owned outright by the housing authority and the property which it leases from the city. The limitation of section 34321 is explicitly stated in terms of preventing the housing authority from operating its housing projects \u201cas a source of revenue to the city. ...\u201d That limitation cannot be avoided simply by having the housing authority operate a property as lessee rather than as owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The judgment is reversed with directions to make new findings and enter judgment enjoining respondent housing authority from fixing rents higher than it may determine to be justified under the standards set forth in Health and Safety Code sections 34321 and 35489, in conformity with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Devine, P. J., and Rattigan, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Stats. Ex.
