J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agy\">Charged with murder of her brother-in-law Mehdi, defendant was found guilty after an extended jury trial. The murder was found to be of the second degree. This appeal presents no issue concerning the sufficiency of the evidence. The record discloses convincing circumstantial proof that defendant shot Mehdi, late at night on November 14, 1966, after lying in wait at his apartment. Her defense was that a gun which she had been carrying in her purse accidentally discharged when she fell after having been slapped by Mehdi. The gun had been bought for three dollars at a \u201cswap meet\u201d as a present for her father. Defendant had been told by the seller that it would not work. She had never purchased any ammunition for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">Additional facts will be set forth wherever necessary to explain defendant\u2019s contentions on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">Defendant was arrested at her home in the early morning hours of November 15. As a result of a conversation with defendant, the police obtained the name of one Edward Bisen. Eisen was interviewed and gave extremely damaging testimony at the trial. Defendant\u2019s conversation with the police, as such, was never offered in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">On November 15 defendant was again interrogated at the West Covina police station from 8:30 a.m. until about noon. During that interrogation defendant first asserted her claim of an accidental shooting; however, it differed in significant detail from her later testimony at the trial. The prosecution effectively impeached her with the statements she made on the morning of November 15. They had not been offered as part of the People\u2019s case in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">The trial court took extensive evidence on the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s statements and on the question whether there had been compliance with the mandate of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974]. No useful purpose would be served by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>setting forth the conflicting evidence offered by the parties. The court\u2019s findings and conclusions made in considerable detail, holding that defendant\u2019s statements were not obtained in violation of her constitutional rights, are amply supported by evidence. There is no question that, on the police version of the facts, defendant talked voluntarily after a knowledgeable waiver of her <em>Miranda </em>right.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">A more serious question is presented by the following events: it may be inferred from the record that some of the more damaging statements which were later used to impeach defendant were made shortly before noon on November 15. At about 9:30 a.m. Detective Corby of the West Covina police received a telephone call from the attorney who eventually became defendant\u2019s trial counsel. He identified himself by name, said that he had been asked to represent defendant and wanted to know whether he could bail her out. Corby asked Captain Ryan who told him that bail would be set at the time of defendant\u2019s arraignment which would probably take place that or the next day. This information was apparently relayed to counsel who then stated that he was in Hollywood and asked whether he would be able to see defendant if he drove to West Covina. The answer was affirmative. Counsel then stated that he \u201cmight be out that afternoon.\u201d Asked for details about the case, Corby read to counsel a press release which contained the information that the police were questioning defendant. Counsel did not ask that the interrogation cease until he had a chance to confer with his client, nor did he request that defendant be advised that he was' representing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Corby \u201cfigured\u201d and Ryan knew that defendant was being interrogated, but neither defendant nor the officers who were doing the interrogating were told that an attorney had called on behalf of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Apparently neither Ryan nor Corby knew, or knew of, the particular attorney. Corby was not at all convinced that he was actually talking to a lawyer. He suspected that the caller might, in truth, be a reporter who was trying to get more information than was being given to the press.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Counsel arrived at the West Covina station at about noon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Within a few minutes he met his client. No further statements were obtained from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">On appeal it is claimed that as soon as the police were made aware of the fact that an attorney was interesting himself in the case on behalf of defendant, they should have discontinued the interrogation, or, at least, have informed defendant of that fact. No authority is cited for these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>propositions, nor have we been able to find any. The facts are, of course, quite unlike the case on which defendant principally relies, <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U.S. 478 [12 L.Ed.2d 977, 84 S.Ct. 1758], where the arrestee\u2019s attorney personally appeared at the police station, asked to see his client\u2014 and actually did see him from a distance\u2014but was not permitted to speak to him and where the client similarly requested permission to speak to the attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">Unquestionably it would have been the more \u201csporting\u201d thing for the police to stop the interrogation after the receipt of the telephone call, but, as has been pointed out: \u201cThe investigation and detection of crime is not a game which one side must play according to the most rigorous standards of fair play, while no holds are barred for the other. To forbid the state to use evidence which has been illegally obtained is one thing, but to go further and bar evidence which is the result of conduct that is not illegal but merely does not measure up to the notions of fair play prevalent on the playing fields of Eton is quite another. . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Boulad, </em>235 Cal.App.2d 118, 126 [45 Cal.Rptr. 104].)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">To hold that under the circumstances shown the police could not go on interrogating, would be to place legitimate investigation of crime under burdens which the Constitution surely does not demand. It must be remembered that on the evidence accepted by the trial court the defendant was fully advised of all of her rights and expressly waived them. As far as the police were concerned, counsel was just a voice on the telephone. He might not have been an attorney at all. He might have been an attorney whose interest in the matter was self-induced.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He did not say exactly when he intended to appear at the police station and, of course, he made no request that any interrogation cease although he was aware that defendant was being questioned. For the police to have stopped the interrogation would have meant the cessation of legitimate investigation because of a possibility which might never materialize; for them to have informed defendant that she had an attorney would not have been warranted by information which they knew to be accurate. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">For reasons unnecessary to relate, it became relevant whether defendant, after November 14, 1966, had had possession of certain pictures which had been in Mehdi\u2019s apartment. To prove their point, the People called defendant\u2019s husband who had received the pictures in the mail some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>time after his brother\u2019s death. He testified that during his marriage with defendant he had become familiar with her handwriting. Over objection that the question called for a violation of the privilege against disclosure of confidential marital communications (Evid. Code, \u00a7 980) the husband was then permitted to testify that certain writing \u201cthat accompanied the pictures that [he] received\u201d was in defendant\u2019s handwriting. The ruling is assigned as error. The court was correct. Assuming for the sake of argument that the contents of the writing were a confidential communication,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the inquiry did not call for their disclosure. The prosecutor merely wanted to know who communicated with the witness, not what was said. \u201cIt is true that ... it is further provided in section 1881 of the Code of Civil Procedure that neither husband nor wife can, even after the termination of the marriage, be examined, without the consent of the other, as to any communication made by one to the other during the marriage. It is to be noted, however, that the point sought to be shown by the communications here in question was the act of communicating and not the nature or character of the communications themselves, the purpose of the inquiry being to show that the appellant Pusey knew the whereabouts of his wife. . . .\u201d <em>(Estate of Pusey, </em>180 Cal. 368, 373-374 [181 P. 648].) Every court that ever analyzed the problem has held that a spouse may identify the handwriting of the other spouse. The cases are collected in 10 A.L.R.2d 1389, 1404.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">During the trial Mrs. Davies, one of the jurors, had lunch with Mrs.\u2018barbara Warner, an attorney. According to Mrs. Warner\u2019s evidence presented to the court when its attention was drawn to the incident, Mrs. Davies said to Mrs. Warner \u201cthat\u2019s the lawyer and there\u2019s the woman that did the murders\u201d when counsel and defendant came into the courthouse cafeteria. Mrs. Davies denied having made the statement in question. She testified that she had simply told Mrs. Warner that she was a juror in a murder trial and had pointed to defendant as the defendant in that trial. She denied having formed an opinion concerning defendant\u2019s guilt. On this conflicting evidence the court found that Mrs. Warner \u201cprobably misunderstood\u201d what Mrs. Davies had said. It made a specific finding that Mrs. Davies\u2019 state of mind was such as to permit her to- continue as a fair and impartial juror. Defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Later during the trial Mrs. Davies was seen speaking to a Mrs. Love during the noon recess. Mrs. Love had just testified for defendant. Both counsel then stipulated that Mrs. Davies might be excused from further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>duty; an alternate juror was put into the box. It is claimed on appeal that the motion for a mistrial was erroneously denied and that the error was not cured by Mrs. Davies\u2019 later removal because the \u201cdamage was already done.\u201d The claimed damage, presumably, is that Mrs. Davies had indeed made up her mind that defendant was guilty and, in view of her demonstrated tendency to talk too much, conveyed her feelings to the other jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">We find no error in denying the motion for a mistrial. The court was entitled to accept Mrs, Davies\u2019 version concerning her conversation with Mrs. Warner and to believe that she was still unbiased. The suggestion that Mrs. Davies must have engaged in improper conversations with her fellow jurors rests entirely on speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">It is claimed that counsel was ineffective within the meaning of <em>People </em>v. <em>Ibarra, </em>60 Cal.2d 460, 464-466 [34 Cal.Rptr. 863, 386 P.2d 487], in not tendering an issue based on defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Originally defendant had pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. Two doctors were appointed to examine her, but six days later the plea of not guilty by reason of insanity was withdrawn. The record contains no further reference to any psychiatric problems until after the jury was picked and sworn, when counsel asked for the appointment of a psychiatrist at public expense. He made it clear that the psychiatrist whom he wanted appointed, was not to report to the court but to \u201cwork with the defense in this particular case.\u201d He claimed that his client was indigent. The court asked for supporting affidavits and law on the question whether it had the power to appoint a psychiatrist on the condition counsel had in mind. Nothing further was said until the defense was well into the presentation of its case. The court then reminded counsel of the previous discussion and noted that the request for the appointment of a psychiatrist had not been renewed. Counsel stated that he was fearful that the report of any psychatrist appointed by the court would have to be furnished to the prosecution. The court expressed doubt that this was the law and urged counsel \u201cto make a proper request backed with points and authorities.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>Later when the defense was almost about to rest, counsel asked for permission to put on \u201cmedical testimony\u201d after the People\u2019s rebuttal. The prosecution was agreeable. Nothing was said about financial assistance in connection with this testimony. No doctor was ever called.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-3\">After the jury returned its verdict, a probation report was ordered. When completed, it strongly suggested that defendant had very definite psychiatric problems. The report had been made available to counsel when he argued a motion for a new trial. He stated that the probation report disclosed something of which he \u201cshould have been possibly more fully aware\u201d and that a \u201cpsychiatric evaluation might have been helpful if presented to the jury in this particular case to go to the matter of intent or the diminished capacity on the matter of intent.\u201d He admitted that while the fact that defendant had emotional problems came as no surprise to him, the degree of her problems did. The court reminded counsel that he had failed to pursue his initial request for the appointment of a psychiatrist. Counsel declared that he had not followed up because, right or wrong, he had come to the conclusion that the prosecution would be entitled to a copy of any report. The court then, \u201cas a matter of fairness,\u201d did order a psychiatric examination of defendant. Doctor George Thompson was appointed. He examined defendant and, in due course, reported his finding that \u201c[a]t the time of the commission of the offense, [defendant] was suffering from a mental illness which, in the opinion of the examiner, diminished her capacity to form the intent to kill, to deliberate, to premeditate, and to harbor malice.\u201d She was, however, sane at the time oLthe examination and had been \u201cpossibly sane under the McNaughton test\u201d at the time of the offense. His diagnosis was: \u201cPsychoneurosis, anxiety state with superimposed psychoneurotic depression. Also superimposed reactive depression.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">At a renewed hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial counsel strenuously argued his own incompetence in not putting defendant\u2019s mental state in issue. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">We are not sympathetic to <em>mea culpas </em>from defense counsel on motions for new trials. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Cuevas, </em>250 Cal.App.2d 901, 907 [59 Cal.Rptr. 6],) In the case at bar it is apparent from the initial plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, that the problem of defendant\u2019s mental state had never been very far from counsel\u2019s mind. As a matter of trial strategy, a defense of diminished capacity to harbor malice does not mix too well with a claim of accidental shooting. The court was not required to accept, at face value, counsel\u2019s protestations of incompetence. A direct appeal, where the appellate court knows only what transpires in the courtroom is a poor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>vehicle for the assertion of a claim of incompetence except in the clearest of cases, such as <em>Ibarra. </em>We find no error on this record.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Stephens, J., and Aiso, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied July 16, 1970. Peters, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-9\">The record contains conflicting evidence concerning the time of counsel\u2019s arrival. According to the defense he arrived shortly after 11 a.m. and was made to cool his heels until noon. The court\u2019s eventual ruling implies rejection of the defense version. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 402, subd. (c).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b891-7\">It is an unfortunate fact that there are a few members of the State Bar who are so solicitous of the <em>Sixth </em>Amendment rights of persons accused of crime that they are willing to close an eye to canon 2 of the Rules of Professional Conduct. (52 Cal.2d 893.) We do not suggest for one moment that this is true of the attorney involved in this case, who is a gentleman of excellent reputation, well known to and respected by this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b892-6\">The record is quite murky on that point. It seems most likely that at least part of the writing which the husband identified as defendant\u2019s was the address on the package, which certainly would not be a confidential communication to the husband since, presumably, various post office employees were expected to read it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b893-7\">The court was entirely correct. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>262 Cal.App.2d 42, 55 [68 Cal.Rptr. 366].) The Law Revision Commission comment to section 1017 of the Evidence Code, when that section was originally enacted, is misleading in that it suggests that the mere tender, by the defendant, of an issue concerning his mental condition destroys the privileged nature of a psychotherapist\u2019s report to the defendant\u2019s attorney furnished solely for the purpose of aiding counsel. Section 1017 was amended in 1967 and an addition to the comment points out that while under such circumstances the psychotherapist-patient privilege might be lost because of the patient-litigant exception stated in section 1016, the report would probably still be privileged under the lawyer-client privilege. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 954; <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>37 Cal.2d 227, 234-238 [231 P.2d 26, 25 A.L.R.2d 1418].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b895-8\">In discussing Doctor Thompson\u2019s report, the trial court pointed out that in view of the verdict folding defendant guilty of murder of the second degree, the question of deliberation and premeditation had become academic. It then voiced the opinion that in view of all of the evidence the jury would have reached the same verdict even had Doctor Thompson\u2019s opinion been put before it. In so finding the court possibly went further than it had to. All it really knew after receiving Doctor Thompson\u2019s report was that there was one psychiatrist who was willing to find that defendant\u2019s mental problems, known to counsel at the very outset, were such that at the time of the commission of the offense her capacity to harbor malice was impaired to some extent. The trial court would have been well justified in taking into account the probability, if not certainty, that the prosecution would have been able to marshal contrary evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
