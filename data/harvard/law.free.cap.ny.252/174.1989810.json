The Special Term granted plaintiff\u2019s motion and denied defendant\u2019s motion. The Appellate Division reversed the order granting plaintiff\u2019s motion and denied the motion and reversed the order denying defendant\u2019s motion and granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The only question is whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The answer depends upon the duty assumed by the subtenant implied in law from the terms of the lease and sublease.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">In <em>Fleischman </em>v. <em>Toplitz </em>(134 N. Y. 349) it was held that, under the statute (L. 1860, ch. 345), upon the destruction by fire of a building occupied by a tenant, the relation between a tenant and his landlord is dissolved, unless the tenant elects to continue, and that, in the absence of such an election, the tenant is under no obligation to remove the bodies of horses burned to death in the fire from the premises. \u201c The damage to the real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>estate and the burden cast upon it by the fire must in such case be borne by the landlord and not by the tenant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The lease in question herein was not terminated by the fire. \u201c The same [the building] shall be repaired as speedily as possible at the expense of the lessor, and in case the damage shall be so extensive as to render the building untenantable the rent shall cease until such time as the building shall be put in complete repair.\u201d The lessor reserved the right to repair the premises, and to keep the lease in force unless the repairs were not completed within four months from the date of destruction by fire, in which case the lessee might at its option terminate the lease upon payment of rent up to the time of the damage by fire. The tenant was not free to depart from the untenantable premises or terminate the lease. Obviously it had no right to exclude the landlord from the premises for the purpose of making the repairs. But its failure to remove the debris did not amount to a constructive exclusion of the landlord. The landlord was free to enter to remove the debris and make the repairs. The analogy of the <em>Fleischman </em>case seems plain. The tenant is discharged from payment of rent until the building is put in complete repair. During that period, the landlord must accept the burden cast upon him by the fire. If he has to remove debris to make the repairs, that is a part of the burden. If that burden is onerous, he should guard against it by suitable covenants in the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Cardozo, Ch. J., Crane, Lehman, Kellogg, O\u2019Brien and Htjbbs, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
