Y. 78) we held that the question, <em>\u201c </em>Have you ever consulted a physician? \u201d following the question, <em>\u201c </em>Are you in good health? \u201d might justly have been taken by the assured to mean <em>\u201c </em>Have you ever consulted a physician in respect to ailments affecting your general health? \u201d and, therefore, that the assured, in answering <em>\u201c </em>No,\u201d may have told the truth. We see no reason for altering our views. It is not to be supposed, however, that the particular holding is authority for the proposition that, in all cases, questions as to consultations with a physician must be taken to relate to none other than communications between doctor and patient in respect to bodily disorders, which are grave. An insurer may wish to know how recently a physician has made a professional call upon an applicant for insurance, regardless of the topic discussed during the consultation between them. If the call has been recent, the insurer, upon that ground alone, may wish to reject the insurance application. If an insurer desires such knowledge it is entitled to it. But when, as in this case, an insurer in effect says, <em>\u201c </em>Is your health good? \u201d and follows the affirmative answer given with the question, <em>\u201c </em>Have you consulted a physician? \u201d it is as if the insurer said, \u201c You have stated your health to be good. Have you ever consulted a physician about it? \u201d The juxtaposition of the questions controls and limits the meaning in a particular instance, such as here shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">The judgment in each action should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Cardozo, Ch.
