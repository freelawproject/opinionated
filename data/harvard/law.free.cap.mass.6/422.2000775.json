The cause was submitted to the Court on a statement of facts agreed by the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-12\">The facts agreed are, that <em>Lemuel Weeks &amp; Son, </em>being sole owners of the ship <em>Harriet, </em>and having sent her on a voyage to <em>Liverpool, </em>in <em>Great Britain, </em>and back to the <em>United States </em>under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the command of <em>David Gray, </em>as master, while the said ship was at <em>Liverpool, </em>on the said voyage, on the 2d of January, 1808, conveyed one moiety of the ship and appurtenances, with all her earnings which might be due for freight on her return voyage, to the plaintiffs in mortgage, to secure to them the payment of certair promissory notes, which the bank held, and which were signed by one <em>William Stevens, Jun., </em>payable to said <em>Weeks Sf Son, </em>and by them endorsed; that, after the said conveyance, the house of <em>Logan, Lenox, &amp;f Co., </em>in <em>Liverpool, </em>of which house the said <em>Stubbs </em>is a partner, shipped on board of the <em>Harriet </em>the salt replevied by the writ in this case, to be transported to <em>Boston, </em>and there to be delivered to the said <em>Stubbs; </em>that the said master received the said salt on board, and signed bills of lading for the same, by which he stipulated, * with the usual exceptions, to deliver the salt at [ * 423 ] <em>Boston </em>to the said <em>Stubbs, </em>or his assigns, acknowledging that the freight had been paid him at <em>Liverpool; </em>that, during this transaction, and until after the ship sailed for <em>Boston, </em>neith he said house of <em>Logan, Lenox, Co., </em>nor the said master, had any knowledge of the said mortgage to the plaintiffs; that the said ship, on her voyage to <em>Boston, </em>with the said salt on board, and also the said <em>Stubbs, </em>who had sailed in another vessel in company as a passenger, put into <em>Portland, </em>and there <em>Stubbs </em>required the said <em>Gray, </em>the master, to proceed to <em>Boston, </em>and there to deliver him the salt, agreeably to the bills of lading, which the said <em>Gray </em>refused to do, unless <em>Stubbs </em>would agree to pay the freight therefor from <em>Liver pool </em>to <em>Boston; </em>that <em>Stubbs </em>then required <em>Gray </em>to deliver him the salt at <em>Portland, </em>which <em>Gray </em>also refused, unless <em>Stubbs </em>would agree to pay the freight therefor from <em>Liverpool </em>to <em>Portland; </em>that the plaintiffs can prove that no freight was paid for the said \u201csalt, in <em>Liverpool, </em>if such proof is in this case by law admissible; that <em>Stubbs </em>refused to pay any freight for the said salt, but replevied it from the said <em>Gray, </em>by a writ executed by the said <em>Gibbs, </em>then a deputy sheriff; and that thereupon the plaintiffs took it by this writ of replevin, claiming to detain the same until they should receive the freight.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-5\">And it was agreed that if, upon consideration of these facts, the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiffs ought to have and maintain this action, the defendants should be defaulted, and judgment be rendered against them for nominal damages, and for their costs; otherwise the plaintiffs should become nonsuit, and judg ment be rendered for a return of the salt, and damages and costs, agreeably to law.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-6\"><em>Whitman </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aros\">The defendant <em>Stubbs </em>was one of the consignors, and, being himself at <em>Liverpool </em>at the time of the ship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>ment, must have been conusant of the whole transaction. [*424] When, therefore, upon the ship\u2019s arrival at * <em>Portland, </em>he refused to be answerable for the freight, had the master proceeded to Boston, he would thereby have declared his assent to the terms of the bill of lading; and if his owners had permitted him to proceed, without a stipulation for the freight to be paid, they would thereby, in effect, have affirmed what they considered a void contract. On the same ground, they lawfully refused to deliver the salt at Portland, unless <em>Stubbs </em>would become answerable for a reasonable <em>pro rata </em>freight.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-5\">The case of the <em>Racehorse </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> shows that a ship may, in some cases, be entitled to her whole freight, although she does not carry the cargo to the port agreed by the charter party; and if in any case, surely where the consignee demands a delivery of it at a place short of such port.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-6\"><em>Emery </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASK\">The owners of a ship are bound by the contract of the master in this case. He acknowledged the freight to have been paid, and he must be accountable to his owners for it. Here was no compulsion, nor is fraud proved or suggested. He cannot vary or contradict, by paroi evidence, an instrument of this solemn nature, unless fraud is shown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-7\">But if the master or owners could show that the freight was not actually paid at <em>Liverpool, </em>and was due on delivery of the cargo, still there can be no pretence that it was demandable, until the arrival of the ship at her port of destination. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> The master refused to proceed to <em>Boston </em>unless the consignee would waive his right under the bill of lading, and make a new contract. Such conduct savors strongly of fraud, and ought not to be countenanced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-8\"><em>Whitman, </em>in reply. The plaintiffs proving that no freight was paid, the <em>onus </em>is upon the defendants, to show that the salt was taken on board as ballast, or for some other convenience to the ship, equivalent to freight; and if they fail, they must be held liable for it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-9\">The opinion of the Court was afterwards delivered by</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b352-12\"> 3 <em>Rob.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqm\">From the statements in this case, several points arise, to which the facts seemed not to be sufficiently [ * 425 ] * directed. The conveyance by <em>Weeks &amp; Son </em>to the plaintiffs being a mortgage, it is a pledge of a personal chattel. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> But to such pledge a delivery of the chattel is essen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>tial, to give the pawnee a special property in it. And although a ship at sea may be mortgaged, yet the mortgagee must take the possession as soon as may be on her return, before the mortgage is complete. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> But the case does not state whether the plaintiffs did, or did not, take possession of the ship, on her putting into <em>Portland. </em>If it be said that, as the possession of the other moiety remained in <em>Weeks \u00a3f Son </em>as part owners, that possession shall be deemed the possession of the plaintiffs, it may well be doubted whether the owner of a chattel can pledge an undivided part of it., without delivering the whole to the pawnee. <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> But in this case it is not necessary to decide on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Another point is, admitting the pledge of the moiety to be completed, and that the plaintiffs, by virtue of the special property resulting from it, are entitled to one moiety of the freight on the salt, yet the assignment of the other moiety is an assignment of a chose in action ; and the replevin ought to have been sued out in the names of <em>Weeks Son, </em>jointly with the plaintiffs. This objection would be entitled to much consideration, had it been made by plea in abatement. But as the case is stated, we ought to consider all objections to the form of the action as waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Another point is, whether the plaintiffs can be admitted to con tradict the bill of lading in this case, by proving that no freight had been paid for the salt. To this point the case does not seem to contain all the necessary facts. If <em>Stubbs, </em>the consignee, was a stranger to the shipment, and no party to the bill of lading in making it, it is very clear that as to him the bill of lading cannot be contradicted, by proving that no freight had been paid. As he is one of the shippers, if the acknowledgment by the master of the payment of freight had been obtained by fraud or mistake, we are satisfied that evidence of such fraud or mistake * might be admitted. But if the ship had been con- [*426] signed, in her outward voyage, to the shippers, as the correspondents at <em>Liverpool </em>of <em>Weeks fy Son, </em>the owners when she arrived there, and after the transfer, but without any knowledge of it, k was lawfully agreed by the master and the shippers, that the latter should credit the owners with the freight, and that the ' master would, on that agreement, acknowledge the freight to be paid, and under their agreement the salt was put on board, \u2014 we are satisfied that the plaintiffs would be bound by such agreement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>their master, confirmed by his signing a bill of lading, on receiving the salt, acknowledging the freight to have been paid, and that their remedy for the freight would be against <em>Weeks Sp Son, </em>who had the benefit of it. The plaintiffs would not have been personally answerable for any previous expenses about the ship, but when they purchased a moiety, they must take it subject to all encum brances on the ship, and to all lawful contracts, which the master had before made, or should afterwards make, respecting the employment of the ship ; and whatever contracts he might lawfully make as the master of the ship of <em>Weeks Sp Son, </em>he might still lawfully make, after the transfer, until he had notice of it. This authority in the master must be considered as acknowledged by every purchaser of a ship abroad, or manifest mischief and injustice might be the consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">But it is not necessary to have the case amended, to decide on this point, as the point remaining is sufficient to decide on the merits of this cause. Admitting, therefore, that the master might lawfully retain the salt until the freight was paid, after he had transported it to the port of delivery, \u2014 the principal question is, whether he could lawfully refuse to proceed from <em>Portland </em>to <em>Boston, </em>without a new stipulation for the payment of the freight at <em>Boston. </em>And we are satisfied that he could not. No freight was due until the voyage was performed and the salt ready to be delivered at <em>Boston, </em>because no impediment to the performing of the [ <em>*427 </em>] voyage appears. If a ship on her way is prevented * from farther proceeding, and the shipper will receive his goods, he shah pay a <em>pro rata </em>freight; but this is not the case before us. \u2022 The master here refused to perform his voyage without a new stipulation for the payment of the freight, which he was not authorized to demand. At <em>Boston </em>he might have retained the salt until payment of the freight; or, if he had delivered it to the consignee, he might have recovered the freight money by action. Very clearly no freight was due at <em>Portland; </em>and the master unlawfully re fusing to perform the voyage, <em>Stubbs </em>might lawfully demand the sal of him at <em>Portland. </em>When the master refused to deliver the salt, he was answerable to <em>Stubbs </em>in trover, or the latter might take it by replevin. <footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark> When <em>Stubbs </em>had received the salt on his replevin, he was in the legal possession of it, which the plaintiffs could not lawfully disturb. If the master had no right to retain the\" salt at <em>Portland </em>against <em>Stubbs, </em>the plaintiffs, his owners, could have no such right; and having no right to retain, they could not lawfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>take it by replevin from <em>Stubbs, </em>for the purpose of detaining it until the freight should be paid. In fact, the master refusing to perform his voyage, and transport the salt to the port of delivery, the ship has not earned any freight; and consequently neither the master nor owners have any right to retain the salt. The plaintiffs, therefore, have not maintained their action.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">We are at a loss for any just ground, on which this writ was sued, admitting freight to be due; for on the writ sued by <em>Stubbs </em>against the master, the right to retain would have come in question, and the merits of the cause might have been decided. <footnotemark>(7)</footnotemark> This action was improperly commenced; for if the master had a right to retain, he, in the action against him, might have had judgment for a return, and the plaintiffs in this action might have judgment to keep the goods irreplevisable ; which would be unreasonable, when both causes must be determined on the same facts and principles, and by privies, against the same adversary. And if <em>Stubbs </em>had disclosed these facts by plea *in abatement, [*428 ] the writ must have abated. The law is otherwise, if <em>Gray </em>and the plaintiffs had each claimed the property in several and distinct rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">There seems to be no color for making <em>Gibbs, </em>the officer, a defendant. His executing <em>Stubbs\u2019s </em>writ of replevin, as was his duty, whether <em>Stubbs </em>could or could not maintain it, cannot make him liable as a wrong-doer. And if he had pleaded the facts here agreed, he must have had judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\"><em>Per Curiam. </em>The plaintiffs must be nonsuit, and judgment be rendered for costs for <em>Gibbs; </em>and for <em>Stubbs, </em>that he have a return, together with his damages and costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"b352-14\"> [A mortgage and a pledge are two different things. \u2014 Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(4)\">\n<p id=\"b353-7\"> [It is not so.
