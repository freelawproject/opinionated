Appleton.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b77-8\">A discharge of the acceptor, by the payee of a bill of exchange, is not a discharge of the drawer, where the acceptor has no funds of the drawer in his hands.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-9\">The plaintiff declared in case upon a bill of exchange drawn by the defendant upon <em>William Smith, </em>for the sum of 1659 dollars 58 cents, payable to the plaintiff, and also for the like sum of money had and'received by the defendant to the use of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-10\">The action was tried upon the general issue, at the sittings after the last November term in this county, before * <em>Sewall, </em>J., and a verdict taken for the amount of the [ * 86 ] bill of exchange, with the customary damages and interest, subject to the opinion of the Court upon the case as reported by the judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-11\">On the trial, it appeared that the defendant was agent and supercargo of the said <em>Smith </em>in his brig <em>Levant </em>at <em>Marseilles, </em>and had in his hands a balance due to the plaintiff, for a quantity of tobacco, which had been consigned to the defendant, by him sold, and, with other effects belonging to <em>Smith, </em>invested in a cargo of oil. For that balance he drew the bill of exchange in question upon <em>Smith. </em>The bill was accepted, and duly presented for payment ; but <em>Smith </em>having then become insolvent, payment was refused, and the bill was protested on the 11th of February, 1805.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-12\">On the 27th of that month, <em>Smith </em>negotiated a composition with divers of his creditors, and by an indenture, to which the plaintiff was a party, assigned to the creditors, among other property, the brig <em>Levant, </em>with her earnings by freight or otherwise ; <em>subject, however, to the payment of any bills which the defendant had already drawn on him, or might thereafter draw on him, or on </em>Thomas Wilson, Esq., <em>of </em>London, <em>for the purchase of a cargo, or any part of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>a cargo, for the said brig </em>Levant. The creditors, in consideration of the said assignment, released <em>Smith </em>forever from all their respective debts and demands against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-5\">The oil was transported from <em>Marseilles </em>to <em>London, </em>and there deposited by the defendant with the said <em>Thomas Wilson, </em>by whom it was sold, and the proceeds thereof placed to the credit of <em>Smith.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-6\">The defendant commenced another voyage from <em>London </em>in the brig, in which he had the assistance of Mr. <em>Wilson, </em>as well on the credit of <em>Smith </em>as the guaranty of the defendant. The amount of <em>Wilson\u2019s </em>supplies were afterwards remitted to him, by the defendant, from the <em>Mediterranean.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-7\">[ * 87 ] *The defendant arrived in the United States in April, 1805, with a cargo on board the <em>Levant; </em>having drawn no other bill for the <em>Levant\u2019s </em>cargo, than the one on which this action is brought; and he has retained sufficient property belonging to <em>Smith </em>to discharge the bill, and for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-8\">In a letter dated at <em>New York </em>on the 13th of June, 1805, from the defendant to the plaintiff, he says, \u201cYour letter of the 9th instant I have just received. In regard to the bill on Mr. <em>Smith, </em>not paid, I shall be on in a few days to <em>Boston, </em>when I shall call and adjust it.\u201d In another letter of the 31st of July following, speaking of this bill, he says, \u201cI have no doubt your demand is good against me, for any deficiency after receiving your proportion of Mr. <em>Smith\u2019s </em>dividend.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-9\">The defendant had expressed his desire to pay the bill in question, but had been prevented by <em>D. D. Rogers, </em>Esq., a creditor of <em>Smith, </em>and a party to the said indenture, who had forbidden him to discharge it, claiming to hold the effects in the defendant\u2019s hands in virtue of said indenture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-10\">In addition to the above facts, appearing from the evidence at the trial, the parties agreed that several parcels of the real estate and effects assigned by the said indenture had thereby vested in the said creditors, to whom the said assignment had been made; but that the plaintiff had received no part of the proceeds thereof, nor been otherwise paid any part of his demand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-11\">On these facts, the jury were directed to find a verdict for the plaintiff, and to assess his damages to the amount of the bill of exchange, with the customary damages and interest. The verdict was taken subject to the opinion of the Court upon the case reserved, and by the consent of the parties, was to be amended, or set aside, and a verdict entered for the defendant, as the Court should order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-12\">The action stood continued <em>nisi </em>for argument, and at the follow ing March term in <em>Suffolk,</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>* <em>Jackson, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqN\">contended that the plain- [ * 88 ] tiff, in discharging <em>Smith, </em>the acceptor, had likewise discharged the defendant, and in bringing this action violates his faith pledged to <em>Smith. </em>If the plaintiff\u2019s case is within the exception in the indenture, he may recover this money of the assignees of <em>Smith, </em>after the defendant shall have paid it over to them. The defendant considers himself as a mere stakeholder, and is ready to pay the money according to the direction of the Court, either to the plaintiff or to the creditors of <em>Smith, </em>at whose instance the defence is in this case made. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-5\"><em>Prescott, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACE\">agreed to the general doctrine that the discharge of the acceptor was a discharge of all the prior parties. But he contended that the doctrine did not apply where, as in the present- case, the acceptor has no effects of the drawer in his hands. <footnotemark><em>(2)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The equity of the case is strongly on the plaintiff\u2019s side. The defendant has retained in his hands funds for the discharge of this bill, and the creditors of <em>Smith </em>have virtually agreed that he may so appropriate them by accepting the assignment of <em>Smith\u2019s </em>effects, subject to the payment of bills of this description. The defendant\u2019s letters in the case, written with a knowledge of the transaction, are a waiver of any advantage he might conceive himself entitled to, and in fact amount to a renewal of his undertaking.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-6\">The opinion of the Court (except <em>the chief justice, </em>who did not sit in the cause) was delivered at an after day in the same term by</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\"> 3 <em>Esp.

He is liable to the drawer, the payee, and to all the endorsees. The reason of * the rule is very [ * 89 ] clearly expressed by Lord <em>Eldon, </em>in the case of <em>English </em>vs <em>Darley, </em>cited at the bar. \u201c It is true that the holder of a bill of exchange has his remedy against all the parties on a bill; but the holder has it not in his power to give time to a party on the bill first liable, and afterwards to proceed against another; the holder may give time to his immediate endorser; he may discharge him out of custody, at the same time that he is proceeding to execution against a prior endorser to him, or against the drawer or acceptor; but he can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>not give time to, or discharge the drawer or acceptor, and afterwards proceed against that endorser. Suppose the holder, a second endorsee, should give time to the payee, the first endorser, and take his warrant of attorney payable at a future time, \u2014 could he proceed and take out immediate execution against his immediate endorser ? I think not; for if <em>that </em>endorser paid the money, he would have a right to proceed immediately to <em>his endorser, </em>that is, to the payee, who had before had time from the holder; this is inconsistent.\u201d And the same reasoning applies, certainly with equal strength, in the case of a discharge, as in one where time of payment is given, as was that then under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The rule, then, supported by the reason on which it is founded, would apply in this case, if, on a recovery against the defendant, he could support an action against Mr. <em>Smith </em>as the acceptor, and not otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">But it is impossible this could be the case ; for the bill would be paid by the defendant with money which belonged to <em>Smith, </em>and which had been retained and appropriated for the express purpose, to which it would be applied ; and this must always be deemed a sufficient answer for <em>Smith </em>to an action by the defendant against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">It is observable, that the real dispute in this case is between the creditors of <em>Smith </em>and the plaintiff in the action. But all the claim which the creditors can make is by virtue of the as- [ * 90 ] signment expressed in the indenture ; * but that assignment is explicitly made subject to the payment of any bill, which had been, or might be, drawn on <em>Smith </em>for the purchase of a cargo, or part of a cargo, for the brig <em>Levant. </em>Now, that this is a bill exactly of that description, and therefore that the money sufficient for its discharge, \u2014 the very money in the hands of the defendant, by him reserved for the payment of the bill,\u2014 is excepted from the assignment, is most evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Should the defendant in this case prevail, the consequence would be, that the money in his hands belonging to <em>Smith </em>must be paid over to him; for, by the terms of the assignment, it is excepted, as has been observed, from its operation; and of course the plaintiff would receive no more than his proportional dividend of the property assigned; which would be manifestly repugnant to the intention of the parties to the indenture \u2014 an intention fair and honest, and which, I think, ought not to be defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">It is the opinion of the Court, that the direction of the judge was right, and that the verdict ought to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">\n<em>Judgment according to the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
