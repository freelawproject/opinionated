H. Sumner, </em>of counsel for the demandants, and opposed [ * 231 ] * by the <em>solicitor-general </em>and <em>Thatcher, o\u00ed </em>counsel for the tenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-9\"><em>Sumner </em>stated the question before the Court to be, whether the possession of the tenant, as it was proved at the trial, and appears in the judge\u2019s report, was such as to constitute an ouster of the demandants. He went into a history of the demandants\u2019 title to the mill-pond, which he traced up to a grant from the colony of <em>Massachusetts Bay </em>in 1642 ; and he contended that the occupation which the tenant had had, being entirely compatible with all the use the demandants made of their estate, had no tendency to oust them, or to affect their possession ; and he cited the opinion of the Court in the case of <em>The Proprietors of the Kennebeck Purchase </em>. vs. <em>Springer </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> as in point \u2014 \u201c To constitute an ouster of him who was seised, the disseisor must have the actual exclusive occupation of the land, claiming to hold it against him who was seised, or he must actually turn him out of possession.\u201d When the tenant attempted another kind of occupation, in 1798, by filling up the pond under his buildings, he was immediately forbidden in behalf of the owners of the pond, and his desisting forthwith amounted to a satisfactory confession of their right and title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-10\"><em>Thatcher </em>urged the hardship to the tenant, if the demandants\u2019 claim should be established ; whose object, he said, was to but down the tenant\u2019s buildings, which he and his predecessors had quietly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>possessed for more than sixty years; and he adverted to the filling up of the pond, which is now in operation by the demandants, for the purpose of converting it into building ground. Their title to the pond is not contested by the tenant, and they still have all the use and benefit of it intended them by the original grant, under which they claim to hold it. Or, if the tenant\u2019s manner of occupation is inconsistent with this, it has now continued too long for the demandants lawfully to disturb it. There was no evidence that <em>Welsh </em>had any authority from the owners to intermeddle as he did; and without such * authority, his act was [ * 232 ] void, and no inference can be drawn from it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-5\"><em>The solicitor-general </em>contended that the tenant\u2019s title was good to the soil by the deeds which were read at the trial; but without relying upon them, his sixty years\u2019 quiet possession was enough to give him a valid title. This possession was as exclusive as property of this nature was capable of. It was absolutely so, except that at every tide the moon brought the waters of the ocean over our premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-6\">There can be no such thing as a partial or half ouster. Eithei the demandants are not now disseised, or they have been disseised these sixty years, so that <em>qu\u00e1cunque via data </em>they have no good cause of action. All that the demandants have shown is a right to an easement; the soil may still be in the tenant, in perfect consistency with the whole title they have shown in themselves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-7\">Jackson, in reply, insisted that the demandants owned the soil ot the mill-pond. Their right to it had never been questioned since 1642. It was very far from a mere easement, as the filling it up, which had been alluded to, sufficiently proved. The point cited from the case of <em>The Proprietors, </em>&amp;c., vs. <em>Springer, </em>precisely applied in principle; and, indeed, the doctrine of that case had never been disputed. The occupation of land, to constitute a disseisin, must be so notorious that the right owner may have notice, and be put upon his guard. The desisting by the tenant to fill up the pond, when warned to desist, was an acknowledgment both of <em>Welsh\u2019s </em>authority, and of the right of those under whom he claimed to act; so that it is of no importance whether he was clothed with legal authority or not. While the sort of possession which the tenant has had of the land demanded, occasioned no inconvenience to the owners of the soil, it was not considered by them as hostile to their rights, and was indulged by them as an act of good neighborhood ; it is not in a court of law, therefore, to be shown in bar of theii recovering their rights.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-8\">* The opinion of the Court, except <em>the chief justice, </em>[ * 233 who did not sit in the cause, was afterwards delivered by</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b194-12\"> 4 Mass. <em>Rep. </em>416.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Sedgwick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7e\">The tenant relies upon the statute of limitations. If the demandants have for thirty years been disseised, whatever their right might otherwise be, they cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The occupation on which the tenant relies as a disseisin, has continued uninterrupted for more than thirty years; and the only question is, whether that occupation is a disseisin ? The occupation is by two buildings standing within five feet of each other. They stand upon piles driven into the ground. The water flows under these buildings, but neither boats nor rafts can pass under them. The vacant space between the buildings has been used by the tenant, and those with whose occupation his own is connected, as a passage-way down to the water, for the convenience of their business; and during part of the time the piles in front of the building had been planked up, although the sides were always left open.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">We have none of us any doubt that such an occupation, open and visible as it was, and almost the only one which, under the circumstances of the subject of occupation, could have existed, is a disseisin. It was independent and notorious, and a complete prevention of the rights of ownership of the demandants. They claim and demand the <em>land; </em>but there has been no time, during this adverse possession, that they could or attempted to use it. Water flowed round the piles and under the buildings. This was no prevention of the occupation of those who owned the buildings; but that occupation was an absolute prevention of any use of the demandants, and a complete exclusion of their possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">This opinion we think not only consistent with the doctrine laid down in the case of <em>The Proprietors of the Kennebeck Purchase </em>vs. Springer, which was cited at the bar, but supported by it. <em>[*234] </em>*As to the vacant space between the two buildings, it seems to be appurtenant to them ; to have been used by the owners of them for the purpose of carrying on their business connected with them ; and occasionally so planked as to prevent the demandants from entering from the water. This is certainly such an open and visible occupation as must, from the nature of the subject, constitute a disseisin.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">The controversy is relative to the <em>land, </em>and not the <em>water; </em>and from the possession of the land the demandants were as much excluded as if the buildings had rested on the firmest and most substantial foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">As to what took place between the tenant and <em>Jonas Welsh </em>in 1798, as to any construction from the tenant\u2019s conduct, it is a sufficient answer, that long before that time the right of the demandants was gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">\n<em>There must be judgment accoiding to the verdict</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
