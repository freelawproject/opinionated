The plaintiff so received and considered it. 2. If the plaintiff did not at the time so receive and consider it, yet it m ist be now so applied, because he has used no diligence to collect it from the maker. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>If <em>M\u2019Conville </em>had a legal authority to give the note, so as to bind the other defendants, the plaintiff may still endorse the note to a third person, or may recover it himself against them; if he had no such authority, he must be considered as a stranger, and the plaintiff, accepting his note in payment, is bound.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b125-5\">Whitman, for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMA\">acknowledged the note to be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of payment, but, like all other evidence of that kind, it was liable to be disproved. It shifts the burden of proof upon the other party. The same thing happens when a receipt in full has been given by mistake. The whole course of the facts in this case shows that it was not the understanding of either of the parties to the note, that it was payment of the debt. The whole is, however, a question of fact, and the jury have found the facts necessary to give the plaintiff his judgment; unless the Court shall say that in every possible case a negotiable note, given in consideration of an existing simple contract, is payment and a discharge of such contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-6\">At this term the opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\"> <em>Clark </em>vs. <em>Young &amp; </em>Co., 1 <em>Crunch, </em>181. \u2014 <em>Richardson </em>vs. Rickman, cited in 5 <em>D &amp; E. </em>517. \u2014 <em>Louviere </em>vs. Laubray, 10 <em>Mod. </em>36. \u2014 <em>Chamberlyn </em>vs. <em>Delarive, 2 Wils. </em>353</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b125-7\">Parsons, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACv\">At common law, a promissory note given by a debtor to pay to his creditor a subsisting debt, is no discharge of the debt; but the creditor may either have his remedy on the note, or may recover the debt. But in this state, this rule is confined to notes not negotiable. And it has long been settled, that when a debtor shall give to his creditor his negotiable note for a debt due on simple contract, the legal presumption is, that the note was received in payment. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> And this presumption arises from the consideration, that the creditor may endorse the note ; and if he could compel payment of the original debt, the debtor might afterwards be obliged to * pay the note to the endorsee, [ * 146 J and thus be twice charged, without any remedy at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">And there is no inconvenience to the creditor ; for if he hold the note, he may sue the debtor upon it, and recover his debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">But this presumption, like all others, may be controlled by the agreement of the parties. And in this case, if it appears that <em>M Conville\u2019s </em>note was not understood by the parties as received in payment, or if this be not within the reason of the exception to the general rule, the verdict ought to stand. Now, the note did not oblige any but the maker. He was authorized by the defendants to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>pay for them, but not to bind them by his promissory notes. <em>M\u2019 Conville </em>and the plaintiff made a further settlement, in which the labor, for which the note was given, was made an <em>item, </em>and considered by the parties as still unpaid for. And all the defendants afterwards considered themselves as holden to pay for this labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">It is said that at this time they had no knowledge of <em>M: Conville\u2019s </em>note. But if they had, they were not obliged to pay it, or to pay <em>M\u2019 Conville </em>the amount of it, <em>for </em>he, being one <em>of </em>the defendants, was present, and made no claim for his note, or as having paid any thing on their account to the plaintiff; and by his certificate, he admitted that the labor was not paid for.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">From these facts, it is manifest that the reason of the presumption, that the note was taken as absolute payment, does not exist; because in no event were the defendants obliged to pay twice the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s demand. And <em>M\u2019 Conville, </em>who made the note, confesses this action by his default. The presumption that his note was a payment, is also controlled by his certificate, that the labor, for which his note was given, remained unpaid for.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\n<em>Let judgment be entered on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b125-10\"> Vide 5 <em>Mass.
