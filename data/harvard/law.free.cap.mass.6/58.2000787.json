The defendant, having been [ * 59 ] appointed guardian * to <em>Scott, </em>for the purpose of procuring his enlargement, made the note to the plaintiff declared on in this action, whereupon the plaintiff fully discharged his execution against <em>Scott, </em>who was thereupon enlarged, and before the day of payment of the note arrived, died insolvent, and the defendant has been appointed administrator of his estate.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-10\">The action stood continued <em>nisi, </em>and at the next March term in <em>Suffolk, </em>the opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b54-11\">Parsons, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxV\">The plaintiff\u2019s right to recover upon the facts agreed is the point submitted to the Court in this action. Two objections are made by the defendant ;\u2022\u2014 that the note is without a sufficient consideration; \u2014and that, by force of it, <em>Scott </em>or his estate are only chargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">As to the first objection, it is true that the defendant has received no consideration for signing the note; but it is equally true that the plaintiff, by discharging <em>Scott </em>from prison, has no remedy on his judgment; which is a sufficient consideration for the defendant\u2019s promise ; for a damage to the promisee, as well as benefit to the promisor, is a sufficient consideration to support a promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-13\">The other objection is, that the defendant is not personally bound, as he contracted only as guardian of <em>Scott. </em>\u2014 As an administrator cannot by his promise bind the estate of the intestate, so neither can the guardian by his contract bind the person or estate of his ward. Unless, therefore, the defendant is liable to pay this note, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>plaintiff has'no remedy. But we are satisfied that the defendant is liable. It is his promise, made on a sufficient consideration; and although in the note he states that he promises as guardian, yet he is personally bound ; his trust being inserted only to entitle himself to indemnity from his ward, with which the plaintiff has no concern. According to the agreement of the parties, the defendant must be called. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b55-5\"> <em>Thatcher &amp; Al. </em>vs. Dinsmore, ante, vol v. p. 299.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b55-6\"> [The promise was made <em>as </em>guardian, and, therefore, would seem to stand on the same footing as a promise made by a defendant <em>as </em>executor, after the death of the testator, which, it has been held, does not render him liable <em>de horns propriis. </em>\u2014 <em>Powell </em>vs. Graham, 1 <em>B. </em>Moore, 316, 317. \u2014 7 <em>Taunt. </em>580. \u2014 <em>Ellis </em>vs. Bowen, <em>For. </em>98. \u2014 <em>Segar </em>vs. Atkinson, 1 H. <em>Bl. </em>103. \u2014 2 <em>Chitty's Pl. </em>6th Lond. edit. 70. \u2014 <em>Partridge </em>vs. <em>Court, </em>5 Price, 412.\u2014 7 <em>Price, </em>591. \u2014 <em>King </em>vs. Thorn, 1 <em>D. &amp; E. </em>407. \u2014 <em>Cowell </em>vs. Watts, 6 East, 405. \u2014 <em>Powley </em>vs. Newton, 6 <em>Taunt. </em>459. \u2014 <em>Roan </em>vs. Hughes, 7 Brown, P.
