And the plaintiffs aver that, afterwards, on the same day, in obedience to the aforesaid order of the said selectmen, the store aforesaid was taken down, to the line afore mentioned, being nineteen feet in the front thereof, and six inches on the w'est end; and by reason whereof the plaintiffs have not been able to hold and occupy the premises for the term aforesaid, but have been lawfully amoved, ejected, and ousted, from the same, in manner aforesaid; and so the plaintiffs say that the defendant hath not kept and performed his covenant, but has broken the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-5\">The defendant prays oyer of the deed declared on, which comports with its description in the declaration, to which he thereupon demurs generally, and the plaintiffs join in demurrer. The demurrer was argued at the last March term in this county, by <em>Bigelow </em>for the defendants, and <em>Selfridge </em>for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-6\"><em>Bigelow, </em>in support of the demurrer, contended that there was no covenant'of the defendant\u2019s in the deed declared [ * 248 ] * on, which could be said to be broken by the facts stated ; and that, if the covenants had been never so special, yet that no action would lie against the defendant upon the facts. It was very absurd to hold the defendant chargeable for what the municipal authority of the town had done by legal authority; especially when it was considered that the plaintiffs would, after all, be liable to the defendant for not leaving the demised premises in as good order and repair as at the commencement of their lease, which they had expressly covenanted to do.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b208-8\"><em>Selfridge, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoI\">insisted that these words \u201c shall hold and occupy \u201d are tantamount to a covenant for quiet enjoyment during the term. Indeed, the words \u201c lease and demise \u201d are an implied covenant to the same effect. Where the enjoyment of the term by the lessee is interrupted by a lawful title paramount tc that of the lessor, an action lies upon a covenant for quiet enjoy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>inent, <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> though not upon an ouster by a wrong-doer. The right and authority of the selectmen in this case is in effect a title paramount to that of the defendant. The plaintiffs have no remedy, if not against the defendant. The statute confines the compensation, to be recovered from the town, to the \u201c <em>owner </em>or owners,\u201d which must mean, at least, the tenant of the freehold. Another construction would be attended with inconvenience, as it would multiply suits, and subject the town unnecessarily to several bills of cost. Besides, it may be that the lessee only is a sufferer. The benefit derived to the tenant of the freehold or fee, in widening the street, may be a balance for the immediate injury to his building, and the loss of his land. But this is nothing to the tenant for a short term, who ought, in such case, to be indemnified by the lessor; and the liability of the latter to his tenant will very properly make an item in his claims upon the town.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-5\"><em>Bigelow, </em>in reply. The first part of the indenture contains a covenant that the tenant shall hold the premises demised; but this covenant is afterwards qualified by the * covenant on the part of the tenant to deliver up the [ * 249 ] premises in like good order, &amp;c. This is not like the cases cited of an eviction by a paramount title. There is no title in the commonwealth, other than there is to all the land in the state. If there had been no covenant at all in this lease, either express or implied, the plaintiffs would still have their remedy equally against the town ; for they are as much <em>owners </em>of the store, during the term, as the tenant in fee simple. It is idle, in this case, to intimate that the defendant is benefited by this proceeding of the selectmen. His store has been cut down, and his land taken from him; and he is now proceeding in this Court against the selectmen for his damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-6\">The action standing continued to this term, the opinion of the Court was now delivered by</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b209-8\"> 3 <em>D &amp; E. </em>584, <em>Dudley vs. Folliott. </em>\u2014 1 <em>Selwyn's Nisi Prius, </em>412.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b209-7\">Parsons, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMO\">This action is in a plea of covenant broken, in which the plaintiffs declare on a lease made by the defendant to them of a brick store in State Street, in <em>Boston, </em>with the appurtenances, for five years from the 8th day of September, 1804, and they aver that the defendant covenanted with them, that they should hold and occupy the demised premises during that term; and that within the term the selectmen of <em>Boston, </em>pursuant to the statute of 1799, <em>c. </em>31, in widening State Street, laid a part of that street over the demised premises, by reason of which the public became en titled to an easement in the same as a town way; and so the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>tiffs could not hold and occupy it agreeably to the covenant. In describing the allegation of the breach, I have adopted the legal inference from the facts alleged. The defendant, after having oyer of the lease, demurs generally, and the plaintiffs join in the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Two questions are made \u2014 whether the covenant shown in the declaration is contained in the lease; and if it is, whether the widening of the street by the selectmen of <em>Boston </em>is a breach of this covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">[ * 250 ] * After this clause of demise, the words of the lease,</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">so far as they apply to the first question, are, \u201c and the said <em>Welch </em>does agree that the said <em>Jonathan Ellis </em>and <em>Luther Ellis </em>shall hold and occupy the same for the term of five years from,\u201d &amp;c. These words, in our opinion, amount to a general covenant for quiet enjoyment during the term, and sufficiently main tain that part of the declaration in which the covenant is alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The next question is, if the widening of State Street in this manner is a breach of this covenant. As no authorities in point are cited, the question must be decided on general principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">All deeds are to be construed agreeably to the intent of the parties; and in a lease or conveyance containing a general covenant for quiet enjoyment, it must be presumed that the parties had \u00bbn view evictions, entries, or disturbances, to be made by virtue only of existing rights, and not of rights afterwards to be acquired ; for these it cannot be presumed, from the general words of the covenant, were contemplated. Now, the interruption complained of is an easement acquired by the public after the execution of the lease. And the authority of the selectmen to locate and establish a town way when necessary, cannot be considered as an existing encumbrance. Neither can the prerogative of the public to convenient ways on the lands of individuals be deemed an existing right, within the intention of the parties to the lease. For the lessor holds his land subject to this prerogative; and so also do the lessees their term, because it is one of the incidents of the tenure, by which all the lands in the state are holden. A covenant against the exercise of this prerogative would be a covenant, not against any existing right or interest in the land, but against a naked possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">To support the presumption that a general covenant for quiet enjoyment extends only to rights then existing, the case of the <em>Executors of Grenelife </em>vs. W--, in <em>Dyer, </em>43, <em>b, </em>is applicable. It was there holden, by all the judges, that [*251 ] *when a man binds himself and his heirs to warranty, they are not bound to warrant against new titles aris <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>mg through the feoffee, <em>or any other person, </em>after the warranty is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Upon this general principle, it appears to us that there is no breach of the general covenant for quiet enjoyment, well and sufficiently assigned. \u2014 But as the case is new, it has been the subject of our further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">To guard the citizen from any oppressive consequences of the prerogative we have noticed, the tenth article of the declaration of rights provides \u201c That whenever the public exigencies require that the property of any individual should be appropriated to public uses, he shall receive a reasonable compensation therefor.\u201d In conformity to this just and equitable provision, the statute of 1786, <em>c. </em>67, \u25a0\u00a7&gt; 1, defining the manner in which town ways, when necessary, may be located and established, has provided that the owner of the land covered by the location may recover of the town where the way is established, a reasonable compensation for the damage, to be estimated by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Now, any person having an interest in the land, either as lessee for years, tenant for life, or for any greater estate of freehold, as also he in reversion or remainder, is an owner within the provision of this section ; because, being within the mischief, he is within the remedy. If there was any doubt, the change of phraseology in the fourth section would remove it. For in that section, compensation for damage in laying out a public highway is provided expressly <em>for any person damaged in his property </em>by the location. And, for the same reason, the provision made in the statute of 1799, <em>c. </em>31, for the owner or owners of buildings, must have the same construction ; and the lessee, as also his landlord, are each one entitled to compensation, according to the nature and magnitude of the damages he may sustain by the widening of any street.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">In this case, therefore, the plaintiffs have no occasion to resort to the defendant for recompense, as the same law * by which the easement, of which they complain, is [ * 25\u00a3 ] authorized, has provided for them a remedy against the town; and such a construction of the lease, as would give the lessees another remedy against the lessor, who is a fellow-sufferer with them, is unnecessary and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">This conclusion is supported in principle by the cases deciding that a general covenant in a lease for quiet enjoyment extends only to entries and interruptions by those who have lawful title, but not by wrong-doers; for the tenant has his remedy by action for all tortious entries and disturbances, <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> Now, the reason of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>distinction applies with great force to the present case. For the plaintiffs have an adequate remedy, for the interruption alleged, against those for whom the easement is acquired. Indeed, this case is not to be distinguished in principle from a feoffment in fee of land, with a general covenant against encumbrances and for quiet enjoyment. And although the feoffor is answerable for existing encumbrances, by ways established at the time of the feoffment, yet it has never been attempted to charge him on his covenant for ways afterwards located; but the feoffee is left to the remedy provided for him by the statutes in such cases provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Upon the whole, we are satisfied that the declaration before us is bad, because no breach of the covenant is therein legally assigned. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\n<em>Judgment must be rendered, that the plaintiffs take nothing by their writ, and that the defendant recover his costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b211-10\"> 3 <em>D &amp; E. </em>584. \u2014 <em>Hob </em>24, <em>Tisdale </em>vs. <em>Sir W.
