No. </em>11, <em>at present commanded, by Lieutenant </em>Joseph Bainbridge, <em>do severally acknowledge hereby to have received, as advance wages, the sums of money placed opposite to our respective names in another column; and we, who have subscribed, our names as sureties, do hereby acknowledge that we are sureties for the several inferior officers, seamen, and ordinary seamen, so engaged as aforesaid, against whose name or names ours are written, that he or they shall repair on board in </em>[ * 255 ] <em>proper time, and. proceed to sea in the </em>* <em>gunboat aforesaid; or, in default thereof, that we will respectively ansiver, and be accountable for, the advance wages, so as aforesaid acknowledged, to be received by any inferior officer, seaman, or ordinary seaman, for whom we are respectively </em>surety.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-7\">On the 5th day of the same July, <em>Matthias Bowers </em>engaged on board the said gunboat, as a boatswain, and subscribed his name in the proper column <em>[of the said shipping paper,] </em>and against his name in the column of sureties the said <em>Downie </em>wrote his name. Thereupon the said <em>Bowers </em>went on board the said gunboat, and did his duty as boatswain on board for six weeks, when he deserted, and, in about a fortnight after, was apprehended, and again carried on board, by the orders of the plaintiff, who confined him on board for about six weeks more, when he was released from his confinement, and again deserted. About a fortnight after-wards, the said gunboat proceeded to sea without him. Before the commencement of this action, the said <em>Downie </em>had notice of both the desertions of the said <em>Bowers, </em>and, after the last desertion, the advance wages paid to <em>Bowers </em>were demanded of him, which he refused to pay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-8\">If the Court shall be of opinion that, on these facts, the plaintiff has maintained this action, the verdict is to be set aside, and a verdict entered for the plaintiff, with seventy-two dollars damages; otherwise the verdict is to stand, and judgment to be rendered accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>At the July adjournment of the last March term, the cause came on for argument.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-5\"><em>Blake </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANB\">The contract was express that the seamen should repair on board in proper time, and <em>proceed to sea. </em>This contract was broken, and there are no equitable considerations in the case which should induce a deduction from the sum forfeited. It would be a hardship upon seamen to be deprived of this humane provision, as they must be, if the responsibility of the surety extends no farther than merely to the seaman\u2019s rendering himself on board in the first instance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-6\">* It was contended at the trial that, if the defendant [ * 256 ] was liable to an action in this case, it was to the <em>United States </em>he was liable, and not to the plaintiff. Now, the plaintiff was commander of this gunboat, he was authorized to enlist seamen, and he was answerable to the <em>United States, </em>either <em>for Bowers\u2019s </em>service, or for the money he had advanced him. But, if this was a contract with the <em>United States, </em>still the plaintiff, as their agent, may maintain the action in his own name. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> And if <em>Bowers\u2019s </em>engagement was to the <em>United States, </em>the present defendant\u2019s was with the plaintiff, that if the plaintiff would grant certain liberties to <em>Bowers, </em>and he should abuse them, the defendant would refund the money advanced.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-7\"><em>Paine, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALc\">contended that the whole contract in this case was expressly made with the <em>United States, </em>\u2014 not even with the plaintiff as their agent; and if it had been, he insisted that lie could not maintain the action in his own name. The plaintiff shows no interest in the demand; it does not even appear that the money was paid by him. The seamen shipped in the service of the <em>United States, </em>and to them alone are they or their sureties answerable. But if this contract was made with the plaintiff, it was with him as an agent of the <em>United States; </em>and so the declaration states expressly. He cannot, then, support the action in his own name. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> A recovery in this action will be no bar to a demand for the same money by the <em>United States. </em>If it is, then they will lose the benefit secured by law to them of a priority in cases of insolvency. But, admitting the contract to have been with the plaintiff, the facts show no breach of it. The defendant was responsible that <em>Bowers </em>should go on board, and proceed to sea. But this must have a reasonable construction. <em>Bowers </em>did go on board, and remained six weeks. Was the defendant to be held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>responsible for an indefinite length of time, until it should happen to suit the plaintiff\u2019s convenience to quit the port ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-5\">[ * 257 ] * The action stood over for advisement until this term, when the opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b215-8\"> <em>Buller's N.

The public faith is engaged, and the personal credit of the agent is neither stipulated nor relied on. The rule opposed to the liability of public officers is in effect the constructive operation of the contract itself, and is equally applicable in many cases of contracts made by private agents or servants for their employers or masters. No agent or servant is liable, who, with proper authority, or in the course of his employment, stipulates in behalf of his principal, without engaging himself personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">This case is to be decided by the construction of the contract upon which the original action was brought. <em>Bowers </em>shipped as a seaman in the service of the <em>United States: </em>the duty more immediately assigned to him happened to be on board a vessel of the <em>United States, </em>then commanded by Lieutenant <em>Bainbridge, </em>the plaintiff. The defendant, <em>Downie, </em>became a surety for <em>Bowers </em>upon the articles of enlistment; but both engagements \u2014 that of <em>Bowers </em>and the collateral one of <em>Downie, </em>upon which this action was brought\u2014 are with the <em>United States. </em>They only are parties to the considerations, acknowledgments, and undertakings, specified in [ * 258 ] these contracts ; and not the plaintiff, the public * officer, or a servant, acting in the course of his employment, in the name of the <em>United- States, </em>and in their service. We are, therefore, all of us, of the opinion that the remedy upon these contracts must be exclusively in the name of the <em>United States; </em>and we may add that this decision seems consonant to the public convenience in cases of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">\n<em>Judgment according to the verdict</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"b216-12\"> 1 <em>Cranch, </em>345.\u2014 8 <em>D. &amp; E. </em>571.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
