J.</author>\n<p id=\"Afl\">This cause also comes before us on a case stated by the parties, as did the case of <em>Cook </em>vs. <em>The Essex Fire and Marine Insurance Company. </em>And by comparing the cases, it appears that <em>Wheatland </em>and <em>Cook </em>were joint owners of the brigantine and cargo; that the policy declared on in this case, and executed by the defendant, is in all respects similar to <em>Cook\u2019</em>policy, executed by the <em>Essex Fire and Marine Insurance Com pony, </em>and that the facts in the two cases are substantially the same. In both cases, therefore, similar judgments must be entered ; and as, in <em>Cook\u2019s </em>action, we gave judgment against him, so, in this action, we are of the same opinion, that on the case agreed, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover any thing of [*1\u00a35] * the defendant; and that judgment must be rendered that the said <em>Wheatland </em>take nothing by his writ, and that the said <em>Gray </em>recover his costs. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b108-16\"> [See reference in note to preceding case. \u2014 Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
