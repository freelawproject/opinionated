When he was weighing * anchor for this purpose, the chief magistrate or sovereign of the countries, called <em>Dato Bassow, </em>sent off certain messengers, and offered to furnish him with a cargo of pepper upon terms which were satisfactory ; and he accordingly, the next day, proceeded to take on board his return cargo. He continued lading, according to the usual course of business in that place, until the 24th of said June, when he agreed to sell to the said <em>Dato </em>a chest of opium, being the property of the plaintiff, and part of the cargo, at an agreed price, and to receive one half the price thereof in dollars, and the other half in pepper, which he supposed would complete the lading of the vessel. The said <em>Dato </em>accordingly ordered his subjects to deliver the said pepper, which Captain <em>H. </em>continued to take in until the evening of that day. Early in the morning of the next day, the said <em>Dato </em>came on board the vessel, to ascertain how much more pepper she could take in. He appeared to be very friendly, and after tarrying about half an hour, and examining the vessel, he went on shore. The captain went with him, and sent off the last boat-load of pepper that the ship could take in, which, with one third before received on account of the opium, made about two thirds of the value of the opium. The <em>Dato </em>then desired to have the opium brought on shore, and said he would pay the balance in dollars, as he had agreed. It was brought on shore, and the <em>Dato </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>ordered his men to take it to the scales, and see if it held out in weight; and while they were placing it in the scales, the <em>Dato </em>told Captain <em>H. </em>that he must let him have it at a price which he named, and which was less by one fifth than the price before agreed on. Captain <em>H. </em>immediately replied, that unless the <em>Dato </em>would comply with the agreement, he would pay him in dollars for the pepper received on account of the opium, which he would take on board again. To this he apparently assented; and Captain <em>H. </em>sent for his long-boat and four hands to take the opium on board the ship. The water being shoal for some distance, the people waded up*to their knees in the water about four or [*199] five rods, with the opium, and had rested it on the gunwale of the boat, and were part of them getting into the boat to stow it, when the <em>Dato </em>ordered his subjects to bring it on shore again. About two hundred of the natives accordingly ran to the boat, and brought back the opium with loud shouts. On inquiring of the <em>Dato </em>the meaning of this extraordinary conduct, he told the captain, that when he had paid for said pepper, and had received back a chest of muskets, which he had previously sold him, and returned the price paid for them, he might go on board his vessel, with the opium and muskets. Captain <em>H. </em>sent on board for his money, and paid 212 dollars 50 cents, which he had received foi the muskets, and 1785 dollars, which was the price of the pepper, and desired that some of the natives should assist him in getting the muskets and opium into the boat. The <em>Dato </em>then replied, that those goods should not be carried on board until the money received for one half of the opium, which he said he had paid the day before, was returned. On the captain\u2019s asking him the meaning of such conduct, the <em>Dato </em>replied, that he had paid him in dollars for half the opium the day before, and that it should not be carried on board until that sum was returned. This assertion was wholly untrue, and the captain became alarmed, and inquired of the interpreter, who had always been friendly to him, if the <em>Dato </em>intended to rob him. The interpreter replied, in a low voice, that he did The captain said, that he might as well take his life as the opium, and that he must take it on board that night. The interpreter replied, \u201c You will do well to get away alive yourself, and, as a friend, I advise you not to hesitate a moment.\u201d As it was then evening, and Captain <em>H. </em>knew that the <em>Dato </em>had no superior, to whom he could apply for relief or protection, he determined to get on board with his boat\u2019s crew as soon as possible; and ne had scarcely got clear of the shore, when an attempt was made by the natives to stop him, but without success. On the * said 25th day of June, there were nearly 2000 of [*200j <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>the natives on the shore, and rather more the next day, a larger portion than usual of whom were armed. Before that time, there had never been above 200 together. During the whole night of the 25th, the crew were expecting to be attacked by the natives, and made every preparation to defend themselves. In the morning, a <em>prow, </em>or small <em>vessel, </em>belonging <em>to </em>a neighboring port, came off from the shore, the master of which advised Captain <em>H. </em>not to go on shore, telling him that the natives had carried the opium, back into the country, that they were making preparations to capture the vessel, and were arming every <em>prow </em>in the harbor for that purpose. This information corresponding with what had already occurred, and with the hostile appearances on shore, which were seen from the vessel, Captain <em>II. </em>determined, for the preservation of the lives of the crew, and the residue of the property, to put to sea immediately. As soon as this was seen from the shore, the natives began to fire at the vessel from the fort, but did not prevent her departure. The usual mode of conducting business at said <em>Labouaga </em>is to contract with the <em>Dato, </em>or king, in whose name all contracts are made. His subjects furnish the articles contracted for to an officer, who delivers them to the purchaser, and in return receives the money, or other articles given in exchange, and distributes them among the natives. Captain <em>Hilliard, </em>conducted his sales and purchases, and his mercantile transactions, in all respects, according to the usage of said place. The value of the opium and other arti cles lost was, at the time of the shipment, 3100 dollars; and the sum due from the defendants, if they are liable for the whole of said loss, is 2558 dollars 57 cents, with interest from, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-5\">If, upon the foregoing statement, the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover for said loss, the defendants agree to be defaulted, and that judgment be rendered [*201 ] against them for such sum as the Court * shall award, with costs; otherwise the plaintiff agrees to become nonsuit, and that judgment for costs be rendered against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-6\">The cause was argued upon these facts, at the last March term, by <em>Otis </em>and <em>Jackson </em>for the plaintiff, and <em>Deader </em>and <em>Hall </em>for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-7\"><em>For the plaintiff, </em>it was insisted that the seizure of the opium by assailing thieves, while lading on board the ship\u2019s boat, was a loss protected by the policy. It was never <em>safely landed, </em>and though this is not an expression in the policy, yet words full as com prehen sive are used. The insurance was on merchandise on board the ship at and from <em>Boston, </em>&amp;c., and <em>at and from </em>Sumatra <em>and </em>Java, <em>for the purpose of disposing of the outward, and of procuring a return cargo. </em>The property was then covered by the policy so long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>as it might be considered as on board the ship, (and for this purpose the boat is a part of the ship,) and until disposed of for the avowed purpose of the voyage, or until it was landed in safety according to the course of the voyage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-5\">But if it were safely landed, yet being afterwards seized by violence, while lading on board the boat, and had thus become part of the return cargo, still the insurance will protect it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-6\">The money demanded and taken by this <em>JDato Bassow, </em>or sovereign prince of the country, was property lost by the <em>\u201c </em>restraint and detainment of kings, princes,\u201d &amp;.c., and so expressly within the words of the policy. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-7\"><em>For the defendants, </em>it was insisted, that the insurance was limited to merchandise on board the ship. Here the article was landed in pursuance of a previous bargain, which had changed the property, and two thirds of the consideration had been actually received. This opium had become the property of the <em>Dato Bassow, </em>who in this case is to be considered solely as a merchant; and thus the defendants were discharged as much as if it had been landed. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-8\">\" * The case of <em>Martin </em>vs. <em>The Salem Marine Insurance </em>[ * 202 ] <em>Company </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> shows that goods insured must retain their connection with the vessel, to be within the contract of insurance. But this opium had been taken on shore, and put into the merchant\u2019s scales to be weighed, when he fraudulently fell from his bargain, and with violence seized it, refusing to pay a balance still due for it. This was merely a fraud in this merchant, against which underwriters never insure. The pepper, which had been delivered in payment for the opium, and was on. board the ship, was at the risk of the underwriters as return cargo; but they could not be held for the outward and return cargoes at the same moment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-9\">As to the money, for which the plaintiff demands an indemnity, it was not taken by force, but voluntarily carried on shore, after the <em>D to Bassow </em>had unmasked himself. The master might certainly have refused to surrender it, and have brought it away with him.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-10\">The cause was continued for advisement, and at this term the opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b171-12\"> <em>Marshall, </em>434, 162, 164, 171. \u2014 <em>Beale </em>vs. <em>Thompson, </em>3 <em>Bos. &amp; Pul. </em>415, 416. \u2014 4 <em>East\u2019s Rep. </em>546. \u2014 <em>Peake\u2019s N.

The policy of insurance, upon which this action is brought, is in the usual form as to the perils insured against; and the loss ali ged to have happened during the voyage insured, is claimed against the defendants, as having been occasioned by the restraint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>and detention of a prince, called the Dato <em>Bassow </em>of the Island of <em>Sumatra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">It is an insurance of 5000 dollars in specie or merchandise <em>out </em>and merchandise <em>home, </em>on board the brig <em>Success, </em>at and from <em>Boston, </em>to port or ports in the Island of <em>Sumatra, </em>or <em>Java, </em>for the purpose of disposing of the <em>outward </em>and procuring a <em>return cargo, </em>and <em>at </em>and from thence to her port of discharge in the <em>United States.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">It is agreed that the plaintiff was interested in the cargo shipped at <em>Boston, </em>for the voyage, to a greater amount than the [ * 203 ] sum insured, and that, during the voyage, he has * sustained a loss; and the general question is, whether for that loss the defendants are responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The insurance is on the voyage round, both outward and homeward, for an entire premium, and it is therefore to be considered as one voyage. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">There are two subjects for which the plaintiff claims to recover \u2014 1. The money sent on shore from the brig, by the order of the master; and, 2. the opium, which was <em>forcibly </em>taken from the brig\u2019s boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">As to the money, we think the plaintiff cannot recover. The whole money carried on shore and delivered to the <em>Dato Bassow, </em>Was 1997 dollars 50 cents, of which 212 dollars 50 cents had been previously received of him for some muskets ; and the money was voluntarily delivered to him, on his promise to redeliver the muskets, which promise he broke. Had he performed his promise, no loss would have been sustained. Of consequence the real loss was sustained by his breach of promise, for which, however liberally we may be disposed to consider this contract, we cannot think the underwriters responsible. And, besides, these muskets were not the property of the plaintiff; and therefore the money received for them could not belong to him. As to the residue of the money, 1785 dollars, it was in fact paid as the price of pepper, which constituted part of the return cargo. The pepper was, it is true, received by the master in pursuance of an agreement, by which it was to be paid for in opium. The pepper was accordingly carried on board the brig, and the opium brought on shore ; but before the delivery was completed, the former agreement was rescinded, and a new one substituted, by which the master was to pay in money for the pepper, and the opium was to be returned on board. The master faithfully performed his part of the agreement, but the <em>Dato Bassow </em>most perfidiously violated his part. This violation of promise was the cause of the loss in this respect. It is therefore a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>loss, as has been observed with regard to the other sum of money, for which the underwriters cannot be responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">* The next question is, whether the plaintiff is entitled [ * 204 ] to recover for the opium. \u2014 The insurance is of the cargo <em>on board </em>for the voyage to the Islands of <em>Sumatra </em>and <em>Java, </em>for the purpose of disposing of the <em>outward-, </em>and procuring a <em>return </em>cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">That the opium was in fact lost by a peril insured against, the restraint and detention of a sovereign prince, or by assailing thieves, is undoubtedly true; and the only question is, whether the loss occasioned thereby happened under circumstances to entitle the plaintiff to demand a compensation for it from the underwriters.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">It must be acknowledged that the policy did not attach, unless the property of the plaintiff, secured by it, was in such circumstances as to constitute part of the <em>cargo </em>of the brig; and that the insurers were discharged from all responsibility, whenever that property was <em>landed in good safety, </em>whether at the termination of the voyage, or at any intermediate port. Was the opium so landed at <em>Labouaga, </em>when it was violently seized and detained by the <em>Dato Bassow </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Every underwriter is presumed to be acquainted with the practice of the trade he insures; and it must be supposed to be the intention of the contract to conform the indemnity to the known practice. In the cas\u00e9 of <em>Noble </em>vs. <em>Kennoway, </em><footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> this principle was recognized and applied. This was an insurance on the ships <em>Hope </em>and <em>Anne, </em>from <em>Waterford </em>to a port or ports of discharge on the coast of <em>Labrador, </em>and upon any kind of goods or merchandise; on the ships until they should have arrived at their port of discharge, and been moored at anchor twenty-four hours; and <em>on the goods until the same should be discharged and safely landed. </em>Both the ships arrived on the coast of <em>Labrador; </em>the last on the 14th of July, 1778. The goods were not landed, but kept on board until the 13th of August following, when they, with the ships, were captured by an enemy privateer. Now, it is the known duty of the insured, in ordinary cases, to remove goods insured from on board, * within a convenient and reasonable time [ * 295 ] after arrival at the port of destination ; and if he neglects to perform it, the underwriters are discharged. But as it turned out in evidence, in the case referred to, that the practice was different in this trade, and that goods were generally kept on board, it was therefore determined that the plaintiff was entitled to ecover.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">And in the case of <em>Tierney </em>vs. Etherington, reported at large by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>in delivering the opinion of the court in the case of <em>Pelly </em>vs. <em>The Governor and Company of the Royal Exchange Assurance, </em><footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark> the same principle is laid down. That was an insurance on goods in a <em>Dutch </em>ship from <em>Malaga </em>to <em>Gibraltar, </em>and at and from thence to <em>England </em>or <em>Holland. </em>This insurance was attended with an agreement, that upon the arrival of the ship at <em>Gibraltar, </em>the goods might be unladen, and reshipped in one or more <em>British </em>ship or ships for <em>England </em>and <em>Holland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Here it will be observed that the <em>goods </em>were insured in no other ships than the <em>Dutch </em>ship, in which they first were, and the <em>British </em>ship or ships, on board which they might be reshipped. But when the <em>Dutch </em>ship arrived at <em>Gibraltar, </em>the goods were unloaded, and put into a <em>store-ship, </em>which was considered as a warehouse, where, two days afterwards, they were lost in a storm. Now, although, by the terms of it, the policy did not protect the <em>goods </em>while in the <em>store-ship, </em>yet the plaintiff recovered, because <em>the assured, by putting them there, had pursued the known course of the trade, and therefore such a construction must be given as would indemnify the assured for the loss which had happened. </em>In this case, it was said by <em>Lee, </em>C. J., \u201c This manner of unloading and reshipping is to be considered as the <em>necessary means </em>of obtaining that which was intended by the policy, and seems to be the same as if it had happened in the act of reshipping from one ship to another; and as this is the known course of the trade, it seems extraordinary if it was not intended.\u201d And in the case of <em>Pelly </em>vs. <em>The Governor and Com- </em>[ * 206 ] <em>pany of the Royal Exchange </em>* <em>Assurance, </em>Lord <em>Mansfield </em>says, \u201c The insurer, in estimating the price, at which he is willing to indemnify against all risks, must have under his consideration the nature of the voyage to be performed, and the usual course and manner of doing it. Every thing done in the <em>usual course </em>must have been <em>foreseen, </em>and in <em>contemplation, </em>at the time he engaged. He took the risk upon a supposition that what was usual or necessary would be done.\u201d \u201c If it is usual to stay so long at a port, or to go out of the way, the insurer is considered as understanding that usage.\u201d \u201c The <em>means </em>must be taken to be insured, as well as the end.\u201d And Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>farther on in the same case, says that <em>\u201c </em>describing the voyage is an express reference to the usual manner of making it, as much as if every circumstance was mentioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">It remains to be considered, whether, in the application of these principles to the case at bar, it follows that the defendants are liable for the loss which has happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>The insurers knew the nature of the voyage, and the risks to which it was exposed; and knowing this, they insured the plaintiff against the restraint and detention of princes, <em>for the purpose of disposing of the outward, and procuring a return cargo ; </em>and while executing this purpose, (in the doing of which, it is expressly agreed that the captain conducted his sales and purchases, and his mercantile transactions, in all respects, according to the usage of the place,) the property in question was, by the orders of a sovereign prince, violently seized, while resting on the gunwale of the brig's boat, at that time in the possession of the crew ; and it has thereby been lost to the assured.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The master, without being chargeable with any want of prudence or discretion, was induced, by the art, fraud, and falsehood, of the <em>Dato Bassoiv, </em>to carry the opium on shore, and put it in his power, whose after-conduct shows that his original intention was not to pay for it, but to detain it by force. Can this property, in the meaning of the policy, * be considered as safely [ * 207 ] landed, in such manner as to put it out of the protection of the stipulated indemnity ?</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">This case is certainly very little like that of <em>Martin </em>vs. <em>The Salem M. Insurance Company, </em>which was cited in the argument. In that case, so far as respects the question now before us, upon a policy similar to this, for the purpose of selling the <em>outward, </em>and purchasing a <em>return </em>cargo, it was very properly determined, that the underwriters were not liable for the proceeds of the sales of the <em>outward </em>cargo, which, by the plunder and burning of <em>Cape.Franpois, </em>were destroyed, in the possession of a factor, with whom they had been several months deposited. In the case before us, when the policy, as made in relation to that particular trade, \u2014 the conduct of the captain, in conforming to the known practice of it, \u2014the base conduct of the <em>Dato Bassow, </em>by which the captain was induced to land the opium, \u2014 and the violence with which it was afterwards detained, \u2014 are taken \"into consideration, it may well be said that it was never <em>safely landed, </em>and consequently that when it was lost, the loss was occasioned by a risk insured against. But upon this part of the case no opinion is given, because \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">In a further attention to the facts agreed in this case, other considerations, favorable to the plaintiff, and which are believed to be decisive, present themselves. In deciding this cause, as has been before observed, the particular circumstances of the trade to be pursued in the voyage insured, are to be taken into consideration. Now, while the master, in the management of the concerns of his owners, is <em>conducting his sales and purchases, and his mercantile transactions, in all respects, according to the usage of the place, </em>it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>becomes proper (so conducting) to send on shore part of the cargo; and afterwards such transactions occur, as render it equally proper that it should be reshipped; and being in a boat o.f the ship for that purpose, the property is violently seized, taken away, and detained, either by the orders of a sovereign prince, or by assailing [ * 308 ] thieves, \u2014 there can be * no doubt that such is a violent seizure and detention, and renders the underwriters liable as much as they would be, if the property had been taken, in the same manner, from on board the ship itself. For although, in the <em>commencement </em>of the voyage, the insurance did not attach upon the <em>goods, </em>while in the act of .transportation in boats to the brig, nor until they were <em>on board, </em>and this from the terms of the policy, yet <em>during </em>the voyage, the goods were as much protected by the policy in the boats <em>while they were employed, as auxiliary to the legitimate purposes of the voyage, </em>as they were on board the ship. For all the purposes of the voyage, boats so <em>employed </em>are very reasonably considered as part of the ship. <footnotemark>(7)</footnotemark> It is our opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. <footnotemark>(8)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\n<em>Defendants defaulted..</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\"><em>Note.
