The DHRD matches the social security numbers against its files showing wages reported to it by employers as having been paid during the second and third prior quarters to persons with those numbers. (See Unemp. Ins. Code, \u00a7 1088.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus an individual must have been a recipient of AFDC approximately six months prior to the time the System obtains information about his earnings, and the earnings information itself is about six months old. The DHRD transmits the information to the DSW, which dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>tributes it to the county welfare departments for comparison with earnings disclosed to them by recipients.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In announcing the System, the DSW publicly stated that the purpose of the System is to determine the amount of unreported earnings of AFDC recipients, to deter fraud, and to save public funds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">.Upon the complaint of the Golden Gate Welfare Rights Organization, Inc. (hereinafter, \u201cGolden Gate\u201d), proceedings were had in superior court which culminated in respondent court\u2019s issuance of a modified preliminary injunction on March 2,-1972. The injunction restrained the Director of the DSW from acquiring information from the DHRD regarding the earnings of any AFDC recipient except in \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d or in cases where the recipient had given his prior consent. Distribution of earnings information obtained by using the System was similarly restrained. The Director was also forbidden to obtain such information in cases,.where the evidence of earnings supplied to the DSW or to' the particular county welfare department by the recipient himself was sufficient to determine his eligibility. After respondent court denied the Director\u2019s motion to vacate the injunction, the Director petitioned this court for a writ of prohibition or mandate. Since all pertinent issues can be thereby disposed of, we treat the petition as being one for mandamus. The public interest in a speedy determination of the issues makes the remedy appropriate. <em>(Mooney </em>v. <em>Pickett </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 669, 675 [94 Cal.Rptr. 279, 483 P.2d 1231].) We issued an order to show cause and temporarily stayed the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>States are not required to participate in the AFDC program, but once a state chooses to join it and take advantage of the substantial federal resources available, the state must comply with the mandatory requirements established by the Social Security Act, as interpreted and implemented by regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare (hereinafter, \u201cDHEW\u201d). <em>(King </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 309, 316-317 [20 L.Ed.2d 1118, 1125, 88 S.Ct. 2128, 2133]; <em>County of Alameda </em>v. <em>Carleson </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 730, 738-739 [97 Cal.Rptr. 385, 488 P.2d 953].)</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">Golden Gate\u2019s contention\u2014in the trial court and in the proceeding before us\u2014is that the System violates DHEW regulations codified in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.10(a)(12), which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-5\">\u201c(12) In determining initial and continuing eligibility:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-6\">\u201c(i) Applicants and recipients will be relied upon as the primary source of information in making the decision about their eligibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-7\">\u201c(ii) The agency [DSW] will help applicants, and recipients provide needed information, as necessary, or will obtain the information for them if, because of physical, mental, or other difficulties, they themselves are unable to provide it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-8\">\u201c(in) Verification of circumstances pertaining to eligibility will be limited to what is reasonably necessary to ensure the legality of expenditures under this program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-9\">\u201cUnder the requirements of this subparagraph:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-10\"><em>\u201c(a) </em>The agency takes no steps in the exploration of eligibility to which the applicant or recipient does not agree. It obtains specific consent for outside contacts, gives a clear explanation of what information is desired, why it is needed, and how it will be used [Golden Gate and the Director refer to this provision as the <em>\u201ccollateral consent </em>rule\u201d];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-11\"><em>\u201c(b) </em>If other procedures are followed in an exceptional situation, they are consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>subparagraph (10) of this paragraph [which requires that standards and methods for determining eligibility must respect the applicant\u2019s or recipient\u2019s constitutional, statutory, and civil rights, and must not harass him or violate his privacy and personal dignity], and the case record specifies what procedures were followed and why they were needed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-4\">\u201c(c) When information available from the applicant or recipient is inconclusive and does not support a decision of eligibility, the agency explains to the individual what questions remain and how he can resolve or help to resolve them, what actions the agency can take to resolve them and the need for their resolution if eligibility is to be established or reconfirmed. If the individual is unwilling to have the agency seek verifying information, the agency, unable to determine that eligibility exists, denies or terminates assistance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-5\"><em>\u201c(d) </em>If a simplified method is used in the determination and redetermination of eligibility, the requirements of \u00a7 205.20 of this chapter apply.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Golden Gate\u2019s theory (substantially accepted by respondent court) is, <em>first, </em>that the System\u2019s \u201cdragnet\u201d character\u2014i.e., its universal application to <em>all </em>AFDC recipients of age 16 or older\u2014is contrary to the import of the above regulations that verifying information, be obtained from \u201coutside contacts\u201d only in limited cases of necessity, i.e., \u201c[w]hen information available from the applicant or recipient is inconclusive and does not support a decision of eligibility . . .\u201d; and, <em>second, </em>that the System violates the collateral consent rule embodied in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.10(a)(12)(iii)(a), quoted <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">Golden Gate asserts that the pivotal issue in this case is \u201cthe fair meaning of federal regulations [45 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.10(a)(12), supra] which place exact and narrow restrictions upon [the Director\u2019s] conduct.\u201d In memo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>randum opinions which preceded the injunction, respondent court similarly viewed the problem as one of interpretation. The court rejected (and properly so) the Director\u2019s contention that the System is simply a means of \u201cquality control\u201d coming within the \u201cexceptional situation\u201d language of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.10(a)(12)(iii)(b), supra.<footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In response to the Director\u2019s argument that authority for the System is found in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 235.110(a)(1), which requires the DSW to establish and maintain \u201c[mjethods and criteria' for identifying situations in which a question of fraud in the [AFDC] program may exist,\u201d the court concluded that identification of possible fraud is \u201cinextricably linked\u201d to the determination of initial and continuing eligibility, and is therefore subject to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.10(a)(12), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">The crux of respondent court\u2019s decision to issue the injunction was its interpretation that, within the meaning of the collateral consent rule (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.10(a)(12)(iii)(a), <em>supra), </em>\u201coutside contacts\u201d include <em>other executive departments of the state government.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As an interpretive guide, the court quoted 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.50, which imposes upon the DSW strict prohibitions against disclosure of information, in <em>its </em>files, and which further requires that \u201cThe same policies are applied to requests for information [received by the DSW] from <em>a governmental authority, </em>the courts, or a law enforcement official as from any other outside source\u201d (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.50(a)(2)(v)). (Italics added.) Without distinguishing situations in which the two agencies are both agencies of the <em>same </em>state government (let alone of the same branch of government), respondent court held that \u201cTranslated into English this [quoted regulation] means that one agency\u2019s request for information from another agency is on the same footing as a request from the general public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">There was a paucity of prior administrative interpretation of the federal regulations to assist respondent court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court was unimpressed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>the Director\u2019s reliance upon part IV, section 2400, of the DHEW\u2019s \u201cHandbook of Public Assistance Administration,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which provides in relevant part that \u201cReliance on applicants and recipients as the primary source of information . . . will enable the agency to determine initial or continuing eligibility in a large percentage of cases on the basis of information provided by the individual, supplemented, <em>if necessary, </em>by information from <em>public records (i.e., records of a public agency).\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Apart from the fact that the Handbook\u2019s reference to \u201cpublic records\u201d applies only in cases where it is \u201cnecessary,\u201d respondent court was of the view that, absent a definition of \u201cpublic records\u201d in the DHEW\u2019s <em>regulations, </em>records of a public agency (here, the DHRD) which are <em>unavailable for public inspection </em>are not excluded from the collateral consent rule.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (See fn. 2, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Taking note that \u201cregulations validly prescribed by a government administrator are binding upon him as well as the citizen\u201d <em>(Service </em>v. <em>Dulles </em>(1957) 354 U.S. 363, 372 [1 L.Ed.2d 1403, 1410, 77 S.Ct. 1152, 1157]), respondent court drew support from the fact that, when a similar Earnings Clearance System was put into effect in Nevada in 1970, the DHEW disapproved it in a report which emphasized that \u201cPrior authorization to contact collateral sources of information was not secured in accordance with Federal policies.\u201d The DHEW report on the Nevada procedure, however, did not define the \u201ccollateral sources\u201d which it mentioned; the report showed that the Nevada AFDC agency had consulted \u201cother individuals or . . . other agencies or firms\u201d <em>in addition to </em>obtaining earnings information from the Nevada Employment Security Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">It is unnecessary, nonetheless, for us to determine whether respondent court correctly interpreted 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.10(a)(12), since we are of the opinion that, on its face, said regulation does not apply to the System inaugurated in California. In our view, respondent court erroneously equated the DSW\u2019s function \u201c[i]n determining initial and continuing eligibility\u201d (of which said regulation speaks) with the DSW\u2019s duty to establish and maintain \u201c[m]ethods and criteria for identifying situations in which a question of fraud in the program may exist\u201d (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 235.110(a)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Golden Gate\u2019s argument\u2014substantially agreed with by respondent court \u2014does not take into account the significance of the fact that, in its operation, the System obtains earnings information approximately six months old only for persons (16 years of age or older) who received AFDC payments <em>six months prior to the time the DHRD supplies the information to the DSW. </em>In short, the System looks to AFDC payments six months in the past, whereas 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.10(a)(12) looks to AFDC payments yet to be received. It is provided in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.10(a)(3) that \u201cA decision will be made promptly on applications, pursuant to reasonable State-established time standards not in excess of 30 days for . . . AFDC\u201d; 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.10(a)(6) specifies that \u201cEntitlement will begin as specified in the State plan, which (i) for financial assistance must be no later than the date of authorization of payment and, for the purposes of Federal financial participation, may be as early as the first of the month in which an application has been received and the individual meets all the eligibility conditions\u201d; and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.10(a)(9)(ii) provides that, where an individual has been determined to be eligible, eligibility will be reconsidered or redetermined \u201cPromptly, within 30 days, after a report is obtained which indicates changes in the individual\u2019s circumstances may affect the amount of assistance to which he is entitled or may make him ineligible . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">Insofar as it refers to the verification of eligibility information, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.10 addresses itself only to <em>future </em>payments.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The reliance which 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.10(a)(12)(i) places upon the applicant or recipient as \u201cthe primary source of information,\u201d and the restrictions imposed by the collateral consent rule, are singularly appropriate to futurity of payment, since 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.10(a)(12)(iii)(c) gives the applicant or recipient the option to minimize or avoid the consequences of fraud by its provision that \u201cIf the individual is unwilling to have the agency seek verifying information, the agency, unable to determine that eligibility exists, denies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>or terminates assistance . . . .\u201d Such option is meaningless as to AFDC payments already received (here, six months earlier).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">We hold, therefore, that the System is not within the intendment of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.10(a)(12); that the System violates no provision of federal or state law which has been cited to us by Golden Gate; and- that the System was established and is maintained as a method \u201cfor <em>identifying </em>situations in which a question of fraud in the program <em>may </em>exist\u201d (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 235.110(a)(1)).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Nor do we find a semblance of merit in Golden Gate\u2019s suggestion that the System subjects AFDC recipients to harassment, invasions of privacy, unlawful search and seizure, or other unconstitutional infringement. In this connection, Golden Gate relies heavily upon <em>Parrish </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 260 [57 Cal.Rptr. 623, 425 P.2d 223]; but there is a substantial distinction between \u201ca mass morning raid upon the homes of the county\u2019s welfare recipients,\u201d as in <em>Parrish (id. </em>at p. 262), and resort by the executive branch to its own records in the case at bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">In the absence of statutory or regulatory restriction, we find in the present case no impediment to the power of executive departments of the state government to share information which they have properly obtained. (See, <em>Abel </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1960) 362 U.S. 217, 240 [4 L.Ed.2d, 668, 687, 80 S.Ct. 683, 698]; <em>Bank of America Nat. Trust &amp; Sav.

We have proceeded on the premise that the vast piajority of AFDC recipients (including Golden Gate\u2019s members) are honest,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and that, as honest persons, they believe it to be eminently fair\u2014and simply common sense\u2014for the executive branch of the State of California to verify the legality of past AFDC payments by recourse to information which it has lawfully acquired and which is lawfully available for that purpose. Neither sound business practice nor the law demands less care if public confidence in the AFDC program is to be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">The order to show cause is discharged. Let a peremptory writ of man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>date issue commanding respondent court to set aside its modified preliminary injunction dated March 2, 1972, and to enter judgment that Golden Gate take nothing by its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">Richardson, P. J., and Friedman, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 22, 1972, and the petition of the real party in interest for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied October 5, 1972.

Although the article uses such language of limitation (p. 491), subdivision (e) does not; and the unofficial law review material, published long after the enactment of the subdivision, cannot be considered as a statement of legislative intent. <em>(In re Lavine </em>(1935) 2 Cal.2d 324, 327 [41 P.2d 161, 42 P.2d 311]; see also, <em>Takahashi </em>v. <em>Fish and Game Com. </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 719, 732 [185 P.2d 805], revd. on other grounds (1948) 334 U.S. 410 [92 L.Ed. 1478, 68 S.Ct. 1138].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"AM\"> 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 235.110 further requires the state agency administering AFDC to establish procedures for the investigation and referral to law enforcement officials of situations in which \u201cthere is\u201d a question of fraud.
