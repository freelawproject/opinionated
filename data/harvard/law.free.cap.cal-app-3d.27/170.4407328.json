The note was secured by a deed of trust that provided the trustee with the right of sale in the event of Universal\u2019s default. Both the note and the trust deed were in favor of Gibraltar Savings and Loan Association. Universal defaulted in payment on August 10, 1967; Gibraltar subsequently caused a trustee\u2019s sale to be held on June 24, 1968, and plaintiff purchased the property for $721,100. Defendant failed to vacate the premises after service of notice to quit on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>June 26, 1968. On July 1, 1968, plaintiff filed its first<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> action for unlawful detainer. On July 5, 1968, the parties executed a stipulation giving defendant the right to remain on the property \u201cuntil a trial court judgment [entitling] plaintiff MCA to a writ of possession or the appointment of a receiver,\u201d even though defendants \u201cadmit, acknowledge and agree that plaintiff MCA is now entitled to a writ of immediate possession pursuant to C.C.P. \u00a7 1166a for said real property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">In substance, defendant\u2019s answers to the complaints alleged, among other things, that the trustee\u2019s sale was null and void because it was improperly held, and sought, among other things, damages \u201cfor plaintiff\u2019s inducing [Gibraltar] to breach the indemnity agreement with defendants, and for plaintiff\u2019s intentional interference with the contractual relationship between [Gibraltar] and the defendants\u201d; and prayed: that the trustee\u2019s sale be declared null and void; that plaintiff be declared at most a mortgagee and not entitled to possession of the real property; and for damages for plaintiff\u2019s alleged collusion with the trustee as well as with Gibraltar.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">On December 26, 1968, plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment was granted, and it was ordered that plaintiff was entitled to possession of said property; that the issues relating to possession and the issue of damages be severed; and that the consolidated actions proceed to trial on the issue of damages for unlawful detention only.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">On June 2, 1969, after trial before a different judge on the issue of damages for unlawful detention, judgment was entered ordering that plaintiff recover possession of the real property in question, and that plaintiff recover from defendant the sum of $136,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">On appeal, defendant first contends that \u201cthe California procedure allowing a non-judicial trustee\u2019s sale fails to satisfy the due process requirements of the United States and California Constitutions.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s contention is unavailing, for even if we assume, arguendo, that the \u201cCali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>fomia procedure\u201d does violate due process, \u201cthe hearing required by due process is subject to waiver\u201d <em>(Boddie </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 378-379 [28 L.Ed.2d 113, 119, 91 S.Ct. 780]), and we believe that defendant clearly waived any such right.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">In <em>D. H. Overmyer Co. </em>v. <em>Frick Co., </em>405 U.S. 174, 188 [31 L.Ed.2d 124, 135, 92 S.Ct. 775], the United States Supreme Court, in holding that the right to prior notice and hearing had been waived in that case, made the following statement: \u201cOur holding, of course, is not controlling precedent for other facts of other cases. For example, where the contract is one of adhesion, where there is great disparity in bargaining power, and where the debtor receives nothing for [relinquishment of the right], other legal consequences may ensue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">In the case before us, defendant, a corporation, executed the trust deed as security on a promissory note of $715,000. Defendant neither complains of a great disparity of bargaining power, nor contends that it received nothing in exchange for its agreeing to a non-judicial trustee\u2019s sale in the event of its default. Defendant does contend, however, that it \u201ccannot be disputed that deeds of trust are usually embodied in form documents prepared by the lending institution, and do not constitute bargained for contracts in the usual sense of that term.\u201d Form contracts, however, are not adhesion contracts; the use of a form contract by one \u201cexercising a superior bargaining power\" is but one of the characteristics to be weighted by the finder of fact in trying a contract under a charge of adhesion. <em>(Tunkl </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California, </em>60 Cal.2d 92, 98-100 [32 Cal.Rptr. 33, 383 P.2d 441, 6 A.L.R.3d 693].) As a consequence, we find that the trust deed here in question did not constitute a contract of adhesion, and even if we were to assume that non-judicial trustee sales do violate a constitutional right to a prior hearing, defendant clearly waived any such right.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Defendant next contends that the trial court erred in granting plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment because its affidavits in opposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>to the motion raised triable issues of fact<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> with regard to plaintiff\u2019s title to the property in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">It is, of course, unquestioned that a summary judgment is improper whenever \u201caffidavits in opposition to said motion ... set forth facts showing that the [defendant] has a good and substantial defense to the plaintiff\u2019s action (or to a portion thereof). . . .\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c.)  The extent, however, to which a plaintiff\u2019s title may be a triable issue in an action brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1161a, subdivision 3 was discussed by the California Supreme Court in <em>Cheney </em>v. <em>Trauzettel, 9 </em>Cal.2d 158, 160 [69 P.2d 832]: \u201cIn our opinion the plaintiff need only prove a sale in compliance with the statute [Civ. Code, \u00a7 2924] and deed of trust, followed by purchase at such sale, and the defendant may raise objections only on that phase of the issue of tide.\u201d (See also, <em>Crummer </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>230 Cal.App.2d 264, 268 [40 Cal.Rptr. 826]; <em>Kartheiser </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>174 Cal.App.2d 617, 620 [345 P.2d 135]; and <em>Bliss </em>v. <em>Security-First Nat. Bank, </em>81 Cal.App.2d 50, 58-59 [183 P.2d 312].) \u201cIrrespective of the merits of [other] defenses raised by the answer, the alleged equitable grounds of attack on plaintiff\u2019s title have no place in the present summary proceeding, for if such issues are permissible, the proceeding entirely loses its summary character. . . . Matters affecting the validity of the trust deed or primary obligation itself, or other basic defects in the plaintiff\u2019s title, are neither properly raised in this summary proceeding for possession [Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1161a, subd. 3], nor are they concluded by the judgment.\u201d <em>(Cheney </em>v. <em>Trauzettel, supra, </em>at p. 160; see also, <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Coyne, </em>75 Cal.App.2d 69, 73 [170 P.2d 25]; <em>Seidell </em>v. <em>Anglo-California Trust Co., </em>55 Cal.App.2d 913, 921 [132 P.2d 12]; <em>Delpy </em>v. <em>Ono, </em>22 Cal.App.2d 301, 303 [70 P.2d 960]; Cf. <em>Union Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Chandler, 4 </em>Cal.App.3d 716, 721 [84 Cal.Rptr. 756].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">As a consequence, defendant\u2019s attacks upon plaintiff\u2019s title other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>by attempting to show plaintiff\u2019s noncompliance with Civil Code section 2924 did not constitute valid defenses to plaintiff\u2019s action, and therefore did not raise triable issues of fact. In addition, defendant\u2019s assertion of plaintiff\u2019s noncomp-liance with Civil Code section 2924 did not raise a triable issue \u201cbecause we do not find in the record any offer on the part of [defendant] to pay the full amount of the debt for which the property was given as security. Some disposition on the part of [defendant] to do equity by tendering the amount of the debt due is a prerequisite to [a] demand for a judgment cancelling the trustee\u2019s sale. (Py v. <em>Pleitner, </em>70 Cal.App.2d 576, 582 [161 P.2d 393], and cases cited. See also <em>Shimpones </em>v. <em>Stickney, </em>219 Cal. 637, 649 [28 P.2d 673].)\u201d <em>(Crummer </em>v. <em>Whitehead, supra, </em>at pp. 268-269; see also, <em>Humboldt etc. Society </em>v. <em>March, </em>136 Cal. 321, 324 [68 P. 968].)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Defendant further contends, however, that its asserted defenses did raise triable issues of fact for the reason that defendant had stipulated to plaintiff\u2019s right of possession, and in unlawful detainer actions where possession is undisputed, such defenses are properly before the court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In considering this contention, though, we need go no further than defendant\u2019s assertion that it had stipulated to plaintiff\u2019s right of possession; we do not believe that there was any such stipulation. The language of the stipulation upon which defendant relies is the following: \u201c1. Defendants . . . admit . . . that plaintiff ... is now entitled to a writ of immediate possession pursuant to C.C.P. \u00a7 1166a for said real property, in that defendant . . . among other things, has no property that is subject to execution sufficient to satisfy the amount of damages sought to be recovered by plaintiff. . . . However, defendant . . . shall remain in possession of said real property . . . until a trial court judgment which entitles plaintiff ... to a writ of possession or the appointment of a receiver for said real property.\u201d This language, at best, however, represents only a limited stipulation as to plaintiff\u2019s right of possession pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1166a.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cSince the purpose of section 1166a is to give immediate possession to the landlord where the tenant is insolvent on the apparent rationale that he may not respond to damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number><em>if </em>the landlord ultimately prevails in the unlawful detainer action, it is clear that the primary object of section 1166a is to ascertain whether the tenant is solvent or has sufficient property subject to execution so as to satisfy the judgment which the landlord may obtain for the damages incident to the unlawful detainer action. Accordingly, if the tenant is insolvent or does not have the property subject to execution he must immediately surrender the premises; if he is solvent he cannot be compelled to do so.\u201d <em>(Mihans </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>7 Cal.App.3d 479, 489 [87 Cal.Rptr. 17].) Therefore, defendant\u2019s stipulation as to plaintiff\u2019s right of possession pursuant to section 1166a was, in fact, only a limited stipulation that defendant was insolvent, and it was not a stipulation as to plaintiff\u2019s superior right of possession. A reading of the second paragraph of the stipulation shows clearly that the right of possession was a disputed issue: \u201c2. If trial court judgment is for plaintiff . . ., plaintiff . . . shall be entitled to immediate possession of said real property. . . . If trial court judgment is for defendant . . ., plaintiff . . . shall surrender possession if it is then in possession. . . .\u201d As a consequence, we find that defendant had not stipulated to plaintiff\u2019s superior right of possession, that possession was a disputed issue, and that, therefore, defendant\u2019s asserted defenses did not raise triable issues of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Defendant\u2019s next contention is that, for various reasons,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the trial court erred in not striking the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s expert witness. We have examined defendant\u2019s specific assignments of error and find the contention to be without merit.  \u201cGenerally speaking, opinion evidence as to value \u2018usually goes no further than to give the court more or less general ideas on the subject. From the evidence thus received a trial court must draw its own conclusions of value by a process of balancing and reconciling, . . .\u201d\u2019 <em>(City of Gilroy </em>v. <em>Filice, </em>221 Cal.App.2d 259, 268 [34 Cal.Rptr. 368].)  \u201cWhere a witness testifies as to value and bases his opinion entirely upon improper considerations or incompetent and inadmissible matters, his testimony may be properly stricken from the record [but where] the valuation testimony embraces proper as well as improper considerations, a motion to strike may properly be denied and the matter left to the court or jury to determine the weight to be given the testimony. The question is ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>dressed to the discretion of the trial court. . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 270-271.) \u201cAs the court said in <em>People </em>v. <em>Nahabedian, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.2d 302, 310 [340 P.2d 1053], \u2018[i]t must be remembered that the facts stated as reasons for the opinion of the witness do not become evidence in the sense that they have independent probative value upon the issue as to market value. On the contrary, they serve only to reinforce the judgment of the witness, that is, they go to the weight to be accorded his opinion [citation].\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 271.)  \u201cIt is almost the universal rule . . . that the trial court must be left to determine the qualifications of an expert [citations] and this determination will seldom, in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion, be reversed on appeal.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>247 Cal.App.2d 730, 735 [56 Cal.Rptr. 21].)  \u201cThe qualifications of an expert witness are for the trial court [citation] and any question as to the degree of his knowledge goes to the weight of his testimony rather than as to its admissibility.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Penny, </em>44 Cal.2d 861, 866 [285 P.2d 926].)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Defendant\u2019s final contention is that \u201cthe court erred in granting [plaintiff] damages for the portion of the property controlled and in the possession of [defendant\u2019s] subtenants. The only measure of damages applicable to this portion of the property, if any, would be the total rent received by [defendant] from the subtenants, less the costs incurred in maintaining the property for the subtenants.\u201d We cannot agree. The proper measure of damages in an action brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1161a, subdivision 3 is \u201cthe detriment to the owner because of the unlawful detention of the property, which could not be computed except from testimony which was adduced showing the reasonable rental value thereof.\u201d <em>(Stockton Morris Plan Co. </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>18 Cal.App.2d 205, 214 [63 P.2d 859]; see also, <em>Cruce </em>v. <em>Stein, </em>146 Cal.App.2d 688, 693 [304 P.2d 118].) Here, plaintiff\u2019s detriment caused by defendant\u2019s unlawful detention was measurable in the amount of a reasonable rental value that plaintiff might have realized had plaintiff not been denied possession unlawfully. As a consequence, the court committed no error by considering, in part, the rents received by defendant during the period of unlawful detention in measuring plaintiff\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Kaus, P.
