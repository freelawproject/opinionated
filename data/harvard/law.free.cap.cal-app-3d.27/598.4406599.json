McMaster and Alice M. McMaster appeal from a judgment of dismissal entered after general demurrers of City of Santa Rosa (City) and Francis Realty, Inc. (respondent) to the second amended complaint were sustained and plaintiffs failed to further amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The crucial and ultimate issue presented in this appeal involves the concept of procedural due process in the context of the sale of tax delinquent property.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Since appellants failed to pay their property taxes for the 1962-1963 fiscal year, ,the City, on July 5, 1968, conducted a tax sale wherein the property of appellants was sold to respondent Francis Realty, Inc. Subsequent to the sale the property was conveyed to respondent by a deed executed by the tax collector of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">Although it is clear from their second amended complaint that appellants\u2019 property was listed on the 1967-1968 published notice of sale, they allege that both the July 5, 1968 sale and the subsequent deed to respondent are invalid because the City violated seven provisions of the City of Santa Rosa Code (\u201cOrdinance\u201d) which regulates the procedure with respect to delinquent taxes and tax sale of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">Observing the rule that a general demurrer admits the truth of all the material factual allegations in the complaint <em>(Alcorn </em>v. <em>Anbro Engineering, Inc. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 493, 496 [86 Cal.Rptr. 88, 468 P.2d 216]), the violations charged in appellants\u2019 complaint must be taken as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">The ultimate legal question, therefore, is whether the alleged defects or irregularities are of such nature as to deprive the City of jurisdiction to consummate a valid tax sale of appellants\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">Resolution of this issue, in turn, involves a determination of the effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>of the state curative statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and/or the built-in curative provision of the City\u2019s Ordinance itself.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Appellants argue: (1) that the state curative statute is. inapplicable to the present case; (2) that the built-in curative provision of the Ordinance \u2014at best\u2014creates only prima facie evidence of the regularity of the proceedings; and (3) that the curative provisions cannot cure the charged violations because they are jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Appellants\u2019 first argument is obviously mistaken. Section 1 of the curative state statute validating certain acts of taxing agencies and revenue districts explicitly provides that \u2018\u201ctaxing agency\u2019 includes the state, county and <em>city.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) At the same time section 53 of the Charter of the City provides that all general laws of the state applicable to municipal corporations are applicable to the City unless they are in conflict with the charter, ordinances or resolutions of the City. Appellants fail to allege or show any such conflict.  As far as the curative provision of the Ordinance is concerned, we note that although section 8.180 is couched in evidentiary terms, it has the same effect as a curative statute <em>(Hall </em>v. <em>Chamberlain </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 673, 678 [192 P.2d 759]; cf. <em>Ramish </em>v. <em>Hartwell </em>(1899) 126 Cal. 443 [58 P. 920]; 47 Cal.Jur.2d, \u00a7 340, pp. 89-90).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Appellants\u2019 third contention, in essence, is that the irregularities in the tax sale procedure were violative of the adequate notice requirement, inherent in due process of law; consequently, appellants claim they were jurisdictional violations which could not be remedied by curative legislation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">It is, of course, elementary that, although it is a matter of common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>knowledge that failure to pay property taxes can result in penalties, including loss of the property, the property may not be taken from its' owner without due process of law. The fundamental requisite of due process is <em>notice, </em>reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise the interested parties of the pendency of the action and to afford them opportunity to be heard <em>(Mullane </em>v. <em>Central Hanover Tr. Co. </em>(1950) 339 U.S. 306, 314 [94 L.Ed. 865, 873, 70 S.Ct. 652]; <em>Milliken </em>v. <em>Meyer </em>(1940) 311 U.S. 457, 463 [85 L.Ed. 278, 283, 61 S.Ct. 339, 132 A.L.R. 1357]). While'there is no constitutional mandate which makes specific how that notice is to be given or which form it must take, the questions of notice and due process are so inextricably part and parcel of each other that there can be no due process without the sovereign following some procedure which, according to common experience, should reasonably give notice of impending interference with ownership or right of possession. <em>(Litchfield </em>v. <em>County of Marin </em>(1955) 130 Cal.App.2d 806, 813 [280 P.2d 117].)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The cases make it explicit that the notice required by statute in tax sale proceedings is designed to afford the property owner protection and enable him to pay taxes <em>before the title passes from him (Sawyer </em>v. <em>Berkeley Securities Co. </em>(1929) 99 Cal.App. 545, 548 [279 P. 217]). Based upon this premise, it has been held that, <em>where </em>the taxing power has acquired private property by due process of law and <em>the title has passed to the state, the state may, </em>without violating any rights; or due process, <em>sell the property without giving notice to the individual owner </em>at all, or may give such notice as, in its discretion, seems proper <em>(Fox </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1907) 152 Cal. 59 [91 P. 1005]; 47 Cal.Jur.2d, \u00a7 321, pp. 65-66).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In the instant case, as we have pointed out, appellants were delinquent in their taxes for the 1962-1963 fiscal year. When this occurred certain provisions of the City\u2019s Ordinance came into' play.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, section 8.153 of the Ordinance provides for the publication of the delinquent list on or before June 8 each year. Section 8.154 provides that \u201cWith the delinquent list the tax collector shall publish a notice specifying: (a) that unless the taxes, penalties and costs are paid the real property on which they are a lien will be sold; (b) the time and place at which the property will be sold to the city by operation of law. (Ord. 554, Sec. 902).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">' Section 8.162 provides that \u201cNot less than twenty-one nor more than twenty-eight days after the first publication of the delinquent list, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>time fixed in the publication, the real property on which all taxes, penalties and costs have not been paid, except tax sold property and possessory interests, shall by operation of law and the declaration of the tax collector be sold to the city. The sale shall be in the tax collector\u2019s office. (Ord. 554, Sec. 936)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">As a result, therefore, it must be concluded: (1) that prior to June 8, 1963 the City tax collector published a delinquent list which included appellants\u2019 property and a notice that unless the taxes, penalties and costs were paid the real property on which they were a lien would be sold, and the time and place at which the property would be sold to the City by operation of law; and (2) that not later than 28 days after the first publication of the delinquent list appellants\u2019 property was sold by operation of law in the tax collector\u2019s office to the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Since appellants do not allege any failure on the part of the City to comply with any of these sections, it must be conclusively presumed that the City did, in fact, perform the duties thereby imposed and that appellants received the only notice to which they were entitled by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Notwithstanding receipt of this notice, appellants now point to claimed \u201cjurisdictional\u201d irregularities occurring thereafter which they contend vitiate the sale to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The cases have not established a clear-cut definition of what does or does not constitute a \u201cjurisdictional defect.\u201d Perhaps the most definitive expression is that contained in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>McKenna </em>(1944) 23 Cal.2d 774, 782 [147 P.2d 531]: \u201cAmong the jurisdictional requisites are (a) a duly constituted taxing authority; (b) property to be taxed within the territorial jurisdiction of the taxing body; (c) property or subject matter legally subject to the tax; and (d) sufficient notice and opportunity for hearing to constitute compliance with due process. [Citations.] <em>While the Legislature cannot cure the omission of jurisdictional requisites, the manner of procedure, after jurisdiction is acquired and the mandates of due process are complied with, are matters within the legislative discretion and may be subjected to the exercise of the healing power so long as further constitutional inhibitions are </em>observed.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The test seems to be that if a particular requisite of the ordinance could have been omitted by the legislative body in the first place, then a failure to comply with it is not jurisdictional <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 654 [222 P.2d 319]).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">We, therefore, turn to the alleged violations and test them in the light of these established principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>A. <em>Tax Roll and Tax Bill Defects.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Appellants allege that the assessor failed (1) to enter on the tax roll the fact that the property had been sold and the date of sale, and (2) failed to indicate on the tax bills subsequent to 1963-1964 that appellants\u2019 property had been sold and the date of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">These precise claims were raised and rejected by the court in <em>Bank of Lemoore </em>v. <em>Fulgham </em>(1907) 151 Cal. 234, 239 [90 P. 936], holding that such defects were cured by a statute making the tax deed conclusive evidence of the regularity of the tax sale proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">B. <em>Notice of Sale Defects.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">1. <em>Contents of the Notice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Appellants set forth four separate defects as to the contents of the published notice of sale in 1968. Thus, they assert: (1) failure to specify the place of sale; (2) failure to state <em>when </em>appellants\u2019 property was to be sold; (3) failure to set forth the minimum amount of acceptable bid; and (4) the absence of a date on the notice of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">None of these defects is of jurisdictional stature for it has long been established that the form and content of tax delinquency notices are \u201cdetails which are subject to legislative or administrative discretion, and defects therein are related to the mode of the exercise of the power, which being merely directory, may be made effective by a curative act. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(City of Compton </em>v. <em>Boland </em>(1945) 26 Cal.2d 310, 316 [158 P.2d 397].)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">2. <em>Failure to Mail Notice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">In addition to the required publication of notice of sale, the City Ordinance provides in section 8.160 that \u201cWithin five days after publication of the notice of sale of tax sold property and at least twenty-one days before the date of sale, when tax sold property is to be sold at public auction, the tax collector shall mail to the last assessee either a copy of the publication or a notice of sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">It is alleged that the City failed to mail such notice to' appellants. It is this omission to which appellants address their major due process, argument. Although this precise defect was once determined by the Court of Appeal to be nonjurisdictional, that decision was supplanted by the opinion of the Supreme Court, after it had granted a hearing <em>(Tannhauser </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1947) 31 Cal.2d 169 [187 P.2d 716, 5 A.L.R.2d 1015]). The Supreme Court reached the same end result as the Court of Appeal, but on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>entirely different basis which eliminated the need for the high court to consider the issue of the jurisdictional or nonjurisdictional nature of the defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">We share the same view, however, as expressed by the trial judge in his scholarly memorandum opinion that the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in <em>Tannhauser </em>was sound and remains sound; namely, that publication of notice is all of the \u201cdue process\u201d notice to- which the delinquent taxpayer is entitled, and that \u201cAs far as the mailing of additional notices of sale prior to the sales to and from the State, or the mailing of any additional notices at all is concerned, such notices could have been done away with or not required by the legislature in the first instance without doing violence to due process.\u201d (182 P.2d 280, 283.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Having satisfied ourselves that appellants were not deprived of due process, we call to mind and repeat the very salutary public policy which is the genesis of validating or curative legislation: \u201cThe purpose of the validating statute is to rehabilitate tax-deeded property and procure its return to the tax rolls. The accomplishment of the purpose is conducive to equality in assessments for the support of government and therefore to stability in government. It is a matter of public importance, therefore, that the validating act be applied to- effectuate the legislative purpose so long as constitutional mandates are observed.\u201d <em>(City of Compton </em>v. <em>Boland, supra, </em>26 Cal.2d at p. 316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Taylor, P. J., and Rouse, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The curative state statute (Stats. 1968, Reg. Sess., ch. 480) provides, inter alia, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFz\">\u201cSection 1. As used in this act \u2018taxing agency\u2019 includes the state, county, and city ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACm\">\u201cSec. 3. Every act and proceeding heretofore taken by any taxing agency ... or the officers thereof relative ... to tax sales or certificates of tax sales, tax deeds or other conveyances, are hereby confirmed, validated and declared legally effective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVg\">\u201cSec. 4. (a) This act is limited to the correction of defects, irregularities and ministerial errors which the Legislature originally could have omitted from the statutory requirements of law under which the acts hereby confirmed, validated and declared legally effective were taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeB\">\u201c(b) This act is limited to the validation of acts and proceedings to the extent to which the same can be effectuated under the State and Federal Constitutions.\"</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b533-13\">Section 8.180 reads as follows: \u201cThe deed, duly acknowledged or proved, is conclusive evidence, except against actual fraud, of the regularity of all other proceedings, from the assessment of the assessor to the execution of the deed, both inclusive. (Ord. 554, Sec. 1000)\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Although these precise sections were not referred to by the parties in their briefs, we take judicial notice of them.
