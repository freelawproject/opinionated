This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">We adopt the factual statement set forth in defendant\u2019s brief, and there is no need for restating the facts here as the sole issue on appeal relates to the instruction as to burden of proof in the defense of entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">The trial court instructed the jury that the \u201cdefendant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entrapped into the commission of the crime.\u201d (CALJIC instruction No. 4.63, based upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Valverde, </em>246 Cal.App.2d 318 [54 Cal.Rptr. 528] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>1 Cal.3d 755, 760 [83 Cal.Rptr. 411, 463 P.2d 763].) The court refused defendant\u2019s requested instruction that \u201cif the evidence in the case should leave you with a reasonable doubt whether the defendant had the previous intent or purpose to commit any offense of the character here charged, and did so only because he was induced or persuaded by some officer or agent of the Government, then it is your duty to- acquit him.\u201d (Based on federal entrapment cases.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">Defendant argues that the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Loggins, </em>23 Cal.App.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>597 [100 Cal.Rptr. 528] held that it was error to instruct that \u201cthe burden is on the defendant to raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt of the charge of murder [CALJIC No. 5.15].\u201d He also contends that CALJIC No. 4.63 (the instruction given) is in conflict with Penal Code section 1096, declaring that guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt, and urges that <em>In re Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 90 S.Ct. 1068] compels the instruction that \u201cthe People have the burden of disproving [the] defense [of entrapment] beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rather than the instruction which was given.  We disagree. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Moran </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 755, 760-761 [83 Cal.Rptr. 411, 463 P.2d 763], the court stated: \u201cDefendant also contends that the recent enactment of the Evidence Code overturn's the holding in <em>People </em>v. <em>Valverde </em>(1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 318 [54 Cal.Rptr. 528] that the defendant has the burden of proving entrapment by a preponderance of the evidence. Evidence Code section 501<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> subjects statutory burdens of proof in criminal cases to Penal Code section 1096,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which requires the prosecution to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant\u2019s burden to prove entrapment, however, is not subject to Penal Code section 1096, for the defense of entrapment in California is not based on the defendant\u2019s inno cence. The courts have created the defense as a control on illegal police conduct \u2018out of regard for [the court\u2019s] own dignity, and in the exercise of its power and the performance of its duty to formulate and apply proper standards for judicial enforcement of the criminal law.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Benford, supra, </em>53 Cal.2d 1, 9 [345 P.2d 928].) Moreover, this court acknowledged the continuing validity of the rule of the <em>Valverde </em>case in <em>In re Dennis M. </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 444, 457, fn. 10 [75 Cal.Rptr. 1, 450 P.2d 296].<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The rale of <em>Winship </em>is not contrary to the rale of <em>Moran. </em>In <em>Winship </em>(decided two months after <em>Morari </em>was decided), the court wrote that \u201cthe Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 364 [25 L.Ed.2d at p. 375].) However, quite apart from the constitutional requirement that each element <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>of the corpus delicti of any crime be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, there exist \u201cspecial defenses which are not elements of the crime . . .; among these is entrapment.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Valverde, supra, </em>at p. 324, cited with approval in <em>Moran.) </em>\u201c[T]he defense of entrapment in California is not based on the defendant\u2019s innocence. The courts have created the defense as a control on illegal police conduct . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moran, supra, </em>at p. 760.) Since entrapment is not an element of the corpus delicti of all crimes, then the absence of entrapment is not a \u201cfact necessary to constitute the crime.\u201d <em>(In re Winship, supra, </em>at p. 364 [25 L.Ed.2d at p. 375].)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Kaus, P.
