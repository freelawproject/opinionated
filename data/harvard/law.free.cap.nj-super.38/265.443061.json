Barger, </em>33 <em>N. J. Super. </em>491 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">The mandate provided, in part, that \u201cthe record be remitted to the Superior Court, Chancery Division, to be there proceeded with in accordance with the rules and practice relating to that Court, <em>consistent </em>with the opinion of this Court.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Thereupon counsel for the appellants made an application to vacate the judgment which the judge below denied on the basis of an asserted lack of authority. In the circumstances, this action was erroneous.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">\u201cIt is the well established, if not the universally accepted, rule that the trial court is under a peremptory duty to obey in the particular case the * * * mandate of the appellate court precisely as it is written, even though the * * * mandate is manifestly erroneous.\u201d <em>Hellstern v. Smelowitz, </em>17 <em>N. J. Super. </em>366, 370 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-8\"><em>Vide, In re Plainfield-Union Water Co., </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>296, 303-304 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">From a reading of the transcript of the argument on the application to vacate the judgment, we are satisfied that the action of the court resulting in the order here for review stemmed from a misconception of our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">Accordingly we reverse that order and remand the cause to the Chancery Division with directions to vacate the judgments, and to accord all parties to the actions a trial on the merits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
