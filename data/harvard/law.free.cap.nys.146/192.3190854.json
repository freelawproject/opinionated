The answer sets up a general denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-16\">The contract, which was in writing, provided for any necessary subordination agreement (in relation to the second mortgage), but was silent as to any estoppel certificates on junior mortgages. Plaintiffs, claiming to act as defendant\u2019s agent, signed an application to the -title company for a loan, but no mention was made therein as to defendant procuring such estoppel certificates from subsequent mortgagees as might be requested by the title company. On September 15, 1913, plaintiffs procured from the title company, whose client mortgage company held the first mortgage, a written conditional agreement to make said loan, to be a first lien on the premises 241 East 123d street, the mortgage to- run for five years at <em>5y2 </em>per cent, interest \u201csubject to the requirements and regulations of this company.\u201d What these requirements and regulations were the conditional acceptance did not disclose.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-17\">The parties met for the purpose of closing the transaction, when the attorney representing the mortgage company demanded an estoppel certificate from the holder of an alleged unpaid third mortgage on which no interest had been paid for over twenty years, and, because defendant could not produce the desired estoppel certificate, the closing fell through.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>The legal effect of the conditional acceptance the title company signed was simply an agreement to make a loan and to accept an assignment of the mortgage held by defendant, as security therefor, subject to any requirement it might see fit to impose, or at its pleasure. The procuring of such a conditional acceptance by plaintiffs was not such a performance of the brokers\u2019 duty as would entitle them to commissions. Holliday v. Roxbury Distilling Co., 130 App. Div. 645, 656, 657, 115 N. Y. Supp. 383; Duckworth v. Rogers, 109 App. Div. 168-170, 95 N. Y. Supp. 1089; Ashfield v. Case, 93 App. Div. 452, 453, 87 N. Y. Supp. 649; Crasto v. White, 52 , Hun, 473, 476, 477, 5 N. Y. Supp. 718; Steele v. Lippman (Sup.) 115 N. Y. Supp. 1099, 1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\">The plaintiffs having failed to perform their contract to obtain a loan for defendant, based on the acceptance by the lender of an assignment of defendant\u2019s mortgage as security, have established no cause of action against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, with costs, and the complaint dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
