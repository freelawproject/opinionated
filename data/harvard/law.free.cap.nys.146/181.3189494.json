These checks were, after such indorsement, deposited with the defendant bank and collected by it for its depositors.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The answer denies that the indorsements were forgeries, and alleges that plaintiff\u2019s employ\u00e9 who indorsed said checks in plaintiff\u2019s name was authorized so to do, and that defendant acted in good faith and in due course of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">It was stipulated that the plaintiff owned the checks in question; that its only officers were Norman C. Brizse, president, and Percy H. Pinder, secretary and treasurer; that it employed as a stenographer one Harriet Cohen, who was accustomed to make its deposits in the Greenwich Bank, and who was authorized to indorse its checks with a rubber stamp as follows: \u201cPay to the order of the Greenwich Bank. The Standard Steam Specialty Company\u201d\u2014and to affix at the end of the stamp indorsement, in her handwriting, the words \u201cPercy H. Pinder, Treasurer\u201d; and that \u201cHarriet Cohen was not verbally or in writing instructed or authorized by the officers of the Standard Steam Specialty Company to indorse checks, except in the manner above set forth\u201d; also, that Harriet Cohen either- took the 11 checks in question from the mail, or they were delivered to her for indorsement for deposit in the Greenwich Bank, and instead of indorsing the checks in question with the rubber stamp, \u201cPay to the order of the Greenwich Bank. The Standard Steam Specialty Company,\u201d and adding in her own writing, \u201cPercy H. Pinder, Treasurer,\u201d as she was alone authorized to do, she indorsed them with the blank indorsement, wholly in her handwriting, \u201cStandard Steam Specialty Company, Percy H. Pinder, Treasurer,\u201d \u201cHarriet Cohen,\u201d or \u201cH. Cohen\u201d; that she then delivered the 11 checks, 9 to one reputable business man and 2 to another reputable business man, who in good faith paid her the full amount thereof in cash, without knowledge of any wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">[ 1 ] Where a bank has collected a check upon which the payee\u2019s indorsement \u201cis forged or made without authority of the person whose signature it purports to be\u201d (Negotiable Instrument Law, \u00a7 42), it cannot retain the money, since it had no title to the instrument upon which the money was paid, \u201cunless the party against whom it is sought to enforce such right is precluded from setting up the forgery or want of authority.\u201d Its indorsement is a warranty of the genuineness of prior indorsements, and, upon the discovery that any indorsement is a forgery, it becomes immediately liable to make good the amount it has received. Seaboard Nat. Bank v. Bank of America, 193 N. Y. 26, 30, 31, 85 N. E. 829, 22 L. R A. (N. S.) 499; Oriental Bank v. Gallo, 112 App. Div. 360, 362, 98 N. Y. Supp. 561, affirmed 188 N. Y. 610, 81 N. E. 1170; Stein v. Empire Trust Co., 148 App. Div. 850, 853, 133 N. Y. Supp. 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> Authority to an agent to indorse checks in a specifically restricted manner, in order that they may be deposited to the account of the principal, does not confer upon the agent authority to indorse in any other manner or for any other purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>In Schmidt v. Garfield Nat. Bank, 64 Hun, 298, 19 N. Y. Supp. 252, affirmed without opinion in 138 N. Y. 631, 33 N. E. 1084, upon a state of facts practically identical with the case at bar, the learned court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-4\">\u201cLingard had authority to use the stamp and to sign the plaintiff\u2019s name under the stamping upon the checks and. drafts, adding his own initials thereto, and thereupon to cause the checks and drafts bearing such restricted indorsement to be deposited in the Chemical National Bank, to the credit of the plaintiff. But such authority gave Lingard no right to indorse the plaintiff\u2019s name, except in connection with a restricted indorsement made by stamping the checks and drafts with the stamp provided for that purpose by the plaintiff. * * * Assuming that he had authority to use the stamp and sign the plaintiff\u2019s name in connection with the use thereof, and then cause the checks and drafts to be deposited to the plaintiff\u2019s account in the Chemical Bank, his action in indorsing the checks with the plaintiff\u2019s name without using the stamp, and depositing such checks and drafts to his own account in the Garfield National \u2022 Bank, was absolutely without any authority or justification whatever. There was therefore not only no testimony which would justify the court in holding that Lingard had authority to indorse the checks and drafts in the manner in which he did, but there was no conflict in the testimony which required the court to submit, or would have justified it in submitting, the question to the jury, as to whether Lingard had authority to indorse the checks in the manner in which he did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">See, also, Cluett v. Couture, 140 App. Div. 830, 125 N. Y. Supp. 813, citing this case with approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The case of Salen v. Bank of State of New York, 110 App. Div. 636, 97 N. Y. Supp. 361, relied upon by respondent as authority for the proposition that plaintiff is precluded herein from denying the authority of its agent, Harriet Cohen, is not on all fours with the case at bar. In the case cited the agent had general authority to indorse checks for the purpose of depositing them to the credit of his principal ; but the exact method of indorsement was not prescribed and restricted as in the case at bar. In this case the sole authority reposed in Harriet Cohen, as to indorsement, was to perform the physical act of affixing the stamp indorsement on the backs of checks, \u201cPay to the order of the Greenwich Bank. The Standard Steam 'Specialty Company,\u201d and adding thereto in her own handwriting the words \u201cPercy H. Pinder, Treasurer.\u201d Had she performed this sole act she was authorized to perform in the restricted manner prescribed, defendant bank could not have been misled thereby. The indorsement of the plaintiff\u2019s name by her in any 'other form whatever was an act of forgery and could convey no title either to the persons to whom she transferred the checks or through them to the defendant bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">It is also to be noted that in the Salen Case the agent had general authority to draw checks against deposits which he was- authorizad to make and to use the proceeds thereof, thus indicating that there was no intent to limit his authority to the performing of a mere carefully restricted physical act.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">No act .of the plaintiff herein would work as an estoppel under section 42 of the Negotiable Instruments Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The fact that a check of a corporation is indorsed by an officer or agent thereof in blank, or to his own order, puts a bank, upon receiving such checks, on inquiry (Niagara Woolen Co. v. Pacific Bank, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>141 App. Div. 265, 267-269, 126 N. Y. Supp. 890; Ward v. City Trust Co., 192 N. Y. 61, 69, 84 N. E. 585; Squire v. Ordemann, 194 N. Y. 394, 396, 397, 87 N. E. 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">It is urged by the respondent that the defendant bank is in a different position because it did not deal directly with the wrongdoer. We are unable to see that its position is altered in any respect by reason of this fact. The indorsement being a forgery, it could convey no title to the transferee thereof, and the invalidity of the indorsements could not be cured by subsequent transfer to others. Defendant\u2019s depositor, having no title, could convey none to the defendant, and defendant, having no title and having wrongfully collected the moneys represented by the checks, is liable for the amounts thus wrongfully received.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Eor this reason the judgment must be reversed, with costs and judgment directed in favor of the plaintiff for the full amount claimed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">DEEANY, J., concurs.
