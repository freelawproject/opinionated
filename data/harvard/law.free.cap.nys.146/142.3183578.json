The motorman knew the condition of his car and his ability to abate its speed so as to permit the execution of his order, and the jury should have been charged that, if the plaintiff crossed in obedience to the command, he was not negligent in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-20\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> There is-no exception to the refusal or to the accompanying charge of the court, but, as the issue of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence depended upon the charge as requested, the absence of the exception should be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-21\">The judgment and order should be reversed; and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event.
