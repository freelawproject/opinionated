(2) Further answering said complaint, the defendant denies knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to each and every allegation therein contained, not hereinbefore specifically admitted or denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The defendant then sets up a separate defense, alleging that a condition of the contract under which the plaintiff purchased was that \u201cany stock that does not prove to be true to name as labeled is to be replaced free or purchase price refunded,\u201d and then offers and 'pays into court upon the trial the amount of the purchase price, together with a sum sufficient to pay the interest, and then, \u201cfurther answering said complaint, defendant denies, upon information and belief, each and every allegation therein contained, not hereinbefore admitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">We are of the opinion that the affirmative defense pleaded is of no . value to the defendant, unless it appears from the evidence that there was a substantial performance of the contract on his part; the clause permitting replacements or the refunding of the money being intended merely to provide for incidental errors in the delivery of the trees and not to an entire failure to perform the conditions of the contract. Sanford v. Brown Bros. Co., 134 App. Div. 652, 119 N. Y. Supp. 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\"><bracketnum>[2,3]</bracketnum> We come, then, to the question of whether the plaintiff has established the cause of action alleged, this question being presented by the motion to dismiss at the close of the evidence and by the motion for a new trial; both of these motions having been denied, the defendant taking exceptions. It will be recalled that the complaint alleged the purchase from the defendant of upwards of 300 trees, and that it was agreed that these trees should be of the varieties known as McIntosh Reds, Delaware Reds, and Fameuse; and the answer admitted that this was the contract entered into between the parties. The complaint also alleged that the \u201cplaintiff has recently discovered that said trees were not Fameuse or McIntosh Reds or Delaware Reds, but were of other varieties known as Ben Davis and others,\u201d and this allegation is denied, so the plaintiff, in order to establish any cause of action for a breach of the contract which, as we have seen by its terms, is one to be satisfied with substantial performance, must show that a substantial proportion of the trees delivered by the defendant were not of the varieties known as McIntosh Reds, Delaware Reds, and Fameuse, for it is still necessary that judgments should be rendered in conformity with the allegations and proofs of the parties; secundum allegata et probata is fundamental in the administration of justice. Wright v. Delafield, 25 N. Y. 266, 268. The defendant admitted the selling of the Fameuse, the Delaware Reds, and the McIntosh Reds, just as alleged in the complaint; and the plaintiff testified that he could not remember just how many trees-he purchased since 1906. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>\"In 1906,\u201d he says, <em>\u201cI </em>had two orders, 37 trees; they were to be McIntosh Reds and Fameuse; in 1907, 100; in 1908, 65; in 1909, 30.\u201d This makes a total not upwards of 300 but of 232, and the witness says he has not purchased any since 1909, and he says, \u201cI purchased Fameuse and McIntosh Reds from him;\u201d but he alleged in his complaint that he purchased Delaware Reds, and this fact was admitted, and the only trees which he specifically says were to be McIntosh Reds and Fameuse were the 37 trees purchased in 1906, so we must assume that the other 195 were either to be Delaware Reds or of the other two varieties alleged in the complaint; and the record will be searched in vain for any evidence that all of the trees in this orchard, with the exception of one Ben Davis tree, were not comprised within these three varieties, for this court can hardly take judicial notice that Delaware Reds are not common fruit, if it can be said that there is any real evidence that any part of the trees were in fact common fruit. No one of the witnesses claimed to be able to distinguish between the kind of trees before they bore fruit, and the plaintiff testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">\u201cI could not tell how many of these trees have borne fruit because I have not counted them. As near as I can tell, near enough, 25.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">This was certainly indefinite enough, although it might have been \u201cnear enough\u201d to suit the plaintiff\u2019s purposes; and he then tells us that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">\u201cOne variety is Ben Davis; the rest I cannot tell you. I know the McIntosh Beds and Fameuse. There are none of them,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">\u2014referring, we suppose, to the trees which have borne fruit, for it immediately follows his guess of 25 bearing trees in the record, and then he adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">\u201cI did not buy any Ben Davis; they are not worth while cultivating and growing.\u201d'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">There is a suggestion in the evidence, but not very direct, that there was one Ben Davis apple tree upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises; certainly there is no evidence which would warrant any one in concluding that there were any more. One witness, it is true, testifies that he visited the orchard in question, and that there \u201care no Fameuse or McIntosh Reds among those trees\u201d; but he admitted immediately afterwards that he could not distinguish \u201cthe McIntosh Reds from Fameuse or common fruit by going through his orchard,\u201d but said that he formed his judgment from the fruit which he picked up under the trees, and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-11\">\u201cThere was one tree we got Ben Davis from. The rest of them I don\u2019t know what variety they are. They are good for nothing, common fruit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">But all of this must be referred to the 25 trees more or less out of the orchard which had borne fruit, and there is not a particle of evidence that the so-called common fruit is not the Delaware Reds alleged in the complaint, with the exception that the plaintiff testified that there is \u201cone other tree in the young orchard than thoge purchased from Sherwood, an early apple tree, an old tree;\u201d and there is nothing \u00b1o show that the witness Weaver, who was clearly testifying as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>wise farmer of the neighborhood rather than from any definite knowledge of the facts, did not pick up some of his sample apples, from under this very tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\">The fact, if it is a fact, that out of the 25 more or less bearing trees there were no Fameuse or McIntosh Reds, and that there was one Ben Davis, the others not being known to the witness, does not establish a breach of the contract alleged by the plaintiff, for it fails entirely to negative the presumption that substantially all of the other trees were Delaware Reds. The only positive evidence of the purchase of Fameuse and McIntosh Reds is given by the plaintiff, who says that he purchased <em>37 </em>trees in 1906, and that these were to be of those varieties, and, if none of these were found among the 25 bearing trees, it would not establish that there were not the required number in the orchard, especially where it does not appear that the bearing trees were the ones which were labeled as belonging to these varieties. Concededly there were to be Delaware Reds among the trees sold and delivered to the plaintiff; the complaint alleges this; and the allegation is specifically admitted by the defendant, so that this fact is established beyond controversy; and, until the plaintiff has established that the orchard is not made up substantially of the three varieties which he says he purchased from the defendant, he has failed to make out the breach of the contract which he has alleged, and he has no right to any damages. The presumption must be that the defendant has delivered the goods contracted to be delivered, and evidence that out of a group of 25 trees, in an orchard of several hundred, there are no trees of two of the varieties is not meeting the burden of proof; is not furnishing any proof whatever of a violation of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">The court disapproves of the findings of fact that the defendant failed to perform the contract, and that the plaintiff suffered damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
