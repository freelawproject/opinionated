By the written agreement of employment, the hotel \u201cagrees to hire the employ\u00e9, beginning November 26, 1912, from month to month at the monthly wage of $60.\u201d On December 30, 1912, plaintiff left of his own accord in connection with a strike which then took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-21\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The validity of the agreement is not attacked on the score of lack of mutuality, nor can it well be. It is signed by both parties, and, although the employ\u00e9 does not expressly engage himself to the service, the provision that he may terminate the agreement by a certain notice in writing indicates plainly his intention to so bind himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-22\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Consequently, by the terms of the contract, plaintiff is hired and agrees to serve a full month, which by other terms of the agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>is automatically renewed from month to month. It is not an indefinite employment at a certain rate per month. Watson v. Gugino, 204 N. Y. 532, 541, 98 N. E. 18, 39 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1090, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 215; Martin v. N. Y. D. Ins. Co., 148 N. Y. 117, 42 N. E. 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-3\"><bracketnum>[3, 4]</bracketnum> Under these circumstances, although his action may be brought either on an express contract or for quantum meruit, or both (Rubin v. Cohen, 129 App. Div. 395, 113 N. Y. Supp. 843; Byrne v. Gillies, 144 App. Div. 677, 129 N. Y. Supp. 602), he cannot recover on either theory, unless he has performed his agreement. Lawson v. Hogan, 93 N. Y. 39, 44; Robinson v. Chinese Association, 47 App. Div. 69, 62 N. Y. Supp. 292; Exeter Works v. Wonham Works, 134 App. Div. 386, 387, 119 N. Y. Supp. 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">It is not a case where plaintiff, although agreeing to work for a definite period, was entitled by the agreement to receive partial periodical payments of his wages during such period. See Walsh v. N. Y. &amp; Kentucky Co., 88 App. Div. 477, 85 N. Y. Supp. 83; Mernagh v. Nichols, 132 App. Div. 509, 118 N. Y. Supp. 59. Consequently plaintiff, having performed his agreement for the month of November 26th to December 26th, was entitled to be paid the balance of the $60 for that month, and, having broken his agreement to serve for the month of December 26th to January 26th by leaving the employment on December 30th without just cause or the consent of his employer, can recover no part of his compensation for that month either on the theory of contract or quantum meruit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">Judgment modified by deducting therefrom the portion of the wages from December 26th to December 30th, namely, $8, and, as so modified, affirmed, with $15 costs to the respondent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
