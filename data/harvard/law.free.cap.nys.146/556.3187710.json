The-order appealed from purports to be a final order in a certiorari proceeding brought by the relator to review the action of the county treasurer of Dutchess county in refusing to issue to him a liquor tax license. The petition is addressed \u201cTo the County Court of Dutchess County.\u201d The order directing the issuance of a writ of certiorari is-entitled in the \u201cCounty Court Dutchess County.\u201d The writ as issued is entitled likewise in the \u201cCounty Court Dutchess County,\u201d and directs return pursuant to its provisions to the \u201cCounty Court of DutchessCounty.\u201d The final order is entitled in the \u201cCounty Court Dutchess County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-15\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> By section 2123 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a writ of certiorari can issue only out of the Supreme Court, except \u201cin a case where another court is expressly authorized by statute to issue it.\u201d This writ of certiorari was provided for by subdivision 1 of section 27 of the Liquor Tax Law, but that statute provides that it\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-16\">\u201cmay be issued by, returnable to, and heard by a county judge of the county, or a justice of the Supreme Court of the judicial district in which the premises are situated in which the applicant desires to carry on the business of trafficking in liquors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-17\">So we have here, apparently, a proceeding of which the county court had no jurisdiction. This objection may be taken at any time, as is well settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-18\">The appellant cites, in support of his contention that the county court as such had no jurisdiction of this matter, the following authorities, all of which are in point: Heisohn v. Knickerbocker Life Ins. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Co., 77 N. Y. 278; Wiechers v. New Home Sewing Machine Co., 38 App. Div. 1, 56 N. Y. Supp. 235; and Matter of Wright, Peters &amp; Co., 73 App. Div. 75, 76 N. Y. Supp. 775. There are numerous other authorities pointing out the distinction between a statutory power given to a judge and that given to a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The order of the county court of Dutchess county should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the writ of certiorari dismissed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
