The debt upon which plaintiff recovered his judgment against Emanuel Hallenbeck is alleged to have arisen between December 1, 1911, and January 15, 1912. The allegation of the complaint that plaintiff has exhausted his legal remedy by the due issuing of an execution upon said judgment and its return unsatisfied is denied in the answer and unsupported by any proof whatever. Without passing upon the sufficiency of the alleged consideration for such conveyance, the evidence fails to clearly establish that its effect was to produce insolvency upon the part of Emanuel Hallenbeck as to his then existing creditors, or that as to subsequent creditors the fraudulent intent was clearly and satisfactorily established. Todd v. Nelson, 109 N. Y. 316, 16 N. E. 360. We think that the judgment must be set aside. Upon a new trial it may be that further and more satisfactory evidence respecting the issues herein may be produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-13\">Judgment reversed, and new trial <em>granted; </em>costs to abide the final award of costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
