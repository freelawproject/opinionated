Its liability comes from the bit falling out of the horse\u2019s mouth, rendering the driver powerless. The bridle, designed to allow feeding in harness, did not have the bit-rings held up on both sides to the jaw-straps by buckles. On one side the strap was attached to the ring by a clasp or snap-hook, so that the bit could be disconnected when the horse was fed from a nose-bag. It was this snap-hook which gave way, and released the bit, as the driver tried to check the horse\u2019s flight. Defendant maintained that the snap-hook was perfect, and the rein properly attached. Hence defendant could give no explanation for this occurrence or account for the snap-hook being separated from the bit. Obviously, it might happen from a weakened or worn snap-hook; and defendant\u2019s driver also admitted that, if the driving rein was attached to the ring forward of the snap-hook., such a crossing over the snap-hook might work it loose. Even if plaintiff could not specify which of these causes let out the bit, yet, as the occurrence was one that in common experience could not happen without negligence, it presented a prima facie case for the jury. Robinson v. Consolidated Gas Co., 194 N. Y. <em>37, 40, 86 </em>N. E. 805, 28 L. R. A. (N. S.) 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-15\">The jury therefore could find for plaintiff, upon the defendant\u2019s failure to account for this slipping out of the bit without negligence on the part of defendant (Sweeney v. Edison Electric Illuminating Co., 158 App. Div. 449, 143 N. Y. Supp. 636), taken in connection with plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>tiff\u2019s evidence of defects in the snap-hook given by three witnesses whose attention had been directed to it when the horse was finally stopped and held.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The complaint, and bill of- particulars, both alleged \u201cdefective harness.\u201d The court therefore rightly refused' to narrow the issue to the question merely of a defect in the clasp or hook. But the court did charge that the \u201cduty of showing the cause of the snap or bit becoming separated one from another is upon the plaintiff\u201d\u2014certainly as favorable as appellant could ask.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The judgment and order are therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
