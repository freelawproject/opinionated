The plaintiff complained that the defendant is a foreign Connecticut state railroad corporation; that her intestate was struck by part of the appliances of the defendant\u2019s locomotive engine, sustaining fatal injuries; and that the casualty was due to defects in the defendant\u2019s ways, works, plant, appliances, locomotive, and the appliances thereof and equipment, and by the negligent acts of the defendant\u2019s agents, officers, and employ\u00e9s, and by the negligence of the defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s, exercising superintendence, control, and command over said plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and by the defendant\u2019s failure to formulate, promulgate, and enforce proper-rules and regulations for the safety of said intestate and his coemploy\u00e9s, and that said defendant conducted its work by unsafe and dangerous methods and by unsafe and dangerous locomotives and appliances thereof, as a result of all of which, as this plaintiff\u2019s intestate was upon defendant\u2019s right of way in the performance of his duties, part of the appliances of one of said defendant\u2019s locomotives was violently blown therefrom and struck and killed said plaintiff\u2019s intestate. The defendant admits its status as a corporation, and makes otherwise general denial. The Special Term made an order, after issue was joined, that granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for an open commission and for the inspection of the written reports made by the defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s to the defendant, and further ordered that the defendant produce for inspection and examination of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>estate As to at is no dispute. The soieir specified, the original of each and every repstion made by the accounting-;g 0f defendant made to the defendant, its itor on this subj ec^is^ that since 0t,sel.vecj or discovered with reference to tile'\" happening of the occurrence in which the intestate was killed, in-eluding all such reports as may have been made to the defendant, its agents or officers, by the defendant\u2019s employes, as to any cylinder head, step, or fragment or detached part of the locomotive or train which may have come from the said locomotive and train and which was found in proximity to the body of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, including such reports as the said employ\u00e9s made to the defendant as to what disposition they made of such cylinder head, step, or fragment, and including such reports as were made to the defendant, its agents or officers, by the defendant\u2019s employes as to the said cylinder head, step, or fragment being missing from the said locomotive or train, likewise ordered that the plaintiff, her attorney, or his representative, shall be then and there afforded-a full opportunity to make copies off said reports, and further ordered that, if it shall appear from said tes- ' timony and inspection that there is in the defendant\u2019s possession, or under its control, a fragment or detached part which came from the locomotive and train and caused the death of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, another application can be then made by the plaintiff for its inspection. The defendant appeals from so much of the order as requires the defendant to give to the plaintiff an inspection of the written reports made by the defendant\u2019s employes to the defendant, and the original of each and every report which any and all employes of the defendant made to the defendant, its agents or officers, as to what they observed or discovered with reference to the happening of the occurrence in which the intestate was killed, including all such reports as may have been made to the defendant, its agents or officers, by the defendant\u2019s employes as to any cylinder head, step, fragment, or detached part of a locomotive or train, including such reports as the said employe made to the defendant as to what disposition they made of such cylinder head, step, or fragment, and that the plaintiff, her attorney, or his representative, shall be then and there afforded, a full opportunity to make copies of such reports.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1047-10\">Argued before JENKS, P.

Walsh v. Press Co., 48 App. Div. 333, 62 N. Y. Supp. 833; Matter of Ehrich v. Root, 134 App. Div. 437, 119 N. Y. Supp. 395. The procedure contemplates evidence. Woods v. Figaniere, 25 How. Prac. 522; Merguelle v. Continental Bank Note Co., 30 N. Y. Super. Ct. 77; Davis v. Dunham, 13 How. Prac. 425; Ahlymeyer v. Healy &amp; Bigelow, 12 N. Y. St. Rep. 677; Matter of Ehrich v. Root, supra; Hallenbeck v. Parr, 65 App. Div. 167, 72 N. Y. Supp. 488. The documents sought to be discovered are not evidence, within the purview of the statute or the rules. It is not enough that the documents suggest or may furnish a clew to evidence. Woods v. Eiganiere, supra; Morrison v. Sturges, 26 How. Prac. 177; Walsh v. Press Co., supra. The burden was upon the plaintiff to establish a condition that would have justified the order. Beyer v. Transit Development Co., 139 App. Div. 724, 124 N. Y. Supp. 463. The fact that the plaintiff is a representative of the deceased does not afford to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>any further or additional rights. Merguelle v. Continental Bank Note Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">The order, in so far as appealed from, is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
