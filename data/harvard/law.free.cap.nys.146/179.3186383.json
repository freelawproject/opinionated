It is not disputed that on August 29, 1912, the plaintiffs held for the defendant\u2019s account 100 shares of Brooklyn Rapid Transit stock and 100 shares of Seaboard Air Line stock with a margin of between $200 and $300 credit. The defendant\u2019s account was placed with the plaintiff through one Benjamin L. Sinsheimer, who was a personal friend of the defendant and was employed by the plaintiffs as a clerk for the purpose of receiving and handling accounts in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>name for customers. Sinsheimer took charge of the defendant\u2019s account for the plaintiffs with their knowledge and consent. It is not disputed, furthermore, that on August 29th, when the defendant still had several hundred dollars to his credit in the account, he said to Sinsheimer, the plaintiff\u2019s agent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">\u201cI am going on a trip, and I will be gone possibly from six to eight weeks. You have a few hundred dollars to my credit there. I do not want to lose any more than you have to my credit, otherwise I will not be responsible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">To which Sinsheimer .replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">\u201cAll right, I will do it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The defendant then went South, and on September 3d he telegraphed the plaintiffs from Louisville, Ky.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">\u201cInform Sinsheimer not lose more than have to my credit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">The obvious meaning of these instructions is shown by the plaintiffs\u2019 reply to this telegram, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-11\">\u201cWe received your telegram to-day from Louisville. * * * Upon receipt of same we immediately put in an order to sell 100 Seaboard Air Line Pfd. at 53 as your debit balance is about $5,283.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">The stock was sold subsequently at a loss of $620.29, which the plaintiffs seek to recover from the defendant. The defense is that the plaintiffs failed to follow the instructions given to Sinsheimer on August 29th as above shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">The plaintiffs moved for a direction of a verdict on the ground that\u2019 no defense was shown, which is equivalent to a demurrer to the evidence produced by the defendant. The court granted the motion and directed a verdict holding that the facts proved did not constitute a defense. This was clearly error. It is well settled that, when stocks are carried upon margin, not alone does there exist the relation of pledgor and pledgee, between the broker and customer, but also the relation of principal and agent, and when the customer gives instructions tending to limit his loss the broker is precluded from recovering from the customer losses which would have been obviated had the instructions been reasonably followed. In Zimmerman v. Heil, 86 Hun, 114, 33 N. Y. Supp. 391, affirmed on opinion below 156 N. Y. 703, 51 N. E. 1094, which is very similar to the case at bar, it is held that a statement by the client \u201cthat he could not afford to deposit more margin, and that he would not lose more than he had lost, amounted in effect to an order to sell\u201d and was sufficient to support a finding by the jury that the brokers were instructed to sell. In the case at bar the defendant\u2019s admitted instructions\u2019not to lose more than he had to his credit, imposed a duty upon the plaintiffs to sell the stock which they were holding for him at a price which would prevent further loss. They so construed and followed the instructions sent in the same language on September 3d after it was too late, and offer no excuse for their failure to do so on August 29th when the order was first given. This, in my opinion, constituted a complete defense to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-14\">The j udgment appealed from must therefore be reversed, with costs to the appellant, and the complaint dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
