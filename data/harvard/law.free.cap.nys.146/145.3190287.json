Plaintiff suffered from tuberculosis to such an extent that he was unable to do any work from -May 1, 1912, and he is still suffering therefrom, and was and still is a patient at the State Sanitarium known as Seton Hall at Spuyten Duyvil.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-15\">In May, 1912, plaintiff\u2019s wife and physician notified his superior of his condition. He was absent from his work from May 1 to November 30, 1912, by reason of such illness. On November 30, 1912, he was duly notified of his discharge, by reason of a reduction in force. For the ten days from May 1 to May 10, 1912, during which plaintiff was absent from duty while he had sick leave, he was paid. \u2022 After May 10th he had no leave, and his name was, by his superior\u2019s order, duly marked on the pay rolls \u201cabsent without leave.\u201d Plaintiff was a city employ\u00e9, not a city officer.. Where a city employ\u00e9 is absent without leave on account of illness, his superior may deduct, and in the case at bar did deduct, his salary during the term of such absence without leave.
