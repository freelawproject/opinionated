A north-bound train injured his foot, which in the course of his work he had placed so near the westerly rail of the north-bound track as to have come in contact with some part of the train.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">From the evidence adduced at the trial, it became quite clear that the \u2018only pertinent allegation of negligence in the complaint was the following :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">\u201cThat the defendant\u2019s superintendent or foreman failed to furnish the plaintiff with any signalman whose duty it was or should be to issue warnings of the approach of trains and to notify all employ\u00e9s in time to avoid accident or injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The proof offered by plaintiff was to the effect that on previous days a watchman had been walking up and down the north-bound track, and had stopped approaching trains by the use of his lantern when he thought that necessary, or whistled to notify the employ\u00e9s to assume positions of safety when he thought it advisable that the trains should pass by. There was not the slightest suggestion that this method of warning was not ample.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s further proof showed that on the morning of the accident, at about 9 o\u2019clock, he had gone to the foreman to ask for a helper on the work and to notify him that' no watchman was on duty, and that the foreman had promised to send one forthwith. The accident happened about 10 o\u2019clock. A number of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified \u201cthat there was no watchman on the north-bound track,\u201d and that no whis.tle was blown or other warning given on that morning. Defendant\u2019s witnesses testified that two watchmen were on duty and had been paid that day, one controlling south-bound traffic and the other at or near the northern end of the station platform controlling the northbound trains. Defendant evidently conceded that a watchman was necessary, and neither plaintiff nor his witnesses gave any indication that a watchman stationed and operating as he had been on previous days was not a sufficient protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The learned court below instructed the jury at length in. regard to the .common-law liabilities of master and servant, and undertook to point out changes made by the Employers\u2019 Liability Law. In the course, of his charge he said, in substance, that the fellow-servant rule had been abolished and that the defense of assumption of risk was neither a question of law nor of fact. To both these statements the counsel for defendant excepted, and asked the court particularly to charge as provided in the first sentence of section 202 of the Labor Law (L. 1910, c. 352) that an employ\u00e9, as matter of law, assumed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>necessary risks of his employment, namely, those inherent in the nature \u25a0of the business after the employer had exercised due care, and excepted to the refusal of the court to so charge. Both these exceptions present errors. The master\u2019s exemption from liability for the act of-a fellow servant has not been abolished by the Employers\u2019 Liability Act, and the distinction between the employe\u2019s assumption of \u201cnecessary risks\u201d as a principle of law, and his possible assumption <em>o\u00ed </em>\u201cobvious risks\u201d as a defense, has been carefully preserved in section 202 \u2022of the Labor Law. See, also, Hurley v. Olcott, 134 App. Div. 631, 637, 119 N. Y. Supp. 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> It may be that these two errors would not require reversal of the judgment, because as the case was tried it is not clear how either the fellow-servant rule or the doctrine of assumption of risk became material to the jury\u2019s deliberations. The chief criticism which defendant presents in respect of' this part of the charge is that it tended to \u25a0confuse the minds of the jury. Unfortunately, however, after the main \u2022charge was completed, and all of the respective counsels\u2019 requests had been passed on, and, at least part of the error above referred to had been technically corrected, counsel for the plaintiff insisted on asking the court to charge \u201cthat if they believed that in the exercise of reasonable care on the part of' the defendant a watchman was needed at the place where the plaintiff was working, 150 feet north of the platform, and no watchman was there,\u201d etc., the jury would be justified in finding the defendant negligent. To this, defendant\u2019s counsel excepted, \u201camong other grounds, upon the fact that this is not an issue presented by the pleadings,\u201d and he might well have added \u201cnor by the proofs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">It is quite plain that, by this last charge and the colloquy and requests to charge which immediately preceded it, an issue which had not previously been hinted at was injected into the controversy. The record is absolutely bare of any testimony upon which the jury might base a conclusion in response to this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">I am reluctant to reverse a judgment after there have been repeated trials; but the defendant is entitled to have the decision of a jury upon the actual issue presented by the pleadings and the proofs and to a correct statement of the law applicable to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> Appellant also makes the point that plaintiff, having testified that he thought that he was in a position <em>of </em>safety, <em>must be </em>taken, as matter of law, to have been guilty of contributory negligence. In this contention I cannot agree\u2014as a general proposition, and particularly not as applied to the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">PAGE, J., concurs.
