The city of New York had acquired certain premises for the approach to the Manhattan Bridge, and the appellant had contracted to fill in the cellars after the buildings had been razed. Plaintiff had hired himself and his tracking outfit to a firm of public truckmen who were carting dirt for the filling work. Prior to the accident, a city inspector had inspected the premises and had discovered nothing more than what appeared to be a solid earth floor some ten feet below the street level, with no evidence of any subcellar. This inspector was \u25a0on the premises daily during the work of demolishing. Cappel, who demolished the buildings and removed their material, discovered no subcellar; the \u25a0city engineers, who were in and about the premises in the course of their work, were equally ignorant of its existence; and the defendants knew nothing about it. Plaintiff had been drawing dirt to the premises for some three weeks before the accident. He testified that when he began there appeared to be a cellar about ten feet deep, with an apparently solid bottom. In pursuing the work of filling, the earth was dumped from the street side, and, as it came up level with the sidewalk, planks were laid on the surface and the trucks backed in upon these planks. On the day in question, plaintiff backed his truck in until the rear wheels came in contact with a timber known as a chock, which served to arrest the trucks at the point where their loads were to be dumped. As he was about dumping his track, the earth beneath the truck and horses subsided, carrying down the plaintiff and his outfit and causing the injuries complained of. It was then for the first time discovered that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>what had appeared to be the bottom of the cellar was a flooring which served as a roof to a subcellar, which roof had given away.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b363-3\">Argued before INGRAHAM, P.

They had the right to rely on the prudence and observation, in the course of the work, of those whose relations thereto preceded theirs, and which relations necessarily called for a reasonable degree of care. Young v. Mason Stable Co., 193 N. Y. 188, 86 N. E. 15, 21 L. R. A. (N. S.) 592, 127 Am. St. Rep. 939. There was nothing intrinsically dangerous in the apparent conditions, nor anything to suggest the necessity of extraordinary care. They were not called upon to drill for a solid bottom, or to make any further investigation concerning the safety of the situation into which they called plaintiff to pursue his labors, than such as was involved in observing the conditions which apparently existed. As was said by Earl, J., in Burke v. Witherbee, 98 N. Y. 562, 568: \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">\u201cWere they bound to know more than every one else? Ought they to have perceived danger that was not visible to any one else? * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">The judgment and order should be reversed, with costs, and the complaint dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
