The checks in question here were paid between the 1st of September, 1907, and the 15th of September, 1910. The first bogus check, for $44.99, was dated the 24th of August, 1907. It was paid by the defendant about that time, the amount charged to plaintiff\u2019s account, and a statement to that effect, together with the checks returned to the plaintiff about the 1st of September. The next one was in September, for $55.01; two in October, aggregating $41.77; two in November, aggregating $60.05'; two in December, amounting to $34.03; and all amounting to $235.85. These checks were all negotiated by Bradford, as were all of those during the following months up to July, 1908, when Walker commenced operations. At first both Bradford and Walker purloined but few checks each month. Apparently, having ascertained how easy it was to defraud the plaintiff, they increased the number so that one month, acting either separately or together, they negotiated 23. Between August 1, 1907, and the 15th of September, 1910, the plaintiff deposited with the defendant $7,377,-903.78, and during the same time defendant paid out on checks drawn by plaintiff $7,367,151.56, and in addition it paid the checks here involved, which it is conceded bore the genuine signature of the plaintiff, amounting to $13,176.74.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel conceded at the trial that there were returned by the defendant to it each month an average of over 600 check vouchers of an average aggregate amount of $200,000. No objection was made to the' statements returned by the defendant to plaintiff, or to the payment of the checks here in question, until the 20th of September, 1910. The fraud was discovered by a check being presented to the plaintiff\u2019s cashier for signature, payable to the order of one Bauman.\" The cashier\u2019s assistant called his attention to the fact that they had only a few days before drawn a check for some thirty-odd dollars, payable to the order of a man named Bauman. On looking at that .check they found Walker\u2019s name indorsed on it. This resulted in an examination, and Walker\u2019s confession also disclosed the frauds committed by Bradford. Many of the checks negotiated by him bore the indorsement of E. B. Wood. A further investigation followed, which showed that Bauman\u2019s indorsement appeared on forty-one checks, some of which had been returned to plaintiff by the defendant \"each month during 1909 and 1910, save January and March of the former year, and 87 checks which bore the indorsement of Walker, extending over the period of two years beginning July, 1908, and ending with August, 1910; that 218 checks bore the indorsement of Wood, which involved Bradford\u2019s fraud; and that the first fraudulent check bor\u00e9 Bradford\u2019s own indorsement. Had the slightest examination been made by the plaintiff of its books and the evidence in its\" possession, the fraudulent acts of Bradford would have been discovered when the bank returned the first bogus check with the other vouchers. And the sarpe is true of the bogus checks returned each time when the passbook was written up. The plaintiff, however, did nothing for upwards of three years, and the result was that these two dishonest clerks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>purloined 362 checks, put them into circulation, and the same were paid by the. defendant, concededly acting in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-3\"><bracketnum>[1-3]</bracketnum> Under such circumstances, I am of the opinion that a question was presented which should have been submitted to the jury, whether the plaintiff ought to recover upon any of the checks. The relation between a depositor and a bank is well understood. It is that of debtor and creditor. By reason of this relation a reciprocal duty is imposed. A bank is bound to. know the signature of its depositors and pay out the money only on their orders. If it does otherwise, the bank, primarily, and not the depositor, must stand the loss. A bank, however, is permitted to escape liability for repayment of amounts paid out on forged, raised, or fictitious checks, by establishing that it made the payment in good faith, without negligence upon its part, and that the payment was brought about or contributed to by the negligence of the depositor; in other words, that the payment was made by reason of the neglect of the depositor to do \u201cthose things dictated by ordinary business customs and prudence and fair dealing toward the bank, which if done would have prevented the wrongdoing which resulted from their omission.\u201d Morgan v. U. S. Mortgage &amp; Trust Co., 208 N. Y. 218, 101 N. E. 871. The facts here presented demonstrate very clearly the reasonableness of this rule. Commercial transactions are now carried on largely by means of checks. The plaintiff, as indicated, used in its business at least 600 each month, aggregating in amount something like $200,000. It therefore owed a duty not only to the defendant, but, I think, to the public generally, to exercise at least reasonable care that the checks which it signed were genuine and not fictitious transactions. If it failed to do this, then it ought not to be permitted to assert their invalidity against either the bank upon which they were drawn or any one else taking them in good faith and for value. When the first fictitious check was returned, and it is not here sought to recover on that one, if an examination had been made such as ordinary prudence would have seemed to dictate, Bradford\u2019s dishonesty would have been disclosed, and measures could have been taken would thereafter have prevented similar transactions either by him or Walker. The purpose of having the passbook written up was to ascertain what checks had been paid out and what the defendant claimed as to the plaintiff\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">As said in Morgan v. U. S. Mortgage &amp; Trust Co., supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">\u201cWhen they submitted their passbook to be thus written up, they in effect called for a statement of their account as kept by the bank, and, when this was furnished to them, is it to be thought that they satisfied the requirements of common prudence and fairness to the bank by absolutely disregarding the passbook and check list which could not be easily falsified, and simply comparing a bundle of vouchers which might be much more easily manipulated by ready abstraction of vouchers? The passbook is the statement of the bank\u2019s version of the account and the fundamental basis for comparison with the depositor\u2019s own records. The paid checks which are returned are the vouchers of the bank for its account as written on the passbook, and, if they are to be made the medium of comparison of accounts, the depositor at least ought to endeavor to know that they tally with the passbook. Otherwise he has made no reliable comparison or verification. Therefore it seems to me that, when the appellants relied for verification merely on a comparison of vouchers without any effort to verify these by comparison with the check list or passbook, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>they did not exercise reasonable methods. On the other hand, it seems to me that when, having \"obtained from the bank a list of vouchers and balanced passbook which were intended to give and did give them a correct basis for comparison and verification, they disregarded these, they were guilty of such obvious oblivion of their duties that no extended argument can make plainer their negligence than does the mere recital of the facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> In connection with the duty imposed on the plaintiff to examine the returned canceled vouchers, so that any irregularity in their issue could be at once corrected, both for\" the protection of the defendant and the banking community, in general, the defendant, in August, 1909, submitted to the plaintiff for execution by it an instrument by which the defendant was authorized to deliver to the person named the plaintiff\u2019s passbook and take his receipt for the same in the form printed on the reverse side thereof. The plaintiff, by its cashier, signed this instrument and delivered it to the defendant. This receipt was to show the balance at the close of business on the day specified, together with the list of canceled vouchers called for by the passbook, and, unless written notice to the contrary were given within 10 days from the date thereof, it was to be considered as accepted by the plaintiff as correct. Thereafter, on receipt of the passbook and vouchers, plaintiff\u2019s representatives signed such receipt. The plaintiff, however, seeks to repudiate this agreement on the ground that the cashier had no authority from the plaintiff to sign it and that the messenger to whom the passbook and vouchers were delivered had no authority to sign such receipt. But the agreement was acted upon by both of the parties from the time of its execution until the fraudulent acts of Bradford and Walker were discovered, and during such time it was not even suggested that the cashier did not have authority to make whatever arrangements were necessary with defendant as to its banking account. It was too late for the plaintiff, after thus receiving the canceled vouchers and statement of the account as shown by them, and the same had been acted upon by plaintiff, to thereafter repudiate the transactions, especially when it appeared that all of the checks were issued under circumstances which would justify a finding that the plaintiff had neglected to take even ordinary precautions to prevent the defendant or others from being defrauded by their use.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The plaintiff was resorting to the use of checks for the purpose of doing its business, and every one of those in question bore its genuine signature. The bank, of course, was bound to know that the maker\u2019s signature was genuine, and it is possible it was also bound to know that the indorsement on the first check was genuine; but, when no objection was made to it when returned, it had a right to treat other checks coming in as it had that one; in any event, after the statement and vouchers had been returned and no objection made within a reasonable time, then it seems to me it certainly was a question for the jury to determine whether or not the plaintiff was not bound by an implied ratification of the statements rendered. Dana v. Nat. Bank of the Republic, 132 Mass. 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">If the plaintiff knew of the fraud, then it was bound to inform the defendant of it. It did, in legal effect, know of it, because its own records showed it, as the slightest examination of them disclosed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Fair dealings require, under such circumstances, that it should be held to the statements as rendered, on the ground that it adopted the payments made and impliedly ratified them. Leather Manufacturers\u2019 Bank v. Morgan, 117 U. S. 96, 6 Sup. Ct. 657, 29 L. Ed. 811; Myers v. S. W. Nat. Bank, 193 Pa. 1, 44 Atl. 280, 74 Am. St. Rep. 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-3\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> But, it is said, the defendant ought not to escape liability because it received the checks for payment from other banks which are solvent, for which reason it will not be damaged. I do not think this conclusion follows. Defendant has paid the checks once, and, plaintiff having called upon it again to pay them, it has a right to resist the payment, irrespective of whether or not it may, in\" case it does pay, be reimbursed by some one else. A loss has been sustained, which, if occasioned solely by plaintiff\u2019s negligence, should be borne by it, and the defendant is in position to assert such defense\u2014this upon the theory that one who, by his own neglect, is responsible for or the cause of a loss, should bear it instead of an innocent party. First Nat. Bank v. American Exch. Nat. Bank, 49 App. Div. 349, 63 N. Y. Supp. 58, affirmed 170 N. Y. 88, 62 N. E. 1089.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">I am of the opinion that there was at least a question for the jury as to the negligence of the plaintiff that would prevent \u25a0 a recovery.

The plaintiff was a depositor with the defendant and brought this action for a balance of account. What, if any, balance exists, depends upon certain checks which plaintiff claims were improperly paid by the defendant because of the alleged forgeries of the indorsements of the payees. The number of checks in dispute is 362, covering a period from August 1, 1907, to September 15, 1910. The plaintiff is an English company which maintains a principal office in the city of New York under the charge of1 a general manager, and through which plaintiff\u2019s business, including its many agencies in the United States, is directed. During the period in question, nearly 800,000 policies were sent from the New York office to the plaintiff\u2019s various agencies, and there was at all times outstanding on its books policies approximating 300,000 in number. When a policy was canceled before it had expired, it became necessary to pay to the holder a return premium representing the unearned portion of the original premium. The policies on account of which such payments were made amounted, during the period in question, to some hundreds of thousands. The individual amounts of the sums so returned were comparatively small; but, because of their great number, the aggregate amounted to about $90,000 a month, all of which was apparently drawn from the plaintiff\u2019s account with the defendant. The territory in which plaintiff transacted business was divided into districts, and, when an application for a return premium was received, it would be given over to a clerk who had charge of the returns within\" the district to which the policy concerned belonged, and thereupon it became his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>duty to proceed as follows: From the canceled policy, the \u201cdaily report,\u201d and the \u201cpolicy register,\u201d it was the duty of the clerk to make out on a printed form what was called an \u201caccount,\u201d showing certain particulars of the policy, the amount of the return premium, etc. The same clerk would also prepare an \u201corder\u201d on plaintiff\u2019s cashier for a check on defendant for the amount to be returned. The clerk would then pass the \u201caccount\u201d and the \u201corder\u201d to the head of the accounting department, who would sign the \u201corder\u201d and send it to the cashier, with the voucher papers on which the order was based, attached. A check having been prepared by the cashier, it would be sent to the proper officers of the plaintiff for signature, after which the check would be returned to the head of the accounting department, and from him it would come to the hands of the clerk who had prepared the vouchers on which the check was based, and thereupon it became the duty of the clerk to see that the check was transmitted to the person entitled to receive the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Among the clerks employed in plaintiff\u2019s accounting department and whose business it was to prepare vouchers and checks for return premiums were Bradford and Walker, who, when the checks in question came back into their hands duly signed, purloined them and converted their proceeds to their own use. This conversion was accomplished in the following manner: In every case, the checks represented a fictitious transaction upon which no return premium was owing by the plaintiff, and each of the checks had been procured from plaintiff by means of fictitious vouchers on the faith of which the checks were \u00bfigned. In some instances, the names of the payees of the checks were those of existing persons, some of whom were customers of' the plaintiff, but to whom plaintiff owed nothing, and some were personal creditors of Walker, who took this method to pay his personal debts. The remaining payees represented persons having no existence. Of the checks payable to the order of existing payees, some were in fact indorsed by such payees; but on the others the indorsements were forged. The indorsements so forged and as well the indorsements of the checks payable to nonexisting payees were made by Bradford or by Walker or by the procurement of one of them. The frauds were discovered by plaintiff, and the defendant was notified early in September, 1910. Prior to August 2, 1909, it had been defendant\u2019s custom to return to plaintiff its passbook with canceled vouchers and to take a mere receipt for the same; but on that day defendant gave to plaintiff\u2019s bank messenger a new form of signature card with directions to have it signed by some one duly authorized and to return the same to defendant. On one side of this card was an order designating the individual to whom defendant should deliver returned vouchers, \u201ctaking, his receipt for same in my behalf in form as on reverse hereof.\u201d On the reverse side was printed the following form of receipt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">\u201cNew York, 190 .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">\u201cReceived, from the Merchants\u2019 National Bank of the City of New York passbook for the account of the undersigned, showing balance $ at the close of business, together with canceled vouchers called for by passbook and list of vouchers which are hereby accepted as correct and gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>uine, and the account approved as stated, unless written notice to the contrary is given within ten days from this date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-3\">This blank card was by the messenger delivered to Ketcham, an employ\u00e9 of the plaintiff with the title of cashier, and among whose duties was the making up of the daily deposits with defendant and the receipt and custody of all returned vouchers when the same were brought to plaintiff\u2019s office by the messenger. Ketcham was not an officer of the plaintiff and his duties were clerical only. Without calling the attention of any of plaintiff\u2019s responsible officers to the receipt of the card or to the new system of receipting for canceled vouchers which the terms of the card suggested, Ketcham filled in the name of the messenger, Thomas Baxter, as the one authorized in the future to receive from defendant and receipt for canceled vouchers, and so filled in, Ketcham signed the card in the name of the plaintiff, per \u201cD. R. Ketcham, Cashier.\u201d The signed card was on August 2d returned to the defendant, from which date all of plaintiff\u2019s canceled vouchers were receipted for in the foregoing form. The fact that Ketcham had signed the card and authorized the giving of the form of receipt evidenced thereby was never brought to the knowledge of any representative of plaintiff authorized to contract in its behalf. On the trial much testimony was given both by plaintiff and defendant on the subject of plaintiff\u2019s alleged negligence in uttering the checks and as well in failing to adopt and enforce such a system of examination or audit as was adapted to disclose the fraudulent practices of its clerks.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">At the conclusion of the trial,, both sides moved to direct a verdict. Defendant\u2019s motion having been denied, it asked to go to the jury on a variety of questions including those raised on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">An analysis of the checks as they appear in the record shows that they were drawn to the order of payees and bore indorsements which are divisible into the following classes: (a) Checks to the order of existing persons; (b) checks to the order of nonexisting persons; (c) checks of class A indorsed by the identical payees named therein; (d) checks of class A bearing forged indorsements of payees.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The plaintiff recovered on all the' checks of the several classes, on the theory that the payees\u2019 indorsements were forgeries, and counsel so argues on this appeal. In the case of checks to the order of and indorsed by existing payees, the theory is that, as to plaintiff, they are to be regarded as forgeries because plaintiff never intended to draw checks to such payees. The bank has thus been held liable not only in the case of nonexisting payees, but also in cases of existing payees whose indorsements were genuine.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">(1) No argument is necessary to show that the court erred in cases of the latter class. As to these, the bank paid according to its instructions. If plaintiff was led by fraud or mistake into unintentionally giving to the bank orders to pay to persons to whom it owed nothing, the loss should fall on plaintiff whose error caused the payments to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">(2) The case of nonexistent payees is apparently covered by Hartford v. Greenwich Bank, 157 App. Div. 448, 142 N. Y. Supp. 387, decided by this court in June last. In that case, an employe of a tea com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>pony, a depositor in defendant bank, fraudulently induced his employer to sign checks to the order of a nonexistent person, in payment of bills which the employ\u00e9 led his employer to believe were owing by him to such pretended creditor. In fact, the name of such payees was one assumed by the employ\u00e9 himself and under which he had rented an office and.received his mail in a distant part of the city. Under his assumed name, the employ\u00e9 opened an account with the Greenwich Bank. Having thus fraudulently procured the checks from his employer, the employ\u00e9 indorsed the same in his assumed name, and, so indorsed, deposited them with the defendant bank, from which he drew the proceeds. By a divided court, the bank was held not liable to the tea company for the loss. The reasoning of the court is summed up in the following sentences (at page 451 of 157 App. Div., at page 389 of 142 N. Y. Supp.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\">\u201cThis is not strictly speaking the case of a check drawn to a fictitious or nonexistent person. * * * What we have here is a successful fraud perpetrated upon the tea company by one of its own employ\u00e9s, by which it was induced to believe that it owed that employ\u00e9 certain sums of money. The checks in suit were intended to be paid in satisfaction of this supposed debt and were in fact paid to the person for whom they were intended. No liability attaches to the bank under these circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The minority of the court pointed out that, while the majority assumed to base their decision on the intent of the drawer, they had in fact confused the matter of such intent with that of the identity of the payee, and in working out their legal conclusion had substituted the latter for the former. The error in a result thus obtained was pointed out in Philips v. Mercantile Nat. Bank, 140 N. Y. 556, 562, 35 N. E. 982, 983 (23 L. R. A. 584, 37 Am. St. Rep. 596), where Judge Gray, writing for the court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">\u201cThe fictitiousness of the maker\u2019s direction to pay does not depend upon the identification of the name of the payee with some existent person, but upon the intention underlying the act of the maker in inserting the name.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">The minority in the Greenwich Bank Case placed their dissent on the ground that the indorsement of the name of the payee should be treated as a forgery, and that \u201cthe rule that a check payable to a fictitious payee is deemed payable to bearer has no application where the drawer of the. checks is not aware that the payee is fictitious.\u201d At page 454 of 157 App. Div., at page 392 of 142 N. Y. Supp. (citing Shipman v. Bank of State of New York, 126 N. Y. 318, 27 N. E. 371, 12 L. R. A. 791, 22 Am. St. Rep. 821). As I read the Shipman Case, it decided exactly that on a state of facts indistinguishable from those in the Greenwich Bank Case. In the Shipman Case, plaintiffs were by the fraud of their clerk induced to sign checks to various classes of fraudulent payees, including some wholly fictitious who plaintiffs were induced to believe were clients of plaintiffs, to whom the sums represented by the checks were owing. But the question would seem settled by Seaboard Nat. Bank v. Bank of America, 193 N. Y. 26, 85 N. E. 829, 22 L. R. A. (N. S.) 499. In that case, one Pennoclc, an employ\u00e9 of Babcock &amp; Co., a depositor of the Federal Bank, presented to that bank a check purporting to have been drawn on it by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Babcock &amp; Co. to the order of \u201cN. Y. Draft,\u201d but which check was in fact forged. In exchange for this check, the employe received from the Federal Bank a draft on plaintiff to the order of Carroll Bros, whose name Pennock indorsed on the draft which he deposited to his credit in the Mellon Bank. Carroll Bros, was an existing firm and dealers with Babcock &amp; Co., but to whom the latter owed nothing. Plaintiff, having reimbursed the Federal Bank, brought action to recover the amount of the draft from defendant, the correspondent of the Mellon Bank, to which plaintiff had paid the draft, and judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor was sustained. The court refused to treat Carroll Bros, as fictitious payees because, under subdivision 3 of section 28'of the Negotiable Instruments Law (Consol. Laws, c. 38) of this state, such an instrument payable \u201cto the order of a fictitious or nonexisting person\u201d is to be considered as payable to bearer only when \u201csuch fact was known to the person making it so payable.\u201d After pointing out that in this fact of knowledge lies' the difference between our act and certain others, including the English Bills of Exchange Act, the court cites numerous commentators, who recognize the \u201cNew York rule,\u201d and also quotes with approval (at page 35 of 193 N. Y., at page 832 of 85 N. E. [22 L. R. A. (N. S.) 499]) the following very apt language from the Shipman Case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\">\u201cHence if the maker or drawer supposes the payee to be an actually existing person (as for instance, where he is induced by fraud to draw the instrument to the order of a fictitious person whom he supposes to exist), the instrument will not be payable to bearer, and no person can acquire the title thereto by delivery. And where the instrument is drawn payable at a bank, the bank cannot charge the same to the account of its customer, since the instrument is not in such case payable to bearer and the instrument is a forgery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The reason for the so-called \u201cNew York rule\u201d is apparent and supports its propriety, and incidentally discloses what I deem to be the basic error of the decision in the Greenwich Bank Case. A check payable to a nonexistent person, necessarily, can never bear a genuine indorsement. Hence the drawer who is aware of such nonexistence cannot intend the check to be .indorsed by the payee named and must be taken as intending it to be payable to bearer. But, if the fact of the payee\u2019s nonexistence is unknown to the drawer, presumably he relies on the drawee to see to it that payment is made as directed, and this casts the burden on the drawee to ascertain by identification or otherwise to whom he pays, and to pay only on a genuine indorsement. Naturally, if such an indorsement be impossible, the drawee should not pay at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">It has been suggested that the Seaboard Bank Case is to be distinguished from that of the Greenwich Bank, because in the former the check of Babcock &amp; Co. in exchange for which the Federal Bank issued its draft, was a forgery, but this fact the court took pains to point out (at pages 31 and 32 of 193 N. Y., 85 N. E. 829, 22 L. R. A. [N. S.] 499), was quite immaterial. The case of the Seaboard Bank was neither cited by counsel nor referred to in either of the opinions in the Greenwich Bank Case, and seems to have wholly escaped attention. If, however, it is, as I deem it to be, a controlling authority binding upon and which it was the duty of this court to follow when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>deciding the Greenwich Bank Case, then I conceive it is no less our duty to accept it now. I conclude therefore that the defendant prima facie is 'liable on the class of checks in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">(3) We have remaining, checks drawn to the order of existing payees whose indorsements were forged. This, among other points, brings directly up the question of plaintiff\u2019s negligence, to which subject the testimony at the trial was largely directed. The bank claims that, notwithstanding it may be liable prima facie on this class of checks and as well on any of the other classes on which, as I have hereinbefore pointed out, it is similarly liable, nevertheless it was error to 'direct a verdict against it, because:</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">(1) As to all the checks in dispute, the question of plaintiff\u2019s negligence should have gone to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">(2) Defendant was released by the 10 days\u2019 limitation contained in the returned voucher agreement signed by Ketcham.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">(3) As to all checks on which a claim was not made within one year after the return of the vouchers, defendant is released by section 326 of the Negotiable Instruments Daw.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">I take these questions up in inverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">(3) The statute says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-11\">\u201cNo bank shall be liable to a depositor for the payment by it of a forged or raised check, unless within one year after the return to the depositor of the voucher of such payment, such depositor shall notify the bank that the check so paid was forged or raised.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">On the face of the statute, it clearly does not apply. It is perfectly clear what forged and raised checks are. When we speak of a forged check, we mean that the maker\u2019s name &lt;is forged; a raised check is one the amount of which has been increased. Defendant attempts to extend the statute to the case of forged indorsements, on the theory that under the Penal Law forgery of a check includes the forgery and circulation of an indorsement. Obviously, if by the phrase \u201cforged check\u201d it was meant to include everything which the Penal Law defined as such, then there was no sense in using the term \u201craised\" check, because that equally is a \u201cforged\u2019\u2019 check. But defendant argues that its construction of the statute is reasonable because the depositor is much better able than the bank to ascertain the validity of an indorsement. This is manifestly untrue. The law is settled that ordinarily a depositor owes no duty to the bank to examine the indorsements on his returned vouchers, inasmuch as the obligation is upon the bank to make payment according to the drawer\u2019s directions, and hence it is the bank\u2019s duty to ascertain that it is making payment to the right person\u2014a duty which the depositor may assume it has fulfilled when his checks are returned. Section 326 was originally enacted in 1904. There had shortly previous been a number of cases, including the Critten Case, 171 N. Y. 219, 63 N. E. 969, 57 L. R A. 529, involving the liability of banks for forged and raised checks. There was much dicta and some language more or less equivocal in the books, but never until Morgan v. U. S. Mtg. &amp; Trust Co., 208 N. Y. 218, 101 N. E. 871 (1913), was it squarely and finally settled that the depositor (as maker) owed to the bank the duty to make a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>ably careful examination of his returned vouchers, and more especially had it never been decided within what exact time he must notify the bank of errors. The law was that the notice must be within a reasonable time, which necessarily depended upon.the circumstances of the case. Section 326 was adopted to settle both of these questions by making it incumbent on the part of a depositor whose signature to a check had been forged or \"whose check had been raised, to notify the bank within a year. It was a codification of substantive law. Shattuck v. Guardian Trust Co., 204 N. Y. 200, 97 N. E. 517. There may be a good reason for a statute requiring a depositor to notify the bank within a limited time of any irregularity in indorsements on returned vouchers; but, in the light of the law which relieves the depositor of any duty so to do (except as hereinafter considered), I think it useless to argue that the phrase \u201cforged\u201d check includes a forged indorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-3\">(2) Prior to August 2, 1909, plaintiff had been doing business with defendant under a system by which returned vouchers were simply receipted for. Shortly after the decision in the Critten Case, there was a general movement among banks, to protect themselves. This led to the adopting of a more stringent form of receipt for returned vouchers. Thus, this defendant adopted a form of receipt which, after acknowledging the return of the passbook with canceled vouchers as per list attached, said that the same \u201care hereby accepted as correct and genuine and the amount approved as stated, unless written notice to the contrary is given within ten days from this date.\u201d This new agreement was on August 2, 1909, signed in plaintiff\u2019s behalf by Ketcham, its cashier.' The original seems to have been retained by defendant, and no copy was kept by or delivered to plaintiff. Although Ketcham held the title of cashier, he was in fact no more than a clerk whose duties included caring for the current cash, making deposits, and receiving returned vouchers. He never had actual authority to sign the new and modified returned voucher contract, and he never informed any one in authority that he had done so. Previous to the adopting of this new form as above stated, it was plaintiff\u2019s custom to give a simple receipt for the returned vouchers. I do not think that any express contract can be predicated of these facts. Ketch-am had no authority to make such a contract. But do not the facts raise an implied agreement on plaintiff\u2019s part identical with the terms of the paper signed by Ketcham? I think so. When defendant sent to plaintiff, by Baxter, plaintiff\u2019s messenger, the new contract with directions to have it signed by some one in authority, and when that form of contract, accompanied by defendant\u2019s message, was presented .to Ketcham, the communication came to an agent who represented plaintiff in the matter of returned vouchers. This amounted to notice to plaintiff of defendant\u2019s desire and intention, in the future, to be bound by and to do business only on the basis of the terms contained in the paper so presented to plaintiff for its acceptance. It then became plaintiff\u2019s duty to act in the premises.' It could not remain silent and continue to do business with defendant, unless it was willing to accept defendant\u2019s conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>In the face of this notice, the subsequent transactions, defendant believing that it had a valid contract\u2014must be deemed to have been pursuant to an implied contract between the parties, in short, a contract by offer and acceptance. See 1 Cyc. 256, 257, 258. If defendant\u2019s president had notified plaintiff\u2019s president that their future business must be done on the basis of the conditions set forth in the paper signed by Ketcham, and if after this, without dissent, plaintiff had continued to transact its banking business with defendant, can there be any doubt that the notice would have bound plaintiff? I think the .notice delivered to Ketcham had the same effect. True, he had no power to enter into any express contract in the premis\u00e9s, but he was an agent representing plaintiff in the business in question, and, as such, it was proper for defendant to convey through him a notice to plaintiff With respect to this business, and, inasmuch as it thereupon became the duty of Ketcham to communicate this notice to plaintiff, he is presumed to have done so. Shattuck v. Guardian Trust Co., 204 N. Y. 200, 207, 208, 97 N. E. 517. Plaintiff having failed to dissent from, and defendant having relied on, this apparent acquiescence, the contract resulting is one made not by Ketcham, but by plaintiff itself. It is argued that the effect of any such notice was not to conclude plaintiff, but at most to establish an account stated, which it could open for fraud or mistake. I cannot so regard it. Any such construction would disregard the words \u201chereby accepted as correct and genuine,\u201d which precede the words \u201cand the account approved as stated.\u201d These words refer back to \u201ccanceled vouchers.\u201d As \u201cvouchers,\u201d the returned checks included the indorsements of the payee. Plaintiff\u2019s ratification and adopting of these \u201cvouchers\u201d and its release of defendant from responsibility for their genuineness and sufficiency as valid charges, unless objection should be made within ten days, was the manifest purpose of the new form of contract and the clear purpose of the language used therein. No words of this character were necessary if the intent of the contract was merely to effect an account stated. A mere return of the balanced passbook and the canceled vouchers would have accomplished this. No receipt, much less any words of express contract, was necessary. Plaintiff was bound by the limitation of ten days. In Matter of New York L. &amp; W. R. R. Co., 98 N. Y. 447, 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">(1) The negligence asserted is of two kinds: Negligence in signing ' and uttering the checks, in that plaintiff failed so to safeguard its system for their issuance as to afford reasonable protection from such frauds as those by which it was victimized, and, as well, negligence in failing to take any reasonably adequate means to discover the extensive and long-continued frauds after they had begun. If, in any view of the case, either of those questions was material, I should advise reversal on this ground, because I think, in that event, the evidence of negligence was such as to require the facts (except as to the checks which bore genuine indorsements of existing payees on which I deem defendant not liable in any event), to be submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">But in my opinion, any negligence on plaintiff\u2019s part is quite immaterial. In the Shipman Case, Judge O\u2019Brien said (at page 327 of 126 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>N. Y., at page 372 of 27 N. E. [12 L. R. A. 791, 22 Am. St. Rep. 821]):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-3\">\u201cPayments made upon forged indorsements are at the peril of the bank, unless it can claim protection upon some principle of estoppel or by reason of some negligence chargeable to the depositors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">To hold plaintiff responsible for negligence in failing to discover and . notify defendant- of the frauds would present difficulties, the mere suggestion of which at once discloses their importance. See Knox v. Eden Musee Co., 148 N. Y. 441, 458, et seq., 42 N. E. 988, 31 L. R. A. 779, 51 Am. St. Rep. 700; People v. Bank of North America, 75 N. Y. 547, 556, 562; Bigelow on Estoppel (6th Ed.) 710 to 716. But for other reasons, I think the question of any negligence on plaintiff\u2019s part, whether in the inception of the checks or thereafter, is unavailable to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The answer contains no allegation that the defendant has suffered or that it will eventually suffer any loss in case it is forced to respond to its prima facie liability on any of th\u00e9 checks. On the contrary, it was conceded that in each and every instance plaintiff is protected from loss by - the prior indorsement of a solvent bank through which the checks passed in the course of their collection from defendant. The Critten Case (171 N. Y. 219, 229, 63 N. E. 969, 57 L. R. A. 529) is express authority for the proposition that, under such circumstances, a bank which has paid checks to which the maker\u2019s name has been forged is not relieved from liability, even though the drawee of the check is chargeable with negligence in the transaction. In such case, the bank may only recoup for its damages, if any; this because the rule in all cases where negligence is asserted is that, to be an effective basis of legal right, damage must have resulted. This is equally true where negligence is alleged as ground of estoppel, for the only basis of estoppel is injury of some kind. Having suffered no injury and anticipating none, any negligence on plaintiff\u2019s part is quite beside the case. Nor may we speculate as to whether, in the case of some prior indorser, near or remote, the defense of plaintiff\u2019s negligence may not be good. No such indorser is now before the court, and our judgment should be based solely on the rights of the parties to the cause in hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">If the foregoing views are correct, they lead to the following, result: Defendant is in no event liable on checks to the order of existing payees and indorsed by them; defendant is prima facie liable on checks to the order of nonexisting payees; it is likewise so liable on checks to the order, of existing payees whose indorsements were forged; but, because of the returned voucher agreement, it is not liable on any checks drawn after the date of that agreement and returned to plaintiff more than 10 days before defendant was notified of the frauds.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b755-7\">DOWLING, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHo\">(dissenting). I concur in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice HOTCHKISS, except in so far as it holds that the defendant is not liable on checks drawn after the date of the alleged agreement made with the plaintiff, namely, August 2, 1909. As Ketch-am, termed a cashier, was no more than a clerk, with duties extremely limited in their nature, and' as he had no authority to make such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>agreement as that by which the plaintiff is sought to be bound, I fail to see how, in the absence of power to make an express agreement, he was vested with power to create such a situation by his acts that plaintiff would be bound by an implied agreement to the same effect as that of the claimed express agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">For these reasons I do not concur in the dissenting opinion in so far as it holds the defendant not liable on any checks drawn after the date referred to.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
