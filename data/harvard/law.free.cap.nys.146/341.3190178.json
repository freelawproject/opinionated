After the action was commenced, the plaintiff made a motion for an injunction pendente lite. The motion was denied, and it appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">\u25a0 The plaintiff\u2019s assignor leased to the defendant Belasco the theater in question for a period of ten years, commencing May 1, 1902, at an \u25a0annual rental of $30,000, plus a certain percentage of the gross receipts. The lease has since been renewed for an additional period of five years. It expressly provided that the premises were \u201cto be used \u2022and occupied by said tenant as a first-class theater,\u201d and that the tenant would not use them, or permit them to be used, \u201cfor any business purpose deemed disreputable or extrahazardous on account of fire under penalty of damages and forfeiture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">From the papers used upon the motion it appears that up to December 6, 1913, Belasco used the theater only for the purpose of producing high-class plays, for which admission tickets were sold from 50 cents to $2; that on the day mentioned, however, he made an agreement with the Universal Film Company, whereby the latter was given a license to exhibit in the theater moving pictures entitled \u201cTraffic in Souls\u201d;- and that under this license the Film Company since that time has been and now is exhibiting the pictures, for which an admission is charged at the rate of 25 cents to $1.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">The complaint alleges that the moving pictures which are being exhibited are'neither a first-class nor any other kind of a play, and for that reason the theater is being used for a purpose other than that stipulated in the lease, and in addition thereto that the exhibition of such pictures also violates the other clause in the lease above quoted, which \u2022renders the premises \u201cextrahazardous on account of fire.\u201d These allegations are supported by affidavits which were used upon the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">In passing upon the question presented by the appeal, it is unnecessary to determine whether the premises are being occupied for a purpose other than a first-class theater. That must be determined upon 'the trial of the issues. It is sufficient to say that there is a great con:flict in the papers upon that subject. If the facts set out in the affidavits presented by the plaintiff are true, then the premises are not being used as a first-class theater, and if such use is continued the value \u2022of the -property will be greatly diminished.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-14\">Our attention.is called to the fact that plaintiff believes such will be the result, since he has offered to cancel the lease rather than to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>the theater so occupied. Not only this, but the fact is not disputed but what the use to which the theater is now being put is extrahazardous on account of fire. In answer to this the defendants state they have complied with all the requirements of the municipal authorities; but, if so, the present use of the theater would seem to be a violation of the clause with reference to an increased hazard on account of fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\">[ 1 ] While it appears that the plaintiff has accepted rent which has accrued since the new use of the premises commenced, it did not thereby consent to such use, because it then, and since has, insisted that the plaintiff was using the theater in violation of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Without expressing any opinion upon the merits of the controversy, we think a proper case was presented in which an injunction should have been granted pending the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The order appealed from is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for an injunction granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
