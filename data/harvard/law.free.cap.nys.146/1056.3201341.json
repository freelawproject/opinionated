The controversy presents attack and counter attack by various of the alleged lienors upon the ground of fatal defects in many of the liens. There are four liens which we will discuss, because upon the question of their validity the court is not in agreement. Two are filed by the plaintiff Barrett, one by the White Plains Trim Company, and one by the Lieberman &amp; Sanford Company. All the liens save these are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac6K\">[ 1 ] The defect asserted to exist in the two notices of lien filed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>the plaintiff Barrett arises from the statement contained in the notices that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-5\">\u201cThe time when the first item of work was performed or materials furnished was on the 20th day of May, 1910, and the time when the last item of such work was performed or materials were furnished was on the 7th day of February, 1912.\u201d \u25a0 '</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">The corresponding requirement of the Lien Law (section 9, subd. 6, c. 38, Laws of 1909, constituting chapter 33 of the Consolidated Laws) reads;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-7\">\u201cThe notice of lien shall state: * * * The time when the first and last items of work were performed and materials were furnished.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-8\">The criticism is that the statement in' the notice is in the disjunctive. The authority for the condemnation is the lin\u00e9 of cases beginning with Bradley &amp; Currier Co. v. Pacheteau, 71 App. Div. 149, 75 N. Y. Supp. 531; Id., 175 N. Y. 492, 67 N. E. 1080, in which liens were condemned because, owing to statements made in the alternative, facts which the statute required to be stated were not definitely stated. The reason for the rule declared in those cases has no application to the question in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-9\">\u201cThe statute requires the lienor to state explicitly or by plain inference the value or the agreed price of the labor performed or materials furnished at the time of the filing of the lien. Finn v. Smith, 186 N. Y. 465 [79 N. 15. 714], Hence a statement in the alternative of the labor performed or to be performed, etc., is not an affirmation of any fact required to be stated. The fact may be either the one or the other, whereas the statute requires an explicit statement of what the fact is.\u201d Abelman v. Myer, 122 App. Div. 470, 471, 106 N. Y. .Supp. 978, 979.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-10\">The information as to the labor performed or the materials fur-, nished, and the agreed price or value thereof, is for the purpose of apprising the owner so that he may, upon inquiry, ascertain whether the materials have been actually furnished or not, and the value of the same. Vogel v. Luitwieler, 52 Hun, 184, 189, 5 N. Y. Supp. 154. The object of the provision requiring the notice to state the time when the first and last items of work were performed and materials were furnished is, so far as the latter requirement is concerned, to establish whether the labor was performed or the materials were furnished during the progress of the work, or whether 90 days had elapsed since the completion of the contract, or the.final performance of the work, or the final furnishing.of the materials, dating from the last item of work performed or of materials furnished; Section 10, Lien Law, ut supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-11\">A lien is available to four classes: Contractors, subcontractors, laborers, or materialmen. Section 3, Lien Law, ut supra. Section 9 of the Lien Law requires what the notice of lien shall state, irrespective of the class to which the person making and filing the notice belongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-12\">In the notices filed it appears that the lienor was a materialman and that what he furnished was trim\u2014sash, door, trim, and other building material and millwork\u2014and any reference in his notice to labor should be considered as labor incidental to the manufacture of his material. Felgenhauer v. Haas, 123 App. Div. 75, 76, 108 N. Y. Supp. 476; Martin v. Gavigan Co., 107 App. Div. 279, 283, 95 N. Y. Supp. 14; Clarke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>v. Heylman, 80 App. Div. 572, 576, 80 N. Y. Supp. 794. The entire notice may be considered in construing any particular part of it, and where it appears in the notice that the lienor is a materialman, and that what he asserts is a lien for the principal and interest for the value or agreed price of materials, he is not required to state separately the time when the first and last items of work were performed, and any reference to items of work contained in his statement, made in an attempted compliance with subdivision 6 of section 9 of the Lien Law, may be ignored as surplusage. Vitelli v. May, 120 App. Div. 448, 450, 104 N. Y. Supp. 1082; Schwartz v. Lewis, 138 App. Div. 566, 568, 123 N. Y. Supp. 319; Felgenhauer v. Hass, ut supra.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-4\">\u201cAs to the time and dates of work done and materials furnished for which a lien is claimed, all that is required is such certainty as will enable those interested to discover during what period the'materials were delivered or the work [was] done so as to individuate the transaction.\u201d 27 Cyc. 182, cited with approval in Hurley v. Tucker, 128 App. Div. 580, 586, 112 N. Y. Supp. 980, 985, affirmed 198 N. Y. 534, 92 N. E. 1087.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">We determine that the two notices of lien filed by the plaintiff Barrett are free from defect; and, as the only objection against the lien filed by defendant White Plains Trim Company is a similar alleged defect, we pronounce it valid also.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The Lieberman &amp; Sanford Company notice provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-7\">\u201c(4) The labor performed was setting iron and glass doors, iron stair, bronze saddles, iron lamps, iron ladder. The labor to be performed is to set wrought iron grilles, and quarter-inch plate glass indoors. The material furnished was iron entrance doors, iron stairs, bronze saddles, iron lamps and iron ladder. The material to be furnished is quarter-inch plate glass in entrance doors. The agreed price and value of said labor is ten hundred seventy and 63/100 dollars. The agreed price and value of said material is eighteen hundred seventy-eight 37/100 dollars or total for labor and materials twenty-nine hundred fifty dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-8\">\u201c(5) The amount unpaid to the lienor for such labor and material is seven hundred and fifty dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-9\">\u201c(6) The time when the first items of work were performed was April 11, 1911, and the time when the first items of material were furnished was April 11, 1911. The time when the last items of work were performed was December 5, 1911, and the time when the last items of material were furnished was February 27, 1912.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-10\">The contract as to the labor was entire, as was the contract for the material, and it is exactly stated when the first items of work were done and the first items of material were furnished, and when the last item of work was done and the last item of material furnished. The items of labor to be performed and the items of material to be furnished are clearly stated. The statute (section 9, subd. 4) requires that the notice shall state \u201cthe labor performed or to be performed, or materials furnished or to be furnished and the agreed price or value thereof.\u201d In Toop v. Smith, 87 App. Div. 241, 84 N. Y. Supp. 326, the notice did not state what materials were furnished or what work was done. No specifications or drawings appeared in or in connection with the notice of lien. Attention is not directed to the omission to state the price. The decision was affirmed in 181 N. Y. 283, 73 N. E. 1113, where, after a reference to the contents of the notice, Judge Werner wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>\u201cWe think this recital will be scanned in vain, either (1) for any statement of labor performed, (2) or to be performed, (3) or materials furnished, (4) or to be furnished.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">Then the opinion tends to the concession that, if the specifications and drawings had been attached to the notice, there would have been a substantial compliance with the statute. Finn v. Smith, ut supra, held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-6\">\u201cUnder the statute any notice of lien must state either explicitly or by plain inference the value or the agreed price of the labor performed or materials furnished at the time of filing thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">A notice is not to be denounced as defective if under certain circumstances it may be declared valid.\" The lien is restricted by express provision of statute to the principal and interest of the value or agreed price or labor performed and materials furnished. Lien Law, art. 2, \u00a7 3; Doll v. Coogan, 48 App. Div. 121, 62 N. Y. Supp. 627, affirmed 168 N. Y. 656, 61 N. E. 1129; O\u2019Reilly v. Mahoney, 123 App. Div. 275, 108 N. Y. Supp. 53. A state of facts may exist where, during the progress of the work and before the entire work is done or all the materials furnished, one entitled to a lien may file his notice for the whole contract price and assert a lien therefor, provided the balance of the contract is thereafter fully completed according to its terms. Lien Law, \u00a7 10; Heinlein v. Murphy, 3 Misc. Rep. 47, 48, 22 N. Y. Supp. 713. See Firth v. Rehfeldt, 30 App. Div. 326, 331, 51 N. Y. Supp. 980, affirmed 164 N. Y. 588, 58 N. E. 1087. The notice sets forth the labor performed and to be performed, and the materials furnished and to be furnished, the agreed price and value of the labor, the agreed price and value of the material, and a total agreed price and value of the labor and material, and the amount unpaid, together with a statement when the first and last items of work were performed and the first and last items of material were furnished. Inasmuch as the amount ,due the lienor was stipulated, we have no knowledge except that that comes from the lien itself, and it is inferable therefrom that there was an entire agreement to furnish the material and do the work for the sum of $2,750, of which the amount of $750 is unpaid. The notice shows that there was one agreement, one transaction, a statement of the gross price for all the labor and of a gross price for all the material, and the union of the two prices in a gross sum for both labor and material. Where the contract is entire both as to labor and material, and there is a gross sum, and the notice shows it, and what has been done and what has been left undone, and the amount unpaid, the demand of the statute has been met. In such case it is not necessary, nor is it generally practicable, that the agreed price should be disregarded and that the person furnishing the labor and material should preserve data of the labor and material furnished and make an estimate of the value of labor or material undone or unfurnished, for the purpose of stating the value of such labor and such material. Full information is furnished by showing the transaction between the parties. The notice is without defect, and the lien of Lieb\u00e9rman &amp; Sanford Company is valid. Felgenhauer v. Haas, ut supra; Martin v. Gavigan Co., ut supra; Woolf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>v. Schaefer, 103 App. Div. 567, 571, 573, 93 N. Y. Supp. 184; Clarke v. Heylman, ut supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-4\"><bracketnum>[3, 4]</bracketnum> The defendant Hudson Trust Company makes a claim on the moneys due, which constitute the fund out of which the liens are payable. The amount of its claim would practically exhaust the fund. The validity of its claim is presented for adjudication by virtue of an assignment which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-5\">\u201cFor and in consideration of the sum of twenty-five thousand ($25,000.00) dollars, lawful money of the United States, paid by the Hudson Trust Company, Thirty-Ninth St. &amp; Broadway, Manhattan borough, city of New York, to John V. Schaefer, Jr., &amp; Co., the said John V. Schaefer, Jr., &amp; Co., hereby assigns all rights, title and interest to the extent of twenty-five thousand ($25,000.00) dollars in the balance and final payments as per statement herewith attached which will become due under contract between said John V. Schaefer, Jr., &amp; Co., and the Hebrew Sheltering Guardian Society of New York (Orphan Asylum) for the erection of twenty-eight (28) buildings at Pleasantville, New York, and hereby authorizes and directs the said Hebrew Sheltering Guardian Society of New York (Orphan Asylum) to pay the said Hudson Trust Company the said sum of twenty-five thousand ($25,000.00) dollars and to deduct the said amount from the said final payments and balance of contract when same becomes due and owing to the said John V. Schaefer, Jr., &amp; Co. from said Hebrew Sheltering Guardian Society of New York (Orphan Asylum) under the terms of said contract, and the said John V. Schaefer, Jr., &amp; Co. does hereby make, constitute and appoint the said Hudson Trust Company its attorney in fact with full power and authorizes it to collect and receive from the said Hebrew Sheltering Guardian Society of New York (Orphan Asylum) said sum. of twenty-five thousand ($25,000.00) dollars to execute and deliver a proper receipt of said amount in the name of the said John V. Schaefer, Jr., &amp; Co.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-6\">\u201cJohn V. Schaefer, Jr., &amp; Co.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-7\">\u201cJohn V. Schaefer, Jr., President.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUPA\">In the first place, we think that as assignee the Hudson Trust Company could not assert a lien. Rollin v. Cross, 45 N. Y. 766; TisdalLumber Co. v. Read Realty Co., 154 App. Div. 270, 138 N. Y. Supp. 829. In the second place, the law specifically provides that no such assignment shall be valid until the contract or a statement containing the substance thereof, and such assignment, or a copy of each, be filed in the office of the cotinty clerk. Lien Law, ut supra, \u00a7 15. It is not disputed that neither the contract nor a statement containing the substance thereof, nor a copy of either, was filed. The contention of the trust company, however, is that the language contained in the assignment was sufficient to constitute \u201ca statement containing the substance\u201d of the contract. A reading of the assignment does not indicate that there was any attempt to comply with the statute by including such a statement in the assignment, but the expressions therein relied upon to support this contention ar\u00e9 but simply in the barest identification of the contract which is the basis of the assignment. This is not a statement containing the \u201csubstance\u201d of the contract, but merely a description of the contract. Not even the purchase price is given. It does not appear, even, that there was even a statement \u201cherewith attached.\u201d Here is a plain omission of an explicit provision of the statute, which requires the filing of the assignment and the contract or a statement. There is a long and labored discussion as to the liberal construction and substantial compliance required by the statute itself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>but this does not mean that we can disregard omissions even to comply with the requirement of the statute, when there is no attempt at compliance. As was said in Mahley v. German Bank, 174 N. Y. at page 501, 67 N. E. at page 118:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-5\">\u201cBut under the most liberal rule of construction we cannot find anything in the notice that even attempts to state when the first item of work was done or anything from which that time may be inferred. It is true that the particular advantage or object of requiring this fact to be stated is not readily apparent, but the statute has expressly required it. Errors in the notice may be disregarded, and it is not necessary that the precise verbiage of the law should be followed. But the provision of the statute that the law shall be construed liberally does not authorize the courts to entirely dispense with what the statute says the notice shall contain. We are therefore constrained to hold the notice of lien insufficient.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">In Bradley &amp; Currier Co. v. Pacheteau, ut supra, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-7\">\u201cThe liberal construction provided for in the statute assumes that the statute has, at least in form, been complied with, and that was not done here. To give this notice any other construction would in effect be holding that a lien might be acquired by the filing of a notice, no matter how defective, and irrespective of whether or not it complied with the statute at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-8\">See, too, Bradley &amp; Son v. Huber Co., 146 App. Div. 631, 131 N. Y. Supp. 388; Schwartz v. Lewis, ut supra.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-9\">\u201cA liberal construction is that by which the letter of the statute is enlarged or restrained so as more effectually to accomplish the purpose intended.\u201d Weltman v. Posenecker, 44 N. Y. Supp. 406.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-10\">See Sutherland on Statutory Construction, \u00a7 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-11\">If this is an equitable assignment, as is contended, it was subject to the same section 15 of the Mechanic\u2019s Lien Law. Harvey v. Brewer, 178 N. Y. 7, 70 N. E. 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-12\">But this appellant also contends that this assignment may be read as an order. The purpose of this contention is to avoid the necessity of filing the contract. See Brace v. City of Gloversville, 167 N. Y. 457, 60 N. E. 779. Of course, it never was intended as an order, but the effort is to twist it into one. It is an \u201corder\u201d in the sense that perforce of the assignment, and naturally in furtherance of it, it authorizes and directs the debtor to pay. The \u201corder\u201d is regarded by the appellant as an equitable assignment (not in the nature of a bill of exchange; there is no acceptance), e. g., Parker v. City of Syracuse, 31 N. Y. 379, Foster v. Dayton, 10 Daly, 228. Thus on page 13 of his points this appellant says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-13\">\u201cThat an order such as is contained in the instrument given by the contractor to the Hudson Trust Company is sufficient as an equitable assignment is also established in the following authorities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-14\">But suppose it is an equitable assignment; it is still subject to section 15, ut supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-15\">We hold the assignment not to be a valid claim against the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-16\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-17\">JENKS, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aumv\">I dissent in part. I think that the controlling policy of consideration was well expressed by Bartlett, J., in Lemmer v. Morison, 89 Hun, at page 279, 35 N. Y. Supp. 624:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-3\">\u201cAs these are matters of purely statutory creation and regulation, it seems to me that a strict adherence to the letter of the law is more conducive to justice than a looser construction with the uncertainties which it would necessarily involve.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1085-4\">The express requirement of a statute cannot be dispensed with because \u201cthe particular advantage or object\u201d of a requirement is not \u201creadily apparent.\u201d See Mahley v. German Bank, 174 N. Y. 501, 67 N. E. 118. And liberal construction prescribed even by the terms of the very statute itself does not, to my mind, authorize the entire dispensation of an express provision thereof. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">I think that the first notice of lien filed by the plaintiff is bad. The provision thereof \u201cthat the time when the first item of work was performed or materials furnished was on the 20th day of May, 1910, and the time when the last item of such work was performed or materials were furnished was the 7th day of February, 1912,\u201d is defective for the reason that the alternative expression is indicated by the word \u201cor\u201d state neither one. fact nor the other. Bradley &amp; Currier Co. v. Pacheteau, 71 App. Div. 148, 75 N. Y. Supp. 531, affirmed as to this feature 175 N. Y. 492, 67 N. E. 1080, and approved in Finn v. Smith, 186 N. Y. 465, 79 N. E. 714, Abbott v. Easton, 195 N. Y. 375, 88 N. E. 572. See, too, New Jersey Steel &amp; Iron Co. v. Robinson, 85 App. Div. 512-516, 83 N. Y. Supp. 450, affirmed 178 N. Y. 632, 71 N. E. 1134, and approved in Finn v. Smith, supra. This objection obtains in the plaintiff\u2019s second notice and in the notice of the White Plains Trim Co. In Bradley &amp; Currier Co. v. Pacheteau, supra, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-6\">\u201cThe liberal construction provided for in the statute assumes that the statute has, at least in form, been complied with, and that was not done here. To give this notice any other construction would in effect be holding that a lien might be acquired by the filing of a notice, no matter how defective, and irrespective of whether or not it complied with the statute at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">I think that the notice of the Lieberman &amp; Sanford Company is defective in that it fails to separate the labor done and to be done, likewise the materials, and states one total agreed price and value. See Finn v. Smith, supra; Toop v. Smith, 87 App. Div. 241, 84 N. Y. Supp. 326, affirmed 181 N. Y. 283, 73 N. E. 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-8\">I am authorized by Mr. Justice RICH to state that he concurs with me.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
