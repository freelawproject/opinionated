This act of the government in thus appropriating the money of the surety company under a claim of right constituted a liability, if not a loss, within the meaning of the agreement. Not only was it a liability, but it was one which had been actually enforced. Whether such appropriation was or was not justifiable is of no importance. If 'the government had paid over the \u2019money without prejudice, and had then brought an action against the surety company on its bond, that company would certainly have been compelled to defend the action at its own cost, and to pay the amount of any recovery. The situation cannot be different where the government has assumed to be its own paymaster and without bringing suit has exercised the right possessed by any creditor to determine for himself and at his own risk whether or not one is indebted to him, and whether in payment of such indebtedness he shall appropriate moneys of the debtor in his hands and leave the debtor to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs,, with leave to defendant to withdraw the demurrer and to answer on payment of said costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">INGRAHAM, P.

The surety company, of which the plaintiff is the receiver, agreed to become surety for defendant on proposals and contracts, and became surety for its performance of a contract with the government of the United States. In addition to paying the premium for the insurance, the defendant agreed in writing \"to save harmless and indemnify\u201d the surety company from \u201cany and all * * * liabilities, losses, * * * of whatsoever kind, name, nature, or description,\u201d which it should \u201cfor any cause at any time sustain or incur by reason of\u201d any bond or undertaking given by it in behalf of defendant, and that the defendant would at its own expense defend the surety company against any action brought on any such bond or undertaking, and pay \u201cupon demand any and all damages, charges and expenses\u201d for which the surety company \"should become responsible.\u201d The government claimed that the defendant failed to perform the contract for the performance of which the insol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>vent company represented by the plaintiff became surety. It appears that at that time the government was, or thereafter became, indebted to the surety company on account of transactions in no manner connected with its contract with the defendant, and the government appropriated from the moneys due from it to the surety company the sum of $1,600, under the claim that it was entitled to do so on account of the defendant's failure to perform its contract for which the surety company was surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">The receiver of the surety company brings this action, alleging merely these facts, and the question presented by the motion for judgment on the pleadings was whether the amended complaint, to which a demurrer on the ground of insufficiency of facts was interposed, states a cause of action. I am of opinion that it does not. The liability of the defendant cannot be affected by the fact that the government happened to owe the surety company and asserted a right to withhold part of the moneys thus owing on account of its claim that the defendant failed to perform the contract. There is no allegation in- the complaint to the effect that the defendant failed to perform its contract with the government; nor is there any allegation from which such failure may legitimately be inferred. The contract between the surety company and the defendant was not made in the light of a situation by which the government might have it in its power to withhold funds due from it to the surety company. It was merely contemplated that the surety company might be called upon to.respond in damages for a breach of contract on the part of its principal, and that it should be reimbursed by the defendant for any liability established against it in an action, suit, or other proceeding, including \u201ccounsel fees and expenses of whatsoever kind, name, nature, or description,\u201d and for any valid claim of liability asserted against it as surety for the defendant which it settled without litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The decision about to be made by this court proceeds upon the theory that the surety company was at liberty to settle any claim asserted against it, \u2022 whether valid or not, and to recover of the defendant the amount thus paid. To that doctrine I cannot subscribe. The amended complaint, in my opinion, is fatally defective, in that it fails to allege any facts tending to show that the United States government had a just or valid claim against the surety company as surety for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">I therefore vote for affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">CLARKE, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
