Zanesville, Ohio, February 12, 1907.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-22\">\u201cFour months after date we or either of us promise to pay to the Old Citizens\u2019 National Bank of Zanesville, Ohio, four thousand one hundred ninety-two and 50/100 dollars, value received, payable at said bank with interest at 6 per cent, per annum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-23\">\u201cNo. 17319. Due June 12. J. E. Blackburn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-24\">\u201cElmer Dover.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-25\">\u201cJ. B. Owens.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-26\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> The note, not being payable to bearer or order, is nonnegotiable (Neg. Instruments Law, \u00a7 20; Kerr v. Smith, 156 App. Div. 807, 142 N. Y. Supp. 57; National Citizens\u2019 Bank v. Toplitz, 178 N. Y. 464, 71 N. E. 1), and there would therefore be no presumption of consideration ; but the recital \u201cvalue received,\u201d in the body of the note, constitutes an admission that the instrument was issued for a sufficient consideration (Prindle v. Caruthers, 15 N. Y. 425; Hamilton v. Ham<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>ilton, 127 App. Div. 871, 112 N. Y. Supp. 10, cited with approval in National Citizens\u2019 Bank v. Toplitz, 178 N. Y. 464, 71 N. E. 1). The cases of Browning, King &amp; Co. v. Terwilliger, 144 App. Div. 516, 129 N. Y. Supp. 431, and Czerney v. Haas, 144 App. Div. 430, 129 N. Y. Supp. 537, and St. Lawrence C. Nat. Bank v. Watkins, 76 Misc. Rep. 633, 135 N. Y. Supp. 461, which has been reversed (153 App. Div. 551, 138 N. Y. Supp. 116), and Kinsella v. Lockwood, 79 Misc. Rep. 619, 140 N. Y. Supp. 513, upon which counsel for respondent relies, are plainly distinguishable on the ground that in those cases the nonnegotiable instrument was not pleaded in hase verba, and the courts were considering allegations to the effect that an instrument or promise was made for a valuable consideration, which were deemed in the nature of conclusions of law and not sufficient allegations of the facts; but manifestly those authorities have no bearing in a case where the pleading sets forth the instrument which recites an acknowledgment of th\u00e9 receipt of consideration. The promise is both joint and several. All of the makers, and each of them, therefore, has admitted the receipt of consideration for the promise. The plaintiff is one of the makers, and the defendants are the other two.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">The plaintiff alleges that he was compelled to pay the note, and that he paid it in full, with interest, and that he has demanded that each of the defendants contribute to him one-third of the amount paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> There is no merit in the contention that the plaintiff should have alleged that neither of the defendants paid the note. That is fairly to be implied from the allegation that he was compelled to pay it.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">- [4] The three makers were liable to the payee both jointly and severally, but presumptively, as between themselves, their liability was joint,, and equity requires that they bear the burden equally, and that those who have not paid shall contribute to the plaintiff, who has been obliged to pay the entire amount for which all three makers were liable. Aspinwall v. Sacchi, 57 N. Y. 331; Hard v. Mingle, 141 App. Div. 170, 126 N. Y. Supp. 51, affirmed 206 N. Y. 179, 99 N. E. 542, 42 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1131; Dillenbeck v. Dygert, 97 N. Y. 303, 49 Am. Rep. 525; McCready v. Van Antwerp, 24 Hun, 322; Kimble v. Williams, 51 App. Div. 616, 65 N. Y. Supp. 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> It was not incumbent on the plaintiff, in the circumstances, to allege an agreement for contribution, for that is an obligation implied and enforced by courts of equity. Aspinwall v. Sacchi, supra; Van Denmark v. Van Denmark, 13 How. Prac. 372; Hard v. Mingle, supra; McCready v. Van Antwerp, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">It follows that the interlocutory judgment should be reversed, and the demurrer overruled, with costs, with leave to respondent to withdraw the demurrer and answer on payment of costs of the demurrer and of the appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
