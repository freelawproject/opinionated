In the course of the operation of the plant thick, black smoke is emitted, heavily charged with a greasy soot, which when the wind is in a certain quarter settles on plaintiff\u2019s houses, and even penetrates into their interiors.. That the plaintiff\u2019s proof established the fact of the nuisance is clear, and is not disputed. The complaint was dismissed at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case because, in the opinion of the learned trial justice, the plaintiff had failed to furnish adequate proof of damages sustained. This, as we think, was error. The fact of the nuisance itself entitled plaintiff to at least nominal damages, but the proof was sufficient to enable a jury to find actual and substantial damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It appeared that the rentals received decreased materially soon after the plant had been put into operation, and never recovered, and that similar houses in other parts of the borough of Bronx produced higher rentals. This was sufficient to take the question of damages to the jury under proper instructions. The respondent argues that an adequate reason for the low rentals which the plaintiff received is to be found in the general character of the neighborhood, which is largely devoted to manufacturing purposes. This argument goes only to the quantum of damages, and should be addressed to the jury rather than the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
