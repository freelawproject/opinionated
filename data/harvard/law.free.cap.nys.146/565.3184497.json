The plaintiff, by the defendant as his guardian ad litem, brought an action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by him. He had a recovery of upwards of $12,000, and thereupon this defendant was appointed his general guardian, and as such received the amount recovered, less the expenses of the litigation. After he became of age he instituted this action to compel h\u00a7r to account. The matter was sent to a referee, who reported that the general guardian was chargeable with a balance of'-$8,491.22. The report was confirmed, and there was entered what is claimed to be a judgment directing the payment of such sum to the plaintiff, or-'his attorney, within five days after a service of the copy of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> It may well be doubted whether this is anything more than \u00a1an order directing the kind of a judgment to be entered. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">\u2022 ' \u201cOrdered that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment against the defendant 'directing her to pay to the plaintiff or his attorneys within five days after-service of a copy of this judgment the sum of * * * $8,491.22.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">If treated as an order directing the kind of a judgment to be entered, then clearly the defendant was not guilty of contempt of court in not -paying the amount found to be due. The rule is well settled that before one can be punished for contempt in not complying with a direction of the court, the particular or precise thing to be done by the party proceeded against must be clearly and definitely stated. Ketchum v. Edwards, 153 N. Y. 534, <em>47 </em>N. E. 918; German Savings Bank v. Habel, 80 N. Y. 273; Rowley v. Feldman, 66 App. Div. 463, 73 N. Y, Supp. 385; Ross v. Butler, 57 Hun. 110, 10 N. Y. Supp. 444. The\u201d provision above quoted does not direct the defendant to pay, but simply provides that the plaintiff \u201cis entitled\u201d to a judgment directing her to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\"><bracketnum>[3-5]</bracketnum> But, assuming that it is a judgment and not an order, and that it does direct the plaintiff to pay within five days the amount specified, then the order appealed from must be reversed. Judiciary Law, section 753, provides that proceedings to punish for contempt may be \u25a0maintained against:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">\u201c1. An attorney * * * or other person, in any manner duly selected or \u25a0appointed to perform a judicial or ministerial service, for a misbehavior in his office or trust, or for a willful neglect or, violation of duty therein; or for disobedience to a lawful mandate of the court, or of a judge thereof, or of an officer authorized to perform the duties of such a judge. * * * 8. A party \u25a0to' the action or special proceeding, * 6 * for the nonpayment of a sum .of money, ordered or adjudged by the court to be paid, in a case where by law execution cannot be awarded for the collection of such sum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">-; The defendant\u2019s alleged contempt consisted in a failure' to obey directions given to her \u201cas a party to the action,\u201d and not as a person who had been appointed to perform some judicial or ministerial act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>The first subdivision of the section of the Judiciary Law, therefore, has no application. The third subdivision is also inapplicable, because an execution may be issued to collect the amount directed to be paid. The Code of Civil Procedure provides (section 1240):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">\u201cIn either of the following cases, a final judgment may be enforced by execution : 1. Where it is for a sum of money, in favor of either party; or directs the payment of a sum of money.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">And section 1241:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">\u201cIn either of the following cases, a judgment may be enforced, by serving a certified copy thereof, upon the party against whom it is rendered, or the officer or person, who is required thereby, or by law, to obey it; and, if he refuses or willfully neglects to obey it, by punishing him for a contempt of court; (1) where the judgment is final, and cannot be enforced by execution, as prescribed in the last section. * * * (4) Where the judgment requires the payment of money into court, or to an officer of the court. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The defendant could not be punished under subdivision 1 of section 1241 of the Code of Civil Procedure, because execution could be issued to enforce the judgment. She could not be punished under subdivision 4 of the same section because she was not directed to pay the money into court, or to an officer of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">There are numerous authorities to the effect that an execution can be issued upon a judgment of this character, and, if so, a failure to pay as directed does not constitute a contempt of court. Thus in Matter of Amerman, 3 N. Y. St. Rep. 356, proceeding was brought in the Supreme Court to remove a trustee under a will and for an accounting. The plaintiff had an order removing the trustee and directing him to pay a specific amount found due to his cotrustees. He failed to pay, and proceedings were taken to punish him for contempt. It was held he was not guilty of contempt for failing to make the payment because execution would lie for its collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">In Matter of Hess, 48 Hun, 586, 1 N. Y. Supp. 811, the judgment directed defendants to pay a certain amount found due. It was held contempt proceedings would not lie because execution could be issued for its collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">The sections of the Code of Civil Procedure above referred to, and also what was then section 14 (now section 753 of the Judiciary Law), were considered in Harris v. Elliott, 163 N. Y. 269, 57 N. E. 406, and it was held that where an execution would be issued, one could not be punished for contempt in failing to make the payment directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">The order appealed from is therefore reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to punish for contempt denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
