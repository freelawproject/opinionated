The answer denies employment for a.definite term and, for a separate defense, alleges that, as part of the contract of employment, plaintiff agreed to: furnish a surety company bond for the faithful performance of his.duties; that,he- failed to -comply with such requirement, and upon May 10, 1913, left defendant\u2019s employ.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Plaintiff -testified that he entered into an oral contract of employment with defendant, through its president, on January 25, 1913, for a period of five months, to begin May 1,1913; but that no mention \u201cwas made of a bond \u00e1t the time of the riiaking of said contract.. He further- testified that-on April 30, 1913, before he entered Upon the performance of -his duties, he was notified by defendant\u2019s, president that he would be required to give a bond, and that he acquiesced in such requirement and immediately made application for a bond; that his application was temporarily approved by a surety company placing his name on the'general bond given by it to cover all employ\u00e9s of defendant, but that subsequently, on May 2, 1913, the .surety company notified defendant and plaintiff that it withdrew its acceptance of plaintiff\u2019s application; that, at the suggestion of' defendant,- he made application, without success, to other companies; that on May 2; 1913, defendant\u2019s president notified plaintiff that he must furnish a bond on or before May 10, 1913, or he could not continue in defendant\u2019s employ; that his efforts.to obtain a bond were unsuccessful; that on May 10,. 1913, he was notified by a representative of the defendant that he was discharged, and he thereupon left defendant\u2019s employ; that a few days later he received a notice from the surety company which had rejected him that, on reconsideration, they had decided to grant his application,.but that' he did not notify defendant that he had received such notice for the reason that he knew some one had been employed in his place. '</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u25a0 Defendant\u2019s' president testified that the fact that a bond would be required was stated as one of the conditions of employment at the first interview on January 25, '19.13, and was' repeated at subsequent interviews. -Two other officers of the defendant company were called as -witnesses and to some .extent corroborated the testimony of -its president on this point. -The- evidence shows that plaintiff, in the course qf his duties, was required .'to' handle large, sums of money, and that the giving of a bond by him was essential to the safe conduct of defendant's business and.in keeping with the'general;rule -established- by de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>fendant that all of its employes should'be und\u00e9r bond. Whether it\"was part of the original contract of employment entered into on January 25, 1913, or whether by mutual consent, as testified to by the plaintiff, the original oral contract was modified by the parties in April, before plaintiff entered upon the performance of his duties, the evidence fully establishes that, at the time plaintiff entered defendant\u2019s employ, his contract required him to furnish a surety company bond, that he was given a reasonable time in which to comply with this requirement, and failed to do so, and his discharge by defendant was therefore justifiable. '</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Plaintiff is evidently a man of excellent character and reputation and suffered great hardship and injustice by reason of the surety company\u2019s refusal of his application, but this was not due to any breach of contract on the part of the defendant. On the contrary, the defendant company showed him great consideration and forbearance, and only-discharged him after he had repeatedly failed to obtain a bond, as required by his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Plaintiff having failed to make out his cause of action for wrongful discharge, the judgment must be reversed, with costs, and the complaint dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
