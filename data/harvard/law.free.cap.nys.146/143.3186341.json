The testimony shows this condition had existed continuously for a number of years prior to plaintiff\u2019s injury, without accident or any indication that the ceiling of the closet was overladen. The evidence, of negligence on the part of the defendant employer is very slight; but, assuming it to be sufficient to sustain a verdict in favor of plaintiff, the learned court erred in admitting, over defendant\u2019s obj ection and exception, much evidence of a conjectural and purely speculative character as to the possible future results of plaintiff\u2019s injuries, and specifically charging the jury that they might award damages for permanent injuries. This, as to which there was no competent proof, was highly prejudicial to defendant and necessitates a reversal unless the amount of the judgment is reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-15\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event, unless the plaintiff stipulates within ten days after service of a copy of the order entered herewith with notice of entry of the same in the City Court to modify the judgment by reducing the same to the sum of $1,000, together with costs and disbursements, in which event the judgment, as so modified, is affirmed, without costs of this appeal to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
