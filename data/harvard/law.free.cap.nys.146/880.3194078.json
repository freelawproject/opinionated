The charge was \u201cneglect of duty, conduct unbecoming an officer, and violation of the rules.\u201d There were three written specifications of these charges. After a hearing, the police commissioner determined that the relator was not guilty of the second and third specifications, but that he was guilty of the first, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-17\">\u201cSaid Patrolman Leo Shenfield, shield No. 1249, having been informed that the carcass of a hog, the property of Richard Webber, 120th street and Third avenue, had been lost or stolen from a wagon on the morning of September 6, 1912, on Central Park West, somewhere between Forty-Second street and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>North River and 120th street and Third avenue, and that the same was in the possession of one Herman Peters, No. 951 Columbus avenue, failed to take proper police action in the matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">The commissioner determined, also, that the relator was guilty of the charge, except as to the words \u201cconduct unbecoming an officer,\u201d which doubtless means he made a finding of neglect of duty and violation of the rules. No rule, of a violation of which there is any evidence, is returned in the record. The charge of neglect of duty remains as the sole basis of the order of dismissal. Of what constituted the neglect of duty we have not been advised, and we cannot conceive of any legal duty that the relator neglected to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">The determination should be annulled, with $50 costs and disbursements, and the relator reinstated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
