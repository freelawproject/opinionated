The alleged contract was oral, and was made, on defendant\u2019s behalf, by Burlinghoff, its treasurer. After one week\u2019s service, for which he was paid, plaintiff was discharged. The complaint was dismissed for lack of proof that Burlinghoff had authority to bind defendant by a contract running for so' long a period as the one sought to be established. We think the facts proved made out a prima facie case. Whether or no the treasurer has or has not power to enter into ordinary contracts affecting the- usual business of the corporation, but not necessarily pertaining to its finances, it is not now necessary to determine. In Parmelee v. Associated P. &amp; S., 9 Misc. Rep. 458, 30 N. Y. Supp. 250, the report fails to show whether the action was for wages or for damages for unlawful discharge, but the opinion seems to have been based on the assumption that prima facie a treasurer has power to enter into ordinary contracts of employment. Here the evidence showed that the defendant accepted and paid for plaintiff\u2019s services for one week, and this, we think, was sufficient prima facie evidence of Burlinghoff\u2019s authority to bind defendant by the contract alleged. Phillips v. Campbell, 43 N. Y. 271, 272; Traitel Marble Co. v. Brown Bros., Inc., 159 App. Div. 485, 144 N. Y. Supp. 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant.to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
