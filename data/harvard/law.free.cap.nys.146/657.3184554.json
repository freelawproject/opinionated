In the first and second paragraphs of the will, the testator gave directions with respect to his funeral and the payment of his debts; and-by the sixth he merely appointed Cecil H.

McMahon of Newark aforesaid, for president and treasurer of said company to fill any vacancy caused by my death or otherwise, and thereafter so long as he may live and the trust created by this will continue, and to vote to fix the salary of the president and treasurer at one' thousand dollars per year so long as Cecil H. McMahon fills those offices (I make this direction because Cecil H. McMahon has for years past been familiar with my business affairs).

After the death of the said Marion Chase Currey, all the net income from my estate shall be divided between my sister, said Florence Muchmore, and my nephew, Norman Davis, until the above-mentioned division of my estate if they shall so long live.

The estate consists of personal property only. The inventory and appraisement of the property left by the decedent shows that its total value was $22,528.70, and that the eight shares of stock of the Conservative Realty &amp; Investment Company were appraised at $800, which was their par value. The property of the corporation consisted of five city lots in Newark, N. J., with improvements thereon which were mortgaged. The aggregate amount of the incumbrances was $113,500, and the executor estimated that the equity therein was of the value of about $125,000; but the income therefrom was insufficient to pay the current running expenses, and no dividend had been or was likely in the near future to be declared.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b682-7\">Argued before INGRAHAM, P.

Read v. Williams, 125 N. Y. 560, 26 N. E. 730, 21 Am. St. Rep. 748; Tonnele v. Wetmore, 195 N. Y. 436, 88 N. E. 1068; Kalish v. Kalish, 166 N. Y. 368, 59 N. E. 917. The executor and trustee, who .is a member of the bar in New Jersey, testified that voting trust agreements with respect to capital stock are lawful in that state, and that there is no limitation with respect to the period for which they may be created. But we are not concerned with the validity or effect of the directions, with respect to the management of the corporation through stock control, given by the testator, by paragraph 3 of the will, to his trustees. If the trustee should fail or refuse to observe the directions, then those questions might arise between him and those beneficially interested in the stock; but they are not presented for decision now.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> We have merely to decide whether any attempted disposition of property by the testator is invalid. It is stated in the will that he gives and bequeaths this stock to his executors in trust for the period of 25 years. He not only attempted to make them voting trustees of the stock for that period, but he expressly authorized them to collect and distribute the income, if any, from the stock during that period and to pay the same to the legatee Currey so far as necessary to make up the amount of $2,100 given to her by paragraph 4, and to divide the surplus, if any, and all of it in the event of said Currey\u2019s death before the expiration of 25 years, between the testator\u2019s sister Florence and his nephew until the termination of the trust period of 25 years, with a proviso that on the death of Florence, her husband, if living, and if not, her children, should take her share, and if the nephew should die his share of such income was to go to the sister if living, and, if not, to her husband, and if he should not be living then to her children. In order to make his purpose with respect to the development of the corporation, for the future financial success of which he evidently had high hopes, he attempted to suspend the absolute ownership, which includes the power of alienation of the stock, for a period not limited by two lives in being, but for a definite fixed period of 25 years in any event in contravention of our statute against perpetuities. Personal Property Law, \u00a7 11; Hagemeyer v. Saulpaugh, 97 App. Div. 535, 90 N. Y. Supp. 228. The trust in one contingency was to be limited by the life of Mrs. Currey; but the testator expressly, clearly, and pointedly declared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>it to be his intention that the trust should, even in the event of Mrs. Gurrey\u2019s prior death, \u25a0 continue until the expiration of 25 years. The will . makes it as plain as meaning can be expressed that he intended to create a trust for the period of 25 years in any event, and since that is not a limitation to two lives in being it is void, at least in so far as it purports to be for 25 years. Herzog v. Title Guarantee &amp; T. Co., 177 N. Y. 86, 69 N. E. 283, 67 L. R. A. 146; Matter of Willcox, 194 N. Y. 288, 87 N. E. 497; Haynes v. Sherman, 117 N. Y. 433, 22 N. E. 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">- [3-5] The learned counsel for the appellant contends that the testator'attempted to create but'a single trust and that it must all stand or fall together. Counsel for respondents argue, however, that, if the \u25a0attempted suspension of absolute ownership for the .period of 25 -years be void,- the trust; may be sustained as one for the.life of Mrs. Currey, On the .theory that the trust-provisions for her benefit are .independent of and separable from the provisions for continuing the trust after: her,,death - until the expiration of the trust period of 25 years. \u25a0 The rule is well settled that that, construction .of a-will, which -will sustain its validity in- whole or in part and avoid either partial pr-total intestacy, is favored (Kalish v. Kalish, supra); and therefore \u00a1where a . will contains one or more invalid trusts and one or -more valid -and \u2022 independent lawful trusts, not forming an essential part of the general scheme of' the will as a whole, the invalid provisions-. may be annulled and the .valid ones sustained (Simpson v. Trust Co. of America, 129 App. Div. 200, 113 N. Y. Supp. 370, affirmed .197 N. Y. 586, 91 N. E. 1120; Matter of Willcox, supra; Central Trust Co. v. Egleston, 185 N. Y. 23, 77 N. E. 989; Benedict v. Webb, 98. N. Y. 460; Knox v. Jones, 47 N. Y. 389; Hooker v. Hooker, 166 N. Y. 156, 59 N. E. 769); and on the same theory invalid provisions which relate to and are connected with valid provisions, but-not .-dependent thereon, will likewise be excised- and the valid provisions to;. which they relate retained (Hascall v. King, 162 N. Y. 134, 56 N. E. 515, 76 Am. St. Rep; 302).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">-: It is: argued that the provisions,-for-Mrs., Currey may- be sustained US an annuity .and charge upon, the residuary estate, even though they cannot be sustained on the theory--of a trust. - :I.f the testator directed th.6 .payment of an annuity - in- a fhted- amo.Unt-to Mrs. Currey, .it would-be deemed a charge Oil the residuary estate without' the iriteryep.tion' of - a trust, 'even though he directed' it to be paid out of .ingoing!\u2019(Clark v. Clark, 147 N. Y. 639, 42.N. E. 275; Dunham v. Deraismes, 165 N. Y. 65, 58 N. E. 789; People\u2019s Trust Co. v. Flynn, 188 N. Y. 385, 391, 393, 80 N. E. 1098), .and the lien on the residuary restate. might be discharg\u00e9d by-payment' of . -the . present value of -the-',annuity (Buchanan, v. Little, 154 N. Y. 147, 47 N. E. 970; People's TruSt Co. v. Flynn, supra), or- sufficient pf., the-residuary estate, Jfathjere- were sufficient,-might' be set apart-, and retained by the'trustee \u00a1to;produce and-pay the annuity (Clark v. Clark, supra); but here .t-hg; annuity is not given absolutely, but . it is expressly limited to income \u00e1nd- made dependent upon the-amount and sufficiency of the inlCQrne#.-,;'Itvis-not,, therefore, a charge upou the,residuary estate in.the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>sense \"that it- may \"be paid -out \"of- the corpus thereof. _ The'validity of the trust would seem therefore .to be.necessary to give Mrs. Currey the: benefit of the' provision the testator intended to make for her. A-trust, however, for the life of Mrs. Currey to' enable her to receive the income of the residuary estate to the extent specified in the will, is .one which was clearly authorized by law, and the trustee may hold the- legal title for the purposes of that.trust, even though with respect to the remainder the testator died intestate and it passed to and vested in his next- of kin. Kennedy v. Hoy, 105 N. Y. 134, 11 N. E. 390; Matter of Willcox, supra; Schlereth v. Schlereth, 173 N. Y. 444; 449, 66 N. E. 130, 93 Am. St. Rep.. 616; On this theory, the testator lawfully disposed of the entire income \"of the residuary estate during, the life of\u2018Mrs. Currey. She takes it all, unless it shall exceed $2,100 per annum, and the surplus,-if any,\" over that amount goes to the nephew .and sister*, and, in the. event of the death of either or both of them*, to the substituted -beneficiaries specified in the fourth paragraph of the will. Schermerhorn v. Cotting, 131 N. Y. 48, 29 N. E. 980.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">It is as has been stated by counsel for appell\u00e1nt, that the trusts, are entire and inseparable, and that therefore, under the well-settled rule (see Central Trust Co. v. Egleston, supra), all must stand or fall together. I am unable to agree with that argument. To sustain the trust for the benefit of Mrs. Currey does not conflict with any. part of the scheme or plan of the testator with respect to the disposition of the remainder, for the provisions for her benefit are not dependent upon or interwoven with the other provisions;\u2018 nor is th\u00e9re anything to indicate that the testator would not have -so provided - for her had he known that he could not dispose of the1 remainder as he did dispose of it; but, on the contrary, it would seeni that to -properly provide for her was his primary consideration. It cannot be reasonably inferred that he only intended that she should have .the income of the residuary estate to the extent of $2,100 per annum during .her life in the event that he could lawfully continue the trust for the period of 25 years if she should die sooner. It is manifest that, whether- the law forbade or permitted the trust for 25 years, he intended to provide an annuity for-this-woman for lif.e\u2019 from the income of his residuary estate. Therefore giving effect to those provisions of the will designed to afford,Mrs. Currey an annuity for the period of her natural life gives effect, to the -plain intention of the,testator, and the fact that owing to his failure to follow the requirements of law we .are unable to give further effect to the provisions of,his. will does not preclude the court from giving it effect as contemplated by the testator until-, .the death of Mrs. Currey., See Kennedy v. Hoy, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">I am of opinion,. therefore, that there was a valid trust created dm&gt; ing the life of Mrs. Currey,. but. that the trust attempted to be created for the period -of 25 years was void. .</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> Counsel for the executor respondent, contends that, if the testator contemplated a trust for the period of 25.years which, would be invalid, that provision may be disregarded and the trust sustained as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>one for the life of Mrs. Currey, and the will upheld as a valid disposition of the remainder at that time, and counsel for all the respondents contend that in any event in order to sustain the will as a disposition of the residuary estate it should be construed as creating a trust only during the life of Mrs. Currey. As already observed, the intention of the testator to have the trust continued in any event for 25 years, no matter how long prior to that time Mrs. Currey may die, is quite plain, and it is equally plain that the testator has not attempted to dispose of the remainder until the expiration of the trust whether it shall terminate with death of Mrs. Currey after the expiration' of the 25-year period or by the expiration of that period should she die before. Moreover, the remainder is contingent, and those who would take now if Mrs. Currey should die presently if the testator had provided for distribution on her death might not be the same persons as those who would take at the expiration of the 25-year period. If Mrs. Currey should die presently, the defendant Davis, the nephew, would take one-half the residuary estate; whereas, he may die before the end of the 25-year period prescribed in the will without leaving issue, and in that event, if the remainder were to vest at the expiration of the 25-year period as contemplated by the testator his sister, if then living, and if dead her children, would take the one-half that the nephew was to take if then living. If Mrs. Currey should die before the expiration of the 25-year period, and the testator\u2019s nephew and sister should survive her, and the disposition of the remainder could be sustained, they would take, and yet they might die within the 25-year period and leave none of the property to their issue who would have taken if the will were sustained as made by the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">There can therefore be no doubt but that, if the will could be sustained as made, the remainder would not vest until the expiration of the 25-year period, even though Mrs. Currey should die before that time, and therefore it could not be definitely known until the time for distribution who would take the remainder. Schlereth v. Schlereth, supra; People\u2019s Trust Co. v., Flynn, supra. If it were certain that identically the same remaindermen would take whether the remainder vested in possession at the death- of Mrs. Curry or at the expiration of the 25-year period, then under the statute and authorities the will might be sustained as a valid disposition of the remainder. Real Property Law, \u00a7 42; Purdy v. Hayt et al., 92 N. Y. 446; Kalish v. Kalish, supra; Matter of Willcox, supra; Rice v. Barrett, 102 N. Y. 161, 6 N. E. 898; Knox v. Jones, supra. Since, however, by the clear and explicit provisions of the will, the remainder is contingent and it cannot be known who will' take until the expiration of the trust which the testator directed should continue for 25 years in any event, the court cannot eliminate those provisions and decree that the remainder shall vest in possession upon the death of Mrs. Currey, for that would not be construing the will as made, but would in effect be construeing a will for the testator. Simpson v. Trust Co. of America, supra. The observations already made suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>ficiently answer the contention that the will may be construed as creating a trust for the life of Mrs. Currey only.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">It follows therefore that the judgment should be reversed, with costs to appellant and to the executors, payable out^ of the estate, and judgment should be entered in favor of the plaintiff to_ the effect that the trust in the fourth paragraph of the will is valid for the life of Mrs. Currey, and that the provisions thereof disposing of the income of the residuary estate during that period are valid, but that the further trusts with respect to income until the expiration of the 25-year period and the disposition of the remainder of the residuary estate are void, and that upon the' death of Mrs. Currey the next of kin of the testator will be entitled to take in possession the residuary estate as intestate property. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
