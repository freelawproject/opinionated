From a judgment for defendant, plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A3si\">Reversed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-15\">The complaint alleges plaintiff\u2019s ownership of the premises 79 Stanton street, where he conducts a clothing business, and that defendant is the owner of the adjoining premises No. 77, which had been used for the same purpose; that, defendant\u2019s premises having become vacant, he agreed with plaintiff that for a period of three years defendant would not rent his store for use in the clothing business, and, in case he (defendant) violated the agreement, he should \u201cbe liable * * * in damages and breach of contract\u201d; that, in violation of the agreement, defendant has let the premises to Freedman Bros, for a clothing store, they having taken the lease with knowledge of the agreement. With appropriate allegations to show that plaintiff had no adequate remedy at law, the relief demanded was that defendant and Freedman Bros, be restrained from leasing or giving or taking possession of the store for the purpose of the clothing business, and from conducting or permitting such business to be conducted on the premises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b547-16\">Argued before INGRAHAM, P.

Lewis v. Gollner, 129 N. Y. 227, 234, 29 N. E. 81, 26 Am. St. Rep. 516; Diamond Match Co. v. Roeber, 106 N. Y. 473, 486, 13 N. E. 419, 60 Am. Rep. 464. Defendant\u2019s counsel concedes that the demurrer is bad, inasmuch as it did not specify <em>the </em>parties failure to join whom constituted the defect. This defect in pleading could not be cured on the motion, under Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The judgment and order should be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer overruled, with $10 costs, with leave to the defendant to withdraw the demurrer, and to answer upon payment of costs in this court and in the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
