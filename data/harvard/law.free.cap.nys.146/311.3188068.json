Judgment was entered in accordance with the stipulation, and, after the time within which execution should not be issued had expired, defendant moved for a vacation of the judgment on the ground that his attorney had signed the stipulation under the impression that the amount claimed was very much less than the amount of the judgment. <em>Held,, </em>that as the amount claimed clearly appeared from the complaint and summons, and as Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, c. 580) \u00a7 1, subd. 16, authorizes that tribunal to enter judgment with consent of the parties, an order vacating the judgment was improper and should be reversed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b333-11\">[Ed.

Judgment in favor of the plaintiff was thereupon entered. On December 18, 1913, the defendant made a motion for an order \u201cvacating and setting aside the judgment heretofore rendered in favor of the plaintiff and. against the defendant and opening the default of the defendant and setting the case down for trial.\u201d This motion was granted, and from the order granting the same the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The grounds of this motion were that the defendant\u2019s attorney had signed the stipulation \u201cunder the impression that the amount claimed by the plaintiff was only the sum of $10.35, instead of $441.41.\u201d Hqw or why. the defendant\u2019s attorney received such an impression is not disclosed in the moving papers. The summons claimed $441.41, and the complaint set forth two causes of action, one in paragraph 3 claiming $10.35, and one in paragraph 5 claiming $431.06, and each paragraph was specifically denied by the answer. The Municipal Court Act, \u00a7 1, subd. 16, confers jurisdiction upon the Municipal Court to enter a judgment in an action upon \u201cconsent of both parties,\u201d and the judgment in the case at bar was therefore not a default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Order reversed, with costs, and judgment reinstated. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
