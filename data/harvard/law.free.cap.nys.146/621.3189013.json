These prior assignees, Messrs. Engesser and Abramson, according to the affidavits filed in the New York county action, were beneficially interested in that suit. The judgment in that action for costs, having been recovered after the trustee\u2019s appointment, could not be here offset. Knight v. Rothschild, 132 App. Div. 274, 278, 117 N. Y. Supp. 26. There is therefore a good ground to stay the present suit until the previous judgment for costs shall be paid. Genet v. Davenport, 58 N. Y. 607; Barton v. Speis, 73 N. Y. <em>133; </em>Behrens v. Sturges, 138 App. Div. 537, 123 N. Y. Supp. 224. Whether or not the assignee in bankruptcy could be charged personally with these costs is not now involved. The real question is whether, by bringing a second suit in this county, the plaintiffs can escape liability for the costs imposed in the original suit, in which the trustee and the two other plaintiffs actively and beneficially \u2022participated. As was held in Nelligan v. Groth, 126 App. Div. 444, 110 N. Y. Supp. 619, the liability of the person beneficially interested for costs \u201cis absolute, and to the same extent as if he was the plaintiff.\u201d Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3247. Defendant has therefore a right to have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>costs of the original suit paid him before he can be put to the trouble and expense of defending another action for the same cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The order appealed from is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and defendant\u2019s motion for a stay granted, with $10 costs;</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
