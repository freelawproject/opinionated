Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), when it treated the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory at sentencing. The government concedes that the district court plainly erred and that the sentence should be vacated and this case remanded for resentencing. During sentencing, the district court expressed an unequivocal desire to impose a sentence lower than the minimum sentence mandated by the Guidelines. Because the district court committed plain error when it applied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory and that error affected Martinez\u2019s substantial rights, we vacate and remand for resen-tencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">In September 2004, Nicky Martinez pleaded guilty to two counts of a ten-count indictment:, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. sections 846 and 841(b)(1)(A), and using or carrying a firearm in furtherance of a violent and drug-related crime in violation 18 U.S.C. section 924(c)(1)(A). Because Martinez had two previous convictions for crimes of violence, he qualified for an enhanced sentence as a career offender. The career offender guideline provided for a Criminal History Category of VI. The resulting sentencing range under the Guidelines was 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment for the cocaine charge, with 60 months to run consecutively for the weapons charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-6\">At the sentencing hearing on January 6, 2005, Martinez stated that he did not \u201csee any factual errors\u201d in the Pre-Sentence Investigation report, \u201chad not made any objections,\u201d and agreed that the Guidelines range was correct as calculated. Martinez did, however, move for a downward departure in the Criminal History Category because the two previous felony convictions that qualified Martinez as a career offender occurred ten years earlier, when he was only 19. Martinez made no other argument for reducing his sentence, and Martinez\u2019s counsel noted- that, \u201c[ojther than [the downward departure], I don\u2019t believe there is really anything the Court can do [to reduce the sentence], unless the Court sees something that I don\u2019t.\u201d The district court granted the downward departure and recalculated the applicable Guideline range for the cocaine charge at 235 months to 293 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">During the hearing, the court repeatedly expressed a concern that the Guideline range was -too high, asking rhetorically \u201c[a]m I using a sledge hammer when a hammer would be just as effective.\u201d The transcript recorded numerous statements of the district court indicating frustration with the Guideline minimum sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-8\">[Although the government may take me up on appeal, I think that this is a case that warrants the exercising of the discretion to not give him the straight career criminal category, but to go down. Unfortunately the Sentencing Guidelines limit me to just going down one level. So I have done that. I understand he is trying to cooperate with the government. I don\u2019t have as much room to play here as I \u2014 and I am getting no \u2014 -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-9\">I exercised my discretion and went downward from where I would have started at, 262 [months], to 235 [months]. If I could go [farther], I might consider doing that. But I have talked with [the probation officer]. The two of us have studied the books to see if there is any way that we can do it legally. And we, as [defense counsel] said, and he has done it too, we can\u2019t find any other way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-10\">The Court has considered the statements by all of the parties and reviewed the Presentence Investigation Report. The Court wall impose a sentence within the guidelines, at the very bottom of the guidelines, since the term of imprisonment is more than sufficient punishment and deterrent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-11\">MS. LAGOA: And, Your Honor, also to be clear on the record, the government has no objection to the sentence imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>THE COURT: Oh, thank God. Is there any way we can make it shorter? MS. LAGOA: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1191-5\">THE COURT: I hope that you are able to be back- here for a Rule 35 in some way shape or another, Mr. Martinez, because I do feel that you have the abilities to make a very. positive contribution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">The court imposed no. f\u00edne, sentenced Martinez to 235 months for' the cocaine charge. and 60 months for the firearms charge, and recommended an intensive drug treatment program \u201cso that he will be eligible for an additional year off his sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-7\">Martinez filed a notice of appeal on January 18, 2005. Before Martinez filed his initial brief on appeal, he filed a \u201cMotion for Temporary Relinquishment of Jurisdiction to the Trial Court,\u201d in which Martinez requested that we return his case to the district court for reconsideration of his sentence in the light of the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Booker. </em>Martinez\u2019s unconventional motion is now before us, and we construe it as a motion for summary reversal. <em>See N.L.R.B. v. Amalgamated Clothing Workers of Am., AFL-CIO, Local 990, </em>430 F.2d 966, 971 n. 13 (5th Cir.1970) (citing <em>Groendyke Transp., Inc., v. Davis, </em>406 F.2d 1158, 1161 n. 6 (5th Cir.1969)). We then directed the government to file a letter brief regarding the merits of Martinez\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-9\">Because Martinez did not object to the conclusion of the district court that it was bound by the Guidelines as mandatory, our review is for plain error. We \u201cmay not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and citations omitted). As the government concedes, Martinez prevails even under this circumscribed review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-11\">Martinez easily satisfies the first and second prongs of the plain error test. The district court erred when it sentenced Martinez because it considered the Guidelines to be mandatory. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005). Although the error was not plain at the time of sentencing, \u201cwhere the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal ... it is enough that the error be \u2018plain\u2019 at the time of appellate consideration.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 1549, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997). Under <em>Booker, </em>application of the Guidelines as mandatory is now plainly error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-12\">The third prong requires Martinez to show that the plain error \u201caffects [his] substantial rights,\u201d and that the error \u201cactually did make a difference.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298. \u201c[I]n applying the third prong, we ask whether there is a reasonable probability of a different result if the guidelines had been applied in an advisory instead of binding fashion by the sentencing judge in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1300. Martinez satisfies this exacting standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-13\">As recounted above, the district court made repeated comments during the sentencing hearing that displayed frustration with its inability to impose a sentence lower than the Guideline minimum. The court did not merely state that it \u201cmight consider\u201d imposing a lower sentence if not precluded by the Guidelines; rather, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>court asked if there was \u201cany way we can make [the sentence] shorter,\u201d stated that the court had unsuccessfully \u201cstudied the books to see if there is any way that we can [reduce the sentence] legally,\u201d and expressed regret that \u201c[u]nfortunately the Sentencing Guidelines limit me to just going down one level.... I don\u2019t have as much room to play here as I\u2014 These comments establish that there is a reasonable probability that the district court would have imposed a more lenient sentence if the court had considered the Guidelines to be advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">\u201cFinally, under the fourth prong of plain-error review, we consider whether the \u2018plain error\u2019 at sentencing \u2018seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1333 (citations omitted). <em>Shelton </em>provides that Martinez prevails under this prong:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aotq\">The district court in this case indicated an express desire to impose, a sentence lesser than the low end of the Guidelines range of 130 months\u2019 imprisonment, and the Supreme Court in <em>Booker </em>plainly indicated that the district court now has the discretion to do so, provided the resulting sentence is reasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Under these circumstances, defendant Shelton has carried his burden to establish the fourth prong and has shown that the plain error that affected his substantial rights also seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings in his particular case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1192-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1333-34. Because the district court expressed a clear desire to impose a more lenient sentence and <em>Booker </em>provides that the district court had the authority- to consider the Guidelines as advisory, the plain error of applying the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of Martinez\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-9\">Martinez\u2019s motion for summary reversal is GRANTED.- Martinez\u2019s sentence is VACATED in its entirety and this matter is REMANDED to the district court for a new sentencing hearing. At the new sentencing hearing,. the district court must consider the Guidelines range along with the statutory factors contained in 18 U.S.C. section 3553(a).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
