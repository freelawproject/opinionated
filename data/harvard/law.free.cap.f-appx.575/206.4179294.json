In denying relief on Parker\u2019s motion, the district court found that Amendment 750 had no effect on Parker\u2019s Guidelines range because he received a career offender sentence in October 2009. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">The district court properly concluded that it lacked authority to grant a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Parker\u2019s Guidelines range was driven by his career offender designation and not the crack cocaine Guidelines provisions. <em>See United States v. Munn, </em>595 F.3d 183, 187 (4th Cir.2010); <em>see also United States v. Bullard, </em>645 F.3d 237, 248 (4th Cir.2011) (holding that the FSA does not apply retroactively to defendants sentenced prior to its August 3, 2010 effective date). Furthermore, our recent decision in <em>United States v. Black, </em>737 F.3d 280, 287 (4th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1902, 188 L.Ed.2d 932 (2014), forecloses Parker\u2019s claim that the FSA\u2019s amendments to the relevant statutory scheme should be applied in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-15\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. <em>See United States v. Parker, </em>No. 5:09-er-00021-BR-1 (E.D.N.C. Feb. 14, 2014). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
