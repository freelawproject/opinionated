He contends for the first time on appeal that the district court erroneously increased his offense level by 16 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because he had a prior conviction in Florida for felony battery. He argues that the documentation of the prior conviction was insufficient to support the conclusion that the offense was a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Specifically, he contends that the documentation in the record does not show that the offense was either an enumerated offense under the Guideline or that it had as an element \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. l(B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-22\">The Amended Information in the record shows that Mejia-Escobar\u2019s prior conviction was for a violation of Florida Statute \u00a7 784.041(1), which has only one relevant subsection. Felony battery under \u00a7 784.041 cannot be committed without using physical force or violence. <em>Dominguez v. State, </em>98 So.3d 198, 200 (Fla.Dist.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>App.2012). This court has not addressed whether Florida felony battery is a crime of violence. Mejia-Escobar fails to show that the district court clearly or obviously erred in concluding that the Florida offense involved the use of physical force against another and thus qualified as a crime of violence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. l(B)(iii)); <em>United States v. Fernandez-Cusco, </em>447 F.3d 382, 384 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
