We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-23\">Ni argues that the IJ and BIA erred, under <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), in relying on the testimony and report of a forensic document analyst who found that Ni\u2019s notarial birth certificate was counterfeit. We lack jurisdiction to consider this argument because Ni did not raise it in his appeal to the BIA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-24\">Ni also argues that the adverse credibility finding was not supported by substantial evidence. The IJ found that Ni\u2019s notarial birth certificate was counterfeit. Ni contends that he did not know that the birth certificate was fraudulent because his wife sent it to him from China. The IJ found, however, that the birth certificate was created in Los Angeles and for that reason, Ni had reason to know that the document was counterfeit. The IJ\u2019s finding distinguishes Ni\u2019s case from <em>Yeimane-Berhe v. Ashcroft, </em>393 F.3d 907, 911 (9th Cir.2004). <em>See Khadka v. Holder, </em>618 F.3d 996, 1001 (9th Cir.2010). Because the birth certificate was offered to establish Ni\u2019s identity, a \u201ckey element[ ] of the asylum claim,\u201d the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-25\">Ni\u2019s remaining arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-26\">Petition DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b797-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
