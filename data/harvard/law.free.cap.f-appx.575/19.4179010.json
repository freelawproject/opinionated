Each appellant is serving a sentence imposed outside that district,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and each appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>filed a materially identical habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in that district seeking immediate release from prison. The District Court denied the petitions on April 16, 2014. Appellants appeal, and we will affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Federal inmates may challenge the execution of their sentences under \u00a7 2241 in their court of confinement, <em>see Burkey, </em>556 F.3d at 146, but they generally may challenge the legality of their sentences only under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and must do so in the sentencing court, <em>see United States v. Tyler, </em>732 F.3d 241, 246 (3d Cir.2013); <em>Furnari v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>531 F.3d 241, 254 (3d Cir.2008). Appellants in these cases requested immediate release from prison on the ground that their sentences are unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">According to appellants, the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 does not authorize incarceration unless the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) provides a mechanism for requesting a reduction in sentence for non-medical reasons under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A)(i).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellants further contend that the BOP failed to provide them with a \u201ccompassionate release request packet\u201d upon request and that, when they created and submitted their own, the BOP took no action on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">Appellants, however, do not request an order directing the BOP to process any such request or to execute their sentences differently in any other way. Instead, they claim that the BOP\u2019s alleged failure to process their requests for reduced sentences renders the sentences themselves unlawful and that \u201cimmediate release [from prison] is the only sanctioned remedy[.]\u201d <em>(E.g., </em>W.D. Pa. Civ. No. 3-13-cv-00285, EOF No. 1-3 at 6.) To that end, each appellant \u201cseeks the re-ordering of his sentence to provide that he serve his supervised release term immediately[.]\u201d <em>(E.g., id., </em>ECF No. 1-1 at 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">The District Court properly recognized that it lacks jurisdiction to grant that request, which must be addressed to the courts that imposed the sentences that appellants seek to have \u201cre-ordered.\u201d No appellant has stated any reason why a \u00a7 2255 motion in his sentencing court might be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e), and we perceive none. Indeed, four appellants already have raised their claims in this regard before their sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>ing courts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We thus express no opinion on the merits of appellants\u2019 claims, though we note that appellants have not cited, and we are not aware of, any authority suggesting that their allegations state a basis for the relief they request, in their sentencing courts or any other.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">For these reasons, appellees\u2019 motion for summary action is granted and we will affirm the judgments of the District Court. Appellants\u2019 pending motions in this Court are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-20\">. Appellant Hendricks\u2019s sentence was imposed at N.D. Ind. No. 2-0 l-cr-00105-001. Slater\u2019s sentence was imposed at S.D. Ohio No. l-07-cr-00155-001. Elfgeeh\u2019s sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>was imposed at E.D.N.Y. No. l-03-cr-00133-001. Ranieri\u2019s sentence was imposed at W.D.N.Y. No. 6-02-cr-06126-001. Whitted\u2019s sentence was imposed at D.V.I. No. 3-04-cr-00176-001. Apostolopoulos\u2019s sentence was imposed at D. Md. No. l-05-cr-00322-001. Mahoney\u2019s sentence was imposed at D. Mass. No. 1-1 0-cr-l 03 89-001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b48-8\">. A certificate of appealability not required to appeal the denial of a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Burkey v. Marberry, </em>556 F.3d 142, 146 (3d Cir.2009). We thus have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Appellees have informed us that Hendricks and Mahoney have been transferred to different facilities, but that transfer has not mooted their requests for outright and immediate release from prison discussed below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b48-13\">. This statute permits a sentencing court, \"upon motion of the Director of the [BOP],\u201d to reduce a sentence if \"extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a reduction.\u201d The BOP's regulations provide a mechanism for inmates to request that the BOP file such a motion. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 571.60-571.64. Although we need not and do not reach the issue, we note the conclusion of other courts that the BOP\u2019s discretionary decision not to file a motion for a reduced sentence is not reviewable in court. <em>See, e.g., Crowe v. United States, </em>430 Fed.Appx. 484, 485 (6th Cir.2011) (collecting precedential decisions).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b49-15\">. Those appellants are Hendricks, Elfgeeh, Ranieri and Whitted, each of whom recently filed in their sentencing courts a materially identical document captioned as a \"request to take judicial notice\u201d of the claim discussed above. In Ranieri\u2019s case, for example, the sentencing court construed his notice as a motion for a reduction in sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A) and denied it because it was not brought by the BOP. Ranieri\u2019s appeal to the Second Circuit from that ruling apparently remains pending.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
