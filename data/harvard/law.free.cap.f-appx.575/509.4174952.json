The district court dismissed the action as time barred and as frivolous. Because the district court cited both 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A as authority for its dismissal, our review is de novo. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-19\">According to Conroy, the defendants violated his constitutional rights at the time of his arrest in July 2010. He contends that he did not learn of the legal basis for this \u00a7 1983 action until November 2011, when his trial attorney provided him with information obtained during the course of discovery. Thus Conroy asserts, he was not required to bring this suit until November 2013. He does not contend that he was ignorant of the facts of his claim when they occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-24\">The two-year statute of limitations established by Texas law governs this action. <em>See Wallace v. Kato, </em>549 U.S. 384, 387-88, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007); <em>Stanley v. Foster, </em>464 F.3d 565, 568 (5th Cir.2006). However, federal law determines the time at which the cause of action accrued. <em>See Wallace, </em>549 U.S. at 388, 127 S.Ct. 1091. Under federal law, the limitations period in a \u00a7 1983 action begins to run when \u201cthe plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>237 F.3d 567, 576 (5th Cir.2001). A plaintiff need not be aware that a legal cause of action exists; he need only know the facts that would support a claim. <em>Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>51 F.3d 512, 516 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-25\">Conroy\u2019s cause of action accrued at the time the alleged violations occurred in July 2010. The limitations period therefore expired in July 2012, over a year before Conroy filed this suit. Precedent forecloses Conroy\u2019s argument that his cause of action did not accrue until his attorney provided him information in November 2011 and he knew that he had a legal basis for suit. <em>See Wallace, </em>549 U.S. at 388, 127 S.Ct. 1091; <em>Piotrowski, </em>237 F.3d at 576; <em>Piotrowski, </em>51 F.3d at 516. This appeal thus \u201crelies on an indisputably meritless legal theory,\u201d lacks any arguable basis, and is frivolous. <em>Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 472 (5th Cir.2001). We therefore dismiss it. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The district court\u2019s dismissal of Conroy\u2019s complaint and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous each counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Con-roy is cautioned that if he receives a third strike under \u00a7 1915(g) he will not be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b537-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
