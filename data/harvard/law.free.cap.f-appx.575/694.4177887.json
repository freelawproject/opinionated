During the contact, Howard discovered O\u2019Berry in possession of a cellular phone with internet capability \u2014 a violation of one of his conditions of supervised release. O\u2019Berry admitted that he had used the phone to view adult pornography. Howard then asked O\u2019Berry whether he had viewed any child pornography, and O\u2019Berry admitted that he had viewed pornography depicting children who were sixteen or seventeen years old. O\u2019Berry stated that he used the phone and his girlfriend\u2019s laptop computer to search for and view the child pornography. Howard seized the phone and conducted a search of O\u2019Berry\u2019s residence. During the search, Howard seized several additional items, including the laptop computer belonging to O\u2019Berry\u2019s girlfriend. Forensic analysis uncovered three videos on the phone and 1,300 still images on the laptop computer. One of the three videos showed the penetration of a prepubescent female\u2019s vulva and another consisted entirely of a prepubescent female performing fellatio on an adult male. O\u2019Berry admitted to downloading these videos in order to view them on the phone. All of the still images that O\u2019Berry downloaded onto the laptop computer depicted prepubescent female children.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">O\u2019Berry pled guilty to one count of receipt of materials involving the sexual exploitation of minors, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2). During the plea hearing, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reviewed the written plea agreement between O\u2019Berry and the Government and informed O\u2019Berry of the fifteen-year mandatory-minimum sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(1). The district court sentenced O\u2019Berry to the mandatory minimum. O\u2019Berry subsequently filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. In his motion, O\u2019Berry claims that his guilty plea was invalid in light of his counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance. First, O\u2019Berry argues that his counsel failed to negotiate with the Government to allow O\u2019Berry to plead guilty to the lesser, uncharged crime of possession of materials involving the sexual exploitation of minors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B) \u2014 which, under the circumstances of his case, carried a mandatory-minimum sentence of ten years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(2). Second, O\u2019Berry asserts that his counsel failed to advise him that possession of materials involving the sexual exploitation of minors is a lesser-included offense of his crime of conviction (ie., receipt of such materials) that carries a lower mandatory minimum, thereby preventing him from meaningfully considering his right to a jury trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In response, the Government made clear at the \u00a7 2255 motion hearing that it would not have agreed to allow O\u2019Berry to plead guilty to the lesser crime of possession in light of his previous child-pornography conviction and the fact that he recidivated approximately two months after being put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>on supervised release. The district court denied O\u2019Berry\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. O\u2019Berry appeals the denial of the motion, and we affirm for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">\u201cWhen addressing post-conviction ineffective assistance claims brought under \u00a7 2255, we review the ineffective assistance issue <em>de novo </em>and the underlying findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Tinajero-Ortiz v. United States, </em>635 F.3d 1100, 1103 (8th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>United States v. Regenos, </em>405 F.3d 691, 692-93 (8th Cir.2005)). To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, O\u2019Berry must show that defense counsel\u2019s performance was both deficient and prejudicial. <em>See United States v. Frausto, </em>754 F.3d 640, 642 (8th Cir.2014). \u201cFailure to demonstrate either deficient performance by counsel or prejudice therefrom is fatal to a petitioner\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 643. \u201cIn order to demonstrate prejudice where, as here, a petitioner challenges the validity of his guilty plea, the petitioner must show \u2018that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985)). \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1403, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011) (quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). \u201cThat requires a \u2018substantial,\u2019 not just \u2018conceivable,\u2019 likelihood of a different result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Whether the alleged deficiencies of O\u2019Berry\u2019s counsel prejudiced him \u201cby causing him to plead guilty rather than go to trial will depend ... in large part on a prediction whether the evidence likely would have changed the outcome of a trial.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 59, 106 S.Ct. 366. Therefore, in cases such as this, \u201cthe \u2018prejudice\u2019 inquiry ... closely resemble[s] the inquiry engaged in by courts reviewing ineffective-assistance challenges to convictions obtained through a trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Assuming, without deciding, that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, O\u2019Berry still is not entitled to relief because he cannot demonstrate prejudice. First, O\u2019Berry argues that his counsel was ineffective by failing to negotiate with the Government to allow him to plead guilty to the lesser crime of possession of child pornography. However, the Government stated at the \u00a7 2255 motion hearing that it would not have offered a plea agreement allowing a guilty plea to the lesser-included crime of possession due to O\u2019Berry\u2019s previous child-pornography conviction and the fact that he recidivated approximately two months after his placement on supervised release. <em>See Ramirez v. United States, </em>751 F.3d 604, 608 (8th Cir.2014) (finding no prejudice where defendant had \u201cnot shown that a reasonable probability existed that the government would have extended a plea offer\u201d). Second, even if O\u2019Berry had been advised of the lower mandatory-minimum penalty associated with the lesser-included crime of possession of child pornography, O\u2019Berry cannot demonstrate a reasonable probability that he would have proceeded to trial given that this determination depends \u201cin large part on a prediction whether the evidence likely would have changed the outcome of a trial.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 59, 106 S.Ct. 366. Evidence that a defendant \u201cknowingly downloaded\u201d child pornography supports a conviction for receipt of such materials under \u00a7 2252(a)(2). <em>United States v. Worthey, </em>716 F.3d 1107, 1113 (8th Cir.2013); <em>see also United States v. Hill, </em>750 F.3d 982, 988 (8th Cir.2014) (holding that evidence of defendant searching for and downloading child pornography is sufficient to support a conviction for knowing receipt of such materials under \u00a7 2252(a)(2)). Here, O\u2019Berry admitted to using a cellular phone and his girlfriend\u2019s laptop computer to search for and view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>child pornography, knowing that the depicted individuals were minors. Forensic analysis revealed two videos on the phone depicting the sexual exploitation of minors. O\u2019Berry admitted downloading these files in order to view them on the phone. Moreover, 1,300 still images were discovered on his girlfriend\u2019s computer \u2014 files that had been downloaded and later deleted. Given this evidence, O\u2019Berry cannot show a reasonable <em>probability </em>\u2014 ie., a substantial, not just conceivable, likelihood \u2014 that he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">\u00a9\u2019Berry\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance therefore fail for lack of prejudice, and the district court did not err in denying his \u00a7 2255 motion. We affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\">. The Honorable Daniel L. Hovland, United States District Judge for the District of North Dakota.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\">. O'Berry's second argument is beyond the scope of the certificate of appealability issued by the district court. However, we exercise our discretionary authority to expand the certificate of appealability <em>sua sponte, </em>arid we will consider the argument on the merits. <em>See United States v. Morgan, </em>244 F.3d 674, 674-75 (8th Cir.2001) (enbanc).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
