Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, <em>Blandino-Medina v. </em>Holder, 712 F.3d 1338, 1348 (9th Cir.2013), and review de novo questions of law, <em>Pechenkov v. Holder, </em>705 F.3d 444, 449 (9th Cir.2012). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-20\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of Saley\u2019s application for CAT protection on the ground that Saley failed to demonstrate that he would more likely than not suffer torture upon his removal to Russia. <em>See Blandino-Medina, </em>712 F.3d at 1348 (affirming the denial of CAT protection for a petitioner who \u201chad not presented evidence that similarly-situated individuals [we]re being tortured by [government] officials\u201d). In reaching this conclusion, the IJ provided an adequately reasoned decision, despite simultaneously having found that Saley has an objective fear of harm, because the standard of proof applicable to CAT claims requires more than a mere objective fear of harm. <em>See Tamang v. Holder, </em>598 F.3d 1083, 1095 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-21\">To the extent Saley contends that the agency erred by according greater eviden-tiary weight to the U.S. Department of State report than to his expert witness\u2019s testimony, our case law forecloses this contention. <em>See Sowe v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 1281, 1285 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201cU.S. Department of State country reports are \u2018the most appropriate and perhaps the best resource for information on political situations in foreign nations.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-22\">Because Saley does not contest the agency\u2019s determination that his 2009 conviction for delivery of methamphetamine under Revised Code of Washington \u00a7 69.50.401 is an aggravated-felony conviction that renders him removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), we lack jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>tion to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that his offense is a particularly serious crime that statutorily disqualifies him from eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Pechenkov, </em>705 F.3d at 448 (holding that the court lacks \u201cjurisdiction to review a \u2018particularly serious crime\u2019 determination where ... the only challenge to this determination is that [the agency] incorrectly assessed the facts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">In light of the agency\u2019s dispositive but unreviewable particular-serious-crime determination, we need not consider Saley\u2019s remaining challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of withholding. <em>See Simeonov v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 532, 538 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cAs a general rule courts ... are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b842-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
