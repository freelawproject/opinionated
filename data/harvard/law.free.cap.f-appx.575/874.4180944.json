He argues that the district court failed to explain the reasons for its chosen sentence and that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-24\">The district court provided a reasoned basis for its decision. The district court stated that it had \u201cconsidered the chapter seven provisions\u201d of the Sentencing Guidelines, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7A intro, emt., and determined that a sentence of imprisonment was necessary because his conduct made \u201cit very difficult for [him] to be supervised by the probation office.\u201d As explained by the district court, Burks\u2019s supervised release had been \u201crevoked before because [he] tested positive for cocaine and marijuana,\u201d failed to complete his sentence of \u201csix months at the halfway house,\u201d and \u201cused [a controlled substance] right after\u201d being expelled from the halfway house. Burks argues that it is unclear why the district court varied upward from his advisory guideline range of four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>to ten months of imprisonment, but the district court explained that it selected a sentence to address Burks\u2019s \u201csecond revocation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Burks\u2019s sentence is reasonable. As explained by the district court, Burks is not \u201camenable to supervision.\u201d Within the first four months of his release from prison, Burks twice tested positive for cocaine,' and the district court and the probation office modified the conditions of supervised release for Burks to receive mental health treatment and to enroll in a residential treatment drug program. After Burks admitted a third time to using cocaine, the district court revoked Burks\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to a custodial sentence of six months followed by 54 months of supervised release, the first 180 days of which he was to stay in a halfway house, but Burks was expelled from the halfway house. The district court was entitled to revoke Burks\u2019s second term of supervised release after he admitted to using synthetic marijuana, which was a grade B violation of his supervised release, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2) &amp; cmt. n. 3; Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 13A-5-6(a)(3), 13A-12-212(b). The district court reasonably determined that a term of imprisonment of 30 months was necessary to address the nature and circumstances of Burks\u2019s violation and his history and characteristics. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Burks argues that his sentence is excessive in the light of his lack of a criminal history, his minor violations of his supervised release, and his inability to obtain drug treatment, but lesser sentences have been ineffective. The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">We AFFIRM Burks\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
