Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether Williams\u2019 sentence is reasonable.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Although advised of his right to file a supplemental pro se brief, Williams has not done so. The Government seeks to dismiss the appeal based on the appellate waiver provision in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-20\">We review de novo the validity of an appeal waiver. <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>707 F.3d 522, 528 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 126, 187 L.Ed.2d 89 (2013). We \u201cgenerally will enforce a waiver ... if the record establishes that the waiver is valid and that the issue being appealed is within the scope of the waiver.\u201d <em>United States v. Thornsbury, </em>670 F.3d 532, 537 (4th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). A defendant\u2019s waiver is valid if he agreed to it \u201cknowingly and intelligently.\u201d <em>United States v. Manigan, </em>592 F.3d 621, 627 (4th Cir.2010). \u201cAlthough the validity of an appeal waiver often depends on the adequacy of the plea colloquy, the issue ultimately is evaluated by reference to the totality of the circumstances,\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>689 F.3d 349, 355 (4th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted), such as \u201cthe experience and conduct of the accused, as well as the accused\u2019s educational background and familiarity with the terms of the plea agreement.\u201d <em>Thornsbury, </em>670 F.3d at 537 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-22\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Williams knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal his sentence. Because the issues he seeks to raise on appeal fall within the scope of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>waiver, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss Williams\u2019 appeal of his sentence and dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Although the waiver provision in the plea agreement precludes our review of the sentence, the waiver does not preclude our review of any errors in Williams\u2019 conviction that may be revealed pursuant to the review required by <em>Anders. </em>In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues that are outside the scope of the appeal waiver. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment as to all issues not encompassed by Williams\u2019 valid waiver of his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">This court requires that counsel inform Williams, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Williams requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a' copy thereof was served on Williams. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b158-18\"> Specifically, counsel questions whether the district court imposed \"an unreasonable sentence by treating the Guidelines provisions for sexual exploitation as reasonable, by not giving sufficient weight to tire [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) [2012] factors, and by not downwardly departing given Williams\u2019s history of traumatic sexual abuse as a four-year-old boy.\u201d <em>(Anders </em>Brief at 1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
