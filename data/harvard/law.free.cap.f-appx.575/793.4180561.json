We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">Defendant\u2019s convictions under \u00a7 2251(a) and \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B) did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because each statute of conviction requires proof of an element that the other does not. <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). Under \u00a7 2251(a), the government must prove that the defendant is a person who \u201cemploys, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces\u201d a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for purposes of producing a visual depiction of that conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a); <em>cf. </em>Ninth Circuit Model Criminal Jury Instruction 8.181. There is no corresponding element in \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B). Under \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B), the government must prove that the defendant knew that a minor was involved in the visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B); <em>cf </em>Ninth Circuit Model Criminal Jury Instruction 8.185. There is no corresponding element in \u00a7 2251(a). Because \u201c[t]he <em>Blockburger </em>test focuses on the statutory elements of each offense\u201d rather than on evidence presented at trial, it is irrelevant that the evidence used to convict Sullivan on both counts overlapped. <em>United States v. Kimbrew, </em>406 F.3d 1149, 1151-52 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-15\">We also conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding polygraph evidence pursuant to Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, even though the court did not cite that rule in its decision. <em>United States v. Ramirez-Robles, </em>386 F.3d 1234, 1245 (9th Cir.2004). The district court could reasonably conclude that such evidence would not be helpful to the court, but would cause undue delay and would waste time. Fed.R.Evid. 403. Accordingly, we need not address whether the district court abused its discretion by not appointing a polygraph expert. Defendant\u2019s motion to augment the record on appeal is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b822-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-18\">. We resolve two of Sullivan\u2019s claims in this memorandum, and resolve his remaining claims as well as the government\u2019s cross-appeal in a concurrently issued opinion. <em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>753 F.3d 845 (9th Cir.2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
