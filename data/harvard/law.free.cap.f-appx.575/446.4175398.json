The district court ruled in part in favor of GMAC and in part in favor of O\u2019Carolan after partial summary judgment proceedings and a jury trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">O\u2019Carolan and Gary Hopper married in 1974 and purchased two lots and a home (\u201cthe Property\u201d) in Dripping Springs, Texas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> O\u2019Carolan and Hopper divorced in May 2000. In August 2000, a Texas state court entered a final decree of divorce and divided the marital property, awarding the Property to Hopper. O\u2019Carolan appealed and in 2002, a Texas court of appeals reversed and remanded the portion of the divorce decree dividing the marital property. In 2010, a different judge in Texas state district court again awarded the Property to Hopper, found it to be Hopper\u2019s homestead, and further stated that O\u2019Carolan was divested of all rights, title, interest and claims to the Property. A few months later, O\u2019Carolan again appealed to the Texas appellate court. That court affirmed the trial court\u2019s award of the Property to Hopper in September 2018. <em>See O\u2019Carolan v. Hopper, </em>414 S.W.3d 288, 314 (TexApp.-Austin 2013, no pet.).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-15\">With respect to encumbrances, in 1995 O\u2019Carolan and Hopper first refinanced the Property through Resource Bancshares Mortgage Group, Inc. (\u201cRBMG\u201d) securing a mortgage debt in the approximate amount- of $87,000. In 1998, that mortgage was assigned to Bank of America. Then in April 2004, nearly four years after O\u2019Carolan and Hopper divorced, Hopper signed a Texas Home Equity Note with Ameriquest in the amount of $113,969, which was secured by the Property, hereinafter referred to as the \u201cAmeriquest loan.\u201d Hopper used part of the proceeds from the Ameriquest loan to pay off the remaining balance on the mortgage note with RBMG \u2014 $76,105.39\u2014which had been assigned to Bank of America. Thereinaf-ter, Bank of America released its lien on the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-16\">Then in 2008, Hopper and his new wife obtained a home equity loan from GMAC in the amount of $160,000, which was secured by the Property. Hopper used part of the proceeds from the GMAC loan to pay off the remaining balance on the loan with Ameriquest \u2014 $85,790.77\u2014who then released its lien on the Property. O\u2019Caro-lan was not informed that GMAC had issued the home equity loan to Hopper using the Property as collateral, nor did O\u2019Caro-lan consent to the loan. By the time the proceedings reached the United States District Court, Hopper had paid approximately $46,841 in principal and $22,751 in interest on the GMAC loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">In 2009, O\u2019Carolan filed suit against GMAC claiming that the Texas Constitution mandated forfeiture of the principal and interest that Hopper had paid on the GMAC loan as a penalty for violating the home equity lending rules. The district court granted partial summary judgment denying O\u2019Carolan\u2019s claims for monetary damages and/or forfeiture because the claims were not provided for in the Texas Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Adopting the report of the magistrate judge, the district court reasoned that because O\u2019Carolan was not a party to the GMAC loan and never made any payments, she did not have standing to make a forfeiture claim \u2014 only Hopper would have had standing to make such a claim. Additionally, O\u2019Carolan\u2019s purported homestead interest in the Property did not entitle her to a remedy of forfeiture on a loan to which she was not a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">O\u2019Carolan and GMAC then filed joint stipulations of fact and proceeded to a jury trial on the remaining questions of fact.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury rendered its verdict finding that O\u2019Carolan did have a homestead interest in the Property which she had not abandoned. The district court adopted the jury\u2019s verdict and thereafter entered judgment in accordance therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The district court then ordered the parties to file post-verdict motions on the remaining issues of law which primarily involved the validity of the various past and present liens on the Property. In those proceedings, GMAC claimed that it was entitled to an equitable first lien against the Property in the amount of $85,790, <em>ie., </em>the balance of the Ameriquest loan satisfied with the proceeds of the GMAC loan plus interest. O\u2019Carolan countered that she was not liable on the GMAC loan because she was not a debtor on the Ameriquest loan at the time the GMAC loan was secured which thereby rendered the Ameriquest loan invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">The district court found that the Bank of America lien was the only valid lien on the Property, a fact which neither party disputed, but that both the Ameriquest and GMAC liens on the Property were invalid. However, applying principles of equitable subrogation the district court then held that, although the original home equity loan obtained by Hopper through GMAC was invalid, GMAC was nevertheless entitled to an equitable lien against the Property in the amount of $76,105. <em>See La-Salle Bank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n v. White, </em>246 S.W.3d 616, 618-19 (Tex.2007) (citation omitted). This amount represented the balance of the valid lien held by Bank of America prior to its invalid refinancing by Ameriquest and GMAC, plus 6% interest per annum accruing from May 1, 2008. O\u2019Carolan appeals herein the portions of the district court\u2019s judgment not in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">On appeal O\u2019Carolan argues that: (1) she is entitled to enforce the forfeiture provision of the Texas Constitution against GMAC because it arises out of her homestead interest in the Property and because forfeiture is a penalty, not damages, under Texas law; and, (2) the district court failed to credit the payments made on the Ameri-quest and GMAC home equity loans to reduce the amount of the lien to which it determined GMAC to be equitably subro-gated.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>same standards as the district court.\u201d <em>Antoine v.
