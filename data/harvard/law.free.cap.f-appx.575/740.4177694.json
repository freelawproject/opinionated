We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely, <em>see Chaffer v. Prosper, </em>592 F.3d 1046, 1048 (9th Cir.2010), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-24\">Soto contends that he is entitled to equitable tolling because he lacked access to the law library and his legal materials while he was in administrative segregation and during a prison transfer. Soto has not demonstrated that these ordinary prison limitations amounted to an extraordinary circumstance beyond his control preventing him from timely filing his federal habeas petition. <em>See Ramirez v. Yates, </em>571 F.3d 993, 998 (9th Cir.2009) (petitioner not entitled to equitable tolling \u201csimply because he remained in administrative segregation and had limited access to\u201d law library and copy machine). Significantly, Soto filed a second state habeas petition with the California Supreme Court before the federal statute of limitations expired. <em>See id. </em>(observing that petitioner was able to file \u201cother substantial legal filings\u201d during time in which he was allegedly denied law library access). Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Soto an evidentia-ry hearing. <em>See Roberts v. Marshall, </em>627 F.3d 768, 773 (9th Cir.2010) (district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>properly denied petitioner\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing on equitable tolling in part because the petitioner filed several state habeas petitions containing the same arguments presented in his federal habeas petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Although we granted Soto\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether the statute of limitations period was tolled during the pendency of Soto\u2019s May 29, 2009, state habeas petition filed in the California Supreme Court, he neglected to address this issue in his opening or reply briefs. Consequently, Soto has waived any argument that he is entitled to statutory tolling. <em>Womack v. Del Papa, </em>497 F.3d 998, 1004 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b768-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
