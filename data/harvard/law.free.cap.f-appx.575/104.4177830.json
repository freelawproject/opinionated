On appeal, Rivas argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for an evidentiary hearing pursuant to <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), and that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">Rivas argues that he was entitled to a <em>Franks </em>hearing because three paragraphs of the search warrant affidavit contained false or misleading information and that, if those paragraphs had been omitted, the affidavit would have been insufficient to find probable cause. A defendant challenging the validity of a search warrant is entitled to a <em>Franks </em>hearing if he makes a preliminary showing that: \u201c(1) the warrant affidavit contain[s] a \u2018deliberate falsehood\u2019 or statement made with \u2018reckless disregard for the truth\u2019 and (2) without the allegedly false statement, the warrant affidavit is not sufficient to support a finding of probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>711 F.3d 460, 468 (4th Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674); <em>see United States v. Colkley, </em>899 F.2d 297, 300 (4th Cir.1990) (defining substantial preliminary showing). A defendant bears a heavy burden to establish the need for a <em>Franks </em>hearing. <em>United States v. Jeffus, </em>22 F.3d 554, 558 (4th Cir.1994). We review de novo the legal determinations underlying a district court\u2019s denial of a <em>Franks </em>hearing and review its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>631 F.3d 164, 171 (4th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-16\">Here, Rivas falls short of making the substantial preliminary showing that the challenged statements were false or that the affiant included the statements -with the intent to mislead the magistrate judge. <em>See Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674; <em>Fisher, </em>711 F.3d at 468. Furthermore, even assuming that Rivas made the necessary showing, we agree with the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>trict court that the alleged false or misleading statements were not essential to the probable cause determination. <em>See Fisher, </em>711 F.3d at 468. Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying Rivas\u2019 request for a <em>Franks </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Next, Rivas contends that his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We review a sentence for reasonableness, applying \u201ca deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In so doing, we first examine the sentence for \u201csignificant procedural error\u201d ensuring, among other things, that the district court did not \u201cimproperly calculate] the Guidelines range, ... fail[ ] to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) [ (2012) ] factors, ... or fail[ ] to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Next, when considering the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, we \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.; see United States v. Yooho Weon, </em>722 F.3d 583, 590 (4th Cir.2013) (discussing appellate presumption of reasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Rivas first challenges the district court\u2019s decision to apply a two-level enhancement because the offense involved sexual contact. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A) &amp; cmt. n. 2 (2012); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(3) (2012) (defining sexual contact). We assume, without deciding, that the district court erred in applying this enhancement but conclude that any such procedural error is harmless. A procedural sentencing error is harmless where this court has \u201c(1) knowledge that the district court would have reached the same result even if it had decided the [Guidelines issue the other way, and (2) a determination that the sentence would be reasonable even if the [Guidelines issue had been decided in the defendant\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Savillon-Matute, </em>636 F.3d 119, 123 (4th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see United States v. McManus, </em>734 F.3d 315, 318 (4th Cir.2013) (stating that procedural \u201c[s]entencing error is harmless if the resulting sentence is not longer than that to which the defendant would otherwise be subject\u201d) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Here, Rivas was sentenced to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory mandatory minimum sentence set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(e) (2012). Thus, even if the district court had sustained Rivas\u2019 objection to the two-level enhancement, we can conclude with confidence that the district court would have imposed the same mandatory minimum 180-month sentence. Moreover, Rivas\u2019 substantial downward variance sentence is reasonable because it took into account Rivas\u2019 mitigating arguments. Accordingly, we conclude that any error on the part of the district court in applying the \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A) enhancement is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">Next, Rivas contends that the district court erred by imposing a two-level enhancement pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(3) and a five-level enhancement pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B) based on Rivas\u2019 distribution of child pornography because there was no evidence presented that he ever distributed child pornography.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Distribution is defined as \u201cany act, including possession with intent to distribute, production, transmission, advertisement, and transportation, related to the transfer of material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2G2.1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>cmt. n. 1; USSG \u00a7 2G2.2 emt. n. 1. Because Rivas admitted at the plea hearing that he had possessed, transported, and produced child pornography, the district court did not err in imposing the distribution enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Further, Rivas argues that his sentence is proeedurally unreasonable because the court failed to properly consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Rivas\u2019 contention is belied by the record. The district court clearly stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when imposing Rivas\u2019 sentence and specifically mentioned the seriousness of the offense, the need to promote respect for the law, the need to provide just punishment, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. We therefore conclude that the district court did not commit procedural error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Finally, Rivas contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court did not give sufficient weight to his arguments for a lower sentence. However, after considering Rivas\u2019 arguments about his childhood, his lack of criminal history, and the seriousness of the offense, the district court determined that a well-below-Guidelines sentence of 180 months was appropriate. Therefore, we conclude that Rivas\u2019 sentence is substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b134-6\"> Rivas does not challenge any other aspect of the enhancement in USSG \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B). See <em>McManus, </em>734 F.3d at 319 (discussing proof required to trigger enhancement).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
