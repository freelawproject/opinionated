On appeal, he challenges the application of an aggravating-role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. After a thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-20\">McElhenny was charged by superseding information with conspiracy to manufacture and possess with intent to distribute five grams or more of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (Count 1), and maintaining a premises for manufacturing, distributing, and using methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1) (Count 2). He pleaded guilty to both counts and submitted a factual proffer in which he admitted that he lived in the premises with four others, that he used the house to manufacture methamphetamine, that he had advised another resident how to manufacture the drug, and that he purchased pseudoephedrine to manufacture drugs. He further admitted that he used the other residents to supply him with pseudoephedrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-21\">In the presentence investigation report (PSI), the probation officer determined the offense level to be 35, which included a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) for McElhenny\u2019s leadership role in the offense. Based on this offense level and McElhenny\u2019s extensive criminal history, McElhenny\u2019s guidelines range was 292 to 365 months\u2019 imprisonment. In his only objection to the PSI, McElhenny disputed that he was a leader or organizer under \u00a7 3B 1.1(a) because, if he was the leader or organizer, he could not be counted as a \u201cparticipant,\u201d and thus the offense did not involve the necessary five participants to support the enhancement. McEl-henny also requested that the court sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>tence him below the advisory guideline range because his criminal history category over-represented the seriousness of his criminal history. He explained that he had no prior violent offenses and no weapons charges, and that his prior crimes were for drug possession or thefts enabling him to feed his drug addiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">At sentencing, the district court overruled McElhenny\u2019s objection because precedent clearly held that the defendant could be counted as a participant under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). The court considered McEl-henny\u2019s request for a variance and sentenced him to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment, noting McElhenny\u2019s history of drug addiction, his prior convictions for drug possession and theft, and the need for a lengthy prison term to deter McElhenny\u2019s conduct. McElhenny now appeals, arguing that the evidence did not support the leadership enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Generally, we review the district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense for clear error, and review <em>de novo </em>whether a provision of the Sentencing Guidelines applies to a particular set of facts. <em>United States v. Yates, </em>990 F.2d 1179, 1182 (11th Cir.1993). But arguments, such as McElhenny\u2019s, that were not raised before the district court are reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. McNair, </em>605 F.3d 1152, 1222 (11th Cir.2010). Plain error occurs when there is (1) an \u201cerror\u201d; (2) \u201cthat is plain\u201d; (3) \u201cthat affects substantial rights\u201d; and (4) that \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), a four-level enhancement applies if (1) the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity; and (2) the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). Factors to consider in determining whether the defendant was an organizer or manager include: (1) \u201cthe exercise of decision making authority,\u201d (2) \u201cthe nature of participation in the commission of the offense,\u201d (3) \u201cthe recruitment of accomplices,\u201d (4) \u201cthe claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime,\u201d (5) \u201cthe degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense,\u201d (6) \u201cthe nature and scope of the illegal activity,\u201d and (7) \u201cthe degree of control and authority exercised over others.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n. 4). \u201cThere is no requirement that all of the considerations have to be presented in any one case.\u201d <em>United States v. Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d 1214, 1231 (11th Cir.2010) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">Evidence that the defendant recruited and instructed participants in the conspiracy is sufficient to support a leadership enhancement. <em>United States v. Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d 1270, 1304 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cSection 3B1.1 requires the exercise of some authority in the organization, the exertion of some degree of control, influence, or leadership.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). And the enhancement can apply where the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of only one other participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n. 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">We conclude that the district court did not plainly err in applying the enhancement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his factual proffer for his guilty plea and the undisputed portions of the PSI, McElhenny admitted that he advised others in the house on how to manufacture methamphetamine, he directed others when and where to purchase pseudoephed-rine for him, and he supplied others in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>house with methamphetamine. This is sufficient \u201ccontrol, influence, and leadership\u201d under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). <em>See Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d at 1304 (upholding enhancement for defendant who recruited and instructed co-conspirators). Thus, we conclude that the district court properly applied a four-level enhancement for McElhenny\u2019s role in the criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-8\">. McElhenny has abandoned his argument that he could not be counted as one of the five participants. <em>Holland v. Gee, </em>677 F.3d 1047, 1066 (11th Cir.2012) (explaining that issues not raised in the initial brief are abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
