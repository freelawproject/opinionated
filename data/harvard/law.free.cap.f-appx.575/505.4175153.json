Finding no error, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-24\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b533-25\">Deputy Denny Perkins, among other deputies and officers from the Denham Springs Police Department, executed a search warrant on an apartment we refer to as the \u201cBlocker Residence.\u201d The officers sought the search warrant after receiving an anonymous tip that residents Dustin and Kelli Blocker were illegally selling prescription drugs. Before executing the warrant, however, the officers saw Plaintiff Stephen Cook enter the residence. When they executed the warrant, Cook tried to leave, but the officers detained him. The officers instructed Cook on his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and Cook said that he understood. The officers searched the residence and found evidence of drug use and distribution. The officers next patted Cook down, finding a cell phone containing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>text messages that related to drug transactions. Cook admitted that he had marijuana at his home and provided signed consent to search his residence. The officers searched Cook\u2019s residence and found marijuana and drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Subsequently, Cook sued Deputy Perkins and Sheriff Graves in Louisiana court, alleging violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and Louisiana law. Cook alleged that he was struck on the back of the head by an unknown deputy when the officers started the search and that during the search Deputy Perkins punched him. Defendants removed the case to federal court and filed motions for summary judgment. The Magistrate Judge granted summary judgment as to Cook\u2019s claims against Sheriffs Graves and Ard on all claims except for Cook\u2019s state law vicarious liability claim against Sheriff Ard. The Magistrate Judge also granted summary judgment as to all of Cook\u2019s claims except for Cook\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim for excessive use of force and his state law claim for battery. At trial Cook called one witness and then rested his case. The Magistrate Judge granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Construing Cook\u2019s brief liberally, he asserts that the Magistrate Judge made three errors. First, he argues that he was not allowed to argue that the search warrant was invalid at trial. Second, he argues that Appellees\u2019 attorney interfered with Cook\u2019s examination of Deputy Perkins by objecting. Third, he argues that his case was \u201cexcessively\u201d streamlined.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review Cook\u2019s appeal from summary judgment and judgment as a matter of law <em>de novo. Kariuki v. Tarango, </em>709 F.3d 495, 501 (5th Cir.2013); <em>Evans v. Ford Motor Co., </em>484 F.3d 329, 334 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">None of Cook\u2019s arguments calls into question the Magistrate Judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment or grant of judgment as a matter of law. To start, at trial Cook presented only Perkins\u2019s testimony on his excessive force claim before resting his case. Cook points to no record evidence demonstrating that Perkins\u2019s testimony satisfied the elements of Cook\u2019s claim. <em>See, e.g., Manis v. Lawson, </em>585 F.3d 839, 843 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cTo prevail on an excessive force claim, a plaintiff must show \u2018(1) an injury, (2) which resulted directly and only from the use of force that was clearly excessive, and (3) the excessiveness of which was clearly unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d). Nor does Cook highlight any record evidence supporting his argument that Appellees\u2019 counsel was unduly disruptive of Deputy Perkins\u2019s testimony. Moreover, Cook moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude all evidence relating to the search warrant at trial, and the district court granted the motion because any evidence relating to the search warrant was \u201cnot relevant to any of the issues that will be tried.\u201d Accordingly, the record reveals no error by the Magistrate Judge in granting judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">Further, Cook does not point to record evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact as to render the Magistrate Judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment erroneous. \u201c[Ojur responsibility to construe <em>pro se </em>filings liberally does not mean that we will invent, out of whole cloth, novel arguments on behalf of a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff in the absence of meaningful, albeit imper-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>feet, briefing.\u201d <em>Jones v. Alfred, </em>353 Fed.Appx. 949, 950 (5th Cir.2009) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the Magistrate Judge did not err in granting summary judgment. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">For the above stated reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b533-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
