We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual determinations, <em>Wakkary v. Holder, 558 </em>F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009), and review de novo claims of due process violations, <em>Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Linton\u2019s contention that the agency violated his due process rights by failing to fully consider and weigh the evidence in his case is unsupported by the record. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error for petitioner to prevail on a due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">The BIA found that Linton failed to establish that the police were unable or unwilling to protect him. The record does not compel a different conclusion, therefore his withholding of removal claim fails. <em>Nahrvani v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir.2005) (although police were unable to solve crimes against petitioner evidence did not compel finding that crimes were committed by forces the government was unable or unwilling to control because police took reports and investigated petitioner\u2019s complaints).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Linton failed to establish it is more likely than not he will be tortured if removed to Jamaica. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1067-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">Linton\u2019s contentions that the agency erred in determining certain convictions are crimes involving moral turpitude and aggravated felonies are not properly before us, because the agency did not make such determinations or deny Linton\u2019s applications for relief on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b839-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
