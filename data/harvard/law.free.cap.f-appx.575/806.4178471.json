We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings and de novo questions of law. <em>Cordoba v. Holder, </em>726 F.3d 1106, 1113 (9th Cir.2013). We deny in part and grant in part the petition for review, and we remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of Pivaral-Gonzalez\u2019s CAT claim because he has not shown it is more likely than not he will be tortured by the government of Guatemala or with its consent or acquiescence. <em>See Silaya v. Mu-kasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">In denying Pivaral-Gonzalez\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims, the agency determined that a group of \u201csmall landowners\u201d is not cognizable as a particular social group. In light of our recent decision in <em>Cordoba, </em>726 F.3d 1106, 1114 (recognizing landownership may form the basis of a particular social group), we remand Pivaral-Gonzalez\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">Each party shall bear its own costs for this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b835-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
