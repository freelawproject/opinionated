Davis contends that the district court abused its discretion by admitting Davis\u2019s prior drug convictions into evidence during his jury trial. Specifically, Davis claims the government used the prior convictions as propensity evidence to bolster its witnesses and improperly suggest that he was guilty because he had been guilty in the past. Even if the evidence was not used as improper propensity evidence, he argues that the prior convictions, which occurred more than 15 years before the conspiracy charged here, were too remote and lacked probative value because his intent was not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-18\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to admit.or exclude evidence under Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and 404(b) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>431 F.3d 1296, 1311 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). When employing an abuse of discretion standard, we must affirm unless we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment or has applied the wrong legal standard. <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). An error in admitting evidence is harmless unless it caused \u201cactual prejudice because it had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Phaknikone, </em>605 F.3d 1099, 1109 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-19\">\u201cEvidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person\u2019s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)(1). However, \u201c[t]his evidence may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\u201d Fed. R.Evid. 404(b)(2). To be admissible, Rule 404(b) evidence must be (1) relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character; (2) established by sufficient proof to permit a jury to find that the defendant committed the extrinsic act; and (3) of probative value that is not substantially outweighed by undue prejudice so as not to violate Rule 403. <em>Matthews, </em>431 F.3d at 1310-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-20\">Even if the district court abused its discretion by admitting Davis\u2019s prior con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>victions, the error was harmless.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because of the overwhelming evidence of his guilt, the admission of the prior convictions in this case did not have a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>See Phaknikone, </em>605 F.3d at 1109; <em>see also United States v. Hubert, </em>138 F.3d 912, 914 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam). Twelve co-conspirator witnesses testified about Davis\u2019s buying and selling cocaine and crack cocaine. These witnesses testified that Davis publically bragged about his drug dealing, and lived a flashy, expensive lifestyle that was inconsistent with his $8,500 of reported earnings during the conspiracy\u2019s time period. The government also presented evidence about Davis\u2019s attempts to threaten or retaliate against some of the witnesses. Lastly, Davis took the stand in his own defense, testimony the jury was permitted to decide was false and which it could rely on as substantive evidence proving guilt. <em>See United States v. Vazquez, </em>53 F.3d 1216, 1225 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Beyond that, the government did not focus on the convictions in opening or closing, and in particular did not rely on it as propensity evidence. Other than to explain how Da-vis met one of the witnesses or lay out the sequence of events, the government\u2019s most specific reference to the prior convictions was to suggest that the cooperating witnesses\u2019 testimony was no less credible than Davis\u2019s because \u201c[tjhey\u2019ve all been to prison for drug dealing.\u201d The risk of undue prejudice was also tempered by the court\u2019s limiting instructions, including that the jury \u201cmust not consider any [evidence of prior similar acts] to decide whether the defendant committed the facts charged now.\u201d <em>See United States v. Edouard, </em>485 F.3d 1324, 1346 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201c[A]ny unfair prejudice possibly caused by admitting evidence of Edouard\u2019s prior smuggling activities was mitigated by the district court\u2019s limiting instruction to the jury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Because we conclude that any error in the district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling was harmless, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b892-5\">. We need not reach the issue of whether the district court abused its discretion because of our harmless error conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
