We dismiss the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">Because an order terminating removal proceedings is not a final order of removal, we lack jurisdiction to consider Chavez-Palafox\u2019s petitions for review of that order. <em>See Alcala v. Holder, </em>563 F.3d 1009, 1013-16 (9th Cir.2009); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(9) (\u201cJudicial review of all questions of law and fact ... shall be available only in judicial review of a final order [of removal].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">To the extent Chavez-Palafox contends that we have jurisdiction to review his 1999 expedited removal order, this contention fails. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(e)(2); <em>see also Garcia de Rincon v. Dep\u2019t. of Homeland Sec., </em>539 F.3d 1133, 1138-39 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201cSection 1252(e) only permits review of expedited removal orders in a habeas corpus petition, and even then the review is limited to an inquiry over whether: (A) the petitioner is an alien, (B) whether the petitioner was ordered removed under such section, and (C) whether the petitioner can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the petitioner is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, [or is a refugee or has been granted non-terminated asylum].\u201d) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-14\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b833-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
