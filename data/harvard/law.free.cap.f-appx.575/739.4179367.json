Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Sandoval-Sanchez\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating that there are no grounds for relief, along with a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. We have provided Sandoval-Sanchez the opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief. No pro se supplemental brief or answering brief has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-23\">Sandoval-Sanchez waived his right to appeal his conviction, with the exception of an appeal based on a claim that his plea was involuntary. He also waived the right to appeal five specified issues related to his sentence. Our independent review of the record, pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), discloses no arguable grounds for relief as to the voluntariness of Sandoval-Sanchez\u2019s plea or any sentencing issue outside the scope of the sentencing appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>waiver. We therefore affirm as to those issues. We dismiss the remainder of the appeal in light of the valid appeal waivers. <em>See United States v.
