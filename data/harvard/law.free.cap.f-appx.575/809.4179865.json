We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Avagyan v. Holder, </em>646 F.3d 672, 674 (9th Cir.2011). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">As the government concedes, Arciga-Lorenzano\u2019s departure from the United States did not deprive the BIA of jurisdiction to consider his motion to reopen. <em>See Reyes-Torres v. Holder, </em>645 F.3d 1073, 1077 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">The BIA did not-abuse its discretion by denying as untimely petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel because petitioners filed their motion eight years after their order of deportation became administratively final, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and failed to demonstrate the due diligence necessary to warrant equitable tolling of the filing deadline, <em>see Avagyan, </em>646 F.3d at 680-81 (finding no due diligence by a petitioner who \u201chad reason to suspect\u201d that her former attorneys had not adequately prepared her case but who nevertheless \u201ctook no affirmative steps to investigate\u201d their errors after the BIA had denied her appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b838-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
