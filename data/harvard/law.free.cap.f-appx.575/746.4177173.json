We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir.2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-22\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding based on the omission from Elias\u2019s asylum application and affidavit of two incidents in which gang members beat and physically injured him. <em>See Zamanov v. Holder, </em>649 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir.2011) (\u201cMaterial alterations in the applicant\u2019s account of persecution are sufficient to support an adverse credibility finding.\u201d). The agency reasonably rejected Elias\u2019s explanations for the omissions. <em>See Rizk v. Holder, </em>629 F.3d 1083, 1091 (9th Cir.2011). Further, the record does not otherwise compel the conclusion that it is more likely than not Elias will be tortured if returned to El Salvador. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156-57 (9th Cir.2003). Finally, we reject Elias\u2019s contentions that the agency failed to consider Elias\u2019s risk of torture in the aggregate and that the agency misapplied <em>Cole v. Holder, </em>659 F.3d 762 (9th Cir.2011). Accordingly, Elias\u2019s CAT claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b774-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
