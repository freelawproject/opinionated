Gaines was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Gaines contends that the government committed prosecutorial misconduct by making a grammar-school arithmetical error in its closing argument. We agree with the district court that the misstatement did not prejudice Gaines\u2019 trial, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">We review for plain error claims of prosecutorial misconduct when the defendant failed to object at trial. <em>United States v. Washington, </em>462 F.3d 1124, 1136 (9th Cir.2006). We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 1135. Under the plain error standard, Gaines is entitled to relief only if the government\u2019s statement was improper and \u201csubstantially prejudice^] [Gaines\u2019s] trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>659 F.3d 1252, 1256 (9th Cir.2011) (first alteration in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Even then, we may \u201ccorrect only particularly egregious errors ... that seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-16\">The prosecutor\u2019s mischaracterization of two 235-foot distances as two 40-yard distances (instead of, correctly, as two 80-yard distances) was improper because it was not \u201cbased on the evidence ... [or] reasonable inferences from the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Hermanek, </em>289 F.3d 1076, 1100 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>241 F.3d 638, 652 (9th Cir.2000)) (internal quotation marks omitted). But the misstatement did not substantially prejudice Gaines. We agree with the district court that the misstatement was \u201csimple arithmetic that the jury was capable of reconstructing and correcting on its own.\u201d Moreover, the district court\u2019s instructions to the jury reminded it, among other things, that \u201cstatements, objections, and arguments by the lawyers are not evidence.\u201d <em>Cf. United States v. Carrillo, </em>16 F.3d 1046, 1050-51 (9th Cir.1994); <em>Tenorio v. United States, </em>390 F.2d 96, 98 (9th Cir.1968). The improper statement was not \u201ccrucial to the government\u2019s case.\u201d <em>United States v. Kerr, </em>981 F.2d 1050, 1054 (9th Cir.1992); <em>see also Carrillo, </em>16 F.3d at 1051 (declining to find prejudice where \u201cthe jury heard independent and far more persuasive evidence of the same information\u201d). And the statement was \u201cbut one of many [points] made in closing.\u201d <em>United States v. Boulware, </em>470 F.3d 931, 937 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>Cir.2006), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>552 U.S. 421, 128 S.Ct. 1168, 170 L.Ed.2d 34 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">We thus conclude that the government\u2019s misstatement was not plain error. The district did not abuse its discretion in denying Gaines\u2019 motion for a new trial. <em>See United States v. Hinkson, </em>585 F.3d 1247, 1261-62 (9th Cir.2009) (en banc). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b820-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
