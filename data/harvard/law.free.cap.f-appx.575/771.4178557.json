See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b799-19\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-20\">Quashon Collins, a California state prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for the writ of habeas corpus. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-25\">1. The state court\u2019s finding that the trial court adequately considered Collins\u2019s second request for substitute counsel did not \u201cresult[ ] in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). A state court\u2019s factual determination is only unreasonable \u201cif it is so clearly incorrect that it would not be debatable among reasonable jurists.\u201d <em>Jef-fries v. Wood, </em>114 F.3d 1484, 1500 (9th Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), <em>overruled on other grounds by Gonzalez v. Arizona, </em>677 F.3d 383, 389 n. 4 (9th Cir.2012) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-26\">Collins does not dispute that the state court gave him a full hearing when he first asked for substitute counsel pursuant to <em>People v. Marsden, </em>2 Cal.3d 118, 84 Cal.Rptr. 156, 465 P.2d 44 (1970). At that hearing, the court allowed Collins to explain why he wanted new counsel. Collins explained that he wanted counsel to request the personnel records of the undercover officer, desired to take his ease to trial, and wanted his brother as a witness. The court then questioned Collins\u2019s counsel regarding these complaints before denying Collins\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-27\">At the hearing on Collins\u2019s second request to substitute counsel, which is at issue on this appeal, the court asked an open-ended question, \u2018What is your request and why?\u201d In response, Collins raised two issues \u2014 the denial of a motion for the undercover\u2019s personnel records and counsel\u2019s delay in contacting his brother\u2014 that had been raised during the first hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>ing. Further, when the court asked him whether anything had changed since the last hearing, Collins again complained of counsel\u2019s delay in speaking with his brother. Although the second hearing was truncated, given the court\u2019s familiarity with Collins\u2019s complaints, the state court did not deprive him of an adequate hearing, and its finding that \u201cnothing has changed\u201d since the first <em>Marsden </em>hearing was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">2. To the extent Collins contends that the state court\u2019s denial of his <em>Marsden </em>request \u201cresulted in a decision that was was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), we disagree for the same reasons stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b799-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
