(\u201cJP Morgan\u201d), NDEX Title Services, L.L.C. (\u201cNDEX\u201d), and Wendy Alexander (\u201cAlexander\u201d) challenging the foreclosure on his property. Emrich appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for JP Morgan and dismissal of his claims against NDEX and Alexander. For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">In 2006, Emrich purchased property located at 220 Brighton Lane, Austin, Texas. Emrich executed a Note and Deed of Trust in favor of JP Morgan in connection with the purchase of the property. In 2009, Emrich refinanced the mortgage, executing a new Note and Deed of Trust in favor of JP Morgan. Emrich eventually defaulted on the mortgage, and JP Morgan foreclosed on the property in 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">Following foreclosure, Emrich filed this suit against JP Morgan, NDEX, and Alexander under Tex. Civ. Prac. <em>&amp; </em>Rem.Code \u00a7 12.002(a). In his amended complaint, Emrich alleges that the foreclosure on his property is void on two grounds: (1) JP Morgan lacked authority to foreclose because JP Morgan was not the holder of the Note at the time of the foreclosure sale, and (2) Alexander signed the Notice of Trustee Sale on behalf of JP Morgan prior to her formal appointment as substitute trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-16\">JP Morgan filed a motion for summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. Emrich did not file a response to the summary judgment motion. NDEX then filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), which Emrich opposed. The district court granted JP Morgan\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the claims against NDEX and Alexander. Emrich timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-17\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b531-18\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo.\u201d <em>James v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>743 F.3d 65, 68 (5th Cir.2014). Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cWhen a defendant moves for summary judgment and identifies a lack of evidence to support the plaintiffs claim on an issue for which the plaintiff would bear the burden of proof at trial, then the defendant is entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff is able to produce \u2018summary judgment evidence sufficient to sustain a finding in plaintiffs favor on that issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>James, </em>743 F.3d at 68 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-19\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss de novo, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\u201caccepting all well-pleaded facts as true and viewing those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Stokes v. Gann, </em>498 F.3d 483, 484 (5th Cir.2007). To avoid dismissal, a plaintiff must plead \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">a. <em>Grant of Summary Judgment for JP Morgan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">On appeal, Emrich raises four challenges to the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. First, Emrich contends that summary judgment was improper because JP Morgan violated various provisions in the Deed of Trust relating to the Notice of Acceleration. Emrich waived these arguments by failing to allege them in his complaint or otherwise raise them in the district court. <em>See AG Acceptance Corp. v. Veigel, </em>564 F.3d 695, 700-01 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Vogel v. Veneman, </em>276 F.3d 729, 733 (5th Cir.2002). We decline to consider these substantive arguments for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Second, Emrich raises a challenge to JP Morgan\u2019s summary judgment evidence, arguing that JP Morgan\u2019s document entitled \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d \u201cdoes not qualify as an affidavit under Texas law, and would therefore be excludable at trial.\u201d Em-rich\u2019s argument is unavailing as the record reflects that the district court did not rely on this document in granting summary judgment. Moreover, Emrich waived this argument by failing to raise it in the district court. <em>See Vogel, </em>276 F.3d at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Third, Emrich contends that the district court abused its discretion in granting summary judgment without adequate time for discovery. \u201cRule 56 does not require that any discovery take place before summary judgment can be granted; if a party cannot adequately defend such a motion, Rule [56(d) ] is his remedy.\u201d <em>Washington v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>901 F.2d 1281, 1285 (5th Cir.1990). Pursuant to Rule 56(d), a party opposing summary judgment may request a continuance for further discovery. To obtain a Rule 56(d) continuance, the party must \u201cshow[] by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(d). Because Emrich did not request a continuance under Rule 56(d) in the district court, Emrich waived the issue of inadequate discovery. <em>See Access Telecom, Inc. v. MCI Telecomms. Corp., </em>197 F.3d 694, 719 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Potter v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>98 F.3d 881, 887 (5th Cir.1996) (\u201cIf [plaintiff] needed more discovery in order to defeat summary judgment, it was up to her to move for a continuance pursuant to [Rule 56(d) ]. Because she did not, she is foreclosed from arguing that she did not have adequate time for discovery.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">Finally, Emrich contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his claim regarding JP Morgan\u2019s authority to foreclose. In his amended complaint, Emrich alleges that JP Morgan lacked authority to foreclose because JP Morgan assigned the Note to Fannie Mae prior to foreclosure. In moving for summary judgment, JP Morgan provided evidence that it was the holder of the Note at the time of foreclosure, including a copy of the original Note and an affidavit by a representative of JP Morgan. Emrich failed to come forward with any evidence to rebut JP Morgan\u2019s evidence or otherwise support his claim. In particular, Emrich did not present evidence that JP Morgan assigned the Note to Fannie Mae. Nor did Emrich present evidence that JP Morgan was not the holder of the Note at the time of foreclosure. Accordingly, the district court did not err <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>in granting summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\n<em>b. Dismissal of Claims Against NDEX and Alexander</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">On appeal, Emrich does not address the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims against NDEX or Alexander. As a result, Emrich has abandoned any challenge to the dismissal of these claims. <em>See Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cA party who inadequately briefs an issue is considered to have abandoned the claim.\u201d); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b531-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
