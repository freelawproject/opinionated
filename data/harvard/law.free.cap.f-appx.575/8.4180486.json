Straus, denying him asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Osaro Agbontaen, </em>No. A073 179 165 (B.I.A. Nov. 21, 2011), <em>aff'g </em>No. A073 179 165 (Immig. Ct. Hartford July 15, 2010 &amp; March 30, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">As an initial matter, we lack jurisdiction to consider Agbontaen\u2019s argument that the agency erred in declining to \u201crepaper\u201d his proceedings, <em>ie., </em>terminate his deportation proceedings and initiate removal proceedings to allow him to apply for cancellation of removal, because he did not exhaust that claim before the BIA. <em>See Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006). Regardless, the claim is without merit as Agbontaen is ineligible for repapering under the agency\u2019s policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">We have reviewed both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">The agency found that, even if Agbon-taen suffered past persecution, the government had rebutted any presumption of future harm by showing that he could relocate to southern Nigeria to avoid persecution on account of his Christian faith and that it would be reasonable for him to do so. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.13(b), 1208.16(b); <em>see also Surinder Singh v. BIA, </em>435 F.3d 216, 219 (2d Cir.2006). This finding is supported by the record. Indeed, Agbontaen and his wife testified that they could safely practice their religion in southern Nigeria, the country conditions evidence demonstrated the same, Agbontaen had visited the south for religious and personal reasons, and his wife has Christian family members living unharmed in that region. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3). Accordingly, the agency reasonably concluded that Agbontaen had not established his eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.13(b), 1208.16(b); <em>see also Surin-der Singh v. BIA, </em>435 F.3d at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-11\">In light of the agency\u2019s relocation finding, as well as the country conditions evidence demonstrating that the Nigerian government respects religious freedom and has not detained any religious prisoners, the agency did not err in finding that Agbontaen failed to establish his eligibility for CAT relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(3) (\u201cIn assessing whether it is more likely than not that an applicant would be tortured in the proposed country of removal, all evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture shall be considered, including, but not limited to ... [ejvidence that the applicant could relocate ... and ... [ojther relevant information regarding conditions in the country of removal.\u201d); <em>see also Pierre v. Gonzales, </em>502 F.3d 109, 115, 118 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-12\">We do not consider Agbontaen\u2019s unex-hausted arguments that he will face perse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>cution on account of his membership in a particular social group. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
