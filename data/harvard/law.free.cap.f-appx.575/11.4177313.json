On appeal, plaintiff argues that the district court erred in using a special verdict form for plaintiffs claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act that did not specifically ask the jury whether defendant provided plaintiff with a \u201creasonable accommodation.\u201d We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-20\">\u201cTo preserve for appeal any objection to the form or substance of questions on a special verdict form, a party must object before the jury has retired to deliberate.\u201d <em>Cash v. Cnty. of Erie, </em>654 F.3d 324, 340 (2d Cir.2011). Woods failed to raise his present objection to the special verdict sheet prior to submission of this case to the jury. Therefore his objection is unpre-served. Both parties agree as much. However, the parties disagree as to the appropriate standard of review for such unpreserved objections. Plaintiff argues that we should review for \u201cplain error,\u201d while defendant contends that our review should assess only whether the district court committed \u201cfundamental error.\u201d The difference in standards is of no moment here, as plaintiffs challenge fails regardless of whether we apply \u201cplain error\u201d or \u201cfundamental error\u201d review.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-21\">In assessing the appropriateness of special verdict questions, \u201cwe must read challenged questions \u2018in conjunction with the judge\u2019s charge to the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cash, </em>654 F.3d at 340 (quoting <em>Shah v. Pan Am. World Servs., Inc., </em>148 F.3d 84, 96 (2d Cir.1998)). Athough the special verdict sheet here contains no mention of \u201creasonable accommodation,\u201d the jury instructions do explain that a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d may have been necessary to ensure \u201csafe and appropriate transportation\u201d for the disabled plaintiff. The district court instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he ADA and the Rehabilitation Act impose an obligation on the County to reasonably accommodate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>disabled persons to ensure safe and appropriate post-arrest transportation.\u201d The district court further instructed the jury to \u201cweigh all of the evidence and use your common sense and experiences to determine whether the County reasonably accommodated plaintiffs disability in order to ensure him safe and appropriate transportation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Because of these instructions as well as the \u201cstrong presumption that the jury in reaching its verdict complied with [the court\u2019s] instructions,\u201d <em>Bingham v. Zolt, </em>66 F.3d 553, 563 (2d Cir.1995), we cannot conclude that the district court committed either \u201cplain error\u201d or \u201cfundamental error\u201d by failing to use the specific phrase \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d in the special verdict sheet. Viewed in the full context of the jury instructions, the omission from the special verdict sheet was not \u201cplain error,\u201d as it was not \u201c[a]n error that \u2018deprive^] the jury of adequate legal guidance to reach a rational decision\u2019 on [the] case\u2019s fundamental issue.\u201d <em>Rasanen v. Doe, </em>723 F.3d 325, 334-35 (2d Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Jarvis v. Ford Motor Co., </em>283 F.3d 33, 62 (2d Cir.2002)). Nor do the jury instructions and special verdict form, when taken as a whole, constitute \u201cfundamental error,\u201d that is, an error \u201cso serious and flagrant that it goes to the very integrity of the trial.\u201d <em>Shade v. Hous. Auth. of City of New Haven, </em>251 F.3d 307, 313 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe have found fundamental error where the jury instructions were \u2018hopelessly confusing and ... failfed] to provide even the barest legal guideposts to aid the jury in rationally reaching a decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>SCS Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Herrick Co., </em>360 F.3d 329, 343 (2d Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Frederic P. Wiedersum Assocs. v. Nat\u2019l Homes Constr. Corp., </em>540 F.2d 62, 66 (2d Cir.1976)). While the special verdict form here could have been clearer and the accompanying jury instructions could have been more concise, taken together, these documents provided the jury with sufficient guidance to rationally reach a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Viewing the special verdict sheet in the context of the jury charge, the district court committed neither \u201cfundamental error\u201d nor \u201cplain error\u201d in using a verdict sheet that failed to specifically ask the jury whether defendant provided plaintiff with a \u201creasonable accommodation.\u201d We have considered the remainder of plaintiffs arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
