Laster argues that the district court erred by dismissing the City because the City should be held vicariously liable for the actions of its employees. Laster also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motions to recuse the trial judge, asserting that a conflict of interest existed and that he presented evidence of the judge\u2019s impartiality. Upon review of the record and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-19\">Laster brought this action against the City and two officers with the Tampa Police Department, Mark Barry and Scott Vantreese, alleging various violations arising out of a traffic stop. Pertinent to this appeal, Laster filed an amended complaint in March 2013 containing the following allegations, which we accept as true for purposes of our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-20\">Around 9:05 p.m. on July 11, 2011, Last-er was driving on Nebraska Avenue in Tampa, Florida, when Barry initiated a traffic stop of Laster\u2019s vehicle. Vantreese arrived soon after as backup. After running a check of Laster\u2019s license and registration, Barry cited Laster for failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>register his vehicle in Florida within ten days of obtaining employment in Florida and arrested him without explanation, placing handcuffs very tightly on Laster\u2019s wrists. Barry also cited Laster for an inoperable passenger-side headlight, although Laster alleged that the light was working. While Laster was detained in the back of the police car, Vantreese searched Laster\u2019s car and seized several cell phones and a laptop. Vantreese and Barry discussed whether they could charge Laster with any other crime based on the evidence obtained from the car. Eventually Laster was taken to the police station and kept in a holding cell until the next morning, when he was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Laster alleged that Barry and Vantreese lacked probable cause to pull him over, pulled him over because he was black, illegally arrested him, and attempted to fabricate additional charges to keep him in jail. He asserted that the defendants should be held accountable for their \u201cdeliberate, wrongful, and malicious actions.\u201d Laster further stated that a state-court judge later found him not guilty of the two citations that Barry issued. Based on these events, Laster raised claims of false arrest, malicious prosecution, and police misconduct under Florida state law, and violations of the Fourth Amendment and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), and Barry and Vantreese raised the defense of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">The district court granted in part and denied in part the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. At issue in this appeal, the court dismissed with prejudice all claims against the City, finding that the amended complaint did not state any claims against the City or the police department, nor did \u201cthe allegations against the officers, even liberally construed, state an action against the City.\u201d The court dismissed the Title VII claim with prejudice but granted Last-er leave to amend his complaint with respect to other counts against Barry and Vantreese which were dismissed without prejudice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">Thereafter, Laster filed a <em>pro se </em>second amended complaint, naming Barry as the sole defendant, alleging false arrest, malicious prosecution, and violations of Last-er\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. Barry answered the complaint, and neither party moved for summary judgment. Laster proceeded to trial before a jury only with respect to his Fourth Amendment claim. The jury returned a verdict finding that Barry had not intentionally committed acts that violated Laster\u2019s constitutional rights. Upon entry of judgment on the jury verdict, Laster timely brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">On appeal, Laster argues that the district court erred by dismissing the City from the action because the City should be held vicariously liable for the torts of its employees under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 768.28. He also contends that the court erred in denying his motions to recuse the judge, which he filed after the order on the motion to dismiss and later during discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R.Civ.P., accepting the facts alleged in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. <em>Butler v. Sheriff of Palm, Beach Cnty., </em>685 F.3d 1261, 1265 (11th Cir.2012). We hold the pleadings of <em>pro se </em>parties to less stringent standards than pleadings drafted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>by lawyers and therefore construe Laster\u2019s pleadings liberally. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). We review a district court\u2019s refusal to recuse for an abuse of discretion. <em>Christo v. Padgett, </em>223 F.3d 1324, 1333 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Section 1983 creates a private cause of action for deprivations of federal rights by persons acting under color of state law. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Municipalities and other local-government units are included among the \u201cpersons\u201d to whom \u00a7 1983 applies. <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. of New York, </em>436 U.S. 658, 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). When a constitutional injury is caused by the execution of a government entity\u2019s official policy or custom, the entity may be held liable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See id. </em>at 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018. But a municipal employer is not vicariously liable under \u00a7 1983 for injuries caused solely by its employees. <em>Id. </em>at 691-94, 98 S.Ct. 2018; <em>McDowell v. Brown, </em>392 F.3d 1283, 1289 (11th Cir.2004). Florida law, on the other hand, allows a plaintiff to recover against a municipality for the tortious acts of its employees based upon a theory of <em>respondeat superior. Brown v. City of Clewiston, </em>848 F.2d 1534, 1543 n. 18 (11th Cir.1988); <em>see </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 768.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">The district court did not err in dismissing the City from Laster\u2019s lawsuit for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Although Florida state law allows for an entity such as the City to be held vicariously liable for the torts of its employees, this rule does not apply to federal constitutional claims asserted under \u00a7 1983. The City cannot be held vicariously liable under \u00a7 1983 for violations of the Fourth Amendment allegedly committed by its individual employees. <em>McDowell, </em>392 F.3d at 1289. Moreover, Laster did not allege any facts indicating that the officers were acting pursuant to the City\u2019s official policy or custom, and he does not raise the City\u2019s municipal liability as an argument on appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018. Consequently, the \u00a7 1983 claim against the City was properly dismissed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">We further disagree with Laster\u2019s contention that the jury\u2019s verdict finding Bar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>ry not personally liable shows that the City itself is liable for his injuries. To prevail on a theory of vicarious liability against the City under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 768.28, Laster had to show liability on the part of Barry, the City\u2019s employee. <em>See Citibank, N.A. v. Data Lease Fin. Corp., </em>904 F.2d 1498, 1500-01 (11th Cir.1990). Because the jury found that Barry had not violated Laster\u2019s constitutional rights, Laster cannot proceed against the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Any judge must disqualify himself \u201cin any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned\u201d or \u201c[wjhere he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), (b)(1). \u201cUnder \u00a7 455, the standard is whether an objective, fully informed lay observer would entertain significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Christo, </em>223 F.3d at 1333. Neither rulings adverse to a party nor friction between the court and counsel constitute pervasive bias requiring recusal. <em>Hamm v. Members of Bd. of Regents, </em>708 F.2d 647, 651 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to recuse. Laster had sought the judge\u2019s recusal on two occasions: first, for reasons relating to the adverse ruling dismissing the City from the action, and second, because Laster did not timely receive a management scheduling order, and he alleged that the deadlines in the order were unfair. The fact that the district judge made rulings adverse to Laster does not constitute pervasive bias. <em>See Hamm, </em>708 F.2d at 651. Nor did Laster present \u2014 and the record does not contain \u2014 evidence that would cause an objective, fully informed lay observer to entertain significant doubt about the court\u2019s impartiality. <em>See Christo, </em>223 F.3d at 1333. On the contrary, the record reflects that the judge promptly responded to the concerns raised in Laster\u2019s second recusal motion by <em>sua sponte </em>amending the scheduling order to extend the deadlines. The district judge, therefore, had no duty to recuse, so his failure to recuse does not constitute error.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">In sum, the district court did not err in dismissing Laster\u2019s claim against the City for violations of his Fourth Amendment rights, and the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Laster\u2019s motions to recuse. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-7\">. Laster does not challenge on appeal the dismissal of his Title VII claim or the dismissal without prejudice of his claims against Vantreese.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b900-6\">. Laster\u2019s argument that the district court erred by dismissing the City with prejudice without granting him at least one opportunity to amend his complaint was first raised in his reply brief and, therefore, is not properly before us. <em>See Lovett v. Ray, </em>327 F.3d 1181, 1183 (11th Cir.2003). In any case, Laster has not shown that permitting him to amend his claims against the City would have been anything other than futile.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b900-7\">. In his briefs on appeal, Laster challenges the district court\u2019s ruling only with respect to the alleged Fourth Amendment violations brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983, not the tort claims brought under Florida state law. Accordingly, Laster has abandoned any argument that the court erred in dismissing the state-law claims by failing to raise the issue on appeal. <em>See Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 681-82 (11th Cir. 2014). Moreover, Laster would not be entitled to relief on appeal with respect to these claims because, even if the district court erred in dismissing the state tort claims against the City, the doctrine of claim preclusion would, under the circumstances, bar Laster from raising these same claims against the City in a future proceeding. <em>See Kaiser Aerospace &amp; Elecs. Corp. v. Teledyne Indus., Inc. (In re Piper Aircraft Corp.), </em>244 F.3d 1289, 1296 (11th Cir.2001). Claim preclusion would apply because the claims were raised, though abandoned prior to trial; there was a final judgment on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction; and the City was in privity with Barry because the City\u2019s liability was based solely on Barry\u2019s actions. <em>See id.; Citibank, N.A. v. Data Lease Fin. Corp., </em>904 F.2d 1498, 1500-03 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
