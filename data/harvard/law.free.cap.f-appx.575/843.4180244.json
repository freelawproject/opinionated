He argues that the government failed to put forth sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the gun Tyson possessed promoted, advanced, or facilitated the conspiracy to traffic in marijuana. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of judgment of acquittal on sufficiency of evidence grounds. <em>United States v. Friske, </em>640 F.3d 1288, 1290 (11th Cir.2011). We review the evidence in the light most favorable to government and draw all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the government. <em>Id. </em>at 1290-91. A jury\u2019s verdict cannot be overturned if any reasonable construction of the evidence would have allowed the jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 1291. The evidence need not be inconsistent with every reasonable hypothesis except guilt, and the jury is free to choose between or among the reasonable conclusions to be drawn from the evidence presented at trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), \u201cany person who, during and in relation to any ... drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm\u201d shall be subject to enhanced penalties. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Thus, \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) contains two prongs that can trigger enhanced penalties: (1) the \u201cuses or carries\u201d a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d prong, and (2) the \u201cpossesses\u201d a firearm \u201cin furtherance\u201d prong. <em>United States v. Haile, </em>685 F.3d 1211, 1217 (11th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1723, 185 L.Ed.2d 785 and \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1724, 185 L.Ed.2d 785 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">Under the first or \u201cin relation to\u201d prong of \u00a7 924(c), the government must establish that the defendant: (1) used or carried the firearm; (2) during and in relation to; (3) a drug trafficking offense (or crime of violence). <em>Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 227-28, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993). The Supreme Court has held that the \u201ccarry\u201d element of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) extends to transporting a firearm in one\u2019s car, including a locked trunk. <em>Muscarello v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 125, 127, 139, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998). In order for the government to establish that the firearm was carried \u201cin relation to\u201d the drug trafficking offense, the government must show that the firearm had \u201csome purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime\u201d and that its \u201cpresence or involvement\u201d was not the result of accident or coincidence. <em>United States v. Timmons, </em>283 F.3d 1246, 1251 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted). To do so, the government must show either that the gun facilitated the drug trafficking offense or that it at least had the potential of facilitating the drug trafficking offense. <em>Id. </em>A drug trafficking offense, for purposes of \u00a7 924(c), \u201cmeans any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2). A violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(D) is a drug trafficking crime because it is a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-13\">Here, Tyson concedes that he was the owner of both the firearm and the marijuana found in the trunk of the rental car, and he appears to argue only that the evidence was insufficient to establish the \u201cin relation to\u201d prong of \u00a7 924(c) under which he was charged and convicted. However, as the record shows, the government put forth sufficient evidence to satisfy the \u201cin relation to\u201d element of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Both Sgt. Franks and Agent Lolley testified that the gun was found in a backpack within arm\u2019s reach of a garbage bag full of marijuana. They also testified that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>gun was immediately accessible upon opening the trunk and unzipping the backpack. Moreover, Agent Stephen testified that guns are \u201ctools of the trade\u201d of drug trafficking and that a gun serves as one of the only forms of insurance to protect the trafficker, his money, and his drugs. While none of the evidence presented shows that the gun directly facilitated Tyson\u2019s drug trafficking, it did show that the gun would have had the potential to facilitate the drug trafficking, and a reasonable jury could have concluded such. <em>See Tim-mons, </em>288 F.3d at 1251. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
