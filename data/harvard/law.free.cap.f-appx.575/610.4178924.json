WHITE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">An untreated spinal abscess rendered appellant Terrell W. Ham paraplegic while he was serving a four-month sentence in the Marshall County Detention Center (MCDC) in Marshall County, Kentucky. This appeal concerns the timeliness of Ham\u2019s claims against Dr. Scott Wilson, M.D., the emergency-room physician who examined Ham but failed to identify the abscess, and Sterling Emergency Medical Services of the Midwest, Inc. (Sterling), the practice for which Wilson worked as an independent contractor. Ham concedes that he filed his first amended complaint, naming Sterling and Wilson as defendants for the first time, outside the one-year limitations period applicable to his claims, but he argues that his claims against them are nonetheless timely under Kentucky\u2019s tolling statute, and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)\u2019s relation-back rule. We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-14\">On February 19, 2010, Ham complained to deputy jailers at the detention center that he could not get out of bed, could not feel his legs, and that his entire left side was numb. MCDC Jailer Roger Ford released Ham on bond so that his family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>could take him to the emergency room at Marshall County Public Hospital (the Hospital). When Ham checked in at the emergency room registration desk at about 6:20 p.m., Dr. Louis Forte was the physician on duty. Dr. Forte was identified as the physician on duty on Ham\u2019s admission paperwork, and because of how the Hospital computer system works, Forte\u2019s name automatically populated Ham\u2019s medical charts from the evening as the physician who treated Ham. Forte\u2019s shift ended at 7:00 p.m., however, before he played any role in Ham\u2019s care, and he was replaced by Dr. Scott Wilson. Dr. Wilson is the physician who examined Ham (and discharged him without identifying the spinal abscess), but Dr. Wilson\u2019s name, aside from two illegible signatures, appears in Ham\u2019s records only once, on Ham\u2019s discharge form where it states, \u201cyou have been seen by Dr. Wilson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">At his deposition, Ham testified that he knew when he was in the Hospital emergency room that Dr. Wilson was the physician examining him, but he thought that Dr. Forte \u2014 who he had met before and had spotted as he entered the Hospital\u2014 was still on the premises and making decisions regarding his care. Ham\u2019s sister and daughter corroborated Ham\u2019s testimony that he was aware that Dr. Wilson was the physician treating him that night: each testified that Ham complained the next day that he had been unable to see Dr. Forte and was treated by Dr. Wilson instead. R. 134, Deposition of Jessica Ham at 31(\u201c[H]e said that he had been treated by a Dr. Wilson because ... Dr. Forte[ ] was not in or not available.\u201d); R. 139, Deposition of Dottie Hamlet at 31, 66. Wilson testified that he introduced himself to Ham by name (although Ham did not mention that in his testimony, instead saying he could not \u201cexactly remember how [he] found out\u201d Wilson\u2019s name). Ham\u2019s attorney Douglas Myers was evidently also aware that. \u201cDr. Wilson\u201d played a role in Ham\u2019s care. In a letter asking Ham to review an initial draft of the complaint, Myers stated, \u201c[a]s you can see, we have left a blank for Dr. Wilson\u2019s first name. Once I have this, I will fill this in.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Ham filed suit on January 24, 2011\u2014 roughly a month before expiration of the statute of limitations on February 21, 2011 \u2014 but the complaint did not name Wilson, or Sterling, as a defendant. Ham brought claims for medical negligence, the tort of outrage (Kentucky\u2019s version of intentional infliction of emotional distress), and violation of his Eighth Amendment rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. He named as defendants the County, various MCDC officials, the Marshall County Public Hospital District Corporation (which owns and operates the Hospital), Dr. Forte, and ten John and Jane Does, described as \u201cemployees and health care professionals of the Marshall County Detention Center and/or the Marshall County Hospital.\u201d The complaint described the Marshall County Public Hospital District Corporation as Forte\u2019s employer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In fact, Wilson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>and Forte both worked as independent contractors for Sterling, and Sterling contracted with the Hospital to provide emergency room physicians. The complaint did not name, or mention, Wilson or Sterling.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Forte was served with the complaint on February 15, 2011, and filed his Answer a week later, stating, among other things, that he was not the physician who treated Ham. On March 29, 2011, the Hospital filed its initial disclosures, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(1), listing Dr. Scott Wilson as among the individuals likely to have discoverable information related to Ham\u2019s claims. A little over three months later, on July 5, 2011, Ham sought leave to amend his complaint to add Wilson and Sterling as defendants. The district court granted leave to file the amended complaint on August 2, 2011, and Ham filed it the same day.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Three months after that, Ham dismissed Forte as a defendant. On March 30, 2012, Wilson and Sterling filed a motion for summary judgment contending that Ham\u2019s claims against them were time-barred. The district court granted the motion. Ham appeals that decision and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Ham does not dispute that his claims are subject to a one-year statute of limitations that expired on or about February 21, 2011. He argues that his claims against Wilson and Sterling are nonetheless timely under (1) Kentucky Revised Statute \u00a7 413.190(2), which provides that statutes of limitation are tolled when the defendant obstructs prosecution of the action; and (2) Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c), which provides that amendments to a pleading may relate back to the date of the original pleading under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">Kentucky\u2019s tolling statute provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-13\">[w]hen a cause of action ... accrues against a resident of this state, and he by absconding or concealing himself or by any other indirect means obstructs the prosecution of the action, the time of the continuance of the absence from the state or obstruction shall not be computed as any part of the period within which the action shall be commenced. But this saving shall not prevent the limitation from operating in favor of any other person not so acting, whether he is a necessary party to the action or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">K.R.S. \u00a7 413.190(2). The provision \u201c \u2018is essentially a recognition in law of an equitable estoppel ... to prevent a fraudulent or inequitable resort to a plea of limitations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Emberton v. GMRI, Inc., </em>299 S.W.3d 565, 573 (Ky.2009) (quoting <em>Adams v. Ison, </em>249 S.W.2d 791, 793 (Ky.Ct.App.1952). The defendant need not act with \u201cbad faith, evil design, or an intent ... to deceive or mislead or defraud in the technical sense\u201d to warrant tolling, but the defendant\u2019s conduct nonetheless \u201cmust have been <em>calculated to mislead or deceive </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number><em>and to induce inaction </em>by the injured party.\u201d <em>Adams, </em>249 S.W.2d at 793 (emphasis added). Generally, \u201cthe concealment envisioned by KRS 413.190(2) must represent an \u2018affirmative act\u2019 and \u2018cannot be assumed\u2019 \u2014 i.e., it must be active, not passive.\u201d <em>Emberton, </em>299 S.W.3d at 573 (quoting <em>Adams, </em>249 S.W.2d at 793). A \u201ccommonly recognized exception to the affirmative act requirement applies \u2018where a party remains silent when <em>the duty to speak or disclose </em>is imposed by law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574 (quoting <em>Gailor v. Alsabi, </em>990 S.W.2d 597, 603 (Ky.1999))). In either event, however, tolling is not warranted unless the defendant\u2019s conduct \u201cin point of fact\u201d misled or deceived the plaintiff, and obstructed him from timely filing suit. <em>Adams, </em>249 S.W.2d at 792. A defendant is not obstructed or misled under the provision if the exercise of reasonable diligence would allow him to pursue his claim. <em>See Greywolf v. Roman Catholic Diocese of Covington, </em>No.2010-CA-000814-MR, 2011 WL 3361342, at * 3 (Ky.Ct.App. Aug. 5, 2011) (\u201c[Njotwithstanding the application of the tolling provision, the law still imposes a duty on a plaintiff to exercise reasonable care and diligence in pursuing a cause of action.\u201d); <em>see also Adams, </em>249 S.W.2d at 793 (\u201c[T]he representation or conduct must have been relied upon reasonably and in good faith.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Ham contends that Dr. Wilson obstructed prosecution of Ham\u2019s action by signing Ham\u2019s medical records illegibly and failing to replace Dr. Forte\u2019s name with his own. Ham Br. 18 (arguing that Ham \u201cwas misled by Dr. Wilson signing medical records indicating that another physician had treated him in the ER on the night of February 19, 2010\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at 21-22 (\u201cDr. Wilson\u2019s fiduciary duty, including his duty to ensure accurate medical records, required him to fully and accurately disclose his identity when documenting Ham\u2019s medical treatment.\u201d). The record belies any contention that Wilson\u2019s illegible signature and failure to correct the medical records was \u201ccalculated to mislead or deceive\u201d Ham. <em>Adams, </em>249 S.W.2d at 793. As Wilson notes, no cause of action had accrued when Wilson treated Ham; he had no reason, therefore, to hide his identity or delay suit. And Wilson\u2019s conduct does not otherwise evince deception. Ham\u2019s discharge paperwork stated that he had \u201cbeen seen by Dr. Wilson.\u201d Dr. Wilson interacted in person with Ham all evening. He testified that he not only introduced himself to Ham, he also contacted MCDC \u2014 and presumably identified himself \u2014 to get background information on Ham\u2019s condition, and, after hearing that a patient matching Ham\u2019s description was being taken to Lourdes Hospital the next night, he called the Lourdes Hospital emergency room physician, whom he knew personally, to make himself available to answer questions. This is not the conduct of a person hoping to obscure his identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">In any event, tolling is unwarranted because Wilson\u2019s conduct did not \u201cin point of fact\u201d mislead or deceive Ham, or obstruct him from timely filing suit. <em>Munday v. Mayfair Diagnostic Lab., </em>831 S.W.2d 912, 914 (Ky.1992) (\u201cOur decisions construing the statute and applying equitable estoppel appear to require \u2018some act or conduct which in point of fact misleads or deceives plaintiff and obstructs or prevents him from instituting his suit while he may do so.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Adams, </em>249 S.W.2d at 792); <em>see also 500 Associates, Inc. v. Vermont Am. Corp., </em>496 Fed.Appx. 589, 596 (6th Cir.2012) (\u201c500 Associates was aware at the time that it filed the lawsuit that Vermont American might have omitted disclosing additional pollution on its property.... Under these circumstances, \u00a7 413.190(2) certainly does not operate to toll the limitations periods.\u201d). Ham, his sister, his daughter, and his attorney all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>knew <em>before </em>Ham filed his complaint that Ham was treated by \u201cDr. Wilson.\u201d If Ham was not aware of or did not remember Dr. Wilson\u2019s full name, surely, in the \u201cexercise [of] reasonable care and diligence,\u201d his attorney could have figured it out. <em>See Greywolf, </em>2011 WL 3361342, at *3. Under these circumstances, \u00a7 413.190(2) does not toll the limitations period for Ham\u2019s claims against Wilson. And because Ham does not argue that Sterling engaged in any obstructive conduct of its own, \u00a7 413.190(2) also does not toll the limitations period for Ham\u2019s claims against Sterling. <em>See </em>\u00a7 413.190(2) (\u201c[T]his saving shall not prevent the limitation from operating in favor of any other person not so acting, whether he is a necessary party to the action or not.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Nor are Ham\u2019s claims timely under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c). Rule 15(c)(1)(C) provides that an amendment that \u201cchanges the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted\u201d relates back to the date of the original pleading if \u201cthe amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out \u2014 or attempted to be set out \u2014 in the original pleading,\u201d and if, within 120 days after the complaint is filed, \u201cthe party to be brought in by amendment (i) received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits; and (ii) knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c); Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m). Ham makes relation-back arguments only with respect to Wilson; the argument with respect to Sterling is therefore waived. <em>See Kuhn v. Washtenaw Cnty., </em>709 F.3d 612, 624 (6th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Defendants argue that Ham\u2019s claims do not relate back because by amending his complaint Ham sought to <em>add </em>parties, not to \u201cchange a party or change the name of a party.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(1)(C). This court has held that claims against <em>additional </em>parties do not relate back.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Asher v. Unarco Material Handling, Inc., </em>596 F.3d 313, 318 (6th Cir.2010) (\u201c[T]he precedent of this circuit clearly holds that \u2018an amendment which adds a new party creates a new cause of action and there is no relation back to the original filing for purposes of limitations.\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>In re Kent Holland Die Casting &amp; Plating, Inc., </em>928 F.2d 1448, 1449 (6th Cir.1991) (in bankruptcy preference action, amended complaint seeking to recover funds from additional insurer did not relate back)); <em>see also Smart v. Ellis Trucking Co., </em>580 F.2d 215, 218 (6th Cir.1978) (in employee suit against trucking company, amended complaint adding union as a defendant did not relate back); <em>Marlowe v. Fisher Body, </em>489 F.2d 1057, 1064 (6th Cir.1973) (in suit against General Motors, amended complaint adding the United Auto Workers as a defendant did not relate back). Wilson is not an <em>additional </em>defendant in the same sense as the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>dants in <em>Kent, Smart, </em>and <em>Marlowe, </em>however. Although Ham knew that Wilson and Forte were two different doctors, apparently thought that both were involved in his care, named only Forte in his original complaint, and then \u201cadded\u201d Wilson seven months later without dismissing Forte at the same time, it is evident that in amending, Ham intended to charge Wilson with conduct initially attributed to Forte. The amended complaint charged Forte \u201cand/or\u201d Wilson with the same conduct and Ham subsequently dropped Forte from the suit. In that sense, Ham <em>changed </em>the party against whom he brought his claim and did not <em>add </em>a new party.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An amendment that \u201cchanges the party ... against whom a claim is asserted\u201d relates back under Rule 15 if the remaining requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C) are met. Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(c); <em>Cox v. Treadway, </em>75 F.3d 230, 240 (6th Cir.1996) (\u201c[A] change in the party sued ... may only be accomplished when all of the specifications of Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(c) are met.\u201d) (quoting <em>Aslani-dis v. U.S. Lines, Inc., </em>7 F.3d 1067, 1075 (2d Cir.1993)); <em>see also Ringrose v. Engel-berg Huller Co., Inc., </em>692 F.2d 403, 405 (6th Cir.1982) (remanding for consideration whether amended complaint naming successor corporations of original, defunct, defendant manufacturer met the mistake and notice requirements of Rule 15(c)). We assume arguendo that in naming Wilson as a defendant, Ham met the \u201cchange in party\u201d requirement of the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The district court concluded that Rule 15(c) does not allow relation back because Ham\u2019s failure to name Wilson as a defendant was not the result of a <em>mistake </em>in the relevant sense, it was merely the result of Ham\u2019s failure to find out Wilson\u2019s name. <em>See Nelson v. Adams USA, Inc., </em>529 U.S. 460, 467 n. 1, 120 S.Ct. 1579, 146 L.Ed.2d 530 (2000) (Rule 15(c) \u201capplies only in cases involving \u2018a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party.\u2019 \u201d). That may well be right. We have distinguished a plaintiffs <em>mistake </em>concerning the identity of a party from a plaintiffs mere <em>failure to find out </em>a party\u2019s identity. <em>See Cox, </em>75 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>F.3d at 240; <em>see also Brown v. Cuyahoga County, Ohio, </em>517 Fed.Appx. 431, 433-34 (6th Cir.2013) (\u201cWe have previously held that an absence of knowledge is not a mistake as required by Rule 15(c)(l)(C)(ii).\u201d) (citing <em>Cox, </em>75 F.3d at 240); <em>Smith v. City of Akron, </em>476 Fed.Appx. 67, 69 (6th Cir.2012) (\u201cSmith did not make a mistake about the identity of the parties he intended to sue; he did not know who they were and apparently did not find out within the two-year limitations period. The relation-back protections of Rule 15(c) were not designed to correct <em>that </em>kind of problem.\u201d); <em>Moore v. Tennessee, </em>267 Fed.Appx. 450, 455 (6th Cir.2008) (\u201cIn this court, a plaintiffs lack of knowledge pertaining to an intended defendant\u2019s identity does not constitute a \u2018mistake concerning the party\u2019s identity\u2019 within the meaning of Rule 15(c).\u201d) (citing <em>Cox, </em>75 F.3d. at 240). Undoubtedly Ham sued <em>Forte </em>under the mistaken belief that Forte made decisions regarding his care, but it is less clear why he did not name <em>Wilson </em>as a defendant. Ham, his sister, and his daughter, all testified that Ham knew that he was <em>not </em>treated by Dr. Forte and knew that he <em>was </em>treated by \u201cDr. Wilson,\u201d and Myers\u2019 January 2011 letter suggests that he did not name Wilson in the complaint only because he did not know Wilson\u2019s full name. Ham asserts that he intended to sue the physician who made the decision to discharge him from the hospital, and he <em>mistakenly </em>believed that Dr. Forte, and not Dr. Wilson, was that physician. Arguably, Ham\u2019s misunderstanding about the roles Forte and Wilson played in his care is a \u201cmistake\u201d under <em>Krupski v. Costa Crociere S. p. A, </em>560 U.S. 538, 130 S.Ct. 2485, 177 L.Ed.2d 48 (2010), if one concludes that had Wilson received notice of the action, he would have recognized that he was the doctor who treated Ham and would have known that if he was on shift, then Forte was not. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(l)(C)(ii). But we need not go further down this road because Rule 15(c)(1)(C) requires more than a mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Under Rule 15(c)(l)(C)(i), an amended complaint does not relate back unless, within the period for service of the summons and complaint, the defendant \u201creceived such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(l)(C)(i); Fed. R.Civ.P. 4(m). The notice may be actual or constructive. <em>See Berndt v. Tennessee, </em>796 F.2d 879, 884 (6th Cir.1986). Wilson submitted an affidavit stating that he had no actual knowledge of Ham\u2019s suit until Ham filed his amended complaint (after expiration of the Rule 4(m) period) and nothing in the record contradicts that assertion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Factors relevant to whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>defendant received constructive notice \u201cinclude the relationship of the new defendants to the defendant(s) originally named, whether the same attorney represented both original and new defendants, and whether the new defendants are officials of the original defendant.\u201d <em>Force v. City of Memphis, </em>101 F.3d 702, 1996 WL 665609, at *2 (6th Cir.1996) (table) (citing <em>Berndt, </em>796 F.2d at 884). Here, the original complaint did not name Forte and Wilson\u2019s mutual employer, Sterling, so it cannot be said that Sterling, a defendant, knew that plaintiff sought to hold it liable for the conduct of the doctor who discharged Ham and simply named the wrong doctor. Forte notified Sterling of Ham\u2019s suit, and Sterling notified its malpractice insurance provider Oceanus Insurance Company (\u201cOceanus\u201d). Oceanus hired counsel for Forte, and after Wilson was added hired the same counsel for Wilson. Any knowledge Sterling may have obtained about the suit and the particulars of the complaint through this process cannot be imputed to Wilson. Accordingly, we find that Wilson did not receive the notice required to allow relation back.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Ham\u2019s action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-5\">. The parties' briefs do not mention this letter or the deposition testimony of Ham\u2019s sister and daughter.

How, and whether, \"substituting\u201d a defendant differs from \"changing\u201d a defendant is unclear. <em>Compare Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>374 (2002) (defining \"change\u201d as \"the act of replacing something with something else of the same kind or with something that serves as a substitute\u201d) <em>with id. </em>at 2280 (defining \"substitute\u201d as \u201cto replace with another\u201d). Undoubtedly, however, the Rule applies to more than merely correcting misnomers, i.e., correcting the name of a party already before the court. <em>See </em>Wright &amp; Miller, 6A Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. Civ. \u00a7 1498.2 (3d ed.) (\"A misnomer is involved when the correct party was served so that the party before the court is the one plaintiff intended to sue, but the name or description of the party in the complaint is deficient in some respect.\u201d). The Rule's text alone makes that clear. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(1)(C) (An amendment relates back when it \"changes the party <em>or </em>the naming of a party\u201d and meets the other requirements of the rule). And, in any event, we have applied the Rule outside that context, <em>see Ringrose, </em>692 F.2d at 405 (amended complaint named successor corporations to original defendant); <em>Black-Hosang v. Ohio Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety, </em>96 Fed.Appx. 372, 374 (6th Cir.2004) (amended complaint substituted individual police officer for state Department of Public Safety), and so has the Supreme Court, <em>see Krupski v. Costa Crociere S. p. A., </em>560 U.S. 538, 548, 130 S.Ct. 2485, 177 L.Ed.2d 48 (2010) (amended complaint substituting correct company for improperly named company). <em>See also Krupski, </em>560 U.S. at 548 n. 3, 130 S.Ct. 2485 (\"Rule 15(c)(1)(C) ... is not limited to the circumstance of a plaintiff filing an amended complaint seeking to bring in a new defendant,\u201d but that is \"the \u2018typical case' \u201d of the Rule\u2019s applicability) (citing 3 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 15.19[2] (3d ed.2009)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b645-5\">. Ham asks us to remand for additional discovery regarding Dr. Wilson\u2019s notice during the limitations period. We decline to do so. Ham filed his amended complaint on August 2, 2011. Wilson and Sterling filed an Answer on August 31, 2011, asserting that Ham's complaint was time-barred. Ham's counsel deposed Wilson five months later, on January 24, 2012, without asking Wilson when he first learned of Ham's suit or about his communications with Sterling. Defendants moved for summary judgment in March 2012, submitting a signed affidavit from Wilson stating that he did not know that Ham had filed suit until he was served with the amended complaint. Ham thereafter filed a motion to compel seeking a privilege log of defense counsel's communications with Forte and Wilson during the Rule 4(m) period, which defendants voluntarily produced on June 18, 2012. The log showed no communications with Wilson regarding the action. The district, court delayed decision on the motion for summary judgment to allow Ham additional time for discovery. Ham noticed the deposition of Sterling in October 2012, and then, a month later sought an additional extension of time and filed a motion to compel, contending that Sterling\u2019s designated representative lacked adequate knowledge of the suit. At this point, Ham had been on notice of Sterling and Wilson\u2019s statute-of-limitations defense for well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>over a year and the discovery deadline in the scheduling order had passed. The district court acted within its discretion when it denied Ham's motions in its order granting defendants' motion for summary judgment. <em>See Dowling v. Cleveland Clinic Found., </em>593 F.3d 472, 478 (6th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
