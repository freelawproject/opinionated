Our review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal discloses that the Board\u2019s decision is based upon substantial evidence and is without reversible error. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>Consolidation Coal Co. v. Blankenship, </em>No. 11-0723 BLA (B.R.B. July 26, 2012). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
