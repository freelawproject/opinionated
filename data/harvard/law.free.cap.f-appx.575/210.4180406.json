The Government moves for the dismissal of Cortes\u2019s appeal as frivolous or, in the alternative, for an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-17\">Cortes was convicted by guilty plea of possession with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine. His base offense level was 32, from which three levels were subtracted for acceptance of responsibility and two additional levels were subtracted because he qualified for the safety valve exception to the imposition of the statutory minimum sentence. His criminal history score of zero placed him in criminal history category I, and his guideline sentencing range was 70-87 months of imprisonment.- He was sentenced to 70 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-22\">This appeal is largely based on Cortes\u2019s interpretation of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010(FSA) and its application to his sentence. Cortes argues that the district court should have taken into account the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), particularly as those factors could be construed as including his cooperation with the Government, when considering his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion; that the term \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d is sufficiently ambiguous that the rule of lenity should be applied to it; that the district court could have downwardly departed without any motion from the Government; that his 70-month sentence was based on his applicable guideline sentencing range, which was lowered after enactment of the FSA; that he might have been entitled to a two-level offense level reduction for minor participation; and that the post-FSA guideline amendments should apply retroactively to lower his guideline sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-23\">By moving to proceed IFP, Cortes challenges the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). We may authorize Cortes to proceed IFP on appeal if he is unable to pay the costs of the appeal and the appeal is taken in good faith. 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>\u00a7 1915(a)(1), (3). \u201cAn investigation into the [IFP] movant\u2019s objective good faith, while necessitating a brief inquiry into the merits of an appeal, does not require that probable success be shown. The inquiry is limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We may determine the merits of a litigant\u2019s appeal \u201cwhere the merits are so intertwined with the certification decision as to constitute the same issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is based on the merits of Cortes\u2019s appeal, and a favorable determination of the motion to dismiss would necessitate denying Cortes\u2019s IFP motion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, while the court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). A district court may not lower a sentence below the minimum guideline sentence when reducing a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.2009). When deciding whether to reduce a sentence, a district court should determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant had the amendment at issue been in effect at the tune of sentencing and \u201cshall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Effective August 3, 2010, the FSA amended relevant statutory provisions by, inter alia, increasing the drug quantities required to trigger mandatory minimum sentences for cocaine base offenses, thereby ameliorating a longstanding disparity in treatment of cocaine base and cocaine offenses. FSA, Pub.L. No. 111-220, \u00a7 2(a)(1), 124 Stat. 2372 (Aug. 3, 2010); <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, ---, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2328-29, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). Cortes\u2019s offense level was based on eight kilograms of powder cocaine, and not on any quantity of cocaine base. The FSA therefore is inapplicable to his offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">The base offense level applicable to eight kilograms of cocaine remains level 32. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4). Subtracting three levels for acceptance of responsibility and two levels for the safety valve adjustment, <em>see </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) (leaving in place guideline adjustments apart from amended provisions), Cortes\u2019s total offense level remains at level 27. His guideline sentencing range remains 70-87 months of imprisonment. \u00a7 5A, Sentencing Table. Because Cortes\u2019s offense level has not been lowered by any amendment to the Guidelines, the district court lacked authority to reduce his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">Cortes has failed to raise any nonfrivo-lous issues for appeal. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5TH CIR. R. 42.2. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED as moot. Cortes\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b238-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
