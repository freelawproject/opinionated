Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>he filed a \u201cMotion to Close Escrow\u201d in which he claimed his posting of a promissory note discharged his criminal judgment and required the district court to release him. The district court denied his motion and Lee filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-21\">In response, the government moved for summary affirmance. Summary disposition is appropriate where \u201cthe position of one of the parties is clearly right as a matter of law so that there can be no substantial question as to the outcome of the case, or where, as is more frequently the ease, the appeal is frivolous.\u201d <em>Groen-dyke Transp., Inc. v. Davis, </em>406 F.2d 1158, 1162 (5th Cir.1969).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-22\">Summary affirmance is appropriate in Lee\u2019s case because the position of the government is clearly right as a matter of law that there can be no substantial question as to the outcome of the case. There is no statutory or legal authority for the district court to accept payment in lieu of a life sentence. A district court\u2019s authority to modify a term of imprisonment is \u201cnarrowly limited by statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2010). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), a district court may modify a sentence only if (1) the Bureau of Prisons files a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>and certain other conditions are met; (2) a modification is expressly permitted by statute or Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35; or (3) the defendant was sentenced based on a guidelines range that was later lowered by the Sentencing Commission and other requirements are met. <em>Id. </em>None of these circumstances is present in Lee\u2019s case, and as a result the district court has no authority to release him.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Because Lee\u2019s motion was filed in his criminal case and seeks a modification of his criminal sentence, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and civil statutes on which he attempts to rely do not apply. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 1. Any argument to the contrary is without merit. <em>See United States v. Mosavi, </em>138 F.3d 1365, 1365-66 (11th Cir.1998) (affirming after \u201c[f]inding that the district court lacked the subject matter jurisdiction necessary to provide Rule 60(b) relief\u2019 because a defendant could not challenge a criminal forfeiture order using the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">To the extent that Lee relies in the alternative on Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 46, this argument is also frivolous. Rule 46 covers a person\u2019s release pretrial, during trial, pending sentence or appeal, and pending hearing on a violation of probation or supervised release. Fed. R.Crim.P. 46(a)-(d). As a result, it does not apply to Lee\u2019s circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">We note that even if the district court had construed his motion for release from custody as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion for habeas relief, denial would have been appropriate. This is because Lee would not be entitled to habeas relief based on the submission of a promissory note for the reasons explained above.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">All of Lee\u2019s remaining contentions on appeal depend on the district court having authority to discharge his criminal judgment after submission of a promissory note. As a result, they are also frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"AMh\">Because there is no substantial question about the outcome of Lee\u2019s case, the government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED and the government\u2019s motion to stay the briefing schedule is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b888-17\">. In <em>Bonner v.
