We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law and for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Jiang v. Holder, </em>611 F.3d 1086, 1091 (9th Cir.2010). We grant the petition for review, and we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-22\">In finding Du did not suffer past persecution, the BIA characterized his experience as involving only a \u201cbrief detention\u201d and \u201csingle threat.\u201d Substantial evidence does not support this finding because the BIA did not address the full extent of Du\u2019s past harm, including the denial of a marriage license, the forced abortion, and the ban on further contact with his girlfriend. <em>See Korablina v. INS, </em>158 F.3d 1038, 1044 (9th Cir.1998) (\u201c[t]he key question is whether, looking at the cumulative effect of all the incidents a petitioner has suffered, the treatment [he] received rises to the level of persecution\u201d); <em>Kalubi v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1134, 1141 (9th Cir.2004) (finding BIA\u2019s consideration of issue insufficient and remanding for explanation of rationale); <em>see also Jiang, </em>611 F.3d at 1095-96 (considering forced abortion and other factors in past persecution analysis). Thus, we grant the petition for review and remand Du\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims to the BIA for further pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>ceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See INS v.
