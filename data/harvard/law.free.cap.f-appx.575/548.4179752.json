He filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition alleging he had received ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. The district court considered and rejected all of Isenberger\u2019s claims except the one alleging that trial counsel was ineffective for putting Isenberger\u2019s wife Dorette on the stand to testify at his trial. The district court sua sponte dismissed that claim as unexhausted, and we granted a certificate of appealability on that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-18\">Isenberger asserts that he raised the claim regarding counsel\u2019s decision to have his wife testify in his state application for postconviction relief. The respondent agrees with Isenberger\u2019s assertion. The record indicates that the substance of Is-enberger\u2019s claim was indeed raised before the state habeas court. Accordingly, the district court erred in dismissing the claim as unexhausted. <em>See Nobles v. Johnson, </em>127 F.3d 409, 420 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, we VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Isenberger\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance as unexhausted, and we REMAND this matter for further proceedings on that sole claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b576-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
