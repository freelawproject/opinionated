We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Campeau filed suit against the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) alleging that it failed to properly treat his request to amend his social security records and failed to provide him with access to those records in violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a. His claims arise from his attempt to amend his records to include what he refers to as a \u201cSimple Social Security Trust\u201d and an \u201cindenture.\u201d Campeau did not attach a copy of this document to his complaint or allege its contents, but he filed suit in his purported capacity as \u201cSteward for the Kingdom of Israel.\u201d Other courts have addressed claims by similarly self-professed \u201cStewards of Israel\u201d based on purported \u201cSocial Security Trusts\u201d and \u201cindentures,\u201d which other individuals have sought to place in their records in furtherance of an income tax liability avoidance theory that those other courts have rejected as \u201cfrivolous.\u201d <em>E. g., Crummey v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>794 F.Supp.2d 46, 56 (D.D.C.2011) (addressing similar Privacy Act claim and collecting cases), <em>aff'd, </em>No. 11-5231, 2012 WL 556317 (D.C.Cir. Feb. 6, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">Campeau alleges that he mailed to the SSA a written request to include this \u201cindenture\u201d in his file but that the SSA never responded. He further alleges that, some seven months later, he drove to the SSA\u2019s headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland, and requested to review his records in person to ascertain whether the SSA had received and granted his request. According to Campeau, a Security Director at the SSA\u2019s headquarters directed him to an SSA field office located on Reistertown Road in Baltimore, but an agent at that office told him that he did not know where the records were located and advised Campeau to make a written or online request under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d). Campeau does not allege that he followed that advice, and he instead filed this action almost two years later asserting the Privacy Act claims (but no claims under FOIA) discussed below. On the SSA\u2019s motion, the District Court dismissed Campeau\u2019s complaint under Rule 12(b)(6). Campeau appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-14\">We agree that the District Court properly dismissed Campeau\u2019s complaint but, because our analysis differs somewhat, we will independently address Campeau\u2019s claims in some detail. Three of Campeau\u2019s four claims relate to his attempt to amend his records as described above. In partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>ular, he claims that the SSA: (1) failed to acknowledge receipt of his request within ten days as required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(d)(2)(A); (2) failed to make a determination of whether to amend his records as required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(d)(2)(B); and (3) failed to permit him to seek review of any denial of his request as required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">The District Court concluded that the first of these claims is barred by the Privacy Act\u2019s two-year statute of limitation, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(5), and that ruling is clearly correct. Section 552a(d)(2)(A) required the SSA to acknowledge Campeau\u2019s request in writing \u201cnot later than 10 days (excluding [weekends and holidays]) after the date of receipt.\u201d Campeau alleges that the SSA received his request on February 10, 2011, so (according to his allegations) the SSA was required to acknowledge it by February 24, 2011. Campeau was thus well aware of this alleged injury well more than two years before filing suit on September 13, 2013, and his arguments to the contrary are baseless.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Campeau\u2019s remaining amendment-related claims sought both monetary damages and injunctive relief. Monetary damages are potentially available under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(1)(D), which permits a person to seek damages under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(g)(4) if a violation of the Privacy Act or regulations promulgated thereunder had an \u201cadverse effect\u201d on that person. The District Court concluded that all of Campeau\u2019s claims for damages fail because he failed to allege an \u201cadverse effect,\u201d and we again agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u201c[T]he reference in \u00a7 552a(g)(l)(D) to \u2018adverse effect\u2019 acts as a term of art identifying a potential plaintiff who satisfies the injury-in-fact and causation requirements of Article III standing[.]\u201d <em>Doe v. Chao, </em>540 U.S. 614, 624, 124 S.Ct. 1204, 157 L.Ed.2d 1122 (2004). Campeau argues that the SSA\u2019s alleged failure to determine his request or provide him with review had an adverse effect on him because he incurred $300 in expenses in driving to the SSA\u2019s headquarters in Baltimore to review his records and ascertain whether the SSA had granted his request to amend them. Campeau\u2019s purely voluntary decision to travel to Baltimore does not give him standing to seek damages under this statute because this \u201cself-inflicted injur[y] [is] not fairly traceable to the Government\u2019s purported activities.\u201d <em>Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1138, 1152, 185 L.Ed.2d 264 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">Campeau also requested an injunction requiring the SSA to amend his records under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(2)(A), by adding the \u201cindenture\u201d to his file. Campeau alleged in his complaint that he did not know whether the SSA did so, and he sought this remedy in the alternative in case it did not. After the SSA represented in its motion to dismiss that it had no record of having received Campeau\u2019s request, Campeau argued that the SSA must not have amended his records and that he should be allowed to amend his complaint to assert an affirmative claim for an injunction requiring it to do so. The District Court concluded that Campeau failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before seeking such an injunction because, inter alia, he failed to allege that his records are materially inaccurate or incomplete in any way. That conclusion is correct and, exhaustion aside, it means that Campeau has failed to state a claim for statutory relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>The Privacy Act permits individuals to request amendment of their records and then seek judicial review of an agency\u2019s refusal to amend \u201cany portion thereof which the individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(d)(2)(B). Campeau has never alleged why he believes it is necessary to add his so called \u201cindenture\u201d to his social security records in order to make them accurate or complete. To the contrary, as explained above, he has not provided a copy of the \u201cindenture\u201d or otherwise alleged its contents. As also explained above, the little information that Campeau has provided suggests (though we do not decide on this limited record) that his requested amendment may be in furtherance of a tax liability avoidance theory that other courts have rejected as \u201cfrivolous.\u201d <em>E.g., Crummey, </em>794 F.Supp.2d at 56 (granting summary judgment on similar Privacy Act claim where plaintiff \u201cfailed to present even a scintilla of competent evidence suggesting that the SSA\u2019s records are, in actuality, materially inaccurate or incomplete\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Although this case is at the pleading stage, Campeau still was required to allege at least some facts plausibly suggesting that his records are inaccurate or incomplete without the \u201cindenture\u201d he seeks to add. Campeau has not alleged any such facts and \u2014 even though the SSA raised this point in its motion to dismiss, and even though Campeau sought to amend his complaint as noted above \u2014 he still has raised nothing suggesting that he could do so in the future. Thus, we are satisfied both that Campeau has failed to state a claim in this regard and that any amendment would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Campeau\u2019s final claim is that the SSA violated 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(d)(1) and 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 401.40 when it allegedly refused to allow him to inspect his records in person at its headquarters and a field office in Baltimore. Campeau seeks damages for this alleged refusal but, once again, he has not alleged the requisite \u201cadverse effect.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(1)(D). Campeau argues that lack of access to his records itself constitutes an adverse effect, but that reasoning reads the independent \u201cadverse effect\u201d requirement out of the statute. Moreover, the Privacy Act does not authorize damages for denial-of-access claims in the first place and provides instead only for injunctive relief. <em>See, e.g., Rouse v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of State, </em>567 F.3d 408, 414 n. 4 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">Campeau has not requested an injunction requiring the SSA to permit him to inspect his records at its offices as he allegedly attempted to do. (ECF No. 1 at 6-7.) He did request an injunction requiring the SSA to produce his records \u201cin open court\u201d in order to \u201cmake it known\u201d whether they include his \u201cindenture\u201d and to provide him with certified copies. <em>(Id. </em>at 6 1\u00cd1IVL3-4.) The District Court concluded that Campeau failed to exhaust this claim as well. Once again, however, we conclude instead that Campeau failed to allege any entitlement to statutory relief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>and we thus need not resolve the exhaustion-related issues noted in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">The Privacy Act permits injunctive relief when an agency <em>\u201crefuses to comply </em>with an <em>individual request </em>[to review the record and obtain copies] under subsection (d)(1) of this section.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Campeau has not alleged that the SSA \u201crefused to comply\u201d with any \u201cindividual request\u201d other than that it allow him to inspect his records at the SSA\u2019s offices. His brief on appeal too argues only that the Privacy Act permits \u201cdirect access to the records at their source.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 5.) But Campeau did not request an injunction requiring the SSA to provide him with such access, and he has not stated any statutory basis for an injunction requiring the SSA to produce his records to him in any other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">For these reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-10\">. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the dismissal of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) de novo, and we consider whether, accepting the factual allegations in the complaint as true, the complaint states a plausible entitlement to relief. <em>See Mayer v. Belichick, </em>605 F.3d 223, 229-30 (3d Cir.2010). In this case, the SSA attached evidentiary material to its motion to dismiss, and the District Court expressly relied on that material without converting the SSA's motion into one for summary judgment as required by Rule 12(d). The District Court's failure to do so is subject to harmless error analysis, however, <em>see SBRMCOA, LLC v. Bayside Resort, Inc., </em>707 F.3d 267, 272-73 (3d Cir.2013), and its error was harmless because Cam-peau's complaint is subject to dismissal on its face. We further note that, although Cam-peau argued below that the District Court was required to convert the SSA\u2019s motion into one for summary judgment before considering its evidence, he has not raised that issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b66-7\">. We need not address whether the Privacy Act's statute of limitations is jurisdictional because, even if it is not, Campeau has not stated a basis to equitably toll this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b66-15\">. As the District Court noted, district courts in this circuit have reached different conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>sions about whether the Privacy Act exhaustion requirement we identified in <em>Quinn v. Stone, </em>978 F.2d 126, 137-38 (3d Cir.1992), is jurisdictional. Even if the exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional, we can reach the sufficiency of Campeau\u2019s complaint without impermissibly exercising \"hypothetical jurisdiction\u201d because the exhaustion requirement\u2019s jurisdictional character would derive from a statute and not from Article III. <em>See Jordon v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>424 F.3d 320, 325 n. 8 (3d Cir.2005). Thus, we need not address the parties\u2019 exhaustion-related disputes, including their factual dispute over whether the SSA ever received Campeau\u2019s request for amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b68-7\">. The SSA submitted a declaration by Stephen Patrick, which in turn attached (1) a September 16, 2011 e-mail from Campeau to an SSA office requesting assistance in obtaining in-person access to his file, and (2) a September 30, 2011 e-mail from the SSA to Campeau in response notifying him of the proper procedures for obtaining copies of his records, including payment of the applicable fees. (ECF No. 5-2.) Patrick\u2019s declaration also states that the SSA has no record of any further communications from Campeau. In his briefs below, Campeau asserted that he might not have received the SSA\u2019s e-mail but that, even if he did, the e-mail does not address his request for an in person inspection. He did not claim to have followed the procedures outlined in that email or to have paid the applicable fees. We need not address this issue, however, or the parties\u2019 other exhaustion-related disputes regarding whether Cam-peau visited the Reistertown Road field office or whether his alleged request to review his records there complied with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(d)(l) and 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 401.40.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
