Lay appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas petition. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the denial of a section 2241 petition de novo, <em>see Reynolds v. Thomas, </em>603 F.3d 1144, 1148 (9th Cir.2010), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Setser v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1463, 182 L.Ed.2d 455 (2012), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-23\">Lay contends that he is entitled to credit toward his federal sentence for the time he spent in federal custody pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum. The argument is unpersuasive because he remained subject to the state\u2019s jurisdiction during the time he spent in federal custody pursuant to the writ. <em>See Taylor v. Reno, </em>164 F.3d 440, 445 (9th Cir.1998). The record reflects that the credits earned during that period were applied to Lay\u2019s state sentence, and therefore they cannot be credited towards his federal sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b); <em>Allen v. Crabtree, </em>153 F.3d 1030, 1033 (9th Cir.1998) (section 3585(b) disallows double crediting for time served).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-24\">Lay also contends that the district court erred when it held his habeas corpus petition to the \u201chigh standard applied to legal findings of lawyers.\u201d The record does not support this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b844-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
