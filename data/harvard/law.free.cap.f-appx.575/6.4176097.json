Mar. 18, 2013). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case. Because Chen does not challenge the denial of <em>sua sponte </em>reopening, we do not address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-20\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen and reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam); <em>Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006). An alien must file a motion to reconsider within 30 days of the decision for which review is sought, while a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(B), (7)(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2), (c)(2). The BIA may deny reopening if the alien fails to demonstrate her <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for the underlying relief sought or does not present new, previously unavailable evidence. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c); <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-21\">To the extent Chen requested reconsideration of the agency\u2019s denial of cancellation of removal, by arguing that the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) mischaracterized her testimony as inconsistent, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion as untimely because Chen filed it after the 30-day filing deadline. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-22\">Although Chen\u2019s motion to reopen was timely, it did not present material, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>previously unavailable evidence. Her explanation, that her apparently inconsistent testimony regarding her U.S. residences was a result of her misunderstanding of the questions posed, is an argument, not evidence. <em>See Pretzantzin v. Holder, </em>736 F.3d 641, 651 (2d Cir.2013) (stating that \u201cthe arguments of counsel are not evidence\u201d). Moreover, it is an explanation that could have been provided to the IJ or on appeal to the BIA, and, therefore, was previously available. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Nor was Chen\u2019s evidence of her continuous residence in the United States new or previously unavailable, as it predated her 2011 merits hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Regarding her request to pursue an I-601A provisional waiver of inadmissibility, Chen submitted evidence that she had an approved visa petition and that qualifying relatives would suffer hardship if she were removed. As the BIA explained, however, there were additional waiver requirements that Chen did not address. With respect to an alien in removal proceedings, a waiver is available only if the agency had administratively closed proceedings, instead of entering a removal order; here, Chen was ordered removed. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.7(e)(3)(ii), (4)(v) (2014); <em>see also </em>78 Fed.Reg. 536, 545 (Jan. 3, 2013). Moreover, Chen did not demonstrate that she had a pending case before the Department of State based on her approved visa petition, a prerequisite for the waiver. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.7(e)(3)(v). Because Chen\u2019s removal order rendered her ineligible for the waiver, she did not establish her <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for the relief sought, as required for reopening. <em>See Abudu, </em>485 U.S. at 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Nothing in this decision precludes Chen from asking the Government to file a joint motion to reopen and terminate her proceedings in order to give her the benefit of applying for the I-601A waiver and consular processing, particularly given that the Government\u2019s agreement to remand Chen\u2019s prior petition under <em>In re Immigration Petitions for Review Pending in U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, </em>702 F.3d 160 (2d Cir.2012), indicates that removal is not forthcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
