Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and that his claims for injunctive relief were not otherwise cognizable. On appeal, we confine our review to the issues raised in the Appellant\u2019s brief. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b). Because Horsey\u2019s informal brief does not challenge the basis for the district court\u2019s disposition, Horsey has forfeited appellate review of the court\u2019s order. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
