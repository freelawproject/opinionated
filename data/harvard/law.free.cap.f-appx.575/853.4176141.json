Silvestro argues the district court erred in denying a so-called \u201csafety-valve\u201d reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, applying three sentencing enhancements, and varying upward from his guideline sentencing range by two years. Upon review, we reject Silvestro\u2019s arguments and affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">\n<em>A. Denial of a Safety-Valve Reduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b882-13\">Under certain circumstances, a district court can sentence a defendant without regard to a statutory minimum. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(l)-(5). In the instant case, Silvestro was subject to a 10-year statutory minimum sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and Silvestro argues the district court erred by not disregarding this statutory minimum under \u00a7 5C1.2(a). However, Silvestro was not eligible for safety-valve relief because he participated in a violent kidnapping and thereby aided and abetted the use of violence. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5C1.2(a)(2) (allowing a court to impose a sentence without regard to a statutory minimum only if, inter alia, the court finds that the defendant did not use violence in connection with the offense); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 5C1.2 cmt. n. 4 (\u201c[T]he term \u2018defendant,\u2019 as used in subsection (a)(2), limits the accountability of the defendant to his own conduct and conduct that he aided or abetted .... \u201d). Moreover, the kidnapping resulted in a death, which also precluded the district court from disregarding the statutory minimum. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5C1.2(a)(3) (requiring that \u201cthe offense did not result in death ... to any person\u201d). For these reasons, the district court did not err in denying safety-valve relief to Silvestro.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-14\">\n<em>B. Application of Sentencing Enhancements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b882-15\">Silvestro also challenges the district court\u2019s application of three sentencing enhancements. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2D 1.1(b)(1) (two-level enhancement for possession of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>dangerous weapon), (b)(2) (two-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the defendant used violence\u201d), (b)(12) (two-level enhancement if \u201cthe defendant maintained a premises for the purpose of manufacturing or distributing a controlled substance\u201d). However, even with these enhancements, Silvestro\u2019s base offense level resulted in a guideline range that was below his 10-year statutory minimum under \u00a7 846, and the statutory minimum therefore become his guideline range. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5Gl.l(b). Consequently, and in light of our conclusion that Silvestro was not entitled to safety-valve relief, Silvestro\u2019s sentence was not affected by any of the enhancements he challenges, and any error the district court made in them application was therefore harmless under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">\n<em>C. Application of an Upward Variance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Finally, Silvestro challenges the reasonableness of his sentence, drawing our attention to the fact that it falls two years above his guideline range. However, under the totality of the circumstances, we are not \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the [sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d and \u201carriv[ed] at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of th[is] case.\u201d <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). Accordingly, we cannot vacate Silvestro\u2019s sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">While we take note of the fact that Silvestro\u2019s sentence was above his guideline range, \u201c[sentences outside the guidelines are not presumed to be unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2009). In this case, the variance the district court imposed served to alleviate potential sentencing disparities under \u00a7 3553(a)(6) with respect to Silvestro\u2019s coconspirators, in comparison to whom the district court observed Silvestro received only a \u201cmodest\u201d increase. Moreover, the drug conspiracy to which Silvestro pleaded guilty involved a kidnapping and a killing, bearing on the seriousness of the offense under \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B). The district court was not unreasonable in concluding that the statutory minimum of ten years did not adequately take into account Silvestro\u2019s uncharged participation in the kidnapping. Finally, although Silvestro\u2019s sentence was above his guideline range, it fell well below the statutory maximum of life imprisonment, which is an indication of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 751-52 (11th Cir.2006). Thus, under the totality of the circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a substantively unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">In light of the foregoing, we reject each of Silvestro\u2019s contentions and conclude that the district court committed no error or abuse of discretion warranting reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-10\">. When evaluating a sentence on appeal, \"[w]e review the district court's factual findings for clear error and the court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. McGuinness, </em>451 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2006). We review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion, asking first whether the district court committed any significant procedural error and then evaluating the sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness under the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v.
