R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b750-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">In these consolidated petitions for review, Khem Chander, a native and citizen of India, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) (No. 12-73316), and the BIA\u2019s order denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings (No. 13-71361). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039-40 (9th Cir.2010). We review for abuse of discretion the agency\u2019s denial of humanitarian asylum, <em>Belayneh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 488, 491 (9th Cir.2000), and the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 986 (9th Cir.2010). We deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on the finding that Chander\u2019s testimony was inherently implausible, and based on the inconsistencies between Chander\u2019s testimony and his brother\u2019s affidavit. <em>See Shrestha, </em>590 F.3d at 1048 (adverse credibility determination was reasonable under the totality of circumstances). Chander does not challenge the agency\u2019s implausibility finding. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived). Contrary to Chander\u2019s contention, the agency considered his explanations for the inconsistencies, and those explanations do not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Zamanov v. Holder, </em>649 F.3d 969, 974 (9th Cir.2011). In the absence of credible testimony, Chander\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). Furthermore, in light of the adverse credibility determination, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying humanitarian asylum. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1)(iii) (requiring showing of past persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">Chander\u2019s CAT claim also fails because it is based on the same statements found not credible, and he does not point to any other evidence in the record to compel the finding that it is more likely than not he would be tortured by or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official in India. <em>See Shrestha, 590 </em>F.3d at 1048-49. Chander fails to overcome the presumption that the agency considered all the evidence. <em>See Larita-Martinez v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1092, 1095-96 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">We do not reach Chander\u2019s arguments regarding corroboration or the reasonableness of relocation. <em>See Najmabadi, </em>597 F.3d at 986 (this court\u2019s review is limited to the grounds relied upon by the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">Finally, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chander\u2019s untimely motion to reopen. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2); <em>Goel v. Gonzales, </em>490 F.3d 735, 738 (9th Cir.2007) (polygraph evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>did not support motion to reopen because it was not previously unavailable).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b750-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
