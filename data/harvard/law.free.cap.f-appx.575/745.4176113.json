We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act, <em>Shres-tha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir.2010), and review de novo claims of due process violations in immigration proceedings, <em>Zetino v. Holder, </em>622 F.3d 1007, 1011 (9th Cir.2010). We grant the petition for review, and we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-23\">Substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s reliance on Xue\u2019s inability to recall the days of the week on which specific events occurred. <em>See Ren v. Holder, </em>648 F.3d 1079, 1085-86 (9th Cir.2011) (inconsistency regarding day incident occurred was \u201cmanifestly trivial\u201d and could \u201cnot form a basis for an adverse credibility determination\u201d). Substantial evidence also does not support the BIA\u2019s reliance on Xue\u2019s omission of being taken to a court because, contrary to the BIA\u2019s finding, Xue was never asked about this omission. <em>See Soto-Olarte v. Holder, </em>555 F.3d 1089, 1092 (9th Cir.2009) (IJ must provide opportunity to explain any inconsistencies that form basis for denying claim). Finally, the inconsistency regarding whether the six signatories on a witness statement were arrested with Xue does not support the adverse credibility finding. <em>See Ren, </em>648 F.3d at 1087 (finding \u201cinitial error\u201d was \u201ca quickly-corrected innocent mistake\u201d). Accordingly, we grant the petition for review and remand Xue\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims on an open record for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam); <em>Soto-Olarte, </em>555 F.3d at 1095-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b773-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
