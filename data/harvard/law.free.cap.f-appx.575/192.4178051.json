We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Osore was found removable for having been convicted of two crimes of moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of conduct, Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(ii). Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (2012), we lack jurisdiction to review the final order of removal of an alien convicted of certain enumerated crimes, including two or more crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal conduct, for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) (2012). We retain jurisdiction \u201cto review factual determinations that trigger the jurisdiction-stripping provision, such as whether [Osore] [i]s an alien and whether []he has been convicted of\u2019 two or more crimes involving moral turpitude. <em>Ramtulla v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 202, 203 (4th Cir.2002). Once we confirm these two factual determinations, then we may only consider \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>see Mbea v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 276, 278 n. 1 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Osore does not challenge the finding that he is an alien and that he was convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Thus, we may only consider constitutional claims or questions of law. While Osore attempts to raise reviewable claims, we conclude that none of the claims have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">Osore challenges that part of the order directing that he be removed to Switzerland. We note that Osore admitted he was a citizen of Switzerland and designated Switzerland as the country of removal. After Osore tried to retract his declaration, the immigration judge directed that Kenya be the alternate country of removal. This is entirely consistent with the statute. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(2)(A)(i), (D) (2012). We further conclude that there is no merit to Osore\u2019s claim that he is not subject to removal proceedings because he was admitted under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(g)(iv) (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\"> While Osore may be presently challenging the convictions in state court, there is no indication that the convictions have been vacated or otherwise called into question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
