(\u201cDelek\u201d) terminated Steve Smith (\u201cSmith\u201d) for \u201cunacceptable performance and insubordination.\u201d Appellants United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union and its Local 202, AFL-CIO (collectively the \u201cUnion\u201d) filed a grievance. Delek and the Union submitted the issue to arbitration. Arbitrator Daniel Jennings (\u201cArbitrator Jennings\u201d) determined that just cause existed to suspend \u2014 but not discharge\u2014 Smith. The Union brought suit to enforce the arbitration award, and Delek responded with its own suit seeking vacatur of the arbitration award. After the cases were consolidated, both parties moved for summary judgment. Finding that the arbitrator exceeded his authority, the district court denied the Union\u2019s motion for summary judgment, granted Delek\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and vacated the arbitration award. For the reasons stated herein, we reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of Delek, and render judgment in favor of the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b359-16\">Delek operates an oil refinery in Tyler, Texas that produces gasoline, diesel fuel, airplane fuel, and other petroleum products. Smith had been an employee of Delek for approximately nineteen years. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>At the time of his termination, he worked as a Pumper/Blender, a position he had held for approximately twelve years. Smith\u2019s responsibilities included transferring crude oil and refined petroleum products through pipelines to and from the operating units and to a variety of storage tanks. Prior to the incident that precipitated Smith\u2019s termination, Smith had four separate disciplinary incidents related to mishandling of oil and petroleum products. First, on December 4, 2005, Smith spilled 100 barrels of product on the ground. Then, on January 18, 2006, Smith spilled another 800 barrels of oil. Frank Simmons, Operations Manager at the time, warned Smith that future mishandling incidents would result in further discipline up to and including discharge. On September 3, 2006, Smith spilled 120 barrels of oil onto the ground, and failed to report the spill to his supervisor. Delek suspended Smith without pay for four days on September 8, 2006, and warned him that \u201c[a]ny additional performance or safety issues will result in immediate separation of employment.\u201d Finally, on December 12, 2006, Smith improperly transferred product between tanks, jeopardizing the quality of military-grade jet fuel. Although Delek initially discharged Smith, it later rescinded the termination and issued him a warning on December 20, 2006 that \u201c[a]ny future performance or safety issues of any nature or severity w[ould] result in immediate separation of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Nearly two years later, a fifth incident led to Smith\u2019s termination at issue in this appeal. On October 27, 2008, Smith transferred 12,959 barrels of \u201cslop oil\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from one tank to the crude oil unit. Delek alleged that the transfer was in direct violation of a \u201cDaily Report\u201d instructing employees not to transfer slop oil on that day. As a result of Smith\u2019s actions, Delek discharged Smith on November 3, 2008 for \u201cunacceptable performance and insubordination.\u201d The Union filed a grievance on Smith\u2019s behalf on November 10, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) between Delek and the Union, the parties submitted the dispute over Smith\u2019s discharge to arbitration. According to its terms, the CBA provided the arbitrator \u201cjurisdiction and authority to interpret and apply the provisions in the determination of such grievances but he shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to or alter in any way the provisions of this Contract.\u201d The CBA further provided: \u201cThe Union recognizes that the right of Management is to manage the plant, to hire, fire and discipline for just cause ... and to perform other managerial functions.\u201d The parties selected Arbitrator Jennings to hear the grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Delek contended at arbitration that it had just cause to fire Smith because the Daily Report in effect on October 27, 2008 directed Smith not to transfer slop oil. During the arbitration hearing, Smith contested the authenticity of Delek\u2019s Daily Report and produced a conflicting version that directed Smith to transfer slop oil into the crude unit. After Delek investigated the conflicting Daily Reports at Arbitrator Jennings\u2019s request, Arbitrator Jennings determined that Delek had failed to establish the authenticity of its proffered version. As a result, the arbitrator concluded that Delek lacked just cause to discharge Smith, but found that Delek \u201chad sufficient and reasonable cause to discipline [Smith] for not contacting his supervisor before pumping 12,959 barrels of slop oil from tank 162 into the crude unit.\u201d Although Arbitrator Jennings recognized Delek\u2019s December 20, 2006 disciplinary warning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>that \u201cany future performance or safety issues of any nature or severity will result in immediate separation of employment,\u201d he \u201cdetermine[d] that a suspension of two months without pay [was] sufficient discipline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">After the arbitrator issued his opinion and award on March 7, 2011, Delek notified the Union that it did not intend to abide by the award. The Union then sued in federal court seeking enforcement of the arbitration award under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, and Delek filed suit seeking vacatur of the award. The district court consolidated the cases and both parties moved for summary judgment. The magistrate judge determined that the arbitrator \u201cimplicitly found just cause for discharge\u201d and therefore \u201cany remedial authority to determine a \u2018proper remedy/ pursuant to the issues submitted to him by the parties for arbitration, was not triggered.\u201d Finding that the arbitrator \u201cexceeded his authority,\u201d the magistrate judge recommended that the district court resolve the motions for summary judgment in Delek\u2019s favor and vacate the arbitration award. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s findings and conclusions, holding that \u201c[t]he arbitrator exceeded his authority as set by an arguable construction and application of the CBA\u201d and that \u201c[t]he arbitrator made an implicit finding of just cause for discharge and improperly fashioned an alternate remedy.\u201d The Union timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The Union appeals the district court\u2019s final decision on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment. Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">This Court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Albemarle Corp. v.

Enter. Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960). \u201c[Wjhere the arbitrator exceeds the express limitations of his contractual mandate, judicial deference is at an end.\u201d <em>Delta Queen, </em>889 F.2d at 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The question before this Court is whether Arbitrator Jennings acted within the ambit of his authority, as set forth by an arguable construction of the CBA, when he found cause to suspend, but not discharge, Smith. To answer this question, we must decide whether Arbitrator Jennings\u2019s finding \u2014 that Smith failed to contact his supervisor before pumping slop oil \u2014 left him no choice under the CBA but to affirm De-lek\u2019s decision to terminate Smith and, thus, no authority to fashion an alternative remedy. Relying upon our decision in <em>DuPont, </em>the district court vacated the arbitration award. The district court reasoned that the arbitrator\u2019s language resulted in an implicit finding of just cause to discharge such that he was not authorized to fashion a less drastic remedy. On the facts of this case, however, we hold that <em>DuPont </em>does not support vacatur of the award here. Instead, <em>Albemarle, </em>decided after the district court rendered judgment, compels this Court to affirm the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">To better understand the <em>DuPont </em>decision, we must first discuss our opinion in <em>Delta Queen. </em>In <em>Delta Queen, </em>a CBA provided that \u201c[n]o Officer shall be discharged except for <em>proper cause </em>such as, but not limited to, inefficiency, insubordination, <em>carelessness, </em>or disregard of the rules of the Company.\u201d 889 F.2d at 601. The arbitrator found that the discharged employee had been \u201cgrossly careless,\u201d but nevertheless ordered him reinstated because the employee had also been the victim of disparate treatment. <em>Id. </em>As here, the employer challenged the arbitration award, alleging \u201cthat the arbitrator, having found gross carelessness, [was] foreclosed from awarding a remedy at odds with the company-imposed discipline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court agreed and stated that, \u201c[i]f a collective bargaining agreement defines \u2018proper cause\u2019 to include a nonexhaustive list of offenses, an arbitrator cannot ignore the natural consequence of his finding that a listed offense was committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 604. The CBA clearly stated that \u201cproper cause\u201d for discharge included \u201ccarelessness\u201d and so the arbitrator, having explicitly found \u201cgross carelessness,\u201d impliedly found cause to discharge under the CBA. <em>Id. </em>The CBA therefore \u201cproscribed the arbitrator from reinstating the discharged employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(\u201c[Wjhere an arbitrator fails to make an express finding of proper cause, he nevertheless will be so bound if he finds that the employee committed certain underlying acts that constitute proper cause under the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">The <em>DuPont </em>opinion drew support from <em>Delta Queen. </em>The CBA in <em>DuPont </em>provided that \u201cno employee will be discharged ... except for just cause.\u201d 968 F.2d at 459. The parties had agreed that discharge was available only if DuPont proved that its employees used marijuana while on its premises. <em>Id. </em>at 458. Although the arbitrator found that DuPont had proven as much, the arbitrator determined that discharge was inappropriate and instead ordered reinstatement, rehabilitative treatment, and drug testing. <em>Id. </em>Relying upon <em>Delta Queen, </em>this Court held that while the arbitrator did not explicitly find that the employer had just cause to discharge the employees, the arbitrator\u2019s language nevertheless constituted an im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>plicit finding of just cause to discharge. <em>Id. </em>at 458-59. And having implicitly found just cause to discharge, the arbitrator exceeded his authority by fashioning an alternative remedy. <em>Id. </em>at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Unlike under the CBAs in <em>Delta Queen </em>and <em>DuPont, </em>discharge was not the only available sanction under the CBA at issue in <em>Albemarle. </em>The CBA in <em>Albemarle </em>provided that \u201cthe suspending, disciplining and discharging [of] employees for cause ... are all rights solely of the [employer].\u201d 703 F.3d at 823. Relying upon this provision, we distinguished the CBA from those in <em>Delta Queen </em>and <em>DuPont:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">We do not accept, as Albemarle advances, that the arbitrator in this case was similarly constrained by the CBA to require the Grievants\u2019 terminations [as in <em>Delta Queen </em>and <em>DuPont </em>]. The CBA does not make clear that any violation of safety rules is an offense requiring discharge. Article III provides that Albemarle, \u201cfor cause,\u201d may not only \u201cdischarg[e],\u201d but also \u201csuspend[]\u201d or \u201cdisciplin[e]\u201d its employees. Thus, by its terms, the CBA contemplates situations in which a finding of \u201ccause\u201d could support lesser sanctions than termination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 825 (first alteration added) (citing <em>Weber Aircraft, </em>253 F.3d at 824-25). In fashioning a lesser sanction, the arbitrator \u201cmade no implicit or explicit finding that Albemarle had entertained cause enough to discharge the Grievants; rather, he explicitly concluded the opposite, that \u2018discharge was not appropriate,\u2019 and that there was instead \u2018cause for the Employer to issue discipline.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Because \u201cthe CBA contemplate[d] situations in which a finding of \u2018cause\u2019 could support lesser sanctions than termination,\u201d it was within the ambit of the arbitrator\u2019s authority to fashion this alternative remedy despite having found that the employees violated a safety procedure. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Weber Aircraft, </em>253 F.3d at 824). Accordingly, we rejected the employer\u2019s argument that the arbitrator overstepped his authority by reinstating the discharged employees despite having found \u201ccause\u201d in the form of a violation of the company\u2019s safety procedures. <em>Id. </em>at 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">We likewise reject Delek\u2019s argument, that Arbitrator Jennings exceeded his authority by fashioning an alternative remedy, because the distinguishing facts in <em>Al-bemarle </em>similarly distinguish the present matter from <em>Delta Queen </em>and <em>DuPont. </em>Whereas the CBAs in <em>Delta Queen </em>and <em>DuPont </em>contemplated discharge as the only available sanction upon a finding of cause, the CBA here \u2014 like that in <em>Albe-marle </em>\u2014 contemplated both discipline and discharge as available sanctions. <em>Compare Albemarle, </em>703 F.3d at 824, <em>with Delta Queen, </em>889 F.2d at 601, <em>and DuPont, </em>968 F.2d at 459. Providing for the right to \u201cfire and discipline for just cause,\u201d the CBA between Delek and the Union did not clearly mandate that any performance or safety issues required discharge. <em>See Al-bemarle, </em>703 F.3d at 826 (holding that the availability of discharge, suspension, and discipline \u201cfor cause\u201d did not \u201cmake clear that any violation of safety rules is an offense requiring discharge\u201d). Rather, \u201cby its terms, the CBA [between Delek and the Union] contemplate^] situations in which a finding of \u2018cause\u2019 could support lesser sanctions than terminations.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">Thus, whereas the arbitrators in <em>Delta Queen </em>and <em>DuPont </em>were powerless to fashion lesser alternative remedies, <em>see Al-bemarle, </em>703 F.3d at 825, Arbitrator Jennings had authority under the CBA to fashion an alternative remedy \u2014 despite finding that Smith failed to contact his supervisor before transferring slop oil\u2014 because \u201clesser alternative sanction[s]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>could \u201cbe arguably inferred from [the] CBA,\u201d <em>see id. </em>(quoting <em>Weber Aircraft, </em>258 F.3d at 825). In fashioning a remedy, Arbitrator Jennings \u201cmade no implicit or explicit finding that [Delek] had ... cause enough to discharge [Smith]; rather, he explicitly concluded the opposite, that discharge was not appropriate, and that there was instead cause for [Delek] to issue discipline.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 824 (citation omitted). As in <em>Albemarle, </em>then, the provision for sanctions less than termination and the arbitrator\u2019s explicit conclusion that discharge was not appropriate compels us to affirm the arbitral award. Arbitrator Jennings did not overstep his authority when he fashioned an alternative remedy upon finding that Smith failed to contact his supervisor before transferring slop oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Delek\u2019s December 20, 2006 warning\u2014 that \u201c[a]ny future performance or safety issues of any nature or severity w[ould] result in immediate separation of employment\u201d \u2014 does not suggest otherwise. This Court has previously held that \u201cwhere an arbitrator fails to make an express finding of proper cause, he nevertheless will be so bound if he finds that the employee committed certain underlying acts that constitute proper cause <em>under the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d Delta Queen, </em>889 F.2d at 604 (emphasis added). But, the CBA here does not define \u201ccause\u201d to discharge. \u201cHad [Delek] wished to remove doubt as to whether [performance issues like Smith\u2019s] met the criteria for cause to terminate, it had only to bargain for a specific list of violations that will be considered sufficient grounds for discharge in the CBA.\u201d <em>See Albemarle, </em>703 F.3d at 826 (citations and internal quotations marks omitted). Delek did not do so, but simply issued a warning and now contends that its warning to Smith constituted a binding \u201clast chance agreement\u201d (\u201cLCA\u201d) that supplements the CBA. <em>See, e.g., Cont\u2019l Airlines, Inc. v. Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int\u2019l, </em>555 F.3d 399, 406 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cAn LCA is a supplement to the CBA, and its terms are just as binding on an arbitrator as those of the CBA: Unambiguous provisions of an LCA may not be ignored.\u201d (citation omitted)). Although the parties produced the warning to the arbitrator, who made specific reference to it in his award, Delek did not advance its LCA argument during arbitration. Because De-lek raises this argument for the first time in federal court, we decline to consider it and decline to treat Delek\u2019s warning to Smith as a binding supplement to the CBA. <em>See Brook v. Peak Int\u2019l, Ltd., </em>294 F.3d 668, 674 (5th Cir.2002) (\u201cIt is well settled that a party may not sit idle through an arbitration procedure and then collaterally attack the procedure on grounds not raised before the arbitrators when the result turns out to be adverse.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>see also Int\u2019l Chem. Workers Union v. Columbian Chems. Co., </em>331 F.3d 491, 499 (5th Cir.2003) (declining to accept a company\u2019s argument that it did not advance during arbitration but raised for the first time in federal court).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Despite Delek\u2019s warning to Smith, the CBA did not establish criteria for determining cause to discharge. Explicating cause, then, was the arbitrator\u2019s charge. <em>Albemarle, </em>703 F.3d at 826 (citation omitted). In carrying out that charge, Arbitrator Jennings found cause sufficient to suspend but not to discharge. With either sanction available under an arguable construction of the CBA, Arbitrator Jennings\u2019s finding that Smith failed to contact his supervisor before pumping slop oil did not leave discharge as the only available sanction under the CBA. Accordingly, we cannot say that Arbitrator Jennings exceeded his authority in finding suspension appropriate, \u201clet alone that he was not \u2018even arguably construing or applying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>contract and acting within the scope of his authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 826 (quoting <em>Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S. at 38, 108 S.Ct. 364). We can go no further in evaluating the arbitration award.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">We conclude that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority when he fashioned an alternative remedy. We REVERSE the district court\u2019s award of summary judgment in favor of Delek vacating the arbitration award, RENDER judgment in favor of the Union, and AFFIRM the arbitration award.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Local 900 of Int\u2019l Chem. Workers Union, AFL-CIO </em>968 F.2d 456, 458 (5th Cir.1992) (\u201c[W]here an arbitrator implicitly finds that just cause exists, he need not recite the operative phrase \u2018just cause.\u2019\u201d); <em>Delta Queen Steamboat Co. v.

Because the majority\u2019s analysis unnecessarily extends this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Al-bemarle Corp. v. United Steel Workers ex rel. AOWU Local 103, </em>703 F.3d 821 (5th Cir.2013), to effectively abrogate our prior holdings on implicit findings of just cause, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">The arbitrator\u2019s opinion stated that, after numerous prior infractions, Delek issued Smith a final warning that \u201c[a]ny future performance or safety issues of any nature or severity will result in immediate separation of employment.\u201d It later noted that, after his latest infraction, \u201cthe Company had sufficient and reasonable cause to discipline [Smith] for not contacting his supervisor before pumping the 12,959 barrels of slop oil from tank 162 into the crude unit.\u201d Nothing more is required for us to hold that the arbitrator implicitly found just cause for termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Albemarle </em>is misplaced. The chemicals manufacturer in <em>Albemarle </em>terminated two employees for violating safety protocols. <em>Id. </em>at 823. As the employees were leaving work after completing their shift, they noticed liquid leaking from a building. They attempted to reach their foreman by phone for five minutes, and then reported the leak to the security guard on duty, who was able to reach their foreman by radio. But because company protocol required employees to <em>immediately </em>report chemical spills to supervision or security, the company terminated the employees a week later. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Albemarle </em>court noted that \u201c[t]he arbitrator reasoned ... \u2018that discharge was not appropriate\u2019 because the Grievants had no prior safety violations, were exiting the facility after completing their day\u2019s work, and succeeded in notifying the proper persons of the spill.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 824. The court also noted that \u201c[t]he arbitrator de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>termined the five minute delay [in reporting the spill] did not measurably increase the leak\u2019s costs to the Company.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">A comparison with our facts reveals why <em>Albemarle </em>is inapposite. As noted above, Smith\u2019s conduct affirmatively caused the erroneous slop oil transfer, which affected Delek\u2019s profits and costs. And unlike the workers in <em>Albemarle, </em>the October 27, 2008 transfer was not Smith\u2019s first transgression, but instead came after several prior incidents that resulted in two final warnings and a suspension. Unlike in <em>Al-bemarle, </em>Smith\u2019s accident-prone history and Delek\u2019s repeated attempts to discipline and warn him provide the requisite backdrop for holding that the arbitrator\u2019s finding of just cause to discipline was also an implicit finding of just cause to terminate. Instead, this case\u2019s facts are closer to those in <em>DuPont, Delta Queen, </em>and other cases where this court found the arbitrator to have exceeded his authority by fashioning an alternative remedy after implicitly finding just cause to terminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">This court has rejected previous attempts to narrowly construe, as the majority does here, DuPont\u2019s and <em>Delta Queen\u2019s </em>holdings. <em>See Am. Eagle Airlines, Inc. v. Air Line Pilots Assoc., Int\u2019l, </em>343 F.3d 401, 410 (5th Cir.2003) (\u201c[T]here is simply nothing in the language of <em>DuPont </em>or <em>Delta Queen </em>to suggest that these holdings were unique to their respective facts.\u201d). And for good reason: adopting such a narrow reading of <em>DuPont </em>and <em>Delta Queen </em>effectively limits those cases\u2019 holdings to their facts, and effectively abrogates circuit precedent while encroaching on any meaningful judicial review that remains over arbitral awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">As did the magistrate judge and district court below, I believe that the arbitrator\u2019s decision here contained an implicit finding of just cause for termination. Consistent with our holdings in <em>DuPont </em>and <em>Delta Queen, </em>I would affirm the district court\u2019s decision to vacate the arbitral award.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
