The district court sentenced Valle to eighty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">On appeal, counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether the district court complied with Fed.R. Crim.P. 11 in accepting Valle\u2019s guilty plea. Valle was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he has not done so. The Government declined to. file a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">Because Valle did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, the adequacy of the Fed.R. Crim.P. 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error only. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 524-27 (4th Cir.2002). To demonstrate plain error, a defendant must show: (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). In the guilty plea context, a defendant meets his burden to establish that a plain error affected his substantial rights by showing a reasonable probability that he would not have pled guilty but for the district court\u2019s Rule 11 omissions. <em>United States v. Mas-senburg, </em>564 F.3d 337, 343 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-17\">Our review of the transcript of the guilty plea hearing leads us to conclude that the district court substantially complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting Valle\u2019s guilty plea and that the court\u2019s omissions did not affect Valle\u2019s substantial rights. Critically, the transcript reveals that the district court ensured that the plea was supported by an independent basis in fact, and that Valle entered the plea knowingly and voluntarily with an understanding of the consequences. <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116, 120 (4th Cir.1991). Accordingly, we discern no plain error in the district court\u2019s acceptance of Valle\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-18\">Additionally, in accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the remainder of the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Valle, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Valle requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Valle.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b207-13\"> Valle was eligible for relief under the safety valve, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) (2012), and thus was not subject to the statutory minimum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
