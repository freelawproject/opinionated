No. 11670, 19 I.L.M. 1501, <em>codified by </em>the International Child Abduction Remedies Act (\u201cICARA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11601 <em>et seq., </em>seeking the return of her child, M.V., to Mexico. In her petition, Plaintiff-Appellee alleged that Defendant-Appellant, M.A.V., unlawfully abducted their minor child when he removed M.V. from Mexico and took M.V. to the United States on June 16, 2012. On August 27, 2013, the district court found that M.V. had been wrongfully removed to the United States and ordered Respondent-Appellant to return M.V. to Mexico. On September 23, 2013, a panel of this Court denied Respondent\u2019s motion for a stay pending appeal. We now affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-22\">The only issue on appeal is whether the district court correctly determined that Mexico, and not the United States, was M.V.\u2019s habitual residence for the purposes of the Convention. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11603(e)(1); Convention art. 3. Respondent raises three points of contention with the district court\u2019s habitual residence determination: (1) whether the district court\u2019s habitual residence determination was supported by sufficient evidence; (2) whether the objective facts of the case unequivocally point to Mexico as M.V.\u2019s new habitual residence; and (3) whether the district court improperly shifted the burden of proof to Respondent to prove that he did not agree to change M.V.\u2019s habitual residence to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-24\">Applying our decision in <em>Larbie v. Larbie, </em>690 F.3d 295 (5th Cir.2012), the district court found that the parties manifested a shared intent for M.V. to abandon the United States as her habitual residence and to remain in Mexico indefinitely. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>district court\u2019s finding that Mexico was M.V.\u2019s habitual residence at the time of MV\u2019s removal is supported by sufficient and compelling evidence. The district court based its decision in part on the credibility of both Petitioner and Respondent, and we afford credibility determinations great deference upon appellate review. <em>See Gitter v. Gitter, </em>396 F.3d 124, 133 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]he court\u2019s task [is] to determine the intentions of the parents as of the last time that their intentions were shared. Clearly, this is a question of fact in which the findings of the district court are entitled to deference.\u201d); <em>Sealed Appellant v. Sealed Appellee, </em>394 F.3d 338, 345 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cWe defer to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations and will not disturb them unless a review of the evidence leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Respondent also argues that the district court improperly placed the burden on him to show that he and Petitioner did not share an intent for M.V. to remain in Mexico, though the law requires the Hague Convention petitioner to carry the burden of proof. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11603(e) (\u201cA petitioner ... shall establish by a preponderance of the evidence ... that the child has been wrongfully removed or retained within the meaning of the Convention.\u201d). When making its shared intent determination, the district court stated, \u201cThe Court relies on Petitioner\u2019s credible testimony that, during Respondent\u2019s August 2011 tripe [sic] to Linares, Mexico, the pair agreed to alter MV\u2019s permanent residence.\u201d After determining that Petitioner had met her burden of proof, only then did the court explain, \u201cAside from Petitioner\u2019s credible testimony, convincing circumstantial evidence exists to demonstrate that, in addition to the parties\u2019 agreement in August 2011 to make Mexico M.V.\u2019s home, Respondent acquiesced to M.V. laying permanent roots there.\u201d The record shows that the district court properly placed the burden of proof on Petitioner to establish MV\u2019s habitual residence, and only viewed the circumstantial evidence of Respondent\u2019s failure to object after the fact as additional proof to support its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Finally, Respondent\u2019s argument that the district court should not have considered the parties\u2019 actions surrounding M.V.\u2019s move to Mexico is unavailing. Since <em>Lar-bie\u2019s </em>shared intent standard is a fact-based inquiry, the district court properly considered the events surrounding the parties\u2019 agreement to move M.V. to Mexico when making its habitual residence determination. <em>See Gitter, </em>396 F.3d at 134 (\u201cIn making [the shared intent] determination the court should look, as always in determining intent, actions as well as declarations.\u201d); <em>see also Larbie, </em>690 F.3d at 310 (noting that the inquiry into a child\u2019s habitual residence \u201cis a fact-intensive determination that necessarily varies with the circumstances of each case\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b535-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.'</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-5\">. The district court did not reach the second step of the Larbie test, namely, \"Absent [the parties'] shared intent, prior habitual residence should be deemed supplanted only where \u2018the objective facts point unequivocally' to this conclusion.\u201d <em>Larbie, </em>690 F.3d at 310-11. Because we affirm this case based on the parties' shared intent, we do not reach this issue either.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
