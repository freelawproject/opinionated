Whether the BIA applied the correct standard of review is a question of law. <em>Perez-Palafox v. Holder, </em>744 F.3d 1138, 1143 (9th Cir.2014); <em>Vitug v. Holder, </em>723 F.3d 1056, 1062-64 (9th Cir.2013). Here, in concluding that Rusello did not demonstrate the requisite hardship to be eligible for special-rule cancellation of removal, the BIA engaged in de novo review of the IJ\u2019s factual findings and conducted its own factfinding in violation of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The BIA rejected the IJ\u2019s finding that Rusello\u2019s information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) experience was outdated, reasoning that Ru-sello did not offer evidence that he had inquired into job opportunities abroad for someone with his qualifications. The BIA, however, did not conclude that the IJ\u2019s factual finding that Rusello\u2019s IT experience was outdated, was clearly erroneous, as it must do before rejecting it. <em>See Ridore v. Holder, </em>696 F.3d 907, 917 (9th Cir.2012); <em>Brezilien v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 403, 414 (9th Cir.2009). The BIA also did not acknowledge the IJ\u2019s factual findings about the emotional, physical, and financial difficulties Rusello experienced as a result of the abuse. Under a clear error standard of review, the BIA cannot ignore the IJ\u2019s factual findings. <em>See Vitug, </em>723 F.3d at 1064; <em>Ridore, </em>696 F.3d at 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Rather than reviewing the IJ\u2019s factual findings, the BIA conducted its own review of the record, expressing doubt that Rusel-lo\u2019s IT experience was outdated in light of the lack of evidence concerning the opportunities available to someone with his qualifications overseas and finding that Rusello \u201chas other transferable job skills.\u201d Moreover, despite acknowledging that the IJ made no factual findings as to the hardship Rusello\u2019s parents would suffer, the BIA also made factual findings on this point. The BIA has no authority to make such factual findings under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3). If the BIA determines that additional factfinding is necessary, the proper course of action is to remand to the IJ to make further factual findings. <em>Ridore, </em>696 F.3d at 919; <em>Rodriguez v. Holder, </em>683 F.3d 1164, 1173 (9th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">Because the BIA applied an incorrect standard of review, we need not reach the remainder of Rusello\u2019s arguments. <em>See Brezilien, </em>569 F.3d at 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">PETITION GRANTED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b818-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
