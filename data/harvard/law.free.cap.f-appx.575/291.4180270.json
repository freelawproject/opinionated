California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Alca-zar Rojas has not filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-23\">The record, however, reflects a clerical error in the written judgment. Alcazar Rojas was indicted for and pleaded guilty to a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 2252(a)(2). However, the written judgment lists the statutes of conviction as \u201c18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.\u201d Accordingly, we REMAND for correction of the clerical error in the written judgment in accordance with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36. <em>See United States v. Higgins, </em>739 F.3d 733, 739 n. 16 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>(May 19, 2014) (No. 13-9678); <em>United States v. Rosales, </em>448 Fed.Appx. 466, 466-67 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
