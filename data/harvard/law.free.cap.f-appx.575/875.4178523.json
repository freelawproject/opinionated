Gilstrap argues that his sentence is proeedurally and substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-24\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential standard for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>Gilstrap\u2019s sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable. Gilstrap argues that the district court impermissibly based its sentence on the seriousness of his original offense, but the district court explained that Gilstrap\u2019s \u201csupervision ha[d] not gone well.\u201d The district court imposed a sentence to deter Gilstrap from committing future similar crimes and punish him for committing the additional offenses of theft by taking, driving with a suspended or revoked registration, and theft by receiving. The district court also explained that it had been more lenient when Gilstrap tested positive for methamphetamine and left the district without permission. And the district court correctly determined that Gilstrap\u2019s offense of theft by taking, for which he faced a sentence of more than one year of imprisonment, <em>see </em>Ga.Code \u00a7 16-8-12(a)(l)(A-D), is a Grade B violation, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2). Although Gil-strap mentioned that the state court might reduce his charge to a misdemeanor, it had not done so before the district court sentenced Gilstrap. The district court reasonably determined that a sentence in the middle of Gilstrap\u2019s advisory guideline range of 12 to 18 months of imprisonment, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 7B 1.4(a)(1), and that was well below his maximum statutory penalty of 24 months, was necessary to satisfy the statutory purposes of sentencing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court did not abuse its discretion by placing more emphasis on Gilstrap\u2019s history and characteristics than his rehabilitation efforts and his gainful employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">We AFFIRM Gilstrap\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
