Cutino appeals <em>pro se </em>from the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) of the Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d) dismissing Mr. Cutino\u2019s opposition to Trademark Application No. 77/325,174 for the mark NIGHTLIFE TELEVISION.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons below, we <em>vacate </em>the Board\u2019s decision and <em>remand </em>for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-22\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b916-23\">Mr. Cutino owns three federal trademark registrations obtained between 1982 and 1995. Registration No. 1207169 covers the mark NEW YORK\u2019S NIGHTLIFE for \u201cMonthly Magazine Dealing Primarily with Things to Do and See and Places to Go in the State of New York.\u201d Registration No. 1324398 covers the mark LONG ISLAND\u2019S NIGHTLIFE for \u201cMonthly Magazine Dealing Primarily with Things to Do and Places to Go in the Long Island and Surrounding Areas and Also Featuring Other Articles of General Interest.\u201d Finally, Registration No. 1908411 covers the mark NIGHTLIFE for \u201cmagazines of general interest\u201d and \u201ctelevision programming services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-24\">On August 22, 2008, Mr. Cutino filed a Notice of Opposition to Application No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>77/325,174 for the mark NIGHTLIFE TELEVISION. The application, filed in 2007 by Nightlife Media, Inc. (\u201cApplicant\u201d), sought to register NIGHTLIFE TELEVISION for the following services:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWV\">Video-on-demand transmission services, Internet broadcasting services, Broadcasting services via mobile and handsets, Satellite television broadcasting, and Television broadcasting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">As grounds for opposition, Mr. Cutino asserted likelihood of confusion under Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act between Applicant\u2019s mark and Mr. Cutino\u2019s three registered marks. Mr. Cutino also asserted deceptiveness and false suggestion under Section 2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Mr. Cutino attached to his Notice of Opposition photocopies of the registration and renewal certificates for his three marks. Mr. Cutino also attached printouts from the PTO\u2019s electronic database showing current status and title, but only for two of his registrations, LONG ISLAND\u2019S NIGHTLIFE and NEW YORK\u2019S NIGHTLIFE. In its answer, Applicant admitted that Mr. Cutino is the owner of the three marks and that the pleaded registrations identify the goods and services alleged by Mr. Cutino in his opposition. Applicant did not counterclaim for cancellation of any of the registrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">Although Mr. Cutino was represented by counsel at the time he filed his opposition, the record shows that his counsel withdrew from representation in March 2011, and Mr. Cutino elected to proceed <em>pro se. </em>Mr. Cutino did not take any testimony or introduce any evidence during his testimony period, which was scheduled to close on November 22, 2011. Mr. Cuti-no served his pretrial disclosures after the testimony period had closed and the October 8, 2011, deadline for pretrial disclosures had passed. Applicant filed a motion to strike as untimely Mr. Cutino\u2019s pretrial disclosures, and a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute under Trademark Rule 2.132(a). In response, Mr. Cutino filed a number of documents and evidence purporting to support his opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">In an order dated May 20, 2012, the Board granted the motion to strike but denied the motion to dismiss. The Board found that Mr. Cutino\u2019s pretrial disclosures were untimely and also failed to comply with Trademark Rule 2.121(e). The Board also found that the materials submitted by Mr. Cutino after the close of his testimony period were untimely and otherwise inadmissible. As a result, the evidence on record supporting Mr. Cuti-no\u2019s opposition consisted only of the records of his pleaded registrations. The Board found that, pursuant to Trademark Rule 2.122(d)(1), only the registrations for the marks LONG ISLAND\u2019S NIGHTLIFE and NEW YORK\u2019S NIGHTLIFE were properly introduced. The Board denied Applicant\u2019s motion to dismiss, finding that the two registrations were sufficient to make out a prima facie case with respect to standing and priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">On July 16 and August 1, 2012, Mr. Cutino submitted additional documents and evidence. Invoking Trademark Rule 2.127(a), the Board granted Applicant\u2019s motions to strike Mr. Cutino\u2019s submissions because Mr. Cutino failed to respond to the motions to strike. The Board noted that, even if not stricken, it would decline to consider Mr. Cutino\u2019s filings because they were not accompanied by certificates of service and they were either late or premature if intended as evidence or Mr. Cutino\u2019s final brief, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">In its final decision dated April 25, 2013, the Board dismissed Mr. Cutino\u2019s opposition. First, the Board ruled that Mr. Cuti-no\u2019s NIGHTLIFE registration was not part of the record because Mr. Cutino <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>failed to submit documents showing the current status and title of the registration as required by the Trademark Rules. The Board also excluded certain submissions made by Mr. Cutino during December 2012 and January 2013 because they were untimely, and concluded that the record in the opposition proceedings consisted solely of: (1) the pleadings; (2) the file of the opposed application; (3) Mr. Cutino\u2019s registrations for the marks LONG ISLAND\u2019S NIGHTLIFE and NEW YORK\u2019S NIGHTLIFE; and (4) the deposition of Applicant\u2019s owner and founder introduced by Applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Second, the Board found that Mr. Cuti-no failed to pursue and waived his claims for deceptiveness and false suggestion under Section 2(a), because he could not establish the required elements of either claim based on the record. Regarding likelihood of confusion, the Board found that Mr. Cutino had established standing and priority based on the two properly-introduced registrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Proceeding to examine the DuPont<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> factors, the Board found that the dissimilarities between Mr. Cutino\u2019s and Applicant\u2019s marks outweigh the similarities. The Board acknowledged that the terms LONG ISLAND\u2019S and NEW YORK\u2019S are disclaimed and are descriptive, but found that they still make Mr. Cutino\u2019s marks look and sound significantly different than NIGHTLIFE TELEVISION. Finding that the term NIGHTLIFE is at best suggestive of the parties\u2019 goods and services, the Board concluded that the addition of the descriptive terms LONG ISLAND\u2019S, NEW YORK\u2019S and TELEVISION sufficiently distinguish the parties\u2019 marks and weigh against finding likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">The Board also found that the parties\u2019 goods and services and channels of trade weigh against finding likelihood of confusion. The Board noted that Mr. Cutino\u2019s registrations for LONG ISLAND\u2019S NIGHTLIFE and NEW YORK\u2019S NIGHTLIFE cover monthly magazines focused on particular geographic areas, while Applicant sought to register its mark for television and other broadcasting services. Because there was no additional evidence of a relationship between the goods and services or that their channels of trade overlap, the Board concluded that these factors did not favor finding likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">Given the absence of evidence on the remaining <em>DuPont </em>factors, the Board found them to be neutral. The Board therefore concluded that there is no likelihood of confusion between Mr. Cutino\u2019s and Applicant\u2019s marks. The Board reiterated that it could not consider Mr. Cutino\u2019s NIGHTLIFE registration, even in the face of Applicant\u2019s admissions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-9\">While applicant admits in its answer that opposer owns the mark NIGHTLIFE, Answer \u00b6 4, that is as far as applicant\u2019s admission goes, and because the registration for this mark is not of record, opposer is not entitled to any of the presumptions which arise out of a registration. In other words, there is no evidence concerning when opposer used NIGHTLIFE, whether the mark is still in use or what goods or services are or were offered under the mark. Applicant\u2019s admission is therefore not enough for us to consider the NIGHTLIFE mark in connection with opposer\u2019s likelihood of confusion claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">Board Decision at 8, n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">Mr. Cutino timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">We review the Board\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this case, we find that the Board abused its discretion in disregarding Mr. Cutino\u2019s NIGHTLIFE registration. The Board\u2019s own procedures and this court\u2019s precedent recognize that an opposer\u2019s registration will be deemed to be of record if the applicant\u2019s answer contains admissions sufficient to establish the current status of the registration and the plaintiffs ownership of the registration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Applicant\u2019s admissions in its answer are sufficient to treat the NIGHTLIFE registration as being part of the record. The Notice of Opposition specifically alleged that Mr. Cutino is the owner of, and would rely on, Registration No. 1908411 for the mark NIGHTLIFE. Notice of Opposition at \u00b6 4, Opp. No. 91186025 (Aug. 22, 2008). While Applicant purported to admit only that Mr. Cutino is the owner of the \u201cmark\u201d NIGHTLIFE, Applicant did not deny that Mr. Cutino owns the corresponding pleaded registration. <em>See </em>Answer at \u00b6 4, Opp. No. 91186025 (Jan. 2, 2009). An answer that fails to deny a portion of an allegation is deemed admitted as to that portion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">Applicant\u2019s admission regarding ownership not only establishes current title, but also the current status of the NIGHTLIFE registration, i.e., that it is active. One technically does not own a registration that is not in force and effect.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We do not read Applicant\u2019s denial that the NIGHTLIFE registration is \u201csubsisting\u201d as a clear denial of the current status of the registration, particularly in view of the identical denial made with respect to Mr. Cutino\u2019s other two registrations for which he attached records establishing current status. <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 5-7. Hence, unlike <em>Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Olympus Corp., </em>where an admission that the registrations \u201coriginally issued\u201d to the opposer was insufficient to establish current title,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> here Applicant admitted current ownership and the active status of the pleaded registrations. The Board therefore committed legal error in ignoring the evidentiary effect of Applicant\u2019s admissions and abused its discretion in refusing to consider the registration for the NIGHTLIFE mark.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-17\">On remand, we direct the Board to consider Mr. Cutino\u2019s NIGHLIFE registration and address the likelihood of confusion between the NIGHTLIFE mark and Applicant\u2019s mark. Mr. Cutino does not appeal, and therefore we do not disturb, the Board\u2019s other evidentiary rulings. We also do not address the remaining aspects of the Board\u2019s determination that Mr. Cu-tino does' not challenge, namely, the likelihood of confusion between Applicant\u2019s mark and Mr. Cutino\u2019s LONG ISLAND\u2019S NIGHTLIFE and NEW YORK\u2019S NIGHTLIFE marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>VACATED AND REMANDED</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b916-15\">. <em>Cutino v.
