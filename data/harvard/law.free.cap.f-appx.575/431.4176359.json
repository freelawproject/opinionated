We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Leone\u2019s response. Leone has filed several motions, which this court has considered. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED. All outstanding pro se motions are DENIED. Counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b459-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
