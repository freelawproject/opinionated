In this appeal, he challenges the district court\u2019s denial of the motion for reconsideration he filed with respect to his unsuccessful motion for modification of sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). As he did in the district court, MendozaCano insists that he is entitled to relief because his guidelines calculations were flawed and because <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), provides for such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>He is mistaken, and his arguments do not show that the district court abused its discretion in connection with its rejection of his motions. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009) (\u00a7 3582(c)(2)); <em>Martinez v. Johnson, </em>104 F.3d 769, 771 (5th Cir.1997). Although Mendoza-Cano invoked \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B), his claims do not fit within the confines of that subsection, nor do these claims fall under the strictures of the other subsections of \u00a7 3582(c). Consequently, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c) motion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672; <em>see also United States v. Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 209, 212 n. 5 (5th Cir.2010). Because <em>Alleyne </em>does not affect this conclusion, the district court likewise did not abuse its discretion by denying his motion for reconsideration. <em>See Martinez, </em>104 F.3d at 771. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
