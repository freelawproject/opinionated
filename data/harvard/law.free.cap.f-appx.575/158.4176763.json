Warren\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising the issues of whether the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Warren\u2019s guilty plea and whether it plainly erred in sentencing Warren. Warren was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-17\">\u201cA guilty plea operates as a waiver of important rights, and is valid only if done voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently, \u2018with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.\u2019\u201d <em>Bradshaw v. Stumpf, </em>545 U.S. 175, 183, 125 S.Ct. 2398, 162 L.Ed.2d 143 (2005) (quoting <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970)). In federal cases, Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \u201cgoverns the duty of the trial judge before accepting a guilty plea.\u201d <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243 n. 5, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969). It \u201crequire[s] a district court, before accepting a guilty plea, to \u2018personally inform the defendant of, and ensure that he understands, the nature of the charges against him and the consequences of his guilty plea.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hairston, </em>522 F.3d 336, 340 (4th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Damon, </em>191 F.3d 561, 564 (4th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-18\">We \u201caccord deference to the trial court\u2019s decision as to how best to conduct the mandated colloquy.\u201d <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116 (4th Cir.1991); <em>see also United States v. Wilson, </em>81 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>1300, 1307 (4th Cir.1996) (noting this \u201cCourt has repeatedly refused to script the Rule 11 colloquy, relying rather on the experience and wisdom of the district judges below\u201d). A guilty plea may be knowingly and intelligently made based on information received before the plea hearing. <em>See DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d at 116; <em>see also Bradshaw, </em>545 U.S. at 183, 125 S.Ct. 2398 (trial court may rely on counsel\u2019s assurance that defendant was properly informed of elements of the crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u201cA federal court of appeals normally will not correct a legal error made in criminal trial court proceedings unless the defendant first brought the error to the trial court\u2019s attention.\u201d <em>Henderson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1121, 1124, 185 L.Ed.2d 85 (2013) (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) creates an exception to the normal rule, providing \u201c[a] plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court\u2019s attention.\u201d Fed. R. Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Because Warren\u2019s Rule 11 claim is raised for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 71, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). It is thus Warren\u2019s burden to show (1) error; (2) that was plain; (3) affecting his substantial rights; and (4) that this Court should exercise its discretion to notice the error. <em>See Martinez, </em>277 F.3d at 529, 532. To show that his substantial rights were affected, he \u201cmust show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004). We have reviewed the record, and we conclude that Warren fails to make this showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">We review a criminal sentence for reasonableness using an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. McManus, </em>734 F.3d 315, 317 (4th Cir.2013) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). First, we consider whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as improperly calculating the Guidelines range, failing to consider the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012), or failing to adequately explain the sentence. <em>United States v. Allmendinger, </em>706 F.3d 330, 340 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2747, 186 L.Ed.2d 194 (2013). If the sentence is procedurally reasonable, we then consider its substantive reasonableness, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. We presume that a sentence within or below a properly calculated Guidelines range is substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Susi, </em>674 F.3d 278, 289 (4th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">In sentencing, the district court must first correctly calculate the defendant\u2019s sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Allmendinger, </em>706 F.3d at 340. The court is next required to give the parties an opportunity to argue for what they believe is an appropriate sentence, and the court must consider those arguments in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012). <em>Id. </em>When rendering a sentence, the court must make and place on the record an individualized assessment based on the particular facts of the case. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328, 330 (4th Cir.2009). In explaining the sentence, the \u201csentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). While a court must consider the statutory factors and explain its sentence, it need not explicitly reference \u00a7 3553(a) or discuss every factor on the record. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that Warren\u2019s sentence is reasonable. The district court properly calculated his Guidelines range and reasonably determined that a sentence below the range was appropriate based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court sentenced Warren below the sentence that he requested, and the court neither erred nor abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his or her client, in writing, of his or her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
