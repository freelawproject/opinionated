We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Lopez-Leon contends that the district court procedurally erred by failing to address adequately his mitigation arguments, and by relying on clearly erroneous facts at sentencing. We review for plain error, <em>see United States v. Valencia-Barragan, </em>608 F.3d 1103, 1108 &amp; n. 3 (9th Cir.2010), and find none. The record reflects that the district court properly addressed Lopez-Leon\u2019s mitigation arguments, and he has not shown a reasonable probability that he would have received a different sentence absent the district court\u2019s allegedly erroneous factual findings. <em>See United States v. Dallman, </em>533 F.3d 755, 762 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">Lopez-Leon also contends that the district court failed to consider the proper factors when determining whether to impose supervised release, and that it failed to explain adequately why it imposed supervised release. These contentions are belied by the record, which reflects that the district court considered the proper factors and explained that it imposed supervised release as an added measure of deterrence in light of Lopez-Leon\u2019s criminal and immigration history. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.1 cmt. n.5 (district court should consider imposing term of supervised release on deportable alien if it determines supervised release would provide an added measure of deterrence and protection).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">Lopez-Leon finally contends that both his custodial sentence and term of supervised release are substantively unreasonable. The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing Lopez-Leon\u2019s sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The above-Guidelines custodial sentence and the two-year term of supervised release are substantively reasonable in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and the totality of the circumstances. <em>See id.; see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.1 cmt. n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b784-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
