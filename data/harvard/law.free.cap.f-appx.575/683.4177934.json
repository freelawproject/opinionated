Trumbull then sued SCI under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. She alleged that, in fact, SCI had fired her because she is African American and female, and to retaliate for her repeated complaints about discrimination. The district court granted summary judgment for SCI and then denied Trumbull\u2019s motion for reconsideration. On appeal she contests only the latter ruling. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Trumbull was hired in September 2007 to sell funeral-related products, including interment rights and monuments. Nearly a year later, in August 2008, she executed a contract for the interment of the cremated remains of a person who had died more than three years earlier. That contract gave the decedent\u2019s family a \u201cpreneed\u201d discount. A sale is \u201cpreneed,\u201d according to the employee handbook, if \u201cmade in advance of death\u201d but \u201cat-need\u201d if \u201cmade at the time of death.\u201d SCI\u2019s director of marketing for the Chicago region and the company\u2019s human resources department learned in September 2008 that Trumbull had executed a \u201cpreneed\u201d contract for someone who was deceased. Managers for the Chicago region began investigating that contract as well as the training Trumbull had received regarding the company\u2019s \u201cpreneed\u201d policy. As part of that investigation, the marketing director tried to schedule a meeting with Trumbull in late 2008, but each time Trumbull said that she was too busy. Trumbull eventually discussed the contract with the human resources department in January 2009; she explained that the client had \u201cdemanded\u201d a \u201cpreneed\u201d discount and that a former supervisor had instructed her to write a \u201cpreneed\u201d contract if a client \u201cdoes not know when they\u2019re going to do it.\u201d Meanwhile, Trumbull lodged several grievances with SCI\u2019s human resources office asserting that her current supervisor and the general manager at Rosehill, as well as the marketing director for the Chicago region, were discriminating against her. In one grievance, for example, Trumbull accused the marketing director of \u201charassing and threatening\u201d her after a Caucasian man hand delivered her a letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">In February 2009, after completing its investigation, SCI fired Trumbull. The company\u2019s termination letter explains that Trumbull had violated SCI\u2019s sales policy by executing a \u201cpreneed\u201d contract for someone who already was deceased. That letter also conveys that SCI had investigated Trumbull\u2019s allegations of harassment but found them unsubstantiated. This lawsuit followed. Trumbull alleged that she was fired because of her sex and in retaliation for complaining of discrimination. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1), 2000e-3(a). When the district court recruited a lawyer to represent her, she amended her complaint to also allege race discrimination under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">SCI moved for summary judgment. After the parties had briefed that motion, the district court\u2019s law clerk left a voicemail for SCI\u2019s counsel, requesting a complete transcript of a deposition that both SCI and Trumbull had cited in their briefs. SCI\u2019s counsel filed the transcript later that day. In ruling for the defendant, the district court concluded that Trumbull\u2019s lawyer had disregarded Local Rule 56.1 by including argument and additional facts in her responses to SCI\u2019s statement of mate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>rial facts, and by denying many of SCI\u2019s facts without citing the record. <em>See </em>N.D. Ill. Civ. L.R. 56.1(b)(3); <em>Judson Atkinson Candies, Inc. v. Latini-Hohberger Dhimantec, </em>529 F.3d 371, 382 n. 2 (7th Cir.2008) (\u201cIt is inappropriate to make legal arguments in a Rule 56.1 statement of facts.\u201d); <em>Cady v. Sheahan, </em>467 F.3d 1057, 1060-61 (7th Cir.2006) (explaining that party violates Local Rule 56.1 by failing to \u201cadequately cite the record\u201d when disputing movant\u2019s statement of material facts); <em>Cichon v. Exelon Generation Co., L.L.C., </em>401 F.3d 803, 808 (7th Cir.2005) (upholding district judge\u2019s refusal to accept additional proposed facts that plaintiff had included in response opposing motion for summary judgment rather than a separate document as required under Local Rule 56.1). After disregarding facts and arguments that Trumbull had presented improperly, the court concluded that she had not offered direct or circumstantial evidence from which a jury reasonably could find that she was fired because of her race or sex or in retaliation for protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Trumbull moved to alter or amend the judgment, <em>see </em>Fed.R.CivP. 59(e), chiefly because of the \u201cex parte\u201d voicemail left for SCI\u2019s counsel. Trumbull argued that, in requesting the deposition transcript only from opposing counsel, the district court had deprived her of a \u201csimilar\u201d opportunity to amend her opposition to SCI\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court should \u201ccure\u201d this error, Trumbull asserted, by allowing her to revise her submissions. In addition, Trumbull acknowledged that the court had been authorized to enforce Local Rule 56.1 by disregarding many of her factual statements, but she asked the court to exercise its \u201cdiscretion to consider less severe sanctions.\u201d She did not disagree, however, that she had failed to comply with that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The district court denied the post-judgment motion. The court explained that the voicemail had concerned an administrative matter and that neither party had gained an advantage from the communication; thus, the communication was permitted under Canon 3(A)(4)(b) of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges. As for the local rule, the court continued, compliance was \u201cexpected\u201d and Trumbull\u2019s failure to do so was not the court\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">On appeal Trumbull continues to challenge the district court\u2019s ex parte communication and enforcement of Local Rule 56.1. But the district court did not err in denying her request for relief from judgment on those grounds. Although ex parte communications are \u201cgreatly disfavored,\u201d <em>RZS Holdings AVV v. PDVSA Petroleo S.A., </em>506 F.3d 350, 356-57 (4th Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. Napue, </em>834 F.2d 1311, 1318 (7th Cir.1987), they are permitted \u201cfor scheduling, administrative, or emergency purposes\u201d as long as they do \u201cnot address substantive matters and the judge reasonably believes that no party will gain a procedural, substantive, or tactical advantage as a result,\u201d Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges Canon 3(A)(4)(b). The law clerk\u2019s voicemail served an administrative purpose \u2014 obtaining a transcript \u2014 and did not refer to any substantive matter. Moreover, SCI did not comment on any substantive issue when it submitted the requested transcript, and Trumbull has not identified any advantage that SCI received as a result of the communication. Thus, we agree with the district court that the voicemail was not an impermissible ex parte communication. Finally, the district court was entitled to strictly enforce the local rule and disregard Trumbull\u2019s noncompliant submissions. <em>See Patterson v. Indiana Newspapers, Inc., </em>589 F.3d 357, 360 (7th Cir.2009); <em>FTC v. Bay Area Bus. Council, Inc., </em>423 F.3d 627, 633 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>In her reply brief, Trumbull does appear to contest the grant of summary judgment on the merits. Yet an argument mentioned for the first time in a reply brief is waived. <em>See Nationwide Ins. Co. v. Cent. Laborers\u2019 Pension Fund, </em>704 F.3d 522, 527 (7th Cir.2013); <em>Hernandez v. Cook Cnty. Sheriff\u2019s Office, </em>634 F.3d 906, 913 (7th Cir.2011). Trumbull also appears to assert for the first time in her reply brief that her court-recruited counsel was ineffective; this argument also comes too late, and, in any case, a litigant does not have the right to assistance of counsel in a civil suit. <em>See Stanciel v. Gramley, </em>267 F.3d 575, 581 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
