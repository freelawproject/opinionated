Gutierrez argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He specifically contends that the guidelines sentencing range was too severe in light of his difficult personal history, his benign motives for returning, and his minimal criminal history. Additionally, Gutierrez asserts that his sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>tence is not entitled to a presumption of correctness because the illegal reentry guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not empirically based, as it gives undue weight to a defendant\u2019s prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">We review sentences for substantive reasonableness, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). As he concedes, Gutierrez\u2019s empirical data argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009). Furthermore, Gutierrez\u2019s sentence, which is in the middle of the applicable guidelines range, is presumed reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). His general disagreement with the propriety of his sentence and the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Gutierrez has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion by sentencing him to a within-guidelines sentence of 44 months in prison. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
