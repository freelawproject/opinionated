We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the agency\u2019s denial of a continuance, <em>Sandoval-Luna v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir.2008) (per curiam), and review de novo due process claims and questions of law, <em>Cruz Rendon v. Holder, </em>603 F.3d 1104, 1109 (9th Cir.2010) (due process claims); <em>Simeonov v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 532, 535 (9th Cir.2004) (questions of law). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The agency did not abuse its discretion by denying for lack of good cause Oli-vare s \u2014 Garcia\u2019s motions for a continuance to wait for the government\u2019s adjudication of his request for prosecutorial discretion and for passage of immigration-reform legislation. <em>See Singh v. Holder, </em>638 F.3d 1264, 1274 (9th Cir.2011) (\u201c[A]n IJ \u2018may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)). Oli-vares \u2014 Garcia conceded his removability and ineligibility for any relief from removal under current law, and the bases for the motions remained merely speculative possibilities at the time of his final removal hearing. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[T]he IJ [is] not required to grant a continuance based on ... speculations.\u201d); <em>see also Sandoval-Luna, </em>526 F.3d at 1247 (rejecting a challenge to an IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance where \u201cno relief was then immediately available\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The agency applied the correct legal standard to Olivares-Garcia\u2019s motions. <em>See Mendez-Castro v. Mukasey, </em>552 F.3d 975, 980 (9th Cir.2009) (concluding that \u201cthe IJ applied the correct legal standard\u201d in a case where \u201cthe IJ expressly cited and applied [relevant case law] in rendering its decision, which is all our review requires\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">Olivares-Gareia\u2019s claim that the denial of his motions for a continuance violated his due process rights lacks merit because he failed to demonstrate prejudice. <em>See Cruz Rendon, </em>603 F.3d at 1109 (\u201cIn order to prevail on [a due process] claim, the alien ... must show prejudice, \u2018which means that the outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the alleged \u2022violation.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>see also Robleto-Pastora v. Holder, </em>591 F.3d 1051, 1062 (9th Cir.2010) (identifying no prejudice from the denial of a continuance where the petitioner was \u201ccurrently ineligible\u201d for relief from removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">In light of this disposition, we need not consider the BIA\u2019s determination that Oli-vares \u2014 Garcia had abandoned his challenge to the IJ\u2019s decision of December 12, 2011. <em>See Simeonov, </em>371 F.3d at 538 (\u201cAs a general rule courts ... are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b841-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
