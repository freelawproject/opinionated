We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, and review de novo claims of due process violations in immigration proceedings. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Zarate\u2019s motion to reopen because he failed to establish prima facie eligibility for relief. <em>See Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 986 (9th Cir.2010) (agency may deny a motion to reopen based on a failure to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought); <em>Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 734, 740-41 (9th Cir.2009) (the REAL ID Act \u201crequires that a protected ground represent \u2018one central reason\u2019 for an asylum applicant\u2019s persecution\u201d). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-17\">We reject Zarate\u2019s contentions that the BIA violated his right to due process because the BIA considered his evidence and arguments. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error for a due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b802-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
