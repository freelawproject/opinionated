Blount seeks to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. To proceed IFP, the party must demonstrate financial eligibility and the existence of any nonfrivolous issue for appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(1); <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). Our inquiry \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Blount argues that the district court erred in concluding that he was not eligible for a reduction in his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He avers that the district court erred in refusing to reduce his sentence under the amendments resulting from the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to ... \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion, ... its interpretation of the Guidelines de novo, and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The denial of a motion for reconsideration is also reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Martinez v. Johnson, </em>104 F.3d 769, 771 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">The district court correctly determined that Blount was subject to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) based on his two pri- or felony drug convictions. A mandatory minimum statutory penalty overrides the retroactive application of a new guideline. <em>See United States v. Pardue, </em>36 F.3d 429, 431 (5th Cir.1994). Because Blount\u2019s sentence of life imprisonment was statutorily mandated, he was not \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also United States v. Reed, </em>490 Fed.Appx. 633, 634 (5th Cir.2012) (holding that a defendant subject to a mandatory sentence of life based on two prior felony convictions was not eligible for application of amendments to crack cocaine guidelines). Additionally, contrary to Blount\u2019s assertion, the FSA has no applicability to him because he was sentenced before it took effect. <em>See United States v. Doggins, </em>633 F.3d 379, 384 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">In light of the foregoing, Blount has not demonstrated that he will present a non-frivolous issue with respect to the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Accordingly, his request for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b525-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
