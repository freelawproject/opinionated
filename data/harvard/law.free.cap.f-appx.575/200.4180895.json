The district court sentenced Hill as' an armed career criminal, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2012), to 192 months in prison. On appeal, counsel for Hill filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious issues for appeal but questioning whether the district court erred in sentencing Hill as an armed career criminal, because two of the predicate offenses should not have been counted separately and none of the predicate felonies were charged in the indictment or proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Hill has not filed a pro se supplemental brief, despite notice of his right to do so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-21\">At sentencing, Hill objected to his designation as an armed career criminal based on the fact that he was convicted of two of the predicate offenses, felony delivery of cocaine, on the same day. However, the crimes for which he was convicted were \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another,\u201d arising out of \u201cseparate and distinct criminal episode[s],\u201d such that the district court properly overruled the objection. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>689 F.3d 349, 358-59 (4th Cir.2012) (quoting <em>United States v. Letterlough, </em>63 F.3d 332, 335 (4th Cir.1995)). We there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>fore conclude that the district court did not err in counting Hill\u2019s prior felonies as separate offenses under the Armed Career Criminal Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Counsel also posits that Hill's constitutional rights were violated because the predicate offenses supporting his armed career criminal designation were not charged in the indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. This argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 284 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that an indictment need not reference or list the prior convictions used to enhance a sentence); <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-54 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that prior convictions used as the basis for an armed career criminal sentence need not be charged in the indictment or proven beyond a reasonable doubt); <em>see also Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2160 n. 1, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013) (recognizing the narrow exception for fact of a prior conviction). Accordingly, the district court did not err in sentencing Hill as an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. \u25a0We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Hill, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Hill requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Hill. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
