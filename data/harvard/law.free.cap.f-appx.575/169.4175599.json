Powell seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2012) motion, denying his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (2012) motion for a sentence reduction, and denying his motion for reduction of restitution. Finding no reversible error, we affirm the portions of the district court\u2019s order denying Powell\u2019s motions for a sentence reduction and for reduction of restitution. <em>United States v. Powell, </em>Nos. 3:07-cr-00324-JRS-1; 3:12-cv-00023-JRS, 2013 WL 1165221 (E.D.Va. Mar. 20, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">The portion of the district court\u2019s order denying relief on Powell\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (2012). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2012). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable, and that the motion states a debatable claim \u00f3f the denial of a constitutional right. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Powell has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal of the portion of the district court\u2019s order denying relief on Powell\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. We also deny Powell\u2019s motion to include the documents attached to the misrouted notice of appeal, as those documents are already in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
