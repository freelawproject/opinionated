Thomas appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006) complaint under Fed. R.Civ.P. 41(b) for failure to comply with its prior order. We review the district court\u2019s order for abuse of discretion. <em>See Ballard v. Carlson, </em>882 F.2d 93, 95-96 (4th Cir.1989). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion when it ... relies on erroneous factual or legal premises.\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson-Riviere, </em>561 F.3d 345, 348 (4th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">The district court dismissed Thomas\u2019 complaint because it found that Thomas \u201cha[d] not filed a signed consent order, amended complaint, or completed exhaustion affidavit.\u201d On appeal, Thomas claims that he has \u201cdone everything [he] was asked to do by the court.\u201d We agree. Upon reviewing the record, we have determined that the consent order, amended complaint, and completed exhaustion affidavit were submitted to the court along with Thomas\u2019 motion \u201cfor the allowance of testimony.\u201d We thus conclude that the district court relied on an erroneous factual premise in dismissing the complaint. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">Thomas also appeals the district court\u2019s orders directing him to file additional documents and denying his motion for appointment of counsel. Finding no reversible error, we affirm those orders.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Thomas v. Ross, </em>No. 1:13-cv-00989-TSETRJ (E.D.
