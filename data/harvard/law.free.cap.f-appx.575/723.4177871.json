We have jurisdiction under \u00a7 2253. We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a section 2255 motion, <em>see United States v. Manzo, </em>675 F.3d 1204, 1209 (9th Cir.2012), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-23\">Osemwengie contends that his counsel was ineffective for failing to advise him adequately during plea negotiations. This contention fails because Osemwengie has not shown a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s conduct, he would have received a shorter sentence. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>see also Missouri v. Frye, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1399, 1409, 182 L.Ed.2d 379 (2012) (to establish prejudice where a plea offer has been rejected because of counsel\u2019s deficient performance, defendant must show \u201ca reasonable probability that the end result of the criminal process would have been more favorable by reason of a plea to a lesser charge or a sentence of less prison time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-26\">Osemwengie also contends that his counsel was ineffective for failing to request credit toward his sentence for the time he spent in pretrial detention. This contention is unpersuasive. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b), a defendant is not entitled to credit for time served in pretrial detention if that time has been credited against another sentence. Moreover, the terms of Osemwengie\u2019s plea agreement prohibited him from seeking any downward departure or variance from the Guideline range. Accordingly, Osemwengie has not established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>either deficient performance or prejudice. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b751-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
