He argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to properly consider his cultural assimilation and, as a result, failed to properly balance the relevant sentencing considerations. In connection with that argument, he states that he met the requirements for a downward departure for cultural assimilation pursuant to Application Note 8 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-25\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 56, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cWhen the district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range and gives proper weight to the Guidelines and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we will give great deference to that sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>and will infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines in light of the sentencing considerations set out in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The presumption of reasonableness \u201cis rebutted only upon a showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The record reflects that the district court adequately considered Guereca-De Santiago\u2019s request for a sentence below the guidelines range, the Government\u2019s argument in favor of a within-guidelines sentence, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including his cultural assimilation argument. The court explicitly adopted the findings of the PSR, which included information about Guereca-De Santiago\u2019s childhood, schooling, and family. The court also heard similar evidence at the sentencing hearing, both from counsel and from Guereca-De Santiago\u2019s brother. Having \u201ctaken into account the conduct admitted to in the Factual resume as well as those matters required to be considered by [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553,\u201d the district court imposed a sentence in the middle of Guereca-De Santiago\u2019s guidelines range. After Guereca-De Santiago objected to the sentence \u201cas unreasonable considering all of the [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553 factors,\u201d the court reiterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">As I mentioned, I have gone through the factors individually and I\u2019ve determined that this is the appropriate sentence, given his criminal history and his multiple reentries ... and ... his personal facts and circumstances and, as I mentioned, I\u2019ve also decided to impose a term of supervised release, again, to serve as a deterrent to his future reentry, given his past history. So I will overrule that objection and I will the order the sentence imposed as stated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT3\">Moreover, \u201c[wjhile cultural assimilation <em>may </em>be considered as a mitigating factor, there is no requirement that a sentencing court <em>must </em>accord it dispositive weight.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008). Guereca-De Santiago\u2019s assertion regarding his cultural assimilation is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness given to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 564-66 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). Therefore, Guereca-De Santiago has failed to show that his sentence is substantively unreasonable, and the district court did not err in denying him a downward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">To the extent that Guereca-De Santiago contends that the district court denied him a downward departure under Application Note 8 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 based upon cultural assimilation, we lack jurisdiction to review his claim. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2006) (\u201c[T]his Court ordinarily has no jurisdiction to review a court\u2019s refusal to downwardly depart ... even where the district court responds to a request for downward departure with a summary denial without explanation or with an implicit denial by imposing a Guideline sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">We AFFIRM Guereca-De Santiago\u2019s sentence and DENY his motion to expedite the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
