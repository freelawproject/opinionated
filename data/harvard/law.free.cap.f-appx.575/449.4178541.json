In his motion, Malm sought to restrain Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) from involving itself in his then-pending immigration case. He also requested that the district court order CCA to provide him with immigration statutes and to not retaliate against or harass him.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-22\">Malm was released from CCA custody while this appeal was pending. Accordingly, to the extent that he seeks injunctive relief or specific performance to remedy his conditions of confinement, his claims are moot. <em>See Herman v. Holiday, </em>238 F.3d 660, 665 (5th Cir.2001). Additionally, we lack jurisdiction to consider Malm\u2019s challenge to the denial of his request for a TRO. <em>See Faulder v. Johnson, </em>178 F.3d 741, 742 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-23\">As Malm\u2019s appeal is now moot, it must be DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"a0d-dedup-0\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
