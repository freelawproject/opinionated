On appeal, Gomez challenges these convictions on two grounds: (1) that police violated his Fourth Amendment rights by using pen registers and trap and trace devices without a warrant, and (2) that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to sustain a conviction for conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-21\">The DEA began investigating Gomez for drug distribution in 2009. In May 2009, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>the DEA arranged the sale of 20 grams of heroin from Gomez to a government informant. This informant provided the DEA with the number to Gomez\u2019s cellular telephone, and from July 9, 2009, to at least August 18, 2009, the DEA used a pen register<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a \u201ctrap and trace\u201d device<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to monitor this phone\u2019s activity pursuant to court orders issued under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3123. These devices allowed the DEA to record a large amount of call data, such as the telephone numbers dialed by Gomez, the telephone numbers of persons who called Gomez, and the time of day and duration of these communications. Importantly, all of this information was disclosed to Gomez\u2019s cell phone carrier, Sprint Corporation, when the calls were placed. This call data revealed that Gomez regularly communicated with suspected drug traffickers and individuals using prepaid phones, which suggested that Gomez was involved in the distribution of illegal drugs. During this period, the DEA also successfully arranged and recorded multiple drug purchases from Gomez to confidential informants.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Using the call data and the evidence obtained through the undercover purchases, the -DEA obtained an order for a wiretap and began intercepting and recording Gomez\u2019s cell phone conversations on August 24, 2009. On September 12, 2009, Gomez abruptly stopped using the tapped phone. A confidential informant provided the DEA with Gomez\u2019s new cell phone number and the DEA obtained authorization for a wiretap for the new phone. Both wiretaps yielded additional evidence that Gomez was engaged in the distribution of illegal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Using all of the foregoing evidence, the DEA obtained and executed a search warrant for Gomez\u2019s apartment, where they recovered almost $6,000 in cash, drug packaging materials and a digital scale, and a loaded .40 caliber handgun with an obliterated serial number. Thereafter, Gomez was indicted on charges of distribution of controlled substances, conspiracy, and possession of a firearm in connection with drug trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">Prior to trial, Gomez moved to suppress the introduction of much of the foregoing evidence, arguing that the DEA violated his Fourth Amendment rights by engaging in extensive call pattern surveillance without a warrant. The District Court denied this motion, concluding that Gomez\u2019s argument was squarely foreclosed by <em>Smith v. Maryland, </em>442 U.S. 735, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 61 L.Ed.2d 220 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">At trial, Government cooperators Raphael Pagan and Ramon Sanchez testified that they sold large quantities of heroin to Gomez on a regular basis. Importantly, they testified that they always sold Gomez heroin on credit and were not paid until after he distributed the drugs to his customers. They also testified that Gomez occasionally sold them cocaine, and that they had sometimes helped Gomez cook crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">The jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts and the District Court sentenced Gomez to a term of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>II<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Gomez first argues that the DEA\u2019s prolonged warrantless use of a pen register and trap and trace device violated his privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment. We agree with the District Court that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Smith. </em>Gomez provided a third party \u2014 in this case, Sprint \u2014 with all the data that the DEA obtained through the use of the pen register and trap and trace device. In so doing, Gomez abandoned his privacy interest in this data because he \u201cassumed the risk that the information would be di-\u2019 vulged to police.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>442 U.S. at 745, 99 S.Ct. 2577. Although Justice Sotomayor has urged the Court to reconsider <em>Smith\u2019s </em>holding that \u201can individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties,\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 945, 957, 181 L.Ed.2d 911 (2012) (Sotomayor, J., concurring), we remain bound by <em>Smith </em>until a majority of the Court endorses this view.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">Gomez next argues that the evidence presented at trial did not support his conspiracy conviction. Specifically, he argues that the evidence demonstrated, at most, a \u201cwholesale buyer-seller relationship\u201d between himself and the Government\u2019s cooperating witnesses \u2014 not a conspiracy. Gomez concedes that he did not raise this issue in the District Court and, accordingly, that plain error is the proper standard of review in this appeal. <em>See United States v. Mornan, </em>413 F.3d 372, 381 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have found the essential elements of a conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt. Pagan and Sanchez testified that they always provided Gomez with heroin on credit. In the context of large-scale drug distribution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>this fact alone provided the jury with sufficient evidence of a conspiracy. <em>United States v. Iglesias, </em>535 F.3d 150, 156 (3d Cir.2008). Additionally, these witnesses testified that Gomez sold them cocaine, and that they helped Gomez cook crack cocaine. Accordingly, we see no reason to disturb Gomez\u2019s conspiracy conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">In light of the foregoing analysis, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-12\">. Gomez raises two other issues, but acknowledges that they are foreclosed by <em>AlmendarezTorres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and <em>United States v. Singletary, </em>268 F.3d 196 (3d Cir.2001), and presents them only for purposes of preservation. They are: (1) his Fifth/Sixth Amendment rights were violated when he was exposed to greater punishment based on a putative prior conviction that was neither charged in the indictment nor proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) the Commerce Clause does not authorize federal regulation of firearm possession based solely on the gun\u2019s one-time travel in interstate commerce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b114-5\">. A pen register records outgoing dialing information from the subject\u2019s phone (i.e., what numbers the subject dialed, when he dialed them, whether the call was connected, and the duration of the call). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3127(3) (defining pen register).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b114-12\">. A \"trap and trace\u201d device records incoming dialing information to the subject\u2019s phone <em>(i.e., </em>when the caller dialed the subject's number, whether the call was connected, and the duration of the call). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3127(4) (defining trap and trace device).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b115-8\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over a District Court's legal conclusions with respect to a motion to suppress. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>280 F.3d 318, 336 (3d Cir.2002). When reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, \"we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, and will sustain the verdict if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Dent, </em>149 F.3d 180, 187 (3d Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b115-9\">. In the proceedings below, Gomez conceded that his position was \"contrary to\u201d <em>Smith, </em>but cited Justice Sotomayor's concurrence in <em>Jones </em>for the proposition that <em>\u201cSmith </em>is antiquated and must be reconsidered.\u201d J.A. 60. Gomez presents a different argument on appeal. Instead of urging us to overrule <em>Smith's </em>\u201cthird party doctrine,\u201d Gomez contends that this doctrine has already been \"cabined\u201d by five Justices of the Supreme Court \u2014 a number he reaches by combining Justice Sotomayor\u2019s and Justice Alito\u2019s concurrences in <em>Jones. </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. 27, 31. As Gomez did not raise this argument before the District Court, it is waived. <em>Holk v. Snapple Beverage Corp., </em>575 F.3d 329, 336 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-14\">In any event, we reject Gomez\u2019s contention that the concurrences in <em>Jones </em>\"cabined\u201d <em>Smith. </em>Justice Alito's concurrence did not explicitly seek to limit <em>Smith, </em>and indeed relied heavily on the fact that drivers of automobiles do not expect third parties to possess detailed, long-term data regarding their location. <em>Jones, </em>132 S.Ct. at 964 (Alito, J., concurring). By contrast, cell phone users do expect service providers to possess detailed, long-term data regarding the numbers they dial because this information is necessarily conveyed in the course of connecting a call. <em>Smith, </em>442 U.S. at 743, 99 S.Ct. 2577. By disclosing this data, cell phone users, unlike drivers of automobiles, \u201dassume[] the risk\u201d that a third party will convey it to law enforcement. <em>Id. </em>at 744, 99 S.Ct. 2577. Therefore, we are not persuaded that the two concurrences in <em>Jones </em>have limited <em>Smith </em>to short-term call monitoring.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
