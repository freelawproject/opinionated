Meals claims the sentence is substantively unreasonable because the applicable methamphetamine Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2D1.1 (unlawful manufacturing, importing, or trafficking of drugs) overstates the seriousness of his offense and is not empirically based.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, as in this instance, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Meals does not claim procedural error. Instead, as noted, he maintains his sentence was substantively unreasonable. Because Meals\u2019 sentence falls within the applicable statutory and advisory Guidelines-sentencing range, we afford it a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding the application of the presumption of reasonableness to sentences within a properly calculated Guidelines range). To rebut this presumption, Meals must show \u201cthe sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing [the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] sentencing factors\u201d. <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">Meals contends that, in the light of <em>Kim-brough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the applicable methamphetamine Guideline lacks an empirical basis, and, therefore, the Guideline does not help arrive at a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to achieve the goals of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Meals\u2019 contention is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>E.g., United States v. Mondra-gon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009). Because Meals has not shown the district court failed to give proper weight to any \u00a7 3553(a) factor, he fails to rebut the presumption of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
