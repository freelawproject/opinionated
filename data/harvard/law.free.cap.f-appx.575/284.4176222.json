Harutyunyan asserts that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s findings that he was not credible based in part on his criminal convictions, that he had not presented sufficient corroborating evidence, and that he had not established his eligibility for relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-18\">Harutyunyan\u2019s removal results from his conviction of an aggravated felony. We do not have jurisdiction to review his claims because they do not present either a constitutional issue or a question of law. <em>See Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 596 n. 31 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 801 (5th Cir.2006); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) &amp; (D). Accordingly, Haru-tyunyan\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b312-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
