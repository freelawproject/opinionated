NIXON, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Terrence Bell pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm and to possessing cocaine with intent to distribute. The government argued Bell should be sentenced as an armed career criminal based on three previous convictions: one aggravated robbery and two aggravated assaults in Tennessee. Bell argued that one of his convictions for aggravated assault under Tennessee law did not qualify as a violent felony. The district court agreed with the government and sentenced Bell as an armed career criminal to 180 months in prison. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">On December 14, 2012, a federal Grand Jury indicted Bell on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), and one count of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). On March 13, 2013, Bell entered a guilty plea to both counts without a written plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">On May 14, 2013, the United States Probation Office prepared a Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), which deemed Bell an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), based on having three previous convictions for violent felonies. The three convictions were one aggravated robbery and two aggravated assaults. Based on the PSR, Bell\u2019s advisory guideline range for both counts was 188 to 235 months; however, the firearm charge also carried a statutory minimum of 180 months (15 years) based on Bell\u2019s designation as an armed career criminal under the ACCA. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. 924(e)(1) (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">On July 30, 2013, Bell filed a Position on the PSR, challenging only the designation of one of his convictions for aggravated assault as a violent felony under the ACCA. In particular, one conviction was predicated on violation of Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-102(c), which Bell contended encompasses both simple assaults and crimes committed recklessly and is therefore outside the scope of the ACCA\u2019s definition of violent felony. On August 4, 2013, the government filed its own Position on the PSR, arguing Bell\u2019s aggravated assault conviction qualified as a violent felony under the ACCA. Specifically, the government submitted that \u00a7 39-13-102(c) does not encompass recklessness and further that any violation of \u00a7 39-13-102(c) presents sufficient risk of physical injury to qualify as a violent felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-14\">On October 7, 2013, the district court conducted a sentencing hearing with oral argument from Bell and the government. Both essentially reiterated the arguments in their respective Positions. Ultimately, the district court rejected Bell\u2019s objections, concluding the statute could not be violated by merely reckless conduct and that the risk of violence created by a violation of \u00a7 39-13-102(c) presented sufficient risk of physical injury to qualify as a violent felony given that \u00a7 39-13-102(c) requires the crime to be committed in violation of a restraining order. The district court then sentenced Bell to 180 months in prison. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination of law that a defendant\u2019s prior conviction is a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>743 F.3d 1054, 1058 (6th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">At the time of Bell\u2019s conviction in 2006, TenmCode Ann. \u00a7 39-13-102(c)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provided</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADl\">A person commits aggravated assault who, after having been enjoined or restrained by an order, diversion or probation agreement of a court of competent jurisdiction from in any way causing or attempting to cause bodily injury or in any way committing or attempting to commit an assault against an individual or individuals, intentionally or knowingly attempts to cause or causes bodily injury or commits or attempts to commit an <em>assault </em>against such individual or individuals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">\u201cAssault\u201d was then further defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">(1) Intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causes bodily injury to another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">(2) Intentionally or knowingly causes another to reasonably fear imminent bodily injury; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-11\">(3) Intentionally or knowingly causes physical contact with another and a reasonable person would regard the contact as extremely offensive or provocative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">TenmCode Ann. \u00a7 39-13-101(a) (2006). For purposes of both of these sections, \u201cbodily injury\u201d was defined as \u201ca cut, abrasion, bruise, burn or disfigurement, and physical pain or temporary illness or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.\u201d Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-ll-106(a)(2) (2006). Further, \u201cin determining the meaning or the scope of [aggravated assault], we are bound by the Tennessee Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation, including its guidance on the elements of the crime.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>743 F.3d at 1059.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-16\">Under the ACCA, a person convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), with three previous convictions under \u00a7 922(g)(1) for violent felonies, shall serve a minimum fifteen-year sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2012). \u201cViolent felony\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGY\">any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that (i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-17\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). Accordingly, there are three ways in which a crime may qualify as a violent felony: (1) as an enumerated offense (burglary, arson, extortion, use of explosives); (2) under the \u201cuse of physical force\u201d clause, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i); or (3) under the \u201cotherwise,\u201d or residual, clause, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). <em>See United States v. McMurray, </em>653 F.3d 367, 373 (6th Cir.2011). Additionally, this Court analyzes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA in the same way as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>relies equally on cases interpreting either term. <em>United States v. Denson, </em>728 F.3d 603, 607 (6th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">We apply a \u201ccategorical\u201d approach in determining the nature of a prior conviction, meaning that the Court \u201clook[s] at the statutory definition of the crime of conviction, not the facts underlying that conviction, to determine the nature of the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>675 F.3d 1013, 1016 (6th Cir.2012) (quoting <em>United States v. Ford, </em>560 F.3d 420, 421-22 (6th Cir.2009)). \u201cCourts use \u2018a variant of this method \u2014 labeled (not very inventively) the \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d \u2014 when a prior conviction is for violating a so-called \u201cdivisible statute,\u201d\u2019 which \u2018sets out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative.\u2019 \u201d <em>Denson, </em>728 F.3d at 608 (quoting <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2281, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013)). This modified categorical approach is applicable only where the statute at issue \u201c \u2018could be violated in a way that would constitute a [violent felony] and in a way that would not.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Rede-Mendez, </em>680 F.3d 552, 556 (6th Cir.2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">As aggravated assault is not an enumerated offense, it can be deemed a \u201cviolent felony\u201d only under either the \u201cuse of force\u201d clause or the residual clause. However, the government has conceded that aggravated assault, as defined in the Tennessee Code, does not categorically meet the \u201cuse of force\u201d clause requirements. Accordingly, we analyze the crime at issue only under the residual clause. Additionally, because we determine that violation of TenmCode Ann. \u00a7 39-13-102(c) is categorically a violent felony under the residual clause, we need not apply the modified categorical approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">a. The \u201cResidual Clause\u201d of the ACCA</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">To qualify as a violent felony under the residual clause of the ACCA, a crime must \u201cinvolve[ ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). While this provision\u2019s \u201clanguage is broad, the residual clause is not intended as a catchall provision and covers only crimes similar to the four enumerated offenses that textually precede it.\u201d <em>Denson, </em>728 F.3d at 609 (internal quotation marks omitted). As this Court noted in <em>United States v. Covington, </em>738 F.3d 759, 765 (6th Cir.2014), the Supreme Court has decided two recent cases under the residual clause, each using a different analysis. First, in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), the Court focused on \u201cwhether the statute insists on \u2018purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct,\u2019 \u201d thus making it similar to the enumerated offenses. <em>Covington, </em>738 F.3d at 765 (quoting <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 145, 128 S.Ct. 1581). However, in <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011), the Court explained that \u201c \u2018levels of risk divide crimes that qualify [as violent felonies] from those that do not,\u2019 \u201d such that the appropriate analysis \u201cis whether \u2018the risk posed by [the crime in question] is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Covington, </em>738 F.3d at 765 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2273, 2275 (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">This Court has not conclusively determined the effect of <em>Sykes </em>on <em>Begay\u2019s </em>\u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\u201d test. <em>See Mitchell, </em>743 F.3d at 1062 (applying the <em>Begay </em>test but noting \u201cstrict adherence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>the \u2018purposeful violent, and aggressive\u2019 rubric is not definitively required, and ... its future is in question\u201d). However, \u201c[t]his Court ... has reasoned that the two analy-ses are more supplementary than distinct.\u201d <em>Covington, </em>738 F.3d at 765 (citing <em>Denson, </em>728 F.3d at 610 (\u201cAs the language in <em>Sykes </em>limiting <em>Begay </em>is not mandatory, we have continued to apply the two-part test in some residual-clause cases, and have chosen to exclude the <em>Begay </em>question in others.\u201d)); <em>see also Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2289 n. 1 (Kagan, J., dissenting) (interpreting the majority\u2019s opinion as not limiting the \u201cpurposeful, aggressive, and violent\u201d standard to strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes, as such \u201cwould ... eliminate the test\u2019s focus on \u2018violence\u2019 and \u2018aggression.\u2019 And it would collide with <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 122, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009) \u2014 a decision the majority cites approvingly \u2014 which applied the test to an intentional crime\u201d). <em>But see United States v. Evans, </em>699 F.3d 858, 865 (6th Cir.2012) (\u201cIn <em>Sykes </em>... the Supreme Court limited the application of <em>Begay\u2019s </em>\u2018purposeful, violent, and aggressive\u2019 standard ... to crimes premised on strict liability, negligence, or recklessness.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Accordingly, while the \u201cpurposeful, aggressive, and violent\u201d standard may still be applied by this Court, the first question to be addressed under the residual clause is whether the violation of the underlying statute presents a level of risk of physical harm that is similar to one of the enumerated offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">i. Level of Risk of Physical Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Three elements are necessary for a conviction under the crime of aggravated assault under TenmCode Ann. \u00a7 39-13-102(c): (1) the violator must be subject to some form of restraining order,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) the restraining order must prohibit the violator from \u201cin any way causing or attempting to cause bodily injury or in any way committing or attempting to commit an assault\u201d against a specific person or persons, and (3) the violator must \u201cintentionally or knowingly attempt[] to cause or cause[] bodily injury or commit[] or attempt ] to commit an assault against\u201d the same person or persons named in the restraining order. Accordingly, the underlying action taken by the defendant must be either an assault against or bodily injury to the victim, or attempt, in combination with the preconditions set forth by the first two elements. Therefore, based on the categorical approach we are required to utilize, we analyze <em>both </em>whether causing or attempting to cause bodily injury, <em>and </em>whether attempting to or committing an assault under these circumstances, present a level of risk similar to an enumerated crime under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">As previously explained, the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d is defined by statute in Tennessee to mean \u201ca cut, abrasion, bruise, burn or disfigurement, and physical pain or temporary illness or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.\u201d TenmCode Ann. \u00a7 39-11-106(a)(2). Additionally, the \u201cassault\u201d element of \u00a7 39-13-102(c) requires only that the person commit or attempt to commit an \u201cassault\u201d and does not require any particular form of assault to give rise to a violation. \u201cAssault\u201d under \u00a7 39-13-101(a) encompasses three different forms of assault: (1) causing bodily injury, (2) \u201ccausing another to reasonably fear imminent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>bodily injury,\u201d or (3) \u201cphysical contact with another [that] a reasonable person would regard ... as extremely offensive or provocative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The government has analogized to the crime of generic burglary under the ACCA in arguing that violation of \u00a7 39-13-102(c) presents a sufficient level of risk to qualify as a violent felony. As explained by the Supreme Court in <em>James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 203, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007), \u201c[t]he main risk of burglary arises not from the simple physical act of wrongfully entering onto another\u2019s property, but rather from the <em>possibility </em>of a face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a third party ... who comes to investigate.\u201d We find this explanation of the level of risk present in an enumerated crime \u2014 burglary\u2014demonstrates why the crime at issue in this case \u2014 aggravated assault \u2014 presents the requisite level of risk of physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">There is little question that the commission of an aggravated assault under \u00a7 39-13-102(c) by way of causing \u201cbodily injury\u201d to the victim presents a level of risk equivalent to an enumerated crime in the ACCA. As this Court has previously noted, where a crime requires the perpetrator to purposefully cause or attempt to cause serious physical injury, such crime presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, \u201c[b]y its plain terms.\u201d <em>United States v. Perry, </em>703 F.3d 906, 910 (6th Cir.2013); <em>see also Mitchell, </em>743 F.3d at 1060-61 (explaining that because the robbery crime at issue \u201crequire[d] violence actually [be] dispensed, or put[ ] the victim in fear from violence offered or impending,\u201d such crime clearly presented the requisite level of risk under the ACCA). Further, as opposed to the mere <em>possibility </em>of a confrontation in generic burglary that <em>could </em>lead to physical injury, causing bodily injury to another almost certainly requires a confrontation and without question requires physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">With regard to the potential for violation of \u00a7 39-13-102(c) based on commission of assault, the statutory definition of \u201cassault\u201d in Tennessee reaches a wider range of activities that we must consider. As the first form of assault is causing bodily injury, <em>see </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-101(a)(l), it is covered by our above analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">As to the second type of assault, \u201ccausing another to reasonably fear imminent bodily injury,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 39-13-101(a)(2), this is largely analogous to our decision in <em>Mitchell. </em>The <em>Mitchell </em>Court dealt with determining whether robbery under Tennessee law constituted a violent felony, particularly where that crime could be accomplished by \u201c \u2018putting the [victim] in fear.\u2019 \u201d 743 F.3d at 1058 (quoting Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13^401). Relying on decisions from the Tennessee Supreme Court, <em>Mitchell </em>explained that such \u201cfear\u201d must be \u201c \u2018a fear of bodily injury and of present personal peril from violence offered or impending.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1059 (quoting <em>State v. Taylor, </em>771 S.W.2d 387, 398 (Tenn.1989)). Because of the nature of the fear required to constitute robbery by fear, the Court held that it was sufficient to find the crime a violent felony. <em>Id. </em>at 1060. While it is true the discussion of fear focused on the \u201cuse of force\u201d clause of the ACCA, the Court also found the crime of robbery by fear to be a violent felony under the residual clause, <em>id. </em>at 1060-63, and that reasoning is relevant to our analysis of aggravated assault under the residual clause. First, the \u201cfear\u201d at issue under the assault statute similarly requires, based on the statutory language, that the victim fear \u201cbodily injury\u201d that is \u201cimminent.\u201d Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-101(a)(2). Second, like robbery by fear in <em>Mitchell </em>but unlike generic burglary, assault by fear essentially requires a confrontation between victim and perpetrator, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>thus increasing the risk of physical injury. <em>See Mitchell, </em>743 F.3d at 1062. Additionally, as we explain below, the additional elements of \u00a7 39-13-102(c) require that the confrontation occur after a court has already restrained the perpetrator from engaging in this conduct with the victim, which would seem to only heighten the likelihood of violent confrontation or escalation given the circumstances that led to the restraining order in the first place. The reasoning of <em>Mitchell </em>thus extends to the present case, and violation of \u00a7 39-13-102(c) by commission of assault by fear presents the requisite level of risk of physical injury to qualify as a violent felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The statute\u2019s third form of assault, committed by \u201ccaus[ing] physical contact with another [that] a reasonable person would regard ... as extremely offensive or provocative,\u201d Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-101(a)(3), presents the most difficulty. The Tennessee Supreme Court has defined \u201cextremely offensive or provocative\u201d contact to include such acts as \u201ckissing without one\u2019s consent, cutting one\u2019s hair without consent, or spitting in one\u2019s face.\u201d <em>State v. Smiley, </em>38 S.W.3d 521, 525 (Tenn.2001). Additionally, \u201c\u00a7 39-13-101(a)(3) applies only to that physical contact which does not involve physical bodily injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While the definition does not include physical injury as an element of the completed offense, the relevant consideration under the residual clause is whether the conduct \u201c \u2018presents a serious <em>potential risk </em>of physical injury,\u2019 \u201d not whether the crime requires physical injury in order to be completed. <em>James, </em>550 U.S. at 203, 127 S.Ct. 1586 (emphasis added) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)). In this regard, this Court\u2019s prior decision in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>707 F.3d 655 (6th Cir.2013), is instructive. In <em>Johnson, </em>the Court analyzed whether a conviction for first-degree stalking in Kentucky qualified as a violent felony. <em>Id. </em>at 658. The Court determined that first-degree stalking could be predicated on making a threat of sexual contact, with sexual contact including \u201c \u2018any touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person for the purpose of gratifying the sexual desire of either party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662 (ellipsis omitted) (quoting Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 510.010(7)). The Court noted \u201cthe slightest touch to a sexual or intimate part of another\u201d was covered under the statute. <em>Id. </em>However, the Court also explained that the statute required a \u201ccourse of conduct,\u201d meaning two or more instances of similar behavior against a victim; thus, a person who commits first-degree stalking has committed such conduct at least twice. <em>Id. </em>at 664. Additionally, the statute at issue in <em>Johnson </em>required the violator to meet one of the following additional requirements: be subject to a protective order as to the victim, currently have a criminal complaint pending by the same victim, have pled guilty to certain crimes against the same victim within the past five years, or have committed the act of stalking with a deadly weapon. <em>Id. </em>at 659-60 (citing Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 508.140). In light of both the \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d and protective order elements, the Court held that such circumstances created a situation where \u201ceven the most innocuous sexual contact could elicit an intensified response that might result in violent confrontation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664. Accordingly, the Court held the crime of first-degree stalking under the relevant Kentucky statute was a violent felony. <em>Id. </em>at 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The statute at issue here encompasses analogous behaviors. While a violation could similarly be predicated on slight touch, such action would nonetheless have to be \u201cextremely offensive and provocative\u201d and have to occur in violation of a restraining order explicitly protecting the victim from such contact by the perpetrator. Additionally, while there is no explicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>\u201ccourse of conduct\u201d requirement under TenmCode Ann. \u00a7 39-13-102(c), the fact that action must be taken in violation of some form of restraining order illustrates that there is prior underlying conduct from the perpetrator serving as the basis for the restraining order in the first instance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, violation of TenmCode Ann. \u00a7 39-13-102(c) premised upon \u201cextremely offensive or provocative\u201d contact assault presents a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury\u201d based on our reasoning in <em>Johnson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Lastly, as violation of TenmCode Ann. \u00a7 39-13-102(c) may be based on attempt crimes, we address whether an attempt to cause bodily injury or attempt to assault presents a sufficient level of risk to qualify as a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>James, </em>attempt crimes are not excluded from the reach of the residual clause of the ACCA; instead, they are simply subject to the same analysis as completed crimes. 550 U.S. at 198-201, 127 S.Ct. 1586. In fact, <em>James </em>explained that there may be certain crimes where an attempt actually involves a greater risk of physical injury than a completed crime, as a preventative, confrontational intervention by the police, a bystander, or the potential victim often results. <em>Id. </em>at 204, 127 S.Ct. 1586. Additionally, the Supreme Court found salient whether the law at issue requires an \u201c \u2018overt act\u2019 \u201d towards the completion of the crime, beyond \u201c[m]ere preparation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202, 127 S.Ct. 1586 (quoting <em>Jones v. State, </em>608 So.2d 797, 799 (Fla.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Tennessee requires for attempt culpability \u201cconduct [that] constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of the offense,\u201d TenmCode Ann. \u00a7 39-12-101(a)(3), which involves something more than preparation, albeit perhaps less than an \u201covert act,\u201d <em>see State v. Reeves, </em>916 S.W.2d 909, 910-14 (Tenn.1996); <em>see also </em>TenmCode Ann. \u00a7 39-12-101 Tennessee Sentencing Commission cmts. (\u201cSubdivision (a)(3) provides that the point of attempt responsibility, <em>beyond mere preparation </em>but short of the completed offense, is reached when an individual\u2019s intentional acts constitute a \u2018substantial step toward the commission of the offense.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added)). In light of our analysis of the elements of \u00a7 39-13-102(c), and Tennessee\u2019s requirement that a \u201csubstantial step\u201d be taken towards completion for attempt crimes, attempting to either (1) cause bodily injury or (2) assault a person under the additional circumstances required by \u00a7 39-13-102(c) presents a similar risk of physical injury as the completed crimes; thus, the risk of physical injury for violation of \u00a7 39-13-102(c) based on attempt is sufficiently similar to an enumerated offense under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">As each potential form of violation of TenmCode Ann. \u00a7 39-13-102(c) presents a level of risk similar to an enumerated of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>fense, namely burglary, we now analyze, to the extent it may be necessary, whether such violations involve \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\u201d conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">ii. \u201cPurposeful, Violent, and Aggressive\u201d Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Where a crime has a \u201cstringent <em>mens rea </em>requirement,\u201d such as requiring intentional or knowing conduct, the crime is generally sufficiently \u201cpurposeful.\u201d <em>Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2275-76. \u201cAggressive, violent acts are \u2018aimed at other persons or property where persons might be located and thereby injured.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>743 F.3d at 1062 (quoting <em>United States v. Vanhook, </em>640 F.3d 706, 714 (6th Cir.2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">As to the purposeful requirement, it is clear that the statute at issue requires that the perpetrator commit the underlying conduct \u2014 cause or attempt to cause bodily harm, or assault or attempt to assault\u2014 either <em>knowingly </em>or <em>intentionally. </em>As this Court has repeatedly explained, \u201c[a] fundamental canon of statutory construction is that when interpreting statutes, the language of the statute is the starting point for interpretation, and it should also be the ending point if the plain meaning of the language is clear.\u201d <em>United States v. Roth, </em>628 F.3d 827, 833 (6th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Despite Bell\u2019s protests to the contrary, the statute\u2019s language stating that the perpetrator must \u201cintentionally or knowingly attempt[] to cause or cause[ ] bodily injury or commit[ ] or attempt[] to commit an <em>assault,\u201d </em>clearly presents a <em>mens rea </em>requirement of intentional or knowing for both causing bodily harm <em>and </em>committing assault. Additionally, Bell\u2019s argument that the statutory language of \u00a7 39-13-102(c) requiring an intentional or knowing crime may still encompass recklessness misreads applicable Tennessee law, which provides that \u201c[w]hen recklessness suffices to establish an element, that element is also established if a person acts intentionally or knowingly.\u201d Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39 \u2014 11\u2014 301(a)(2) (2006). As one Tennessee court explained: \u201cThe statutory scheme creates a hierarchy, and, while each of the four mental elements are unique, the lesser levels of culpability are included within the greater,\u201d thus, \u201c[t]he state cannot prove that an offense was committed \u2018knowingly\u2019 without proving that it was committed \u2018recklessly.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Crowe, </em>914 S.W.2d 933, 937 (Tenn.Ct.Crim.App.1995). However, under this statutory scheme \u2014 and as a general rule for <em>mens rea </em>\u2014 \u201c[t]he converse ... is not true. A \u2018reckless\u2019 act is not necessarily done \u2018knowingly.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 937 n. 2. Bell points to language in <em>Crowe </em>that explains Tennessee courts may properly instruct a jury on \u201crecklessness\u201d where the defendant has been charged with a \u201cknowing\u201d violation. <em>Id. </em>at 937. However, in <em>Crowe, </em>the defendant conceded that he had been charged under a section of the aggravated assault statute that provides for culpability based on intentional, knowing, or reckless conduct, and his objection to the jury instruction arose solely because the language of the indictment against him used only the word \u201cknowingly,\u201d and thus, he unsuccessfully argued, he was only on notice to prepare a defense against knowing conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 936. Therefore, while knowing or intentional conduct will always suffice to prove recklessness, it does not follow, as Bell argues, that proving an act was committed recklessly suffices to prove it was committed knowingly or intentionally. Accordingly, as Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-102(c) contains a \u201cstringent <em>mens rea </em>requirement\u201d of knowing or intentional action, the conduct covered is sufficiently \u201cpurposeful\u201d to constitute a violent felony. <em>See Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2275-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">With regard to aggressiveness and violence, to the extent they are still required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>after <em>Sykes, </em>violations of Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-102(c) are also violent and aggressive. Any violation of \u00a7 39-13-102(c) must be necessarily be \u201caimed at\u201d a specific person or persons, such that the \u201ccrime ... occurs not only where a person <em>might </em>be located, but where the presence of another is assured with absolute certainty.\u201d <em>See Mitchell, </em>743 F.3d at 1062 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted) (emphasis added). Further, as we have explained above in our analysis of level of risk, all violations of \u00a7 39-13-102(c) will involve conduct that may \u201cthereby injure[ ]\u201d another person. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, aggravated <em>assault </em>under Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-102(c) requires sufficiently \u201cviolent\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d conduct to constitute a violent felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">In conclusion, because the crime of aggravated assault under Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-102(c) categorically presents a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d that is \u201croughly similar, in kind as well as in degree posed\u201d to the enumerated offenses, <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 142-43, 128 S.Ct. 1581, violations of TenmCode Ann. \u00a7 39-13-102(c) are categorically violent felonies under the ACCA. Accordingly, the sentence imposed by the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-13\">. The current version of the statute is essentially identical to the 2006 version. <em>See </em>Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-102(c) (2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b628-14\">. Under this section of the guidelines, a \"crime of violence\u201d is defined as \"any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that (1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.2(a) (2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\">. The exact language of the statute provides the violator must \u201chav[e] been enjoined or restrained by an order, diversion or probation agreement of a court of competent jurisdiction,\u201d without specific reference to a particular type of restraining order. Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-102(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b633-6\">. While not explicitly referenced in Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-102(c), the statutory framework for obtaining a restraining order in Tennessee further supports this contention. Under Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 36-3-605, in order to obtain a protection order, the person requesting the order must \u201cprove[ an] allegation of domestic abuse, stalking or sexual assault by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d in a hearing before a court. <em>See also Cable v. Clemmons, </em>36 S.W.3d 39, 41-42 (Tenn.2001) (explaining the general process for obtaining an order of protection). We recognize that the language of \u00a7 39-13-102(c) appears to encompass a range of court orders and other agreements broader than those provided by \u00a7 36-3-605. However, we are satisfied that, based on \u00a7 39-13-102(c)\u2019s underlying requirement of some form of order or agreement prohibiting what is clearly already illegal conduct, in \"the ordinary case\u201d violation of this statute presents a heightened risk of violent confrontation based on past behavior, thus establishing a \"serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>See James, </em>550 U.S. at 208, 127 S.Ct. 1586.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
