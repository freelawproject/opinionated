He argues that the district court erred by grounding his sentence in a desire to impose \u201cjust punishment for the offense.\u201d <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843-44 (5th Cir.2011); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-22\">Because Ward did not object to the revocation sentence, it is considered for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259 (5th Cir.2009). To establish plain error, he must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes this showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but will do so only if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Ward has not made the showing necessary to receive relief under this \u201cdifficult\u201d standard. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-23\">The record does not support Ward\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s choice of sentence was driven by a desire for that sentence to meet the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) goal of \u201cjust punishment for the offense.\u201d To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>be clear, the district court never used the specific phrase \u201cjust punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The word \u201cpunishment\u201d was used several times by both the district court and defense counsel. When these remarks are considered in context, it appears the court simply used this word to speak of the penalty that Ward was to receive for violating the terms of his supervised release. \u201c[T]he goal of revocation is to punish a defendant for violating the terms of the supervised release.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 843. This interpretation of the remarks is supported by the district court\u2019s written judgment which stated: \u201cthe court considered all relevant factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) that are proper for consideration in a revocation context.\u201d It is also supported by the district court\u2019s following statement at the revocation hearing: \u201cI think a sentence of the kind I\u2019ve described is one that would adequately and appropriately address all the factors the Court should consider in a revocation context under 18 United States Code Section 3553(a).\u201d But even assuming there is a lingering ambiguity regarding the district court\u2019s use of the word \u201cpunishment,\u201d this court has stated: \u201cBecause [the defendant] did not object at sentencing and give the court an opportunity to clarify itself, we are unable to conclude that the court based his sentence on an impermissible factor.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez-Martinez, </em>485 F.3d 270, 274 (5th Cir.2007). In this case, Ward has not shown plain error in connection with the district court\u2019s references to \u201cpunishment\u201d at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b538-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
