He sought both monetary and injunctive relief for his claims. The district court stayed his claims for illegal search and seizure to the extent that he requested monetary relief and ordered him to file an update on the status of his state criminal proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>every 90 days. The district court dismissed his requests for injunctive relief under the <em>Younger </em>abstention doctrine, <em>see Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), and dismissed his remaining claims for failure to state a claim or as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">On appeal, Boyd argues that this court should decide the constitutional issues set forth in his claims and order the state prosecutor to provide him with copies of his state criminal proceedings to provide evidentiary support for his claims. He argues that the district court erred in construing his request for monetary relief as being based solely upon his claims of illegal search and seizure. He argues that this court should order the defendants to pay him $6 million in damages. He also requests appointment of counsel and an order requiring an evidentiary hearing. To the extent that Boyd attempts to rely upon evidence submitted for the first time on appeal, we may not consider that evidence or his arguments that rely upon that evidence. <em>See Theriot v. Parish of Jefferson, </em>185 F.3d 477, 491 n. 26 (5th Cir.1999). \u201c[W]e may affirm on any ground supported by the record, including one not reached by the district court. This is so even if neither the appellant nor the district court addressed the ground, so long as the argument was raised below.\u201d <em>Gilbert v. Donahoe, </em>751 F.3d 303, 311 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In his amended complaint, Boyd stated that the relief he wanted was \u201ccharges dropped/immediate release from incarceration. Compensation for loss of wages &amp; pain &amp; suffering [sic] physical/emotional distress.\u201d Thus, Boyd\u2019s broad request was for both injunctive relief and for damages as to all of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">As to Boyd\u2019s request for injunctive relief, all of his claims must be dismissed pursuant to the <em>Younger </em>abstention doctrine. We review a district court\u2019s abstention ruling for an abuse of discretion but we review <em>de novo </em>whether the elements of <em>Younger </em>abstention are present. <em>Bice v. Louisiana Public Defender Bd., </em>677 F.3d 712, 716 (5th Cir.2012). Boyd requested that the district court enjoin the state criminal proceedings, which is precisely the crux of what <em>Younger </em>forbids a federal court to do. <em>See Younger, </em>401 U.S. at 40-41, 91 S.Ct. 746; <em>Ballard v. Wilson, </em>856 F.2d 1568, 1569-70 (5th Cir.1988); <em>see also Price v. Porter, </em>351 Fed.Appx. 925, 927 (5th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (unpublished). Boyd makes no argument, beyond a conclusory assertion, for why the failure to address his constitutional claims would result in irreparable injury that is both great and immediate, such that <em>Younger </em>should not apply. <em>See Younger, </em>401 U.S. at 46, 91 S.Ct. 746 (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Boyd\u2019s claims to the extent that he seeks injunctive relief for those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">As to Boyd\u2019s request for damages, we have held that <em>Younger </em>is not applicable to claims for damages. <em>See Lewis v. Beddingfield, </em>20 F.3d 123, 125 (5th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Allen v. La. State Bd. of Dentistry, </em>835 F.2d 100, 104 (5th Cir.1988)). Even if <em>Younger </em>applies, the proper course of action is for a district court to stay the claims for damages pending the outcome of the state proceedings, such that they can move forward without interference. <em>Deakins v. Monaghan, </em>484 U.S. 193, 202, 108 S.Ct. 523, 98 L.Ed.2d 529 (1988). However, this preference for a stay applies only where there is \u201cno question that [a complaint] allege[s] injuries under federal law sufficient to justify the District Court\u2019s retention of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>204, 108 S.Ct. 523; <em>Marts v. Hines, </em>68 F.3d 134, 135 &amp; n. 5 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Cassell v. Osborn, </em>Nos. 93-1557, 93-1607, 93-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>2079, 28 F.3d 394, 1994 WL 159424, at *2 (1st Cir.1994) (unpublished). We have interpreted this limitation to mean that a stay is not required where the district court determines that the claim for damages is frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. <em>See Marts, </em>68 F.3d at 135 &amp; n. 5; <em>see also Ballard v. Wilson, </em>856 F.2d 1568, 1569-70 (5th Cir.1988) (\u201c[A] federal district court has no discretion to dismiss <em>cognizable </em>claims for monetary relief which cannot be redressed in a pending state proceeding.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Cassell, </em>23 F.3d at *2-4 (concluding that a district court may proceed to decide whether a claim for damages should be dismissed for failure to state a claim); <em>Williams v. Hepting, </em>844 F.2d 138, 143 (3d Cir.1988) (same); <em>Kelm v. Hyatt, </em>44 F.3d 415, 421 (6th Cir.1995) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">A district court is required to dismiss a prisoner\u2019s civil rights complaint if it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim for relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) &amp; (ii). Because the district court dismissed Boyd\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous or for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915A and \u00a7 1915(e)(2), our review is <em>de novo </em>under the same standard that is used to review a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998) (per curiam). \u201c[A] complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A claim is facially plausible if the plaintiff pleads facts that allow a court \u201cto draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A claim is frivolous if it lacks any arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Samford v. Dretke, </em>562 F.3d 674, 678 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The district court did not err in dismissing Boyd\u2019s malicious-prosecution, illegal-arrest, and bystander-liability claims. In his completed questionnaire, Boyd conceded that he did not know whether Farrin told the alleged lie and that he did not even know if Farrin presented the case to a grand jury, which undermines the validity of his claim against Farrin. In any event, we have held that a claim of malicious prosecution, standing alone, is not a violation of the United States Constitution and that to proceed under \u00a7 1983 such a claim must rest upon a denial of rights secured under federal law. <em>Castellano v. Fragozo, </em>352 F.3d 939, 942 (5th Cir.2003) (en banc). Although the \u201cinitiation of criminal charges without probable cause may set in force events that run afoul of explicit constitutional protection,\u201d those claims are for the \u201clost constitutional rights\u201d and \u201care not claims for malicious prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 953-54. Furthermore, Boyd conceded that his arrest was based on an outstanding municipal warrant for tickets and does not specifically respond to the district court\u2019s conclusion that his arrest was valid because of that warrant. To the extent that Boyd\u2019s claims relied upon verbal threats, he has not stated a constitutional violation. <em>See Bender v. Brumley, </em>1 F.3d 271, 274 n. 4 (5th Cir.1993). Moreover, Boyd could not pursue claims on behalf of his children, and, in any ev\u00e9nt, there is no constitutional right to be free from witnessing a police action. <em>See Coon v. Ledbetter, </em>780 F.2d 1158, 1160-61 (5th Cir.1986) (holding that any person claiming a deprivation of constitutional rights must prove a violation of their personal rights); <em>Grandstaff v. City of Borger, Tex., </em>767 F.2d 161, 172 (5th Cir.1985) (holding that there is no constitutional right to be free from witnessing a police action).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>The district court did err, however, in dismissing Boyd\u2019s excessive-force claim. To prove a claim for excessive force, a plaintiff must show \u201c(1) injury, (2) which resulted directly and only from a use of force that was clearly excessive, and (3) the excessiveness of which was clearly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Elizondo v. Green, </em>671 F.3d 506, 510 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Claims of excessive force involve a fact-intensive inquiry. <em>Newman v. Guedry, </em>703 F.3d 757, 761 (5th Cir.2012). The plaintiff must show he suffered a cognizable injury, which is determined based upon a subjective analysis of the context in which the injury arose. <em>Williams v. Bramer, </em>180 F.3d 699, 703-04 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In his amended complaint and completed questionnaire, Boyd alleged that the ten to fifteen arresting officers assaulted him by violently forcing him to the ground, shoving his head to the ground with assault rifles, and putting their feet on his neck to keep him down. As to his conduct, Boyd alleged that he repeatedly asked the officers why he was being arrested. Boyd further alleged that when the officers finally informed him why they were arresting him, they told him it was for parking tickets. When accepted as true, these allegations are sufficient to state a plausible claim of excessive force. <em>See Williams v. Bramer, </em>180 F.3d 699, 704 (5th Cir.1999) (holding that facts were sufficient to assert an excessive-force claim where plaintiff alleged that officer became frustrated after search and grabbed him by the throat, causing dizziness and loss of breath); <em>Jackson v. City of Beaumont Police Dep\u2019t, </em>958 F.2d 616, 621 (5th Cir.1992) (noting that facts which would allow the determination that officers\u2019 conduct was unreasonable include reasons given by officers for being called to the scene, plaintiffs own conduct during the incident, and other circumstances surrounding arrest). Therefore, the district court erred in dismissing Boyd\u2019s excessive-force claim as either frivolous or for failure to state a claim. <em>See Samford, </em>562 F.3d at 678; <em>Ashcroft, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">In sum, as to Boyd\u2019s request for injunc-tive relief, we affirm the district court on the ground that all of the claims must be dismissed pursuant to the <em>Younger </em>abstention doctrine. As to Boyd\u2019s request for damages, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Boyd\u2019s malicious-prosecution claim, illegal-arrest claim, bystander liability-claim, and all claims to the extent that they rely upon verbal threats. We likewise affirm the district court\u2019s order staying Boyd\u2019s request for damages for his illegal-search-and-seizure claim and requiring Boyd to file an update on the status of his criminal cases every 90 days. We reverse the district court\u2019s order dismissing Boyd\u2019s excessive-force claim and remand for further proceedings. We deny Boyd\u2019s request for appointment of counsel. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212, 213 (5th Cir.1982). We deny Boyd\u2019s request for an order requiring an evidentiary hearing without prejudice to its consideration on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.
