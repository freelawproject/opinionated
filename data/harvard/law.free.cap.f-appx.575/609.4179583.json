BATCHELDER, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Appellant Rodney Monerief Smith appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Appellant contends that he is entitled to a sentence reduction based on the new mandatory minimum sentences for crack cocaine offenders contained in the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372 (\u201cFSA\u201d). He also argues that failing to apply the FSA\u2019s lowered minimum sentence violates his constitutional right to equal protection of the law and his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. In <em>United States v. Blewett, </em>746 F.3d 647 (6th Cir.2013) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1779, 188 L.Ed.2d 607 (2014), we held that the FSA\u2019s new mandatory m\u00ednimums do not apply retroactively, <em>see id. </em>at 649, and that then-prospective application does not violate an individual\u2019s right to equal protection of the law or his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, <em>see id. </em>at 658-60. Our decision in <em>Blewett </em>governs the disposition of this appeal, and we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Appellant\u2019s motion based on our reasoning in <em>Blewett.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
