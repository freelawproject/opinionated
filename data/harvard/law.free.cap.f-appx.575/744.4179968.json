We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2003), and de novo claims of due process violations, <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-22\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that the threats, rock-throwing, and economic deprivation Carrillo-Cocom experienced on account of his membership in the Freemasons, even considered cumulatively, did not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See Nagoulko, </em>333 F.3d at 1016 (discrimination, harassment, and physical encounters without any significant physical violence did not compel finding of past persecution). Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s determination that Carrillo-Cocom failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his Freemason or political party membership. <em>Id. </em>at 1018. We reject Carrillo-Cocom\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s decision lacked sufficient clarity, <em>see Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error and prejudice to prevail on a due process claim), and we reject his contention that the IJ and BIA overlooked key evidence in the record, <em>see Almaghzar v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 915, 921-22 (9th Cir.2006). Accordingly, Carrillo-Cocom\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-23\">Because Carrillo-Cocom failed to meet the lower standard of proof for asylum, his claim for withholding of removal necessari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>ly fails. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b772-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
