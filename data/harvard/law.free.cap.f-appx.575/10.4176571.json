Nov. 22, 2010), <em>dismissing appeal from </em>No. A078 435 429 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 11, 2009). In the same order the IJ also granted Singh\u2019s petition for withholding of removal from the United States;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Singh does not seek review of that portion of the order. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-22\">An applicant who seeks asylum must \u201cdemonstrate!] by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States,\u201d or must dem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>onstrate \u201ceither the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (D). We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s decision that an applicant did not meet his burden to show timely filing, nor do we have jurisdiction to review its determination that there were no changed or extraordinary circumstances excusing the untimeliness. <em>Id. </em>at (a)(3). We retain jurisdiction, however, to review constitutional claims and \u201cquestions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). .</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">In order to determine whether jurisdiction exists in an individual case, the Court \u201cneed[s] to study the arguments asserted\u201d in a petition for review and determine, \u201cregardless of the rhetoric employed in the petition, whether it merely quarrels over the correctness of the factual findings or justification for the discretionary choices, in which case the court would lack jurisdiction, or whether it instead raises a \u2018constitutional claim\u2019 or \u2018question of law,\u2019 \u201d which are issues that may be addressed. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006). A question of law is not implicated \u201cwhen the petition for review essentially disputes the correctness of an IJ\u2019s fact-finding or the wisdom of his exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">On appeal Singh argues that he complied with the one-year filing deadline and in fact signed his first asylum application in the law office of Jaspreet Singh in August or September 2001. He further contends that to the extent his asylum application was untimely it was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. Singh\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision is a quarrel with purely factual issues that he seeks to advance as a due process claim. Because it is not a challenge to the law, we lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>Rosario v. Holder, </em>627 F.3d 58, 61 (2d Cir.2010) (\u201c[T]he BIA\u2019s factfinding, factor-balancing, and exercise of discretion normally do not involve legal or constitutional questions, so we lack jurisdiction to review them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-15\">. At oral argument the Government represented that because Singh's removal was withheld, he is permitted to reside in the United States lawfully unless he commits an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>act that would cause his status to be revoked. The counsel for the Government opined that Singh could adjust his status through \"various ways ... other than through a grant of asylum; for example through employment-based visas, family-based petitions and so forth.\u201d Oral Argument (June 3, 2014) at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>2:48:43, <em>Singh v.
