Holder, </em>742 F.3d 171 (4th Cir.2014). We accordingly grant the petition for review in part and remand Lin\u2019s family planning claim to the Board for further proceedings in light of our decision in <em>Ai Hua Chen.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">Next, we have reviewed the record and claims relevant to Lin\u2019s claim based on her Christian faith, and conclude that the record evidence does not compel a ruling contrary to that of the Board, and that substantial evidence supports the finding that Lin did not establish eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal on this ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We therefore deny the petition for review in part with respect to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">Accordingly, we grant the petition for review in part and remand, and deny the petition for review in part. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-15\">\n<em>PETITION GRANTED IN PART AND REMANDED; AND DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-11\">. In her opening brief, Lin fails to raise any meaningful challenge to the denial of her request for protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Accordingly, we conclude that Lin has abandoned her CAT claim on appeal. <em>See Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 189 n. 7 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b217-24\">. The Board\u2019s further proceedings may include a review of the Immigration Judge's determination that Lin\u2019s asylum application is time-barred and that she failed to show that she qualified under any exception to the one-year filing requirement. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
