LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Juan Carlos Angulo-Lopez appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to modify his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">In 1993, this court affirmed Angulo-Lopez\u2019s convictions on eleven counts of drug trafficking. <em>United States v. Angulo-Lopez, </em>7 F.3d 1506, 1508, 1512 (10th Cir.1993), <em>superseded on other grounds as recognized in United States v. Kissick, </em>69 F.3d 1048 (10th Cir.1995) <em>(abrogated on other grounds as recognized in United States v. Horey, </em>333 F.3d 1185 (10th Cir.2003)). We stated that \u201c[t]he evidence established that Mr. Angulo-Lopez was involved in a conspiracy to distribute 47.82 kilograms of cocaine base.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1509. He was sentenced to two concurrent life sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">After the United States Sentencing Commission made Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines retroactive, Angulo-Lopez moved to reduce his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. McGee, </em>615 F.3d 1287, 1290 (10th Cir.2010) (consolidated appeal, noting that Amendment 706 altered the Drug Quantity Table in the United States Sentencing Guidelines to provide a reduction in base offense levels for crack-cocaine-related offenses). We affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of Angulo-Lopez\u2019s motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1290, 1293. In 2012, Angulo-Lopez filed a pro se motion for a modification of his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), seeking relief under Sentencing Guidelines Amendment 750. The district court denied the motion. Angulo-Lopez appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">\u201cAmendment 750 retroactively implemented the Fair Sentencing Act, which reduced the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences from 100:1 to 18:1.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilkerson, </em>485 Fed.Appx. 318, 320 (10th Cir.2012) (unpublished). \u201cThe amendment altered the drug-quantity tables in the Guidelines, increasing the required quantity to be subject to each base offense level in a manner proportionate to the statutory change to the mandatory minimums effectuated by the\u201d Fair Sentencing Act. <em>United States v. Osborn, </em>679 F.3d 1193, 1194 (10th Cir.2012) (quotation omitted). However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-14\">[i]n determining whether, and to what extent, a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement is warranted, the court shall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment(s) to the guidelines listed in subsection (c) had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced. In making such determination, the court shall substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c) for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>tenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">U.S. S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1). \u201cAmendment 750 \u2018does not lower the sentences for offenses\u2019 that involve \u20188.5 kilograms or more\u2019 of crack cocaine.\u201d <em>United States v. McIntyre, </em>470 Fed.Appx. 717, 718 (10th Cir.) (unpublished) (quoting U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 750 cmt.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 492, 184 L.Ed.2d 309 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">\u201cUnder \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B), a sentence reduction is not authorized if the amendment at issue \u2018does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Darton, </em>595 F.3d 1191, 1194 (10th Cir.2010); <em>see also Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 821, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (\u201cAny reduction must be consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d). \u201c[District courts cannot recalculate aspects of a sentence that are unaffected by a retroactively applicable amendment to the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Battle, </em>706 F.3d 1313, 1317 (10th Cir.2013). Because Angulo-Lo-pez\u2019s sentence was based on 47.82 kilograms of cocaine base, far above the quantity affected by Amendment 750, the amendment did not have the effect of lowering his Guidelines range. The district court was therefore correct in determining that a sentence reduction was not authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the district court is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Angu-lo-Lopez\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b858-10\"> After examining appellant's brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-11\">. Angulo-Lopez filed a document titled \u201cRequest to Take Judicial Notice,\u201d in which he requested that this court take notice that the government did not file a brief. We construe the document as a motion, but note as a factual matter that the government filed a brief in this case. Therefore the motion is DENIED. We also note that the document contains language that could be interpreted as an abandonment of this appeal. Because An-gulo-Lopez references another case number and is proceeding pro se, we have addressed the appeal on the merits. <em>See Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (per curiam) (\"A document filed pro se is to be liberally construed. ...\u201d (quotation omitted))</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
