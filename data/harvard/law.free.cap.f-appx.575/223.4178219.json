Relying on <em>National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2566, 183 L.Ed.2d 450 (2012) <em>(National </em>Federation), he contends that \u00a7 922(g)(1) exceeds Congress\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause. He argues that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied because his factual resume did not state that his possession of the firearm was an economic activity and failed to reflect that he was engaged in the relevant market at the time of the regulated conduct. Further, he contends that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is facially unconstitutional because <em>National Federation </em>interpreted the Commerce Clause to mandate that \u201cCongress may regulate only ongoing economic activity,\u201d and his possession of a firearm purchased many years ago does not qualify. Moody raises these arguments to preserve them for further review. The Government moves for summary affirmance, or in the alternative, for an extension of time to file an appellee\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-22\">In <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>889 F.2d 580, 583 (5th Cir.1989), and decisions fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>lowing, this court held that \u00a7 922(g)(1) was a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s authority under the Commerce Clause. <em>See United States v. Alcantar, </em>733 F.3d 143, 145 (5th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1570, 188 L.Ed.2d 579 (2014). In <em>Alcantar, </em>we determined that <em>National Federation </em>did not overrule this court\u2019s precedent upholding \u00a7 922(g)(1). <em>See id. </em>at 146. Whether our review is de novo or for plain error, Moody\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1) is foreclosed. <em>See id. </em>at 146 &amp; n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Therefore, we GRANT the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance, DENY its alternative motion for an extension of time to file an appellee\u2019s brief, and AFFIRM Moody\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b251-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
