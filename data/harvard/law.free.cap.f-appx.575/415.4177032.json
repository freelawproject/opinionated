He argues that his petition is in fact not \u201csecond or successive\u201d within the meaning of the statute. We determine that his petition would be successive, and deny his motion for authorization to file it.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">Parker pleaded guilty to eleven counts of an indictment charging him with conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering, tax evasion, filing a false income tax return, and aiding and abetting related to various fraudulent loans guaranteed by the United States Export-Import Bank. Parker was sentenced to 60 months on the counts of conspiracy and tax evasion; 117 months on the counts of wire fraud, money laundering, and aiding and abetting; and 36 months on the counts of filing false income tax returns, all terms to be served concurrently. Parker was ordered to serve concurrent three-year periods of supervised release as to all counts, and he was ordered to pay $10 million in restitution and to forfeit real and personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-14\">On direct appeal, this court rejected Parker\u2019s challenge to his guilty plea. <em>United States v. Parker, </em>372 Fed.Appx. 558, 560-63 (5th Cir.2010). Parker moved for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The magistrate judge concluded that the \u00a7 2255 motion was without merit and recommended that it be denied. However, the magistrate judge also determined that Parker correctly argued that he should not have been sentenced to three-year periods of supervised release as to counts 27 and 28, relating to the filing of false income tax returns under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206, because those terms exceeded the statutory maximum of one year. The magistrate judge rejected Parker\u2019s argument that a new sentencing hearing was required to correct the error. The district court adopted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>findings and conclusions of the magistrate judge, and entered judgment denying and dismissing the \u00a7 2255 motion. The district court also entered a third amended judgment correcting the periods of supervised release with respect to counts 27 and 28.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because all terms of supervised release are to run concurrently, Parker\u2019s overall length of supervised release on all counts remains three years. This court dismissed a direct appeal of the amended judgment, reasoning that Parker raised no issue related to the amended judgment but instead sought to raise claims rejected by the district court in his \u00a7 2255 petition, and thus required a certificate of appeala-bility that he had not obtained. <em>United States v. Parker, </em>520 Fed.Appx. 244, 245 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Parker filed another motion under \u00a7 2255, which the district court denied as successive and unauthorized, and, in the alternative, with prejudice as barred by limitations. Parker now moves in this court for leave to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Before filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court, a mov-ant must obtain leave from this court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2255(h), 2244(b)(3)(A). This court may authorize the filing of a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion only if the movant makes a prima facie showing that his claims rely on either:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">(1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-12\">(2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">\u00a7 2255(h); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">Parker makes no argument that his petition satisfies these requirements, but instead invokes <em>Magwood v. Patterson, </em>561 U.S. 320, 130 S.Ct. 2788, 177 L.Ed.2d 592 (2010), and <em>In re Lampton, </em>667 F.3d 585 (5th Cir.2012). Liberally construed, Parker\u2019s argument is that he is not subject to the successive filing requirements because the third amended judgment constituted an intervening judgment that he has not yet challenged in a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Magwood, </em>561 U.S. at 339-42, 130 S.Ct. 2788.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his motion and petition, Parker asserts numerous substantive issues that call into question the constitutionality of all of his counts of conviction. None of his claims pertain specifically to the new terms of supervised release as to counts 27 and 28. According to Parker\u2019s argument, the third amended judgment is a new, intervening judgment with regard to all his convictions and his sentence, and thus under <em>Magwood, </em>he may now challenge all the convictions and the entire sentence in a second \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">A \u00a7 2255 motion is not second or successive merely because it follows an earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>motion. <em>Magwood, </em>561 U.S. at 331-32,130 S.Ct. 2788; <em>Lampton, </em>667 F.3d at 588. The phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d is \u201cinterpreted with respect to the judgment challenged.\u201d <em>Lampton, </em>667 F.3d at 588 (quoting <em>Magwood, </em>561 U.S. at 332-33, 130 S.Ct. 2788). \u201cAs a consequence, where the granting of an initial habeas petition results in the issuance of a new, intervening judgment of conviction, \u2018an application challenging the resulting new judgment is not second or successive\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Lampton, </em>667 F.3d at 588 (quoting <em>Magwood, </em>561 U.S. at 341-42, 130 S.Ct. 2788). We have previously stated that \u201cWhether a new judgment has intervened between two habeas petitions, such that the second petition can be filed without this Court\u2019s permission, depends on whether a new sentence has been imposed.\u201d <em>Lampton, </em>667 F.3d at 588 (citing <em>Burton v. Stewart, </em>549 U.S. 147, 156, 127 S.Ct. 793, 166 L.Ed.2d 628 (2007) (equating \u201cjudgment\u201d in criminal case with \u201csentence\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">However, the fact that a judgment, including a sentence, is amended \u201eas a result of an initial \u00a7 2255 petition is not necessarily sufficient to render it a \u201cnew, intervening judgment\u201d under <em>Magwood. See Lampton, </em>667 F.3d at 587-88. We must consider the impetus and effect of the amended judgment. For example, in <em>Lampton, </em>the petitioner\u2019s one conspiracy conviction was overturned on a \u00a7 2255 motion on double jeopardy grounds, while his three convictions for engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise (CCE) were upheld. <em>Id. </em>at 586-87. Lampton had been sentenced to life imprisonment on all four convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 587. When Lampton filed another \u00a7 2255 motion, he contended that it was not successive because the criminal judgment had been amended. <em>Id. </em>at 587. This court held that the motion was successive because, despite the amended judgment, Lampton was still serving the same life sentence for the CCE conviction, and his \u201cprior \u00a7 2255 petition did not yield a new judgment of conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">In the instant case, the district court vacated the three-year periods of supervised release as to counts 27 and 28 because those terms exceeded the statutory maximum of one year, and it entered a third amended judgment imposing one-year periods of supervised release as to those counts and left intact the sentences imposed for the other counts of conviction. This amended judgment is unlike those that courts have found to constitute new, intervening judgments. In <em>Magwood </em>itself, the second-in-time habeas petition followed a grant of habeas relief and a resentencing proceeding. 561 U.S. at 323, 130 S.Ct. 2788; <em>see also Wentzell v. Neven, </em>674 F.3d 1124, 1126-28 (9th Cir.2012) (holding that second habeas petition not successive under <em>Magwood </em>where it was filed after state courts granted partial relief and issued amended judgment); <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>623 F.3d 41, 45-46 (2d Cir.2010) (\u201cMagwood. applies in a situation where, as here, a prisoner who successfully challenged his judgment of conviction in a prior \u00a7 2255 motion files a subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Here, although the initial \u00a7 2255 petition prompted the amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>ment to the judgment, the district court did not grant habeas relief but merely corrected the petitioner\u2019s sentence. <em>See Parker, </em>520 Fed.Appx. at 245. There was no need for the district court to make any reassessment of the sentencing evidence or law in correcting the judgment. <em>See Magwood, </em>561 U.S. at 339, 130 S.Ct. 2788; <em>Lampton, </em>667 F.3d at 588-89. The amended judgment is not the result of a new proceeding or resentencing, and the amended judgment had no effect on the overall length of Parker\u2019s supervised release. <em>See Magwood, </em>561 U.S. at 339, 341-42, 130 S.Ct. 2788; <em>Lampton, </em>667 F.3d at 588-89. Therefore, the district court did not enter a new sentence as contemplated by <em>Magwood. See Lampton, </em>667 F.3d at 589. In the circumstances presented by this case, the amended judgment is not a new, intervening judgment under <em>Magivood </em>and <em>Lampton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Parker\u2019s petition is thus a \u201csecond or successive petition\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2255. He makes no argument that if his petition is deemed successive, it satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 2255(h). Parker\u2019s motion for authorization to file this second \u00a7 2255 petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Parker\u2019s motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 petition is DENIED. Parker has also moved to recall the mandate of the third amended judgment, for a hearing, for a refund of attorney fees, and for leave to conduct discovery. We likewise DENY those requests.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
