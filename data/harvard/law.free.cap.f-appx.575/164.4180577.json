We granted a certificate of appealability and the Government\u2019s unopposed motion to remand. After an evidentiary hearing on the claims for which the certificate was granted, the district court denied relief. Musgrove appeals the court\u2019s order on remand denying \u00a7 2255 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-22\">The order entered on remand is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (2012). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2012). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-23\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Musgrove has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We deny Mus-grove\u2019s motion to appoint counsel and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
