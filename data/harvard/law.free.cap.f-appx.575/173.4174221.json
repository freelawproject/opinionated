We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny Smith\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel and affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Smith v. Owens, </em>No. 7:13-cv-00060-SGW-PMS, 2013 WL 6709467 (W.D.Va. Dec. 18, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-20\">We note that our holding with respect to Smith\u2019s excessive force claim is determined by the deferential standard of review. Following a bench trial, this court may reverse a district court\u2019s factual findings only if they are clearly erroneous. <em>Roanoke Cement Co. v. Falk Corp., </em>413 F.3d 431, 433 (4th Cir.2005). The area of the prison in which Smith alleges the assault took place \u2014 the kitchen hallway \u2014 is not covered by the prison\u2019s surveillance system, so the district court\u2019s findings as to the incident were necessarily based on assessments of witness credibility. \u201c[Wjhen a district court\u2019s factual finding in a bench trial is based upon assessments of witness credibility, such finding is deserving of the highest degree of appellate deference.\u201d <em>Evergreen Int'l, S.A. v. Norfolk Dredging Co., </em>531 F.3d 302, 308 (4th Cir.2008) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Because the district court\u2019s factual findings are not clearly erroneous, we must affirm those findings and the judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-22\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
