We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Lemusu contends that he is entitled to equitable tolling because he was placed in administrative segregation, relied on inadequate legal assistance from a fellow inmate, and was misled by the district court\u2019s affirmative misrepresentations. We review the district court\u2019s equitable tolling decision de novo. <em>See United States v. Battles, </em>362 F.3d 1195, 1196 (9th Cir.2004). Lemusu\u2019s claim to equitable tolling fails because he has not established that the alleged impediments were \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d that prevented timely filing of his section 2255 motion. <em>See Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U.S. 408, 418, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005) (equitable tolling available where the petitioner shows \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">Lemusu contends that his actual innocence excuses his untimely filing. Assuming this argument is properly before the court, it fails because Lemusu has not demonstrated that, in light of new evidence, it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See McQuiggin v. Perkins, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 1928, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-14\">Lemusu\u2019s motion filed on March 11, 2013, requesting an expansion of the certificate of appealability is denied. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 22-l(e); <em>Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1104-05 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b834-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
