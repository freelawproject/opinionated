(\u201cJostes\u201d), appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing with prejudice Counts One, Two, and Seven of its First Amended Complaint (\u201cFAC\u201d) against defendants. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We reverse. We remand with instructions to grant Jostes leave to file a second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-16\">The district court properly dismissed Count One (breach of contract), Count Two (wrongful termination), and Count Seven (alter-ego liability) of the FAC as pled. Count One fails because Jostes did not adequately allege that any of defendants\u2019 modifications applied retroactively to work that Jostes had already completed. <em>See Rubenstein v. Sela, </em>137 Ariz. 563, 672 P.2d 492, 493 (1983). Count Two fails because Jostes\u2019s allegations do not provide fair notice of its claim that defendants breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. <em>See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). The district court properly dismissed Count Seven because Jostes did not adequately plead any substantive cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-17\">However, the district court erred in dismissing Counts One, Two, and Seven without giving Jostes an opportunity to amend the FAC. Jostes requested an opportunity to amend in its response to defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. The FAC was the first complaint to which defendants responded, and amendment would not clearly be futile. <em>See AE ex rel. Hernandez v. Cnty. of Tulare, </em>666 F.3d 631, 636 (9th Cir.2012); <em>Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>519 F.3d 1025, 1034 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-18\">The district court should have allowed Jostes to amend Count One to allege that defendants retroactively provided reduced payments that they owed for completed work. Such allegations could state a claim under Arizona law. <em>State v. Gregg, </em>18 Ariz. 121, 157 P. 227, 228 (1916); <em>see also Demasse v. ITT Corp., </em>194 Ariz. 500, 984 P.2d 1138, 1144 n. 3 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"A3_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>The district court should have allowed Jostes to amend Count Two because it is not clear that Jostes could not plead a claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Arizona law. <em>See Bike Fashion Corp. v. Kramer, </em>202 Ariz. 420, 46 P.3d 431, 434-35 (2002) (\u201c[A] party can breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing both by exercising express discretion in a way inconsistent with a party\u2019s reasonable expectations and by acting in ways not expressly excluded by the contract\u2019s terms but which nevertheless bear adversely on the party\u2019s reasonably expected benefits of the bargain.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">We decline to reach the merits of Count Seven. If Jostes amends Counts One and Two, it is free to re-plead its claim for alter-ego liability. The district court may then consider the merits of that claim in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b763-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
