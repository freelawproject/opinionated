Following removal, the federal district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the case. Thao-Xiong appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Thao-Xiong executed a promissory note for $179,200 in June 2006 to American Mortgage, who secured the note with an adjustable rate mortgage on her Hennepin County home and designated Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) as its nominee. Thao-Xiong defaulted on her mortgage sometime after the interest rate reset in July 2009. The assistant secretary of MERS, Brittney Jones, acting on behalf of American Mortgage, assigned the mortgage to CitiMort-gage on January 9, 2012, though the assignment was not recorded until January 20. A notice of pendency to foreclose the mortgage was executed by Brian Liebo of the Usset law firm on behalf of CitiMort-gage on January 17, notarized on January 19, and recorded on January 20. Beginning on January 21 and running for six weeks, CitiMortgage published notice of a March 15 mortgage foreclosure sale. On February 7, CitiMortgage served Thao-Xiong with notices of foreclosure, help for homeowners in foreclosure, and redemption rights. A power of attorney was then filed on February 14 authorizing Liebo and Usset to foreclose on behalf of CitiMort-gage, and a sheriffs sale was held on April 26 after publication of a notice of postponement. The sheriffs certificate of sale indicates that CitiMortgage purchased the home with a bid of just over $81,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">On December 21, 2012, Thao-Xiong filed this action in state court to invalidate the foreclosure and sale, seeking a determination of adverse claims under the Minnesota quiet title statute, and asserting claims of negligence per se and slander of title. The defendants removed the case to federal district court on February 18, 2013 and filed a motion to dismiss on grounds that the facts asserted in the complaint were too speculative to support the claims. After denying Thao-Xiong\u2019s motion to remand to state court on grounds the law firm was fraudulently joined, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss all claims. The district court determined that Thao-Xiong could not bring a quiet title claim because she was in default on her mortgage and therefore lacked \u201cclean hands.\u201d It also determined that the facts asserted in her complaint were \u201ctoo speculative\u201d to support her claims. Thao-Xiong appeals only the dismissal of her quiet title claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">A grant of a motion to dismiss is reviewed de novo, with the facts alleged in the complaint being taken as true. <em>Badrawi v. Wells Fargo Home Mortg., Inc., </em>718 F.3d 756, 758 (8th Cir.2013). In order to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must state \u201c \u2018enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). Pleadings must contain sufficient factual content to \u201c \u2018allow[ ] the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009)). \u201cLegally insufficient conjecture and \u2018labels and conclusions,\u2019 \u201d do not suffice to state a claim. <em>Karnatcheva v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., </em>704 F.3d 545, 547 (8th Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Twombly, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955). Federal courts applying state law under diversity jurisdiction \u201capply federal pleading standards ... to the state substantive law to determine if a complaint makes out a claim under state law,\u201d <em>Karnatcheva, </em>704 F.3d at 548, and they are bound to follow the law as articulated by the state\u2019s highest court. <em>Badrawi, </em>718 F.3d at 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Thao-Xiong first argues that the district court erred by imposing on her the burden of showing that CitiMortgage\u2019s interest in her home is invalid. She claims that Minnesota law only requires her to plead possession of the property and CitiMort-gage\u2019s adverse interest in it. The burden at the pleading stage of a case is on the plaintiff to state facts which \u201c \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,\u201d\u2019 <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955. In <em>Kamatcheva, </em>we determined that a claim under Minnesota\u2019s quiet title statute \u2014 to which we apply federal pleading standards \u2014 requires facts showing the adverse claim is invalid. 704 F.3d at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Thao-Xiong alternatively argues that CitiMortgage\u2019s interest in her home is invalid because it failed to comply strictly with several of the requirements in the Minnesota statute for foreclosure by advertisement. She asserts that strict compliance with all sections of the statute is required under the Minnesota Supreme Court decision in <em>Ruiz v. 1st Fidelity Loan Servicing, </em>829 N.W.2d 53 (Minn.2013). We note however that <em>Ruiz </em>held only that MinmStat. \u00a7 580.02(3) strictly \u201crequires all assignments of the mortgage to be recorded <em>before </em>the mortgagee has the right to engage in the process of foreclosure by advertisement.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>829 N.W.2d at 57 (emphasis in original). The state supreme court specifically declined to address whether strict compliance with other sections of the statute is also necessary. <em>Id. </em>at 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">For the purposes of this appeal, we assume without deciding that the defendants were required to comply strictly with all of the statutes Thao-Xiong cites.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thao-Xiong asserts the existence of several technical defects in the filings leading to her foreclosure. Some of these defects she asserts for the first time on appeal. Her complaint first alleged \u201cupon information and belief\u2019 that Jones lacked authority to assign the mortgage on behalf of MERS and American Mortgage. She now contends that Jones was an employee of CitiMortgage at the time of the assignment rather than the assistant secretary of MERS as the assignment document states. Thao-Xiong argues that the mortgage assignment thus is void, since CitiMortgage could not assign itself a mortgage it did not own. Even considering Thao-Xiong\u2019s new allegations, she supplies no evidence contradicting the face of the mortgage assignment itself, which plainly indicates Jones\u2019 position at MERS. We therefore conclude that Thao-Xiong has asserted only \u201cinsufficient conjecture\u201d and \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d to support this claim. <em>See Karnatcheva, </em>704 F.3d at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">Thao-Xiong also asserts that Brian Liebo lacked recorded power of attorney when he executed the notice of pendency on behalf of CitiMortgage and that this lack invalidates the foreclosure. However, the relevant statute only requires that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>entity seeking foreclosure by advertisement \u201crecord a notice of the pendency of the foreclosure ... before the first date of publication of the foreclosure notice.\u201d Minn.Stat. \u00a7 580.032(3). It does not require that notice be recorded by someone holding recorded power of attorney. Lie-bo recorded a notice of pendency on behalf of CitiMortgage on January 20, a day before the notice of the mortgage foreclosure was first published. The record thus shows that CitiMortgage complied with the requirements of \u00a7 580.032(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Thao-Xiong also challenges the validity of the power of attorney used to execute the mortgage foreclosure because it was recorded after the first publication of notice of the sale. However, Minn.Stat. \u00a7 580.05 states that an attorney employed to conduct a foreclosure \u201cshall appear by power of attorney executed ... and recorded prior to the sale,\u201d not prior to the publication of notice. Liebo recorded a power of attorney on February 14, more than two months before the April 26 sale. Thao-Xiong now claims for the first time on appeal that the power of attorney filed in this case violates Minn.Stat. \u00a7 582.25(l)(v), a statute of repose. Since Thao-Xiong failed to raise this issue in the district court, we cannot reverse the judgment on that basis. <em>See Campbell v. Davol, Inc., </em>620 F.3d 887, 891 (8th Cir.2010). Finally, Thao-Xiong concedes in her reply a claim which she raises for the first time in her brief and which is plainly contradicted by the record: that CitiMortgage published the notice of sale for only one week, in violation of Minn.Stat. \u00a7 580.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Because Thao-Xiong fails to assert sufficient facts to support her claims, the district court did not err in denying them, and we need not address whether it erred in also determining they were barred by Thao-Xiong\u2019s \u201cunclean hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-6\">. The Honorable Michael J. Davis, Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, adopting the report and recommendation of the Honorable Tony N. Leung, United States Magistrate Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b721-7\">. Thao-Xiong maintains that we misstated Minnesota law on this point in <em>Badrawi v. Wells Fargo Mortg., Inc., </em>718 F.3d 756, 759 (8th Cir.2013). <em>Badrawi </em>considered the Minnesota Court of Appeals decision in Ruiz; which was decided <em>before </em>the subsequent Minnesota Supreme Court decision. We concluded in <em>Badrawi </em>that strict compliance with Minn.Stat. \u00a7 580.032(3) was not required in homeowner suits challenging foreclosures. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
