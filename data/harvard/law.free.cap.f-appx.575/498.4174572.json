He moved for a preliminary injunction, and the district court denied his motion. He filed an appeal from the denial of that motion and a motion to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. The district court denied Sheppard\u2019s motion to proceed IFP under the three-strikes provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">Sheppard has accumulated three strikes, and he fails to show that he was under imminent danger of serious physical injury at the time he sought to file his suit in the district court, proceed with his appeal, or file a motion to proceed IFP. <em>See Ba\u00f1os v. O\u2019Guin, </em>144 F.3d 883, 884 (5th Cir.1998); \u00a7 1915(g). Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that his motion to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED and his appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a preliminary injunction is DISMISSED. The appeal may be reinstated if Sheppard pays the full appellate filing fee within 15 days of this dismissal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b527-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
