We vacate this portion of the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings. Newby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>does not, however, challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (2012) motion. Thus, he has forfeited appellate review of the district court\u2019s decision on that issue, <em>see </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b), and we affirm that portion of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), a one year statute of limitations applies to the filing of a \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f). The limitations period runs from the latest of: (1) \u201cthe date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final;\u201d (2) the date on which any government-imposed impediment to filing the motion is removed; (3) the date on which the asserted constitutional right was recognized and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court; or (4) \u201cthe date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">With regard to subsection (f)(1), it is well settled that finality attaches when the Supreme Court \u201caffirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.\u201d <em>Clay v. United States, </em>537 U.S. 522, 527, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003). Here, the Supreme Court denied Newby\u2019s timely-filed petition for writ of certiorari on March 28, 2011. Thus, his \u00a7 2255 motion, filed on March 22, 2012, was timely under the AEDPA. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Newby\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely filed and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
