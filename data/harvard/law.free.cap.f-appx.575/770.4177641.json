Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b798-14\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-15\">Sodhi Singh-Kaur, a citizen and national of India, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Reviewing for substantial evidence the BIA\u2019s factual findings in this pre-REAL ID Act case, <em>Ghaly v. INS, 58 </em>F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995), including those portions of the IJ\u2019s decision that the BIA has reviewed and adopted, <em>Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-19\">1. At least \u201cone of the identified grounds [for the adverse credibility determination] is supported by substantial evidence and goes to the heart\u201d of Petitioner\u2019s claim. <em>Wang v. INS, </em>352 F.3d 1250, 1259 (9th Cir.2003). For example, Petitioner\u2019s various statements and documentary evidence told different stories about an alleged incident at a temple on June 5, 2003, that led to his arrest in India, and in his Record of Sworn Statement, Petitioner stated that he had never been arrested, which directly contradicted his later testimony about past arrests in India and Cos-ta Rica. The fact and details of Petitioner\u2019s arrest in India were central to his claim. We therefore \u201care bound to accept the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding,\u201d <em>id., </em>which was properly adopted by the BIA, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i). In the absence of credible testimony, nothing in the record compels the conclusion that Petitioner suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on a protected ground, as required to sustain an asylum claim, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13; or that Petitioner\u2019s life or freedom will be threatened if he is removed, as required for withholding of removal, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-20\">2. Petitioner\u2019s CAT claim depends on the same testimony that was found not credible, <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1157 (9th Cir.2003), and nothing else in the record compels the conclusion that Petitioner is more likely than not to be tortured if removed, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>Substantial evidence therefore also supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Petitioner failed to meet his burden to establish a CAT claim. <em>Monjaraz-Munoz v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 892, 895 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b798-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
