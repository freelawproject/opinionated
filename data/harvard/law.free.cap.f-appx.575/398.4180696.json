He concedes that we have previously ruled that the BIA\u2019s \u201cextreme cruelty\u201d and \u201cextreme hardship\u201d determinations are discretionary and non-reviewable, <em>see Wilmore v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 524, 528 (5th Cir.2006), but requests that we revisit the issue in light of his arguments and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kucana v. Holder, </em>558 U.S. 233, 130 S.Ct. 827, 175 L.Ed.2d 694 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-15\">We conclude that <em>Kucana </em>has no bearing on our holding in <em>Wilmore, </em>nor does it affect our decision here. <em>Kucana </em>concerned the application of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), rather than \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae. Specifically, the Court considered \u201cwhether the proscription of judicial review stated in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) applies not only to Attorney General determinations made discretionary by statute, but also to determinations declared discretionary by the Attorney General himself through regulation.\u201d 558 U.S. at 237, 130 S.Ct. 827. The regulation at issue in <em>Ku-cana </em>dealt with a petitioner\u2019s ability to file a motion to reopen his case. <em>Id. </em>at 239, 130 S.Ct. 827. Here, we are not dealing with a determination \u201cdeclared discretionary by the Attorney General ... through regulation.\u201d Rather, we are presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>with a question that falls squarely under a listed provision of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), and which is addressed by our precedent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Jacobs v. Nat\u2019l Drug Intelligence Ctr., </em>548 F.3d 375, 378 (5th Cir.2008) (\u201cIt is a well-settled Fifth Circuit rule of orderliness that one panel of our court may not overturn another panel\u2019s decision, absent an intervening change in the law, such as by a statutory amendment, or the Supreme Court, or our <em>en banc </em>court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we GRANT the government\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
