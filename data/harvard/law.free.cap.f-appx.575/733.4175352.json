Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir.2010). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on inconsistencies within Sun\u2019s testimony regarding when she first intended to apply for asylum and regarding the existence of medical records aside from the abortion certificate. <em>See id. </em>at 1048 (adverse credibility finding reasonable under totality of circumstances). We do not consider Sun\u2019s explanation of memory failure regarding the medical records inconsistency because the BIA did not, <em>see Andia v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 1181, 1184 (9th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (court considers only the grounds relied upon by the BIA), and Sun does not contend the BIA erred by failing to address it, <em>see Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996). Finally, we lack jurisdiction to consider Sun\u2019s argument that she was not given an opportunity to explain the medical records inconsistency at the hearing because she did not exhaust it to the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004). Accordingly, in the absence of credible testimony, Sun\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
