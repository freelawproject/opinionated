In his complaint, Oliver asserted that he was denied adequate medical care and was the victim of excessive force. As relief, Oliver requested that the employees be terminated and criminally prosecuted. On appeal, Oliver argues that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to file objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation was erroneous and should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-20\">A district court is required to dismiss a prisoner\u2019s civil rights complaint if it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim for relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1); \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) &amp; (ii). Oliver is incorrect in his assertion that the district court dismissed his \u00a7 1983 complaint because he failed to timely object to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. The record reflects that the district court dismissed Oliver\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint because the injunctive relief Oliver requested was not only moot due to his transfer to another prison, but improper because the termination of a prison employee is within the discretion of prison officials. The district court further concluded that Oliver\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint was frivolous because Oliver did not have a constitutional right to have the defendants criminally prosecuted. Because Oliver does not challenge the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous, he has abandoned the claims on appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v.
