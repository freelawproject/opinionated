Washington appeals from the judgment of conviction imposed following a trial by jury of a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a) for possession of a counterfeited security and possession of stolen mail in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708. He contends that the district court abused its discretion in admitting hearsay statements. He also asserts that the evidence was insufficient to persuade a rational trier of fact of his guilt of a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-19\">Washington also seeks vacation of the sentence imposed by the district court. He argues that the court erred in denying him a two-level reduction for his acceptance of responsibility and in applying a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>two-level increase for the number of victims of his crimes. He also asserts that the court erred in applying a three-level increase for his role in his criminal activity. He also challenges the court\u2019s finding as to the amount of loss of his victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">We affirm the judgment convicting Washington of the alleged crimes because we are persuaded that the evidence was sufficient and that no prejudicial error occurred in the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. We vacate the sentence, however, and direct the district court to conduct further proceedings and make findings regarding the number of victims of Washington\u2019s crimes, the amount of loss they suffered, and his role in the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The parties have each waived oral argument. They are well acquainted with the facts necessary to resolve this appeal. Since we have concluded that the issues raised do not present novel issues requiring publication of our opinion, we set forth only those facts necessary to address the legal issues raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">In January 2012, a grand jury indicted Washington on one count of possession of a counterfeited security in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a) and one count of possession of stolen mail in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708. Under a Rule 11 Plea Agreement, he agreed to plead guilty to the \u00a7 513(a) count in exchange for the Government\u2019s agreement to dismiss the \u00a7 1708 count. The parties also agreed that, if the district court decided to impose a sentence higher than 96 months, Washington could withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">During his plea hearing on March 27, 2012, Washington pled guilty and reserved his rights to contest the number of victims, the amount of loss, and his role in the offense at sentencing. The Government did not object. The district court accepted Washington\u2019s guilty plea and took the plea agreement, with Washington\u2019s reservations, under advisement pending sentencing. During the hearing that was to serve as Washington\u2019s sentencing on July 25, 2012, the court rejected the plea agreement because it found the agreed-to maximum sentence inadequate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court also rejected Washington\u2019s position that he could plead guilty and still dispute the number of victims, the loss, and his role in the offense at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">Washington then opted to proceed to trial. After a two-day trial on November 27-28, 2012, a jury convicted him on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">Washington\u2019s December 11, 2012 Pre-sentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculated his total offense level as 31, assigned him a criminal history category of VI, and determined that he was subject to a guideline range of 188 to 235 months, pursuant to the 2012 Guidelines (\u201cUSSG\u201d). The PSR concluded, however, that the applicable statutory m\u00e1ximums limited his term to 180 months.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Washington\u2019s total offense level included a 14-level increase for loss of $540,471.40 \u201ccombined between two victims,\u201d the check verification services Certegy Check Services (\u201cCertegy\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>and TeleCheck; a four-level increase for involvement of at least 67 victims; a three-level increase for his role as a \u201cmanager or supervisor\u201d of the criminal activity; and no reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Before sentencing, the Government stipulated that Washington\u2019s total offense level in his PSR should have been a 29, based on a two-level increase for involvement of 10 or more, but less than 50, victims. The stipulation resulted in a guideline range of 151 to 188 months with a statutory maximum sentence of 180 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">In his Sentencing Memorandum, Washington objected to the PSR\u2019s recommendations on the number of victims, the amount of loss, his role in the offenses, and his acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">During his sentencing hearing on March 26, 2013, Washington expressly raised two objections to the PSR. First, he objected that the PSR did not give him credit for acceptance of responsibility because he had \u201cdebriefed \"with the Government a number of times\u201d prior to his plea agreement, \u201cfully admitted\u201d responsibility in the plea agreement, and \u201c[h]e did not testify at the trial.\u201d The court denied the objection. It explained that Washington \u201cdidn\u2019t fully admit his responsibility because he did it on his terms, in terms of what he thought would be the victims and so forth\u201d and that \u201che didn\u2019t accept responsibility in the sense that the Sentencing Guidelines look to [as] evidenced by the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Second, Washington objected that \u201cthere should not be any increase for number of victims because the two check clearing companies ... reimbursed their clients,\u201d leaving only Certegy and Tele-Check as victims. In response, the Government explained that, during trial, a Certegy fraud investigator had testified that Certegy had two broad categories of clients, warranty merchants and self-risk merchants, and that Certegy reimburses the former, but not the latter, category for erroneously authorized checks. The Government stated that there had been 37 non-reimbursed self-risk merchant victims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court denied the objection as \u201csupported by all the testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">Afterwards, Washington and the court engaged in the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-13\">THE COURT: Okay. What\u2019s the next one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-14\">[Counsel for Defendant]: Well, your Honor, the other objections really just go to the calculations and such. You know, based on what I was saying what the level should be. So every time it was brought up I just\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-15\">THE COURT: They\u2019re repeated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-16\">[Counsel for Defendant]: So\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-17\">THE COURT: Anything you want to \u2014 I think they have been dealt with, but anything that you want, that you think\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-18\">[Counsel for Defendant]: I would say that\u2019s what\u2019s important, your Honor, to address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-19\">THE COURT: Okay. So let the record reflect that ... we have a total offense level of 29; a criminal history of 6 where the guideline provisions are 151 to 188 [months]. The 188 [months] ... exceeds the statutory maximum. So it would really be 180 [months] because that would be the statutory combined maximum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-20\">The court then proceed to impose its sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>During his sentencing hearing, Washington did not expressly restate the objections he had raised in his Sentencing Memorandum to the amount of loss or his role in the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The court\u2019s total offense figure of 29 indicated that it implicitly adopted the PSR\u2019s recommendations as adjusted downward by the Government\u2019s stipulation. The court sentenced Washington to a term of 180 months. The court also imposed $540,471.40 in restitution, of which $849,178.72 was to be paid to Certegy and $191,297.68 to TeleCheck.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Washington asserts that the district court erred by admitting three alleged hearsay statements into evidence at trial. This Court \u201creview[s] a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings only for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Morales, </em>687 F.3d 697, 701-02 (6th Cir.2012) (citation omitted). \u201c[Rjeversal is appropriate only if the abuse of discretion was not harmless error, that is, only if the erroneous evidentiary ruling affected the outcome of the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">First, Washington contends that the court erred in admitting a U.S. Secret Service agent\u2019s testimony that a Nevada driver\u2019s license was counterfeit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">[Government] Q How do we know that is a counterfeit Nevada driver\u2019s license?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">[Agent Holtz, U.S. Secret Service] A First of all, the number in the upper right-hand corner ... I contacted the field office out in Las Vegas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-11\">[Counsel for Defendant]: Objection. Hearsay, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-12\">[Government]: It\u2019s not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. It\u2019s being offered to explain why this agent has rendered [his] opinion____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-14\">THE COURT: He may testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-15\">A I contacted the field office to see check on the number to see if it was a legitimate number. I was informed it was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-16\">... As well as the symbol the, the stamp, if you look at it, it\u2019s the upside down symbol of the state of Michigan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9Ak\">Agent Holtz\u2019s testimony does include hearsay to the extent he described what the Las Vegas field office told him about the license in question, but the error is harmless. Agent Holtz also testified that an upside down State of Michigan seal was affixed to the Nevada license. In light of this uncontested testimony, Agent Holtz\u2019s prior hearsay testimony cannot be said to have materially affected the outcome of Washington\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-17\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b592-18\">Washington also argues that the court erred in admitting a detective\u2019s testimony about a related investigation concerning Washington. The transcript reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-19\">[Detective Bernas, Deerfield Police Department] A I investigated the case involving Mr. Washington regarding several counterfeit checks and a stay he had at the Hyatt Hotel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-20\">[Government] Q Do you have an understanding as to why ... officers from the Deerfield Police Department investigated activity which you just described[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-21\">A My understanding is the Hyatt Hotel contacted\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-22\">[Counsel for Defendant]: ... I\u2019m going to object. I think it\u2019s still hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-23\">THE COURT: It is hearsay, but it\u2019s designed to segue I believe as to his testimony; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>[Government]: That is absolutely correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">THE COURT: He may proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">Q What is your understanding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">A My opinion is the Hyatt Hotel contacted Deerfield Police Department because the subject was staying under the name of Dat Midnightsea.... He had previously stayed there two other times, and every time that this person stayed they paid with a counterfeit check.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">This Court has explained that, \u201c[i]n some circumstances, out of court statements offered for the limited purpose of explaining why a government investigation was undertaken have been determined not to be hearsay.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>897 F.2d 1368, 1371 (6th Cir.1990) (citing cases). The context of Detective Bernas\u2019s testimony establishes that his assertion of the police department\u2019s reason for investigating the activity in question was offered for the limited purpose of explaining why the Deerfield Police Department\u2019s investigation was undertaken. Under <em>Martin, </em>this is non-hearsay testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">This case is distinguishable from <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>725 F.3d 615 (6th Cir.2013). In that case, police officers testified about a 911 dispatcher\u2019s description of the defendant and the fact that he had a gun. <em>Id. </em>at 619. The government argued that statements of the dispatcher were offered as background and not to show that the defendant had a gun. <em>Id. </em>at 620. However, we concluded that the government offered the dispatcher\u2019s statements for the truth of the matter asserted, i.e. that the defendant possessed a gun. <em>Id. </em>at 620. Given the context of the case, \u201ca less-detailed statement indicating that the police received a 911 call\u201d would have been sufficient to explain why the officers investigated the defendant. The context of these cases is different. Nelson involved a garden-variety response to a 911 call. But here, Detective Bernas\u2019 was describing an ongoing investigation. Describing an investigation\u2019s background is appropriate when the statement is \u201cnecessary to provide the jury with a coherent narrative explaining complex interactions between criminal defendants, police officers, and cooperating witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 620-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">But more importantly, the dispatcher\u2019s identification of a gun in the defendant\u2019s possession in Nelson was critical to the prosecution\u2019s case. \u201cThe Government\u2019s other evidence was circumstantial, and no officer testified to having seen Nelson possess a gun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 621. Because the statement went to \u201cthe heart of the government\u2019s case,\u201d we concluded that admitting the statement was not a harmless error. <em>Id. </em>But here, there was overwhelming evidence of Washington\u2019s guilt. In that context, it is much less clear that the government was offering Detective Ber-nas\u2019 statement for its truth rather than as background. And even if the statement was offered for its truth, any error was harmless in light of the substantial evidence of Washington\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">Lastly, Washington alleges that the court erred in admitting the following testimony of another federal officer about another related investigation concerning Washington:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-14\">Q How is it that you have a knowledge of [the Post Office\u2019s investigation involving Washington]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-15\">[Agent Fix, U.S. Postal Inspection Service] A In August of 2009, I was contacted by Postal Inspectors out in St. Louis, Missouri. They had \u2014 a business out there had some mail that was stolen from them in the weekend of August 15th, 2009. And then shortly thereafter one of the checks was deposited\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>[Counsel for Defendant]: Objection, your Honor. Hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-4\">[Government]: This is not being offered for the truth asserted. All this is going to show is why\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">THE COURT: He may continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">Q Please continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">A One of the checks was deposited into an account in the Detroit area. I began investigating that check. And as my investigation continued ... I was advised by one of the inspectors in St. Louis that Agent Holtz of the Secret Service was also investigating a similar matter. So once we determined that our cases were overlapping we joined together and assisted with his investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">As with Detective Bernas\u2019s testimony above, the context of Agent Fix\u2019s testimony establishes that his assertion of other postal inspectors\u2019 identification of stolen mail was offered for the limited purpose of explaining why the Post Office\u2019s investigation was undertaken. Under <em>Martin, </em>this is non-hearsay testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Washington also argues that, in addition to being hearsay, the three statements referred to Washington\u2019s prior bad acts in violation of FRE 404(b). However, in each case, Washington\u2019s lawyer objected to the statements as hearsay, and not as prior bad acts. A specific objection on one ground will not preserve other grounds on appeal. For example, in <em>United States v. Seymour, </em>468 F.3d 378, 384 (6th Cir.2006), a defendant objected to a piece of evidence as unfairly prejudicial under FRE 403 at trial. But on appeal, the defendant argued that the evidence was inadmissible under FRE 414. <em>Id. </em>We held that, as the grounds for the defendant\u2019s objection was not obvious from context, the defendant had failed to preserve his objection by not specifically invoking FRE 414. We proceeded to review, admission of the evidence for plain error. Because Washington did not object under FRE 404(b) at trial, this court reviews the admission of those statements for plain error. Given the substantial evidence of Washington\u2019s guilt \u2014 in particular his written confession \u2014 Washington cannot show that any error affected his substantial rights as is required to make a showing of plain error. <em>See United States v. Barnett, </em>398 F.3d 516, 526 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">Washington also contends that the Government did not meet its burden to prove a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a) at trial. In pertinent part, \u00a7 513(a) provides, \u201cWhoever makes, utters or possesses a counterfeited security of ... an organization ... with intent to deceive another person, organization, or government shall be\u201d guilty of an offense against the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a). The term \u201csecurity\u201d includes checks. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 513(c)(3)(A). The term \u201corganization\u201d means \u201ca legal entity ... which operates in or the activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 513(c)(4). The section does not define \u201cperson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-13\">Washington maintains that to prove a violation of \u00a7 513(a) the Government is required to establish that the counterfeit checks at issue (1) \u201cbe of an organization which operates in or the activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce\u201d and (2) \u201cbe used with intent to deceive another person [or] <em>organization which operates in or the activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d </em>He contends that the Government\u2019s evidence \u201cdid not connect the alleged misconduct by Washington to checks from an interstate organization <em>nor </em>with an intended target of an interstate organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>This Court \u201creview[s] <em>de novo </em>a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Pritchett, </em>749 F.3d 417, 430 (6th Cir.2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn evaluating a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we must determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430-31 (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Washington\u2019s first argument challenges the sufficiency of the evidence that his counterfeited checks were of an organization that operates in or the activities of which affect interstate commerce. Without explanation, he states that the trial testimony of the finance manager of the School Community Health Alliance of Michigan and the chief financial officer of AC Lewis Management \u201cdid not establish [a] sufficient connection to interstate commerce.\u201d The Alliance and AC Lewis were listed as payors on some of Washington\u2019s counterfeited checks. Washington, nonetheless, concedes that the Alliance, which operated in Michigan, \u201cdisbursed checks to vendors in Mississippi, Alabama and Delaware\u201d and that AC Lewis, which operated in Louisiana, \u201chad vendors they pay outside the state of Louisiana.\u201d Br. for Appellant at 46-47. This undisputed testimony established that both the Alliance and AC Lewis were organizations that operate in, or the activities of which affect, interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Washington\u2019s second argument challenges the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the target of Washington\u2019s deceptive intent. Again without explanation, Washington states that \u201c[tjhere was an insufficient showing that the organizations to whom allegedly counterfeit checks were passed were themselves engaged in interstate commerce.\u201d In the indictment, though, the grand jury charged Washington with violating \u00a7 513(a) \u201cwith the intent to deceive another <em>person or organization.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Lorenzo Hughes, who worked for Washington by passing counterfeited checks and providing related support services, testified during trial that he would call Certegy to check on the status of Washington\u2019s counterfeited checks and \u201ctry[ ] to get them approved for a certain amount.\u201d Certegy\u2019s fraud investigator testified that the company provided products and services \u201cnationwide.\u201d Washington did not dispute this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">Hughes also testified that he passed counterfeited checks for Washington at \u201c[njumerous stores throughout the Detroit area\u201d by deceiving store employees. He went to stores approved by Washington, bought goods with checks counterfeited by Washington, and used fake identification provided by Washington. Hughes testified that, when he went to buy something, \u201c[t]he driver license number ... would already be on the check with a number change in order for it to pass through the clerk.\u201d He explained, \u201cI pretty much had [the license number] on the check before I get into the store. Once I would present it to the clerk, I make her aware that the driver\u2019s license number is already on the check. So that way she won\u2019t pay as much attention to my driver\u2019s license number.\u201d He also explained that Washington \u201ctaught\u201d him to alter the number he wrote on the check slightly from the number on his fake identification \u201c[i]n order to keep using the same ID.\u201d Washington did not dispute this testimony either.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">Section 513(c)(4) defines an \u201corganization,\u201d in part, by its relationship to interstate commerce, but it does not do so with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>respect to a \u201cperson.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(c)(4).As a result, \u00a7 513(a) does not require the Government to prove an individual victim\u2019s link to interstate commerce. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Chappell, </em>6 F.3d 1095, 1099 (5th Cir.1993) (\u201cSection 513 does not require the government to demonstrate an individual victim\u2019s connection to interstate commerce.\u201d). The un-controverted testimony established that Washington intended to deceive both Cer-tegy, which operates in interstate commerce, and various individual retail associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Washington raises four procedural issues with his sentence. \u201c\u2018[Ajppellate review of sentencing decisions is limited to determining whether they are reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Mackety, </em>650 F.3d 621, 623 (6th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)) (internal quotation marks omitted). We review for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 46, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If a court committed errors \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range\u201d or \u201cselecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,\u201d it will be found to have imposed a proeedurally unreasonable sentence and abused its discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. We review the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Moon, </em>513 F.3d 527, 540 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Washington asserts that the district court erred in denying him a two-level reduction for his alleged acceptance of responsibility. He argues that he is \u201centitled to sentencing credit for acceptance of responsibility where this matter only went to trial because the District Court rejected the Rule 11 Plea Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">A defendant who \u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense\u201d may receive a two-level reduction in his total offense level.

A defendant who exercises his right to a trial may qualify for the reduction in \u201crare situations\u201d \u2014 such as where he \u201cgoes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">This case is not a \u201crare situation.\u201d At trial, although he did not testify, Washington disputed his guilt. In his opening, his counsel declared that \u201cthe Government [could] not prove[ ] its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d R. 40, Nov. 27, 2012 Tr. at PgID 222. He explained that \u201cthe linchpin of the Government\u2019s case\u201d was the testimony of Lorenzo Hughes, who was \u201cthe only ... individual who knew Mr. Washington at the time of the events that are the subject of this lawsuit,\u201d and that Hughes \u201cwas caught in the act of committing fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221, 222. He concluded that Hughes \u201chas much to lose, and he has a person to blame ... Terrence Washington. And that easily gives rise to false testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221. During cross examination, Washington\u2019s counsel tried to portray Hughes as lying about Washington\u2019s culpability. R. 41, Nov. 28, 2012 Tr. at PgID 450-51. And, in his closing, Washington\u2019s counsel proclaimed, \u201cThe defense is that Mr. Washington is not guilty of either of the two charges against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521. At sentencing, the district court did not find an honest acceptance of responsibility. We are persuaded that this finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Washington contends that the district court erred in applying a two-level increase for the number of victims involved, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(2)(A)(i), because the PSR attributed all of the loss at issue to two victims: Certegy and TeleCheck. He also contends that the Government failed to provide any support for the alleged number of Certegy\u2019s self-risk merchant victims. The Government \u201cconcedes that the sentencing record, as it stands, does not support the two-level increase in Washington\u2019s guideline calculation under USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A) for an offense involving 10 or more victims\u201d and that \u201cthe case should be remanded for resentencing.\u201d Br. for U.S. at 15, 22. It explains that the PSR failed to incorporate a spreadsheet showing that there were 37 self-risk merchant victims and that \u201cthe government mistakenly neglected to introduce the spreadsheet as an exhibit at the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16. Accordingly, because the record does not support any sentence enhancement for the number of victims involved pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2B 1.1(b)(2), we conclude that this part of Washington\u2019s sentence is procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Washington further asserts that the district court erred in applying a three-level increase for his role as a \u201cmanager or supervisor\u201d of the criminal activity, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), because there was insufficient evidence to support the increase and the court applied it \u201cwithout explaining its reasoning.\u201d Similarly, he asserts that the court erred in applying a fourteen-level increase for loss of $540,471, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H), because \u201cthe only evidence adduced at Washington\u2019s trial was a loss of $34[9],000.00, from the testimony of Certegy\u2019s [fraud investigator],\u201d which should have resulted in a twelve-level increase. He also contends that the court \u201cdid not explain how it arrived at this higher [loss] figure.\u201d During his sentencing hearing, Washington did not expressly restate the objections he had raised in his Sentencing Memorandum to his role in the offenses or the amount of loss. The Government responds that the trial evidence supported the role enhancement. It also responds that Washington \u201cwaived\u201d his loss objection \u201cby abandoning it at his sentencing hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">Washington first objected to his role in and the loss from his offenses during the proceedings on his plea agreement, which the district court rejected. He then reiterated these objections in his Sentencing Memorandum. ,At sentencing, the court noted that it had \u201cstud[ied]\u201d Washington\u2019s Sentencing Memorandum. After Washington unsuccessfully objected to the PSR\u2019s recommendations on his acceptance of responsibility and the number of victims at sentencing, he started to raise his remaining objections. The court, however, interjected that such objections were \u201crepeated\u201d and that \u201cthey have been dealt with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that, at sentencing, district courts <em>\u201cmust </em>\u2014 for any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter \u2014 rule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing[.]\u201d Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B) (emphasis added). \u201cThis Court requires literal compliance with Rule 32 when sentencing issues are contested by the parties.\u201d <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>356 F.3d 719, 722 (6th Cir.2004) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Because Washington objected to his role in the offenses and the amount of loss, the district court was required to address his objections, pursuant to Rule 32. <em>See United States v. Poulsen, </em>655 F.3d 492, 512-13 (6th Cir.2011) (\u201cThe Sixth Circuit requires \u2018literal compliance\u2019 with Rule 32, so when matters are contested the court must explain its [loss] calculation methods.\u201d (quoting <em>Nelson, </em>356 F.3d at 722-23)); <em>United States v. Darwich, </em>337 F.3d 645, 667 (6th Cir.2003) (stating, where disputed matter would affect sentencing, \u201cBecause the matter of leadership role was disputed by [defendant] in his objections to the PSR, the district court had an obligation under Rule 32(i)(3) to issue a ruling on the disputed matter....\u201d). The record of Washington\u2019s March 26, 2013 sentencing hearing does not show that the district court either expressly ruled on the disputes concerning Washington\u2019s role or loss or expressly determined that such rulings were unnecessary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Additionally, the record does not support the district court\u2019s statement that Washington\u2019s remaining role and loss objections \u201cha[d] been dealt with\u201d previously. Prior to Washington\u2019s March 26 sentencing hearing, Washington had only one other opportunity to raise these objections\u2014 his July 25, 2012 hearing. At Washington\u2019s July 25 hearing, though, the court rejected the parties\u2019 plea agreement only and, therefore, had no occasion to address Washington\u2019s objections. In light of this, it is unclear how the court determined that Washington\u2019s remaining objections were foreclosed because it provided no explanation on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The court\u2019s sentence was, therefore, procedurally unreasonable because it erred in not addressing Washington\u2019s role and loss objections. These errors affected Washington\u2019s substantial rights because they may have caused him to receive a more severe sentence than he should have received under the Guidelines. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(a); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>467 F.3d 559, 564 (6th Cir.2006) (noting that an error at sentencing is harmless where it did not cause the defendant to receive a more severe sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">For the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM Washington\u2019s conviction, but we VACATE his sentence, and we REMAND for resentencing. On remand, the district court should determine whether Washing<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>ton is subject to sentencing enhancements for (i) the number of victims involved in his offenses, (ii) his role in the offenses, and (iii) the amount of loss stemming from his offenses in accordance with Rule 32(i)(3)(B).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-8\">. Before this hearing, Washington filed a Sentencing Memorandum on July 24, 2012. It was the first of two Sentencing Memoranda that he filed in this case. In it, he objected to the then-current Presentence Report's recommendations on the number of victims, the amount of loss, and his role in the offense. During the hearing, the district court acknowledged that it had reviewed Washington\u2019s objections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b590-15\">. The consecutive combination of the statutory maximum sentences of 10 years for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a) and five years for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708 amounts to 180 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\">. The record does not reflect that the Government established the number of self-risk merchants or their losses at trial or during sentencing. As explained below, the Government concedes on appeal that there is an issue with the support for its calculation of the number of victims in this matter that requires remand for resentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b597-8\">. The Government does not make the same \"waiver\u201d argument concerning Washington's role objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b598-6\">. The Government concedes that the district court \"did not make a specific finding on loss amount.\u201d Br. for U.S. at 21.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">Additionally, although the court noted that Washington \"w[as] obviously a leader\u201d as it imposed its sentence, this statement does not address the Washington's role objection. A determination that a defendant was a <em>\"leader </em>of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive\u201d results in a four-level increase, while a determination that a defendant was <em>\u201cmanager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) </em>and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive\u201d results in a three-level increase. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) &amp; (b) (2012) (emphasis added). Washington's December 11, 2012 PSR recommenced that the court find that Washington was a \"manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader)\u201d and, therefore, subject to a three-level increase. As described above, the court\u2019s total offense figure of 29 indicated that it implicitly adopted the PSR's recommendations, including its three-level role enhancement, as adjusted downward by the Government\u2019s stipulation. Moreover, the court provided no explanation on the record for stating that Washington was a \"leader.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
