Section 2000e <em>et seq. </em>for race and sex discrimination. Thompson alleges that her former employer Defendant Harris County Hospital District (\u201cHCHD\u201d) constructively discharged her pursuant to unlawful discriminatory practices. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-23\">The district court granted HCHD\u2019s motion for summary judgment. As to the race and sex discrimination claim, the district court concluded that because Thompson presented no direct evidence of discrimination, she had to proceed with circumstantial evidence through the burden-shifting analysis of <em>McDonnell Douglas.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cUnder that framework, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination, which requires a showing that the plaintiff (1) is a member of a protected group; (2) was qualified for the position at issue; (3) was discharged or suffered some adverse employment action by the employer; and (4) was replaced by someone outside his protected group or was treated less favorably than other similarly situated employees outside the protected group.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If the employer sustains its burden, the prima facie case is dissolved, and the burden shifts back to the plaintiff, who \u201cmust then offer sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact either (1) that the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>reason is not true, but is instead a pretext for discrimination (pretext alternative); or (2) that the defendant\u2019s reason, while true, is only one of the reasons for its conduct, and another \u201cmotivating factor\u201d is the plaintiffs protected characteristic (mixed-motive[s] alternative).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The district court concluded that, as conceded by HCHD, Thompson established a prima facie case of race and/or sex discrimination. But it held that HCHD\u2019s articulated non-discriminatory reasons for not promoting Thompson \u2014 inadequate responses to interview questions, negative feedback from physician stakeholders, and the Administrative Director\u2019s knowledge of Thompson\u2019s past performance and her interactions with Thompson \u2014 were legitimate and were neither pretextual nor mixed with a discriminatory motive. The court also explained that Thompson failed to raise a material question of fact about whether she clearly was better qualified than the applicants selected for the positions. As to her constructive discharge claim, Thompson failed to establish she was a victim of unlawful discrimination, and she faded to show that her move to a lower position in the employer\u2019s reorganization plan was intolerable or illegal. Accordingly, the district court granted HCHD\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">We apply <em>de novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same standards used by the district court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Having reviewed the evidence Thompson puts forth in support of her claims, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
