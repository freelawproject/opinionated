We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Hu v. Holder, </em>652 F.3d 1011, 1016 (9th Cir.2011). We grant and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-22\">Hu testified police told him they arrested and detained him because he was \u201cspreading words\u201d against the communist party leadership and the government, and he provided evidence he was laid off because he \u201cinstigated the workers\u201d and \u201cslandered the party leader.\u201d ' The record compels the conclusion that \u201cone central reason\u201d for the harm inflicted on Hu was his actual and/or imputed political opinion. <em>See id. </em>at 1017-20 (9th Cir.2011). Thus, we grant the petition and remand Hu\u2019s asylum claim for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See INS v.
