Ruiz\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw, and has filed a brief arguing that Ruiz\u2019s sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-25\">Upon careful review, we conclude that the within-Guidelines-range revocation sentence was not substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Petreikis, </em>551 F.3d 822, 824 (8th Cir.2009) (applying presumption of substantive reasonableness to revocation sentence within Guidelines range); <em>see also United States v. Growden, </em>663 F.3d 982, 984 (8th Cir.2011) (per cu-riam) (revocation sentence is reviewed for substantive reasonableness under deferential abuse-of-discretion standard). Counsel notes in the brief that Ruiz believes the district court judge should have recused himself, but nothing in the record indicates that a sua sponte recusal was warranted. <em>See United States v. Melton, </em>738 F.3d 903, 905-06 (8th Cir.2013) (discussing plain-error review of recusal issues raised for first time on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-26\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, subject to counsel informing Ruiz about procedures for seeking rehearing or filing a petition for certiorari.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b730-22\">. The Honorable John A. Jarvey, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
