Expeditor\u2019s Express asked Gramercy Insurance Company to defend the lawsuit and indemnify it against any judgment. In response, the insurance company filed this declaratory judgment action in federal court against Expeditor\u2019s Express and the estate over responsibility for coverage. The district court granted judgment in Gramercy Insurance\u2019s favor under Civil Rule 12(c), concluding that Gramercy\u2019s insurance policy did not apply because Underwood was an \u201cemployee\u201d of Expeditor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Express. We reverse. The pleadings do not establish (at this point in the case anyway) that Underwood was an employee of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Expeditor\u2019s Express leased a 1997 Volvo truck tractor from William Littlefield. Donald Underwood in turn drove the truck from Tennessee to Georgia, transporting magazines for Expeditor\u2019s Express. As he drove along Interstate 24 in Tennessee, the truck suffered a flat, veered off the road, turned over, and caught fire. Underwood died in the accident, and his estate sued Expeditor\u2019s Express, Littlefield, and others in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">An insurance contract between Gramer-cy Insurance and Expeditor\u2019s Express provides liability coverage for Expeditor\u2019s Express\u2019s trucking business. The contract does not cover \u201cbodily injury\u201d to Expeditor\u2019s Express\u2019s \u201cemployee[s] ... arising out of and in the course of ... [ejmployment by\u201d Expeditor\u2019s Express or \u201c[pier-forming the duties related to the conduct of\u2019 Expeditor\u2019s Express\u2019s business. R.10-1 at 35. The exclusion applies \u201cwhether the insured may be liable as an employer or in any other capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the contract, Gramercy Insurance thus had no duty to defend and indemnify Expeditor\u2019s Express against the estate\u2019s lawsuit if Underwood worked as an employee for the company when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The contract defines employee to include a \u201cleased worker\u201d: \u201ca person leased to [Expeditor\u2019s Express] by a labor leasing firm under an agreement between [Expeditor\u2019s Express] and the labor leasing firm, to perform duties related to the conduct of [Expeditor\u2019s Express\u2019s] business.\u201d R.10-1 at 43^14. The term does not include a \u201ctemporary worker\u201d: \u201ca person who is furnished to [Expeditor\u2019s Express] to substitute for a permanent \u2018employee\u2019 on leave or to meet seasonal or short-term workload conditions.\u201d R.10-1 at 43, 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Gramercy Insurance moved for judgment on the pleadings \u2014 what amounted to the complaint, the answer, and the insurance contract (filed as an exhibit to the complaint). To win, Gramercy Insurance had to show that, after reading the complaint in the light most favorable to the estate and after accepting the estate\u2019s answer as true, the estate could \u201cprove no set of facts in support of [its] claim that would entitle [it] to relief.\u201d <em>Ziegler v. IBP Hog Mkt., Inc., </em>249 F.3d 509, 512 (6th Cir.2001). It did not meet that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Underwood transported magazines from Tennessee to Georgia for Expeditor\u2019s Express in a truck owned by Littlefield and leased to Expeditor\u2019s Express. Was Underwood an employee at the time of the accident? Maybe; maybe not. Yes, he was driving a truck leased by Expeditor\u2019s Express that was carrying its magazines when the accident occurred. But, so far as the pleadings show, a friend could have recommended Underwood to fill in while he took a vacation or to help out with a late-summer surge in demand for trucking services. Nor is it clear whether an independent contractor is an \u201cemployee\u201d under the contract, and Underwood (for all we know) could have worked for the company in that capacity. Because the uncontested facts do not answer the question central to this case one undisputed way or the other, the case cannot be resolved on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Attempting to overcome this problem, Gramercy Insurance invokes the Motor Carrier Act of 1980. The Act requires carriers (like Expeditor\u2019s Express) to carry a minimum level of liability insurance and permits companies (like Expeditor\u2019s Express) to exclude employees from insurance coverage. And it supplies a broad definition of employees that includes any \u201coperator of a commercial motor vehicle\u201d who \u201cdirectly affects commercial motor ve-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>hide safety in the course of employment\u201d and is not a government employee. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 81132(2)(A)-(B); <em>see also </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 387.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Using an endorsement in the contract, Gramercy Insurance tries to get from point A (the contract\u2019s definition of employee, which Underwood might, but does not conclusively, meet) to point B (the Act\u2019s definition of employee, which Underwood conclusively would meet). The endorsement \u201camend[s the contract] to assure compliance by the insured ... with Sections 29 and 30 of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 and the [relevant] rules and regulations.\u201d R.10-1 at 66. But this does not resolve the dispute. The most basic way in which it applies is this: Say Expeditor\u2019s Express started sending Vehicle X on runs but did not add Vehicle X to its policy. If the Act required Expeditor\u2019s Express to have insurance coverage for Vehicle X, the endorsement provides that coverage to fill up the gap between the contract and the Act\u2019s coverage requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">But the relevant language of the endorsement \u2014 \u201camend[s the contract] to assure compliance\u201d \u2014 does not incorporate the Act\u2019s definition of employee into the contract. The endorsement instead acts as a form of extra insurance for the insurance contract. If the contract covers <em>less </em>than the Act requires, the endorsement amends the contract to comply with the Act. Yet here the contract covers <em>more </em>than the Act requires. The insurance contract uses a narrower definition of employee than the Act permits, so the contract covers more people (or excludes fewer people from coverage, take your pick). Nothing in the language of the endorsement suggests it operates to amend the more generous coverage in the insurance contract <em>down </em>to the minimum requirements of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\"><em>Consumers County Mutual Insurance Company v. P.W. &amp; Sons Trucking, Inc., </em>307 F.3d 362 (5th Cir.2002), says nothing to the contrary. A trucking company\u2019s insurance contract excluded coverage for injuries to employees, but the contract did not define employees. <em>Id. </em>at 364 n. 2. Satisfied \u201cthat [the parties drafted the contract] to comply with federal insurance requirements,\u201d it turned to the Act \u201cto supply the definition of the term employee in the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366. The decision nowhere suggests that the court would have reached the same result had the contract included a definition of employee \u2014 as this one does. <em>See id. </em>at 367; <em>see also Canal Indem. Co. v. Rapid Logistics, Inc., </em>514 Fed.Appx. 474, 477-78 (5th Cir.2013) (distinguishing <em>Consumers County Mutual Insurance Company </em>this way but deciding the case on other grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">For these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
