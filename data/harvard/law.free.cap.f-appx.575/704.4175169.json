His counsel moved to withdraw, and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that Louie received ineffective assistance of counsel and the government engaged in prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-24\">This court declines to consider Louie\u2019s ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. McAdory, </em>501 F.3d 868, 872-73 (8th Cir.2007) (ineffective-assistance claims are ordinarily deferred to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceedings). There is no merit to Louie\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claims. <em>See United States v. New, </em>491 F.3d 369, 377 (8th Cir.2007) (to obtain reversal based on prosecutorial misconduct, defendant must show prosecutor\u2019s remarks or conduct were improper). An independent review of the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), reveals no non-frivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-25\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed, and counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted, subject to counsel informing Louie about procedures for seeking rehearing or filing a petition for certiorari.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b732-19\">. The Honorable Howard F. Sachs, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
