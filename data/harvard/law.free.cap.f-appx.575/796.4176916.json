Supplementing the Record</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to supplement the administrative record with transcripts, as permitted by 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(ii). <em>See Ojai Unified Sch. Dist. v. Jackson, 4 </em>F.3d 1467, 1473 (9th Cir.1993) (\u201cThe determination of what is \u2018additional\u2019 evidence must be left to the discretion of the trial court....\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Recordings of the relevant meetings were already in the record, so the contents of the meetings, including any alleged lack of discussion that C.B. wished to demonstrate, were available to the district court and to this court. The district court properly considered whether transcripts would be \u201crelevant, non-cumulative, and otherwise admissible,\u201d <em>E.M. ex rel. E.M. v. Pajaro Valley Unified Sch. Dist. Office of Admin. Hearings, </em>652 F.3d 999, 1006 (9th Cir.2011), and it was not an abuse of discretion to conclude that transcripts would be cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">II. Compliance with the IDEA</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">The IDEA imposes substantive and procedural requirements upon states and school districts, including that they must offer students with disabilities a free and appropriate public education (\u201cFAPE\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(1)(A), and develop an individualized education program (\u201cIEP\u201d) that is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1412(a)(4); <em>see also R.P. ex rel. C.P. v. Prescott Unified Sch. Dist., </em>631 F.3d 1117, 1121 (9th Cir.2011). In reviewing compliance with the IDEA, courts should first consider whether the district complied with the procedures set forth by the Act and then consider whether the IEP is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits. <em>Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist., Westchester Cnty. v. Rowley, </em>458 U.S. 176, 206-07, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982). Procedural inadequacies that result in the loss of educational opportunity, seriously infringe the parents\u2019 opportunity to participate in the IEP formulation process, or cause a deprivation of educational benefits result in the denial of a FAPE. <em>See Amanda J. ex rel. Annette J. v. Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist., </em>267 F.3d 877, 892 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">A. Procedural Compliance with the IDEA</p>\n<p id=\"b826-12\">None of the procedural flaws alleged by C.B. resulted in the denial of a FAPE. First, any failure by the District to assess or set goals with regard to C.B.\u2019s anxiety did not result in a denial of a FAPE because the District\u2019s offer of placement adequately addressed C.B.\u2019s anxiety through weekly counseling sessions and the opportunity to reevaluate after the District was able to observe C.B. in the new setting. Second, the lack of a specific goal for reading comprehension alone did not render the IEP inadequate, as the District was required to provide only some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>educational benefit, not necessarily the ideal or maximum benefit to that student. <em>Ojai, </em>4 F.3d at 1474. The IEP team discussed C.B.\u2019s reading comprehension need and District staff made clear they intended to provide him with appropriate services. Third, the baselines for C.B.\u2019s goals in the IEP met the requirements of the IDEA, <em>see </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(I), and provided sufficient information upon which to measure C.B.\u2019s progress toward goals; any lack of greater specificity in the baselines did not amount to a denial of a FAPE. Fourth, the lack of a designated section in the IEP listing accommodations did not result in the loss of an educational opportunity because the IEP team discussed and the IEP included (at least in the meeting notes) accommodations appropriate for C.B. Fifth, any inadequacies in the transition services portion of the IEP did not result in the denial of a FAPE because, in 2010, C.B. had several more years to receive services and work towards individualized transition goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Finally, District personnel presented the placement offer during the IEP meeting after listening to C.B.\u2019s preferred providers discuss C.B.\u2019s abilities and collaborating with those providers in developing individualized goals for C.B., suggesting that District personnel had an open mind about C.B.\u2019s placement and did not deprive C.B.\u2019s guardian of an opportunity to meaningfully participate in the IEP. <em>Cf. J.L. v. Mercer Island Sch. Dist., </em>592 F.3d 938, 952 (9th Cir.2010) (finding no predetermination where district changed aspects of the program based on parent and expert recommendations, even though district held pre-meeting). Thus, none of the alleged procedural flaws resulted in the denial of a FAPE.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">B. Substantive Compliance with the IDEA</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">The court reviews <em>de novo </em>whether the District\u2019s offer of placement was a FAPE, <em>Seattle Sch. Dist., No. 1 v. B.S., </em>82 F.3d 1493, 1499 (9th Cir.1996), evaluating the IEP in light of the information available at the time it was developed, <em>Adams ex rel. Adams v. Oregon, </em>195 F.3d 1141, 1149 (9th Cir.1999). The District\u2019s offer of placing C.B. in a setting with small group instruction was a FAPE in the least restrictive environment given that C.B. had spent the past three years receiving one-on-one instruction and there was no information before the District indicating that a large group setting would be appropriate for C.B. Especially considering that C.B. had not been in the District for three years and District personnel had only one opportunity to observe C.B. before the June IEP meetings, the District\u2019s proposed placement as an interim placement was appropriate. <em>Cf. Ms. S. ex rel. G. v. Vashon Island Sch. Dist., </em>337 F.3d 1115, 1132 (9th Cir.2003) (where student had not been in the district the prior year and assessments were outdated, the district\u2019s \u201cdecision to evaluate [the student] before implementing a program and the [district\u2019s decision to implement a temporary IEP during the [district\u2019s evaluation of [the student] was appropriate\u201d), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds, </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d)(1)(B). The District\u2019s offer of placement was a FAPE in the least restrictive environment in accordance with the requirements of the IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b826-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
