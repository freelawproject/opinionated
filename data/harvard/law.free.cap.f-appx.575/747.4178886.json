We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, </em>542 F.3d 738, 742 (9th Cir.2008). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-22\">Vasquez-Hernandez contends gang members subjected him to threats, extortion, and an assault on account of his political opinion and his membership in a social group. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Vasquez-Hernandez failed to establish past persecution or a fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See id. </em>at 742-44, 746\u201447; <em>Zetino v. Holder, </em>622 F.3d 1007, 1016 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201cAn alien\u2019s desire to be free from harassment by criminals motivated by theft or random violence by gang members bears no nexus to a protected ground.\u201d). Thus, Vasquez-Hernandez\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-23\">Because Vasquez-Hernandez failed to meet the lower burden of proof for asylum, it follows that he has not met the higher standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b775-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
