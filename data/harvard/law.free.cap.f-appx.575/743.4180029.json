We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-24\">Gurrola contends that the trial court violated his due process rights by admitting an audiotape recording of a conversation that included allegedly involuntary statements procured by coercion. The district court concluded that the state court\u2019s determination that the statements were not coerced was objectively reasonable. In making this determination, the district court reviewed only a transcript of the recording because the state had not lodged the audiotape, and therefore the audiotape is not part of the record on appeal. <em>See Kirshner v. Uniden Corp. of Am., </em>842 F.2d 1074, 1077 (9th Cir.1988) (\u201cPapers not filed with the district court or admitted into evidence by that court are not part of the clerk\u2019s record and cannot be part of the record on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-25\">Without the actual recording, we cannot fully determine whether the state court\u2019s adjudication of Gurrola\u2019s due process claim was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established law, or whether it was an unreasonable determination of the facts based on the evidence presented. Accordingly, we remand to the district court for the limited purpose of reconsidering Gurrola\u2019s due process claim after listening to the audiotape recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b771-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
