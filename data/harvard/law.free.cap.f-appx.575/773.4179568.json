Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reconsider. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791 (9th Cir.2005). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-20\">In his motion to reconsider, Lin requested de novo consideration of his direct appeal because the brief he filed \u201clikely\u201d was the result of an \u201cunscrupulous preparer.\u201d The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Lin\u2019s motion to reconsider because Lin failed to identify any error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior order. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>Mohammed, </em>400 F.3d at 791 (the court reverses the denial of a motion to reconsider only if the BIA acted \u201carbitrarily, irrationally, or contrary to law\u201d). We reject Lin\u2019s contention that the BIA failed to address his argument related to the preparation of his brief on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-21\">We lack jurisdiction to address Lin\u2019s contentions related to the BIA\u2019s March 31, 2\u00d311, decision denying his appeal because the petition for review is untimely as to that order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (the 30-day filing period for a petition for review is mandatory and jurisdictional).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-22\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b801-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
