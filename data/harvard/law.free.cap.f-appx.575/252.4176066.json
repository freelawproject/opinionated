He appeals his conviction and sentence claiming that (1) the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and in applying a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(2)(B), and (2) his sentence is greater than necessary to effectuate the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The record does not reflect, and Alonzo has not shown, that the district court\u2019s decision to deny his motion to withdraw his guilty plea was based on an error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. <em>United States v. McKnight, </em>570 F.3d 641, 645 (5th Cir.2009). The district court did not abuse its broad discretion in denying the motion to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>Id.; see United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 344 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Although Alonzo preserved his challenge to the application of \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(2)(B), his assertion that he \u201cdid nothing to compromise the victim\u2019s volition\u201d is insufficient to rebut the presumption that there was \u201csome degree of undue influence\u201d based on the \u201csubstantial difference in age between\u201d him and the minor. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2G1.3, comment. (n. 3(B)). The district court did not commit any procedural error by applying the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Our review of Alonzo\u2019s sentence for substantive reasonableness is limited to plain error because he did not object on that ground in the district court. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). In support of his contention, Alonzo asserts that the erroneous application of the \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(2)(B) enhancement resulted in a sentence greater than necessary to provide adequate deterrence and protect the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">Alonzo has not demonstrated that his within-Guidelines sentence fails to account for a factor that should have received significant weight, gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). He has thus failed to show that the district court plainly erred in imposing the within-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b281-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
