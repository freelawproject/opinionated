Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791 (9th Cir.2005). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">In his opening brief, Carrillo fails to raise, and therefore has waived, any challenge to the BIA\u2019s determination that notice of his October 3, 2005, hearing was proper. <em>See Tijani v. Holder, </em>628 F.3d 1071, 1080 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Carrillo\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely where Carrillo filed his motion more than five years after his in absentia removal order was issued. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) (an alien has 180 days to file a motion to reopen to rescind the in absentia order if the alien can show that he failed to appear for the hearing due to exceptional circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Carrillo\u2019s contention regarding equitable tolling of the motion to reopen filing deadline because he failed to exhaust this contention before the BIA. <em>See Tijani, </em>628 F.3d at 1080.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b786-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
