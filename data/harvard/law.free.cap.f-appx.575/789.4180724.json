R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b817-19\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-20\">Tag Althof sued Douglas County Jail (\u201cthe Jail\u201d) officers John Hanlin, Mike Root, Tim O\u2019Kelly, and Mason Goodknight (collectively \u201cthe Defendants\u201d), alleging the Defendants had deprived Althof of outdoor exercise during Althofs incarceration at the Jail. The district court granted summary judgment on all of Althofs claims. Althof appeals the disposition of (1) the \u00a7 1983 claim based on the Eighth Amendment, and (2) the intentional infliction of emotional distress (\u201cIIED\u201d) claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reviewing de novo, <em>Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. of Am. v. Brenneke, </em>551 F.3d 1132, 1137 (9th Cir.2009), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-21\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on the \u00a7 1983 claim. The Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on Althofs \u00a7 1983 claim, because the asserted constitutional right was not clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). It is not clearly established that an inmate is entitled to outdoor exercise when he has proven to be violent, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>the deprivation of outdoor exercise is in response to the plaintiffs violence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the contrary, this court has held that even a deprivation of outdoor exercise \u201cfor most of a five-year period of incarceration\u201d did not violate the Eighth Amendment, when the deprivation was \u201cdirectly linked to [the prisoner\u2019s] own misconduct, which raised serious and legitimate security concerns within the prison.\u201d <em>LeMaire v. </em>Maass, 12 F.3d 1444, 1457-58 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">The district court also did not err in granting summary judgment on Althofs IIED claim, because Althof did not present any evidence of the Defendants\u2019 intent to cause him severe emotional distress. <em>See McGanty v. Staudenraus, </em>321 Or. 532, 901 P.2d 841, 849 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AiA\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Ap1P\">. Althof waived any appeal of his negligence claim by not presenting any argument or legal authority on it. <em>See Kohler v. Inter-Tel Techs., </em>244 F.3d 1167, 1182 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AHZ\">. Because we affirm on this independent ground, we need not address Hanlin\u2019s potential liability in a supervisory role.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b818-8\">. We so conclude, even considering the events that occurred prior to July 8, 2008, the contested statute of limitations cut-off date.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b818-6\">CLIFTON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AI6\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">I respectfully dissent. I disagree with the conclusion that the asserted constitutional right was not clearly established at the time of the alleged violation. A right is clearly established if it has been found violated \u201cunder facts not distinguishable in a fair way from the facts presented in the case at hand.\u201d <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), <em>overruled on other grounds by Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009). I view <em>Allen v. Sakai, </em>48 F.3d 1082 (9th Cir.1994), as sufficiently similar to the facts presented in this case. <em>See also Spain v. Procunier, </em>600 F.2d 189, 199-200 (9th Cir.1979). That does not mean that the plaintiff in this case should or would ultimately prevail, but in my view his claim should have survived summary judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
