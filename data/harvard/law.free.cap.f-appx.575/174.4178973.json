For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-20\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-21\">At trial, the government presented evidence that, on December 12, 2012, Officers Joachin Okonkwo and James A. Spada of the Richmond Police Department approached a man whom they recognized by sight but not by name. They asked him to stop, but the man fled and the officers pursued him. Officer Okonkwo testified that while he lost sight of the man he was chasing a few times, those lapses were \u201cjust momentary.\u201d J.A. 46. During the chase, Officer Spada saw the man remove a firearm from his clothing and discard it in the street. At the end of the chase, the man was apprehended and identified as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Morris. Morris told the officers that he carried the gun, but only for protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">No witness was asked to perform a courtroom identification of Morris. When asked on direct examination, \u201c[d]o you recognize Mr. Morris here today?\u201d Officer Spada testified that he did, J.A. 69, although the record does not show that he pointed or gestured to Morris. When asked if there was \u201cany question in [his] mind\u201d that the individual who threw the gun was \u201cMr. Morris,\u201d Officer Spada answered that there was \u201c[n]o question at all.\u201d J.A. 77. Following the government\u2019s case in chief, Morris moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. That motion was denied. A jury found Morris guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) placed Morris at an offense level of 20 and a criminal history category of IV. His advisory Guidelines sentence ranged from 51 to 63 months. Morris did not object to the PSR or the Guidelines calculation. At the sentencing hearing, the district court accepted the PSR, adopted its findings, and then heard the parties\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Morris argued for a below-Guidelines sentence of 42 months because he did not fire the gun he was convicted of possessing and because his personal history and relative youth placed him at a particularly high risk of criminality. Morris also argued that his criminal history was exaggerated by non-serious offenses and that a 42-month sentence would provide just punishment, as the longest he had ever received. The government argued for a sentence within the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The district court sentenced Morris to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment, saying that it had \u201cconsidered all the arguments of the parties\u201d and that it was denying Morris\u2019s motion for a below-Guidelines sentence \u201cprimarily because you can\u2019t run from your history. That Guidelines Range was earned and is appropriate.\u201d J.A. 201. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>United States v. Green, </em>599 F.3d 360, 367 (4th Cir.2010). A guilty verdict survives \u201cif, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the verdict is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d 209, 216 (4th Cir.2006) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). We may only set aside a conviction if \u201cno rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Royal, </em>731 F.3d 333, 337 (4th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">We review criminal sentences for substantive and procedural reasonableness using an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 575-76 (4th Cir.2010). If we find an abuse of discretion, the sentence can stand only if the error was harmless. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">Morris argues that the government did not present sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s guilty verdict for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-15\">First, Morris argues that because no witness identified him in court, the government did not present sufficient evidence of his identity as the man who possessed the firearm. This argument is meritless because a courtroom identification is not required to show sufficient evidence of a defendant\u2019s identity if other evidence of identity is sufficient. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>900 F.2d 779, 782 (4th Cir.1990) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>(testimony of one witness who identified the defendant by name as the person who committed the crime was sufficient evidence of the defendant\u2019s identity, even without a courtroom identification).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Second, Morris argues that the government\u2019s evidence of his identity as the individual who possessed the firearm was insufficient. We cannot agree. The testimony of one witness that a defendant was the person who committed the crime is sufficient evidence of a defendant\u2019s identity to support a conviction. <em>United States v. Holley, </em>502 F.2d 273, 274 (4th Cir.1974). At trial, the jury heard extensive testimony from multiple witnesses who saw, chased, and apprehended Morris, and who recognized him as the same individual throughout the encounter. Officer Spada testified that he saw Morris discard the firearm, and that Morris admitted to possessing the firearm. These facts constituted substantial evidence that Morris possessed the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Morris next argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not provide a sufficiently individualized explanation for choosing a 51-month sentence, rejecting Morris\u2019s arguments for a below-Guidelines sentence. We may presume that Morris\u2019s within-Guidelines sentence was substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Mendoza-Mendoza, </em>597 F.3d 212, 216-17 (4th Cir.2010). However, we need not reach the question of whether the district court erred. Even if we assume that the district court\u2019s explanation of Morris\u2019s sentence was insufficient, we agree with the government that any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">For a procedural sentencing error to be found harmless, the government must show that the error \u201cdid not have a substantial and injurious influence on the result.\u201d <em>United States v. Boulware, </em>604 F.3d 832, 838 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The government bears the burden of showing that the error was harmless, but it can meet this burden by showing that it would be \u201cunrealistic\u201d to think that the error affected the sentence length. <em>Id. </em>at 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">To determine whether a district court\u2019s failure to explain a sentencing decision was harmless error, we consider two primary factors. The first is the strength or weakness of a party\u2019s arguments that the district court did not address. <em>Id. </em>at 839-40. The second is an indication in the record that the district court considered and understood those arguments. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">Morris\u2019s arguments for a below-Guidelines sentence were weak. Like the defendant\u2019s arguments in <em>Boulware, </em>many of Morris\u2019s arguments were based on circumstances that are \u201cnot atypical for a defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 840. He admits that his arguments about his personal history could be made by many people. Similarly, Morris\u2019s argument that his criminal history was exaggerated was weak because his criminal history was substantial. His argument that he did not use the firearm he was convicted of possessing, and only carried it for protection, has little to do with why he should be sentenced below the Guidelines range for being a felon in possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">Where, as here, the government can show that the district court fully considered a party\u2019s arguments for a particular sentence, but failed to explicitly address them, that failure is a harmless error. <em>Boulware, </em>604 F.3d at 840. In the present ease, the district court\u2019s statement that it had \u201cconsidered <em>all </em>of the arguments of .the parties,\u201d J.A. 201 (emphasis added), demonstrates that it fully considered Mor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>ris\u2019s arguments for a below-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Considering these facts, we can say with \u201cfair assurance\u201d that that the district court would not impose a different sentence if it were forced to explain its reasoning, and the district court\u2019s failure to do so could not have had a \u201csubstantial and injurious influence\u201d on Morris\u2019s sentence. <em>Boul-ware, </em>604 F.3d at 840, 838 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). For these reasons, we hold that even if we assume Morris\u2019s sentence was proeedurally unreasonable, any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Morris\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
