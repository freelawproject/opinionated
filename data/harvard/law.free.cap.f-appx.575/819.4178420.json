We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-15\">The BIA found Kumar failed to establish the Indian government was unable or unwilling to control the Sikh terrorists he feared, or that the government would be unable or unwilling to protect him in the future. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding. <em>See Castro-Martinez v. Holder, </em>674 F.3d 1073, 1080-82 (9th Cir.2011) (substantial evidence supported BIA conclusion that petitioner did not meet his burden to show government was unable or unwilling to control attackers); <em>see also Nahrvani v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir.2005) (record did not compel conclusion that the government was unable or unwilling to control the perpetrators of the harm). Thus, Kumar\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-16\">Because Kumar did not establish eligibility for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye, </em>453 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b847-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
