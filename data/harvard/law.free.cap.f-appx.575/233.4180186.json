The district court concluded that Mejia-Aguilar had been previously deported for a drug trafficking offense and applied a 16-level enhancement under United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). Mejia-Aguilar was sentenced to 41 months in prison. He argues that the district court erred in applying the enhancement and appeals his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b262-17\">Mejia-Aguilar was deported after a conviction for \u201c[sjolicitation to possess a narcotic drug for sale\u201d in violation of Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 13-1002, 13-3408, for which he was sentenced to two years in custody. He was later found in the United States and pleaded guilty to illegal reentry in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b). The Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) prepared by the Probation Office determined that Mejia-Aguilar had a base offense level of 8. Because of his prior Arizona conviction, the Probation Office applied a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) for a felony drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months. Mejia-Aguilar received a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 21 and an advisory Guidelines range of 41-51 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-18\">Mejia-Aguilar had filed objections to the enhancement applied in the PSR, which he renewed at sentencing. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>overruled Mejia-Aguilar\u2019s objections and sentenced him to 41 months in prison. Mejia-Aguilar now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u201cThis court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusion that a prior conviction constitutes a drug trafficking offense.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 (b)(1) (A) (i) is \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of, or offer to sell a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 further provides that \u201c[p]rior convictions of offenses counted under subsection (b)(1) include the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting, to commit such offenses.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit a drug trafficking offense, for which a sentence exceeding 13 months is imposed, would result in a 16-level enhancement. The question is whether solicitation of a drug trafficking offense comes within the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The answer to that question is largely resolved by this court\u2019s prior precedent. We have previously held that \u201caiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting!] to commit [any of the enumerated offenses]\u201d is not- an exclusive list of offenses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our reasoning was that \u201c[t]he commentary to the Guidelines\u2019 \u2018General Application Principles\u2019 states that \u2018the term \u201cincludes\u201d is not exhaustive.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We said, \u201cbecause the list in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 5 begins with the word \u2018include,\u2019 the offenses listed\u2014 aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting \u2014 must be interpreted as examples, rather than an exclusive list.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-18\">We have further held that a solicitation offense was within the scope of the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 regarding aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit the offenses enumerated in subsection (b)(1) of that Guideline provision. In <em>United States v. Mendez-Casarez,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this court addressed whether the North Carolina crime of solicitation to commit assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury constituted a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Citing the reasoning of decisions from other circuit courts, we explained that \u201cthe analysis involves comparing the <em>mens rea </em>(mental state) and <em>actus reus </em>(action or conduct) of the prior offense to those of conspiracy, aiding and abetting, and attempt.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cThe purpose of comparing offenses,\u201d we said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>\u201cis to avoid categorizing a prior offense as a predicate offense that qualifies a defendant for sentence enhancement when the prior offense is clearly less serious than the offenses enumerated as constituting the substantive offense.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We determined that solicitation under North Carolina law was not clearly less serious than conspiracy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We reasoned that \u201cboth offenses require the same <em>mens rea: </em>the defendant must intend that the underlying crime be committed.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> With respect to the <em>actus reus, </em>we noted that \u201cboth offenses involve the defendant taking a step, whether agreeing or soliciting, towards fulfilling his intention that the crime be committed.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The \u201cacts of soliciting and agreeing \u2018are of similar severity,\u2019 \u201d we concluded.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Mejia-Aguilar attempts to distinguish <em>Mendez-Casarez, </em>asserting that North Carolina\u2019s solicitation law requires proof of each element of the substantive crime, whereas Arizona treats solicitation separately from the underlying offense. We are unpersuaded. North Carolina law requires that the prosecution \u201cprove <em>a request </em>to perform every essential element\u201d of the underlying offense.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Arizona law similarly requires proof of intent and proof of conduct that would constitute a crime. Arizona\u2019s solicitation statute defines the offense as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">A person, other than a peace officer acting in his official capacity within the scope of his authority and in the line of duty, [who], with the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a felony or misdemeanor, ... commands, encourages, requests or solicits another person to engage in specific conduct which would constitute the felony or misdemeanor or which would establish the other\u2019s complicity in its commission.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">The <em>mens rea </em>and <em>actus reus </em>of the North Carolina and Arizona offenses of solicitation are not clearly less serious than the crime of conspiracy. As noted above, the <em>mens rea </em>required by both Arizona\u2019s solicitation statute and the crime of conspiracy is that the defendant intend that the crime be committed. Similarly, both require an <em>actus reus </em>that involves the defendant taking a step in furtherance of his intention that the crime be committed. Although Arizona\u2019s solicitation statute requires that the defendant command, encourage, request, or solicit another to commit a crime, while conspiracy requires an agreement between the defendant and another to commit the offense, we explained in <em>Mendez-Casarez </em>that \u201c[t]he acts of soliciting and agreeing are of similar severity.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the district court did not err in holding that a 16-level enhancement was appropriate as a result of Mejia-Aguilar\u2019s prior conviction for solicitation to possess a narcotic drug for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">We note that there is some question as to whether, and if so to what extent, our decision in <em>United States v. Mendez-Casa-rez </em>has survived in the wake of our court\u2019s en banc decision in <em>United States v. Rodri</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>guez.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Fourth Circuit has observed that <em>Rodriguez </em>\u201carguably undermines the precedential weight accorded <em>Mendez-Ca-sarez.\u201d </em><footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Our en banc court expressly disapproved of <em>Mendez-Casarez </em>to the extent that it could be read as holding that courts should \u201clook <em>always </em>to the majority of state codes \u2014 as well as the Model Penal Code, federal law, and criminal law treatises\u2014 when deriving the \u2018generic, contemporary meaning\u2019 of an undefined offense category in a federal sentencing enhancement.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The continued vitality of our decision in <em>Mendez-Casarez </em>was otherwise unaffected by <em>Rodriguez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">A question also arises as to whether the methodology set forth in <em>Rodriguez </em>applies in our analysis of solicitation offenses. Because \u201csolicitation\u201d is not an enumerated offense in \u00a7 2L1.2, and in light of <em>Mendez-Casarez\u2019s </em>construction of note 5 in the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2, we conclude that we are to compare the seriousness of the solicitation offense of which Mejia-Aguilar was convicted to the seriousness of a conspiracy to possess a narcotic drug for sale. That is the analysis that we conducted in section II above. We need not treat \u201csolicitation\u201d as an offense enumerated in the commentary and engage in the <em>Rodriguez </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">But if we are mistaken, and we must employ the <em>Rodriguez </em>methodology, the outcome is the same. The en banc court in <em>Rodriguez </em>\u201cadopt[ed] a plain-meaning approach when determining the \u2018generic, contemporary meaning\u2019 of non-common-law offense categories enumerated in federal sentencing enhancements.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The court set forth the steps that we are to take:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-14\">Under this approach, our application of <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>categorical approach to a prior state conviction proceeds in the following four steps: First, we identify the undefined offense category that triggers the federal sentencing enhancement. We then evaluate whether the meaning of that offense category is clear from the language of the enhancement at issue or its applicable commentary. If not, we proceed to step two, and determine whether that undefined offense category is an offense category defined at common law, or an offense category that is not defined at common law. Third, if the offense category is a non-commonlaw offense category, then we derive its \u201cgeneric, contemporary meaning\u201d from its common usage as stated in legal and other wellaccepted dictionaries. Fourth, we look to the elements of the state statute of conviction and evaluate whether those elements comport with the generic meaning of the enumerated offense category.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">Mejia-Aguilar contends that <em>Rodriguez </em>\u201cis inapplicable because solicitation was a crime at common law.\u201d This ignores the fact that the crime is not merely solicitation but solicitation to possess a narcotic drug for sale.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we conclude that regardless of whether we consider \u201csolicitation\u201d or \u201csolicitation to possess a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>narcotic drug for sale\u201d to be common-law offenses or within \u201can undefined offense category,\u201d either path under the <em>Rodriguez </em>methodology leads to the same conclusion in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">If we consider \u201csolicitation\u201d as the offense, rather than \u201csolicitation to possess a narcotic drug for sale,\u201d and if \u201csolicitation\u201d is a common-law offense,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> then \u201cour precedent ... looks to definitions in the variety of state codes, the Model Penal Code, federal law, and criminal law treatises to define the \u2018generic, contemporary meaning\u2019 of offense categories defined at common law.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The generic, contemporary meaning of \u201csolicitation\u201d is congruent with the common-law definition, which is most simply described \u201cas asking another person to commit an offense.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> \u201cThe gravamen of the offense of soliciting lies in counseling, enticing or inducing another to commit a crime.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> \u201cIt is an indictable offence at common law for one to counsel and solicit another to commit a felony or other aggravated offence, although the solicitation is of no effect, and the crime counselled is not in fact committed.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Professor Wayne R. LaFave has noted with regard to current state formulations of the offense that \u201cthe acts of commanding or requesting another to engage in conduct which is criminal would seem of necessity to require an accompanying intent that such conduct occur, and there is nothing in the decided cases suggesting otherwise.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We have little difficulty in concluding that Mejia-Aguilar\u2019s Arizona conviction was for generic \u201csolicitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">If \u201csolicitation\u201d or \u201csolicitation to possess a narcotic for sale\u201d are not common-law offenses, then \u201cwe derive its \u2018generic, contemporary meaning1 from its common usage as stated in legal and other well-accepted dictionaries.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201csolicitation\u201d in relevant part as: \u201c1. The act or an instance of requesting or seeking to obtain something; a request or petition!.] 2. The criminal offense of urging, advising, commanding, or otherwise inciting another to commit a crime!.]\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary defines \u201csolicit\u201d in relevant part as: \u201c1. To try to obtain by entreaty, persuasion, or formal application!.] 2. To petition persistently____3. To entice into evil or illegal action.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Mejia-Aguilar\u2019s conviction for \u201ccommanding], encouraging], requesting] or soliciting] another person to engage in specific conduct which would constitute the felony or misdemeanor or which would establish the other\u2019s complicity in its commission\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> comports with the generic, dictionary meaning of \u201csolicitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">Mejia-Aguilar argues that there is no documentation in the record to clarify the specific offense that was the basis of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>conviction and that therefore we must consider only whether the least culpable act constituting a violation of Arizona\u2019s solicitation statute qualifies as a drug trafficking offense. Mejia-Aguilar does not specify which action prohibited by Arizona\u2019s solicitation statute is least culpable and less serious than the crimes of conspiracy, aiding and abetting, and attempt, but we need not determine which action is least culpable to conclude that this argument also fails. Regardless of the action Mejia-Aguilar took in violating the statute \u2014 commanding, encouraging, requesting, or soliciting \u2014 he took <em>some </em>step in furtherance of his intention that a crime be committed. Accordingly, considering only the least culpable act constituting a violation of Arizona\u2019s solicitation statute does not change our conclusion that a conviction under the statute qualifies as a drug trafficking offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">For the foregoing reasons, Mejia-Aguilar\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\">. <em>United.
