Ham, Jr., appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006) complaint for failure to state a claim. We review the dismissal de novo. <em>Philips v. Pitt Cnty. Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>572 F.3d 176, 179-80 (4th Cir.2009) (supplying standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-21\">Ham alleged that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated when his employer opened his workplace locker on several occasions while he was suspended from employment pending the resolution of disciplinary matters. Although Ham had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his locker, we conclude that he failed to allege facts indicating that his employer violated that expectation. <em>Francis v. Giacometti, </em>588 F.3d 186, 194 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-22\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of relief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
