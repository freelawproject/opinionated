Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), against Tamechia Beemon, a corrections officer at the federal penitentiary in which Schreane was incarcerated, asserting that Beemon violated his Eighth Amendment rights. Schreane raises two Eighth Amendment failure-to-protect claims. First, he alleges that Beemon was deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of serious harm when she violated a prison policy against allowing inmates to enter units to which they were not assigned. Second, he raises a \u201csnitch\u201d claim, alleging that Beemon labeled him a \u201csnitch\u201d to other inmates and thus exposed him to a substantial risk of serious harm. The district court granted summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds in favor of Beemon. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b515-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-19\">In 2007, Schreane arrived at United States Penitentiary, Pollock to serve his criminal sentence. Beemon was a corrections officer who worked at the prison during Schreane\u2019s incarceration there. In January 2008, the prison\u2019s warden, Joe Keffer, issued a memorandum for both inmates and staff that reiterated various prison policies, including policies regarding acceptable attire for inmates, policies prohibiting certain decorations in cells and, as relevant here, a policy that inmates were not allowed to be present in units to which they were not assigned. The memorandum was posted throughout the prison and served as \u201ca reminder to all inmates of some basic rules and regulations which must be followed,\u201d citing recent \u201cassaults with weapons\u201d and destruction of property that had taken place in the prison. Keffer emphasized in a declaration that he \u201cinstructed inmates and staff, both verbally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>and in writing, that inmates should not be allowed to enter housing units to which they are not assigned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">On April 22, 2008, Beemon, who had formerly been posted to a different unit, was assigned to supervise Schreane\u2019s unit. Schreane claims that he began noticing that Beemon would allow inmates from the unit she used to guard to enter his unit,, in violation of the prison\u2019s policy against allowing inmates to enter units to which they were not assigned. Schreane was concerned that Beemon also \u201centertained\u201d a specific inmate from the unit she used to guard and would enter into long conversations with him rather than supervise Schreane\u2019s unit attentively. Schreane states that, on April 27 or 28, he privately informed the manager of his unit, Patrick Townsend, that Beemon was allowing inmates assigned to other units to visit Schreane\u2019s unit. According to Schreane, Townsend told him that he would speak to Beemon. Townsend, for his part, says that he did not recall this initial conversation with Schreane. Schreane claims that, on or about April 29, he also informed Keffer about Beemon\u2019s conduct. Schreane explained to Keffer that, several months prior, two inmates had been stabbed or beaten by inmates assigned to other units. Keffer says that he did not recall this conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">On May 1, 2008, Schreane says that he spoke to Beemon directly \u201cregarding her favoritism\u201d in allowing certain prisoners to visit from other units, explaining that inmates were \u201cbecoming irritated by her actions.\u201d According to Schreane, Beemon responded that she had worked in corrections for fourteen years and \u201cappreciat[ed] his concern of safe housing.\u201d Beemon says that she did not recall any conversation with Schreane about inmates assigned to other units entering the unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">As Schreane describes it, later that same evening, Beemon again allowed an inmate from the unit she used to guard to visit Schreane\u2019s unit. While Beemon and the inmate were engaged in conversation, a fight erupted in Schreane\u2019s unit, and Townsend ordered a lockdown. Townsend was in the unit at the time, and Schreane approached him to once more discuss Beemon\u2019s conduct. While in the common area, Schreane says that he \u201cdiscretely\u201d informed Townsend of the situation \u2014 that Beemon had allowed an inmate from another unit to' enter Schreane\u2019s unit \u2014 and he identified the offending inmate for Townsend. Townsend recalls that Schre-ane raised the issue with him but did so \u201cvery loudly\u201d and \u201cin close proximity to other inmates.\u201d Townsend states that he told Schreane \u201cto quiet down and discuss this complaint with [him] in a proper setting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Schreane claims that Beemon must have told the inmate assigned to another unit\u2014 the one whom Schreane had identified for Townsend \u2014 of Schreane\u2019s complaints and labeled Schreane a \u201csnitch.\u201d That inmate allegedly informed some of his friends in Schreane\u2019s unit that Schreane had been consulting with prison authorities, and, that night, an inmate from Schreane\u2019s unit confronted Schreane in the activity room about \u201ctalking to the police\u201d and then assaulted him. Prison medical records reflect that, at 8:45 P.M. on May 1, 2008, Schre-ane suffered from a laceration of the lip \u201csecondary to blunt force trauma,\u201d seemed disoriented as to time and place, and could not remember the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Beemon presents a different version of the events at issue. She acknowledges that she was aware of the prison\u2019s policy against allowing inmates to enter units to which they were not assigned and notes that \u201cinmates have been known to enter other housing units to which they\u2019re not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>assigned in order to steal property, hide from other inmates, or even assault other inmates.\u201d Beemon states that she \u201calways did her best\u201d to prevent inmates assigned to other units from entering Schreane\u2019s unit. Beemon maintains that she never knowingly permitted inmates from other units to enter Schreane\u2019s unit and that, whenever she noticed inmates from other units, she acted immediately to remove them. As described, Beemon did not recall Schreane\u2019s speaking to her about his concerns prior to the assault. Beemon denies informing other inmates that Schre-ane was a \u201csnitch\u201d or knowing that Schre-ane was at risk of an assault. She further states that she found Schreane bleeding on a stairway after his assault and triggered an alarm to signal for help.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Schreane later filed this <em>Bivens </em>action in federal court, naming, as relevant here, Beemon as a defendant. The magistrate judge construed Schreane\u2019s complaint to raise, under the Eighth Amendment, both: (1) a failure-to-protect claim, in Beemon\u2019s failure to prevent the inmate assault by allowing inmates assigned to other units to enter Schreane\u2019s unit in violation of the prison\u2019s policy against this; and (2) a \u201csnitch\u201d claim, in Beemon\u2019s allegedly labeling Schreane a \u201csnitch,\u201d which he claims resulted in his assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Schreane sought to compel the government to turn over surveillance video footage from the prison, which Schreane argued would show that while guarding Schreane\u2019s unit Beemon had willfully violated the policy against allowing inmates to enter units to which they were not assigned. The government turned over footage of the May 1, 2008 assault on Schreane but provided no further video. As the government and the prison\u2019s electronics technician explained, the prison\u2019s cameras automatically record over surveillance video after a period of fifteen to thirty days unless a prison official identifies specific footage relating to an incident warranting investigation. Other than the assault, investigators had not sought to preserve any surveillance footage. Schreane argued that he was entitled to an evidentiary inference of spoliation because the destruction of the missing footage indicated that it was harmful to Beemon. The magistrate judge, however, denied Schreane\u2019s spoliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Beemon moved for summary judgment, raising a qualified immunity defense. Ultimately, the district court granted Beemon\u2019s motion and dismissed Schreane\u2019s claims with prejudice. The district court determined that Schreane had \u201coffered no summary judgment evidence whatsoever\u201d in responding to Beemon\u2019s declaration denying that she had labeled him a \u201csnitch\u201d or had deliberately allowed inmates assigned to other units to enter Schreane\u2019s unit in disregard of Schreane\u2019s safety.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Schreane then filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and apply the same standard as the district court. <em>Dameware Dev., L.L.C. v. Am. Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>688 F.3d 203, 206 (5th Cir.2012). Summary judgment is appropriate if the movant demonstrates \u201cthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). \u201c[T]he party moving for summary judgment must demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, but need not <em>negate </em>the elements of the nonmovant\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe construe all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party when reviewing grants of motions for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Tolan v. Cotton, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1861, 1863, 188 L.Ed.2d 895 (2014) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AQS\">I. Spoliation Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">\u201cUnder the spoliation doctrine, a jury may draw an adverse inference that a party who intentionally destroys important evidence in bad faith did so because the contents of those documents were unfavorable to that party.\u201d <em>Whitt v. Stephens Cnty., </em>529 F.3d 278, 284 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). An adverse inference of spoliation can be relevant on summary judgment. <em>See Byrnie v. Cromwell, Bd. of Educ., </em>243 F.3d 93, 107 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201cIn borderline cases, an inference of spoliation, in combination with some (not insubstantial) evidence for the plaintiffs cause of action, can allow the plaintiff to survive summary judgment.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). \u201cThe Fifth Circuit permits an adverse inference against the destroyer of evidence only upon a showing of \u2018bad faith\u2019 or \u2018bad conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Condrey v. SunTrust Bank of Ga., </em>431 F.3d 191, 203 (5th Cir.2005). The defendant\u2019s adherence to standard operating procedures in destroying the evidence, however, may counter a contention of bad faith conduct. <em>See Vick v. Tex. Emp\u2019t Comm\u2019n, </em>514 F.2d 734, 737 (5th Cir.1975). We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to permit an evidentiary inference of spoliation for abuse of discretion. <em>King v. Ill. Cent. R.R., </em>337 F.3d 550, 553, 555 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">In this case, there is no dispute that the surveillance tape that Schreane wanted was erased. In response to Schreane\u2019s request for the footage leading up to the day of his attack, the government produced all that remained: the few minutes of Schreane\u2019s assault on May 1, 2008. The government also provided the affidavit of an electronics technician at the prison, Derrick Cox, who described the prison\u2019s general policy of automatically recording over surveillance video that has not been marked for investigation within fifteen to thirty days of its recording. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 556 (noting that defendant\u2019s compliance with a federal preservation regulation, after which \u201cthe records are destroyed as a part of routine file maintenance,\u201d \u201cfurther demonstrat[ed] that [the defendant] lacked a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>\u2018bad faith\u2019 motive for [the records\u2019] destruction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Schreane claims that Beemon or some other prison official purposefully destroyed the footage in bad faith because it would have shown damning evidence of Beemon allowing inmates assigned to other units to enter Schreane\u2019s unit and generally ignoring her duties. Beyond this accusation, however, Schreane offers no evidence that anyone who knew of his objections to Beemon\u2019s conduct (Beemon, Townsend, or Keffer) was involved in the decision to record over the tape. In fact, there is no indication that any prison official even viewed the footage because, as Cox explained, it \u201cis not live-monitored 24-hours a day.\u201d <em>Cf. Bracey v. Grondin, </em>712 F.3d 1012, 1015, 1019-20 (7th Cir.2013) (affirming the district court\u2019s finding of no spoliation when prison surveillance cameras erased footage three days after an incident, pursuant to standard procedure, and the plaintiff offered no proof that any officials viewed the footage in question prior to its erasure). Schreane has therefore failed to make the requisite showing of bad faith to be entitled to a spoliation inference. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Schreane\u2019s spoliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">II. Eighth Amendment Claims</p>\n<p id=\"AdK\">A. Violation of Policy Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Schreane argues that Beemon violated his constitutional rights when she failed to protect him against harm from other inmates. He contends first that Beemon failed to protect him by permitting inmates assigned to other units to enter his unit, which exposed him to a substantial risk of serious harm. Beemon moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity, which has two components: (1) the violation of a constitutional right (2) that was clearly established at the time of the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 232, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009). In applying this test, courts may address either of the two components first. <em>Id. </em>at 236, 129 S.Ct. 808. The plaintiff must bear the burden \u201cto prove that a government official is not entitled to qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Wyatt v. Fletcher, </em>718 F.3d 496, 502 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">The Eighth Amendment prohibits the infliction of \u201ccruel and unusual punishments.\u201d U.S. CONST, amend. VIII. It requires the humane treatment of prisoners and, more specifically, requires prison employees to \u201ctake reasonable measures to guarantee the safety of the inmates.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 832, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIt is not, however, every injury suffered by one prisoner at the hands of another that translates into constitutional liability for prison officials responsible for the victim\u2019s safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970. For a prison guard\u2019s failure to protect an inmate from assault to violate the Eighth Amendment, the guard must have acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d and subjected an inmate \u201cto a substantial risk of serious harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 828-29, 834, 844, 114 S.Ct. 1970 (internal quotation marks omitted). A defendant may escape liability by \u201cresponding] reasonably to the risk, even if the harm ultimately was not averted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 844, 114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">Deliberate indifference is a subjective inquiry. <em>Atteberry v. Nocona Gen. Hosp., </em>430 F.3d 245, 255 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cAn official is deliberately indifferent when he \u2018knows of and disregards-an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 524 (5th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970). The plaintiff may prove deliberate indifference with circumstantial evidence, including by \u201cshowing that the risk was so obvious that the official must have known about it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The relevant risk of harm encompasses both \u201ccurrent threats\u201d and \u201csufficiently imminent dangers that are likely to cause harm in the next week or month or year.\u201d <em>Horton v. Cockrell, </em>70 F.3d 397, 401 (5th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Schreane argues that the record, which we must read in the light most favorable to him, <em>see Tolan, </em>134 S.Ct. at 1863; <em>Dillon, </em>596 F.3d at 266, reflects a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Beemon was \u201caware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of harm exist[ed],\u201d \u201cdr[ew] the inference\u201d herself, and yet disregarded it. <em>Johnson, </em>385 F.3d at 524 (internal quotation marks omitted). In support of his argument, Schreane offers evidence that he brought his concerns not only to Beemon\u2019s attention, but also to the attention of her supervisors, Keffer, the warden, and Townsend, the unit manager. Beemon also acknowledges in her unsworn declaration that she was \u201caware\u201d of the prison\u2019s policy against allowing inmates to enter units to which they were not assigned. Although Schre-ane has offered summary judgment evidence that Beemon violated this policy, our inquiry cannot end there.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">To overcome qualified immunity, Schre-ane must show that Beemon violated a right that was \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time. <em>Pearson, </em>555 U.S. at 232, 129 S.Ct. 808. Schreane need not demonstrate that \u201cthe very action in question has previously been held unlawful,\u201d but \u201cin the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). Certainly, it has long been clearly established that a prison guard violates the Eighth Amendment by <em>causing </em>an inmate to be assaulted. <em>See, e.g., Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 833, 114 S.Ct. 1970 (\u201cgratuitously allowing the beating or rape of one prisoner by another serves no legitimate penological objective\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Irving v. Dormire, </em>519 F.3d 441, 447-48 (8th Cir.2008) (denying qualified immunity where prison guards opened cell doors so as to allow a prisoner to attack the plaintiff). Here, however, the causal relationship between Beemon\u2019s violation of the policy and the assault that Schreane suffered is so attenuated that it is beyond clearly established law. <em>See Pearson, </em>555 U.S. at 232, 129 S.Ct. 808. Indeed, the facts show that Schreane was assaulted by someone from his <em>own </em>unit. As a result, any connection between that assault and Beemon\u2019s occasional violation of the policy against allowing prisoners from one unit to enter another is unclear at best. Accordingly, Schreane has not overcome Beemon\u2019s defense of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">B. \u201cSnitch\u201d Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Schreane asserts that Beemon labeled him \u00e1 \u201csnitch\u201d to other inmates, thereby placing him at risk of the violent assault he suffered on May 1, 2008. The Eighth Amendment duty to protect inmates from harm can be violated when a prison official acts with deliberate indifference by exposing a prisoner to physical assault through labeling him a \u201csnitch\u201d to other inmates. <em>See, e.g., Adames v. Perez, </em>331 F.3d 508, 515 (5th Cir.2003). Schreane claims that Beemon must have told an inmate assigned to another unit (the one whom Schreane had identified for Townsend on the day of the lockdown) that Schreane was a \u201csnitch,\u201d that this inmate then told unidentified inmates from Schreane\u2019s own unit what Beemon had told him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>and that Schreane was thereafter assaulted. However, the only admissible evidence that Schreane offers in support of his claim that Beemon labeled him a \u201csnitch\u201d is that his assault came soon after his various complaints regarding Beemon\u2019s conduct and that the person assaulting him mentioned that Schreane had been \u201ctalking to the police.\u201d Schreane does not, for instance, assert that he himself heard Beemon label him a \u201csnitch,\u201d nor does he offer any corroboration from other inmates to that effect. <em>Cf. White v. Fox, </em>470 Fed.Appx. 214, 220, 223 (5th Cir.2012) (per curiam) (reversing summary judgment on failure-to-proteet claim where plaintiff supported his assertions of being labeled a \u201csnitch\u201d with two sworn affidavits from fellow prisoners). Schreane offers only an unsubstantiated assertion that Beemon labeled him a \u201csnitch.\u201d <em>See Ragas v. Tenn. Gas Pipeline Co., </em>136 F.3d 455, 458 (5th Cir.1998) (\u201c[U]nsubstantiated assertions are not competent summary judgment evidence.\u201d). Because there is no dispute as to any material fact regarding Schreane\u2019s \u201csnitch\u201d claim, summary judgment was warranted for this claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b515-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-8\">. We note that the district court should have considered Schreane\u2019s verified complaint on summary judgment. Allegations in a verified complaint may serve as summary-judgment evidence. <em>King v. Dogan, </em>31 F.3d 344, 346 (5th Cir.1994). To verify the complaint, a plaintiff may include \"a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.\u201d <em>Hart v. Hairston, </em>343 F.3d 762, 765 (5th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Specific statements in the complaint, to be available as evidence, must also meet the requirement, contained in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, that \"they be within the personal knowledge of the affiant, that they otherwise would be admissible into evidence, and that the affiant be competent to testify.\" <em>Huckabay v. Moore, </em>142 F.3d 233, 240 n. 6 (5th Cir.1998); <em>see </em>FED. R. CIV.
