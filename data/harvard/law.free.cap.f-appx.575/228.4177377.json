The Deed of Trust and right to receive payment under the note apparently had been assigned to Chase some time earlier. After purchasing the property, Morlock brought this action, seeking a judgment which determines whether Chase has any interest in the property and forbids Chase from taking any action adverse to Mor-lock\u2019s interest, specifically foreclosing on the property. Fundamentally, Morlock asserts that the assignment to Chase somehow was not valid and that Chase\u2019s asserted interest is a cloud on Morlock\u2019s title.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">Morlock filed a Motion to Remand, arguing that the amount in controversy does not exceed $75,000 because the full $130,000 is not in dispute, only Morlock\u2019s equity in the property. Chase filed a Motion to Dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), arguing that Morlock failed to state a claim. In Morlock\u2019s response to Chase\u2019s motion, it sought leave to amend its pleadings. The district court denied Morlock\u2019s motions and granted Chase\u2019s motion, dismissing Morlock\u2019s action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-15\">We affirm the dismissal essentially for the reasons assigned in the district court\u2019s lengthy and well-reasoned memorandum opinion and order. First, the district court properly found that because Mor-lock\u2019s action concerns its rights in the entire property, the full fair market value of approximately $130,000 is at issue, triggering subject matter jurisdiction. Next, the district court correctly concluded-that the assignment to Chase was valid on its face, and Morlock has failed to put forward any viable theory on which it could recover under any cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-16\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b257-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
