Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 376-79 (5th Cir.2008), held that a district court may not award a reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) absent a motion from the Government and that \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s refusal to waive his right to appeal is a proper basis for the Government to decline to make such a motion.\u201d However, Amendment 775 to the U.S.S.G., made effective November 1, 2013, provides that \u201c[t]he government should not withhold ... a motion [under Section 3El.l(b) ] based on interests not identified in \u00a7 3E1.1, such as whether the defendant agrees to waive his or her right to appeal.\u201d In <em>United States v. Palacios, </em>756 F.3d 325, 2014 WL 2119096 n. 1 (5th Cir. May 21, 2014), the Court en banc concluded that <em>Newson, </em>\u201cto the extent it may constrain us from applying Amendment 775 to cases pending on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>direct appeal under our rule of orderliness,\u201d is abrogated in light of Amendment 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated, and remanded the instant case for further consideration in light of the position asserted by the Solicitor General in his brief for the United States filed on April 8, 2014. We, therefore, VACATE the judgment of sentence and remand for further proceedings in accord herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
