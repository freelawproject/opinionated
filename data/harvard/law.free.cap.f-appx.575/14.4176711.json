We will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-18\">In 2013, Reynolds filed a complaint alleging that Magisterial District Judge Paul Manzi violated his civil rights by imposing $360 in fines and court costs after he was found guilty of disorderly conduct. The District Court concluded that Judge Manzi was immune from suit and that Reynolds\u2019 claim was barred under the <em>Rooker-Feld-man </em>doctrine. Reynolds timely appealed. After Reynolds filed his informal brief, Judge Manzi filed a motion to summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-20\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise plenary review of the District Court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal for failure to state a claim. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). In deciding whether the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Reynolds\u2019 complaint was proper, we \u201caccept as true the factual allegations in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Nami v. Fauver, </em>82 F.3d 63, 65 (3d Cir.1996). We may summarily affirm if an appeal does not present a substantial question. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-21\">The District Court properly determined that judicial immunity bars Reynolds\u2019 claims against Judge Manzi. \u201cA judicial officer in the performance of his duties has absolute immunity from suit and will not be liable for his judicial acts.\u201d <em>Azubuko v. Royal, </em>443 F.3d 302, 303 (3d Cir.2006). Although Reynolds complains that Judge Manzi \u201charass[ed] him with false charges,\u201d this allegation is insufficient to overcome judicial immunity. <em>See Capogrosso v. Supreme Court of N.J., </em>588 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir.2009) (per curiam) (holding that judicial immunity extends to judicial officers, even if their actions were \u201c \u2018in error, w[ere] done maliciously, or w[ere] in excess of [their] authority,\u2019 \u201d unless the officers acted in clear absence of all jurisdiction (quoting <em>Azubuko, </em>443 F.3d at 303)).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-22\">Because Judge Manzi is entitled to absolute judicial immunity from Reynolds\u2019 claims, this appeal does not present a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>stantial question.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we will grant Judge Manzi\u2019s motion and summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b43-15\">. In light of this holding, we need not address the District Court\u2019s alternative determination that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine bars Reynolds\u2019 claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
