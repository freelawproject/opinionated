After an unsuccessful direct appeal, Boomer challenged his conviction and sentence in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which was denied on the merits. See Dkt. No. 234. This Court upheld that ruling in C.A. No. 13-2514.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-21\">Boomer then filed a document entitled \u201cFirst Amendment Petition\u201d with the District Court. In it, he contended that his rights pursuant to the Fifth and Sixth Amendments were violated during his trial. He also alleged prosecutorial misconduct. He requested that the District Court grant him relief in the form of, <em>inter alia, </em>vacating his conviction and sentence, dismissing the indictment and charges, and releasing him from incarceration. The District Court found that this document was, in effect, a \u00a7 2255 motion. Because Boomer\u2019s previous \u00a7 2255 motion was denied, the District Court dismissed the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>stant motion as an unauthorized second or successive motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). Boomer timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Upon review, we conclude that the District Court correctly denied Boomer\u2019s petition for relief. The appropriate avenue for a federal petitioner to challenge the validity of his conviction and sentence is \u00a7 2255. <em>See In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 249 (3d Cir.1997). If a petitioner\u2019s previous \u00a7 2255 motions were denied, he must first seek authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 2244 and 2255(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">In the instant matter, Boomer sought to challenge the validity of his federal conviction. The District Court correctly determined that the proper vehicle for raising such a claim is a motion pursuant to \u00a7 2255. Because his previous \u00a7 2255 motion was denied, he was required to first seek authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 2244 and 2255(h). Accordingly, we discern no error in the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Boomer\u2019s petition. There being no substantial question presented on appeal, we will summarily affirm. Boomer\u2019s motions for leave to amend his response on appeal are granted, and we have considered his amended arguments in reaching our decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b43-22\">. We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\". We may summarily affirm a decision of the District Court if the appeal does not raise a substantial issue. 3d Cir. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
