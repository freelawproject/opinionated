The district court dismissed the petition, finding that Villalobos failed to satisfy the requirements to proceed under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Under \u00a7 2241, this court reviews findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo. <em>Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2003). Villalobos\u2019s challenge to the dismissal of the claim that his conviction was invalid in light of <em>United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008), is conelusory and offers no meaningful analysis of the district court\u2019s decision. As noted by the district court, this court, interpreting <em>Santos, </em>has held that where a defendant is convicted of laundering proceeds from the sale of drugs, the term \u201cproceeds\u201d means receipts rather than profits. <em>Wilson v. Roy, </em>643 F.3d 433, 436 (5th Cir.2011). Thus, the district court did not err in concluding that the holding of <em>Santos </em>does not undermine Villalobos\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to launder money.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">For the first time on appeal, Villalobos contends that his conviction for money laundering is invalid in light of <em>Cuellar v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 550, 128 S.Ct. 1994, 170 L.Ed.2d 942 (2008), and that this claim may proceed under the savings clause. Because Villalobos\u2019s challenge to his conviction based on the holding of <em>Cu-ellar </em>was not raised in the district court, we will not consider the argument on appeal. <em>See Wilson, </em>643 F.3d at 435 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b496-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R.. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
