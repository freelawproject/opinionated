We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-21\">1. The district court\u2019s finding that Meggitt SJC owned the trade secrets at issue was supported by the declarations offered by Meggitt SJC and the parties\u2019 Operations Governance Framework Agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>ment. The district court therefore properly exercised diversity jurisdiction over the dispute. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(2). Subject matter jurisdiction \u201crefers to a tribunal\u2019s power to hear a case\u201d and presents a separate question from whether the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (\u201cUTSA\u201d) applies extraterritorially. <em>Morrison v. Nat\u2019l Austl. Bank Ltd., </em>561 U.S. 247, 130 S.Ct. 2869, 2877, 177 L.Ed.2d 535 (2010) (quoting <em>Union Pac. R.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng\u2019rs &amp; Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment, Cent. Region, </em>558 U.S. 67, 81, 130 S.Ct. 584, 175 L.Ed.2d 428 (2009)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, Appellants miss the mark in contesting the district court\u2019s exercise of subject matter jurisdiction based on the extraterritorial reach of the UTSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">2. Meggitt SJC had standing to request injunctive relief because, as noted above, the district court correctly found that it owned the trade secrets. The fact that those trade secrets were disclosed and treated as proprietary to Meggitt Xiamen does not eliminate Meggitt SJC\u2019s standing. As pleaded in its complaint, Meggitt SJC derived independent economic value from the general lack of disclosure of the trade secrets to the public, and also undertook reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of those trade secrets. <em>See </em>Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 3426.1(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Appellants\u2019 remaining standing-related challenges are actually arguments pertaining to Meggitt SJC\u2019s likelihood of success on the merits. As such, those arguments have been waived because Appellants failed to file a timely opposition to Meggitt SJC\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. They are, moreover, unpersuasive. First, Appellants cite no state authority for the proposition that Meggitt SJC should have identified the particular trade secrets <em>at the pleading stage. </em>Rather, the authorities on which they rely simply require a plaintiff to identify a trade secret \u201cwith reasonable particularity\u201d prior to commencing discovery. <em>See </em>Cal.Civ. Proc.Code \u00a7 2019.210; <em>see also Silvaco Data Sys. v. Intel Corp., </em>184 Cal.App.4th 210, 109 Cal.Rptr.3d 27, 38 (2010). Meg-gitt SJC has done so. Second, Meggitt SJC adequately alleged that Appellants obtained the trade secrets at issue through unlawful means. <em>See </em>Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 3426.1(a). Meggitt SJC contended in its complaint and in its motion for a preliminary injunction that Nie violated his confidentiality agreement with Meggitt Xiamen. Even though Meggitt SJC was not a party to this agreement, Appellants nonetheless acquired the trade secrets at issue via a \u201cbreach ... <em>of a duty </em>to maintain secrecy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">3. The forum selection clause contained in Nie\u2019s confidentiality agreement with Meggitt Xiamen neither renders venue improper for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a), nor provides a basis for transfer under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a). <em>See Atl. Marine Const. Co., Inc. v. U.S. Dist. Court for the W. Dist. of Tex., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 568, 579, 187 L.Ed.2d 487 (2013). Meggitt SJC was not a party to the agreement, and thus is not bound by it. Moreover, the paragraph to which the forum selection clause applies does not encompass claims involving alleged misappropriation of trade secrets.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">4. Appellants\u2019 arguments regarding federal preemption of Meggitt SJC\u2019s state and common law claims, and their reliance on <em>TianRui Group Co. Ltd. v. International Trade Commission, </em>661 F.3d 1322 (Fed.Cir.2011), are misplaced. <em>TianRui Group </em>involved a \u201cdistinctly federal concern as to which Congress has created a federal remedy\u201d within \u201ca field of special federal concern\u201d \u2014 namely, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>exclusion of foreign goods pursuant to \u00a7 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 based on a congressional policy of protecting domestic industries from unfair competition. <em>Id. </em>at 1327. For that reason, \u201cthe case for applying a federal rule of decision [was] particularly strong.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">'In contrast, \u201cissues of trade secret misappropriation are ordinarily matters of state law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the Supreme Court has observed that \u201cCongress, by its silence over these many years, has seen the wisdom of allowing the States to enforce trade secret protection,\u201d and thus \u201c[u]ntil Congress takes affirmative action to the contrary, States should be free to grant protection to trade secrets.\u201d <em>Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., </em>416 U.S. 470, 493, 94 S.Ct. 1879, 40 L.Ed.2d 315 (1974); <em>see also Henry Hope X-Ray Prods., Inc. v. Marron Carrel, Inc., </em>674 F.2d 1336, 1339 (9th Cir.1982) (\u201cTrade secret protection is governed by state law.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">5. Appellants\u2019 arguments regarding the scope and form of the preliminary injunction have been waived. <em>See Barrientos v. 1801-1825 Morton LLC, </em>583 F.3d 1197, 1215-16 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">6. We lack jurisdiction to consider Appellants\u2019 arguments regarding expedited discovery. Appellants are not entitled to an interlocutory appeal as a matter of right under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a). The district court has not certified in an order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) that the issue presented by Appellants involves a \u201ccontrolling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion.\u201d Finally, Appellants cannot rely oh pendent appellate jurisdiction, as they fail to explain how the operation of California Civil Procedure Code \u00a7 2019.210 is either \u201cinextricably intertwined with, or necessary to ensure meaningful review of\u2019 the preliminary injunction at issue on appeal. <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Vaughn, </em>509 F.3d 1085, 1093 (9th Cir.2007). At best, they suggest that \u00a7 2019.210 \u201cassists the court and parties in defining the appropriate scope of discovery.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Opening Br. 15 (quoting <em>Soc. Apps, LLC v. Zynga, Inc., </em>No. 4:11-CV-04910 YGR, 2012 WL 2203063, at *2 (N.D.Cal. June 14, 2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b830-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

The district court specifically noted that the injunctive relief requested by Meggitt SJC was \u201cfully supported by [its] California Uniform Trade Secrets Act claim,\u201d and Appellants offer no argument that this decision constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
