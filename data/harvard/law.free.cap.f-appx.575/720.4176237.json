We dismiss the appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-19\">Bonneau contends that his due process rights were violated at a prison disciplinary hearing in April 2011 that resulted in the loss of seven days of good-conduct time and the loss of telephone privileges. After filing his section 2241 petition, Bonneau completed the custodial portion of the sentence that he was serving at the time of the disciplinary hearing and was placed on supervised release. The record further reflects that, in December 2013, the district court revoked supervised release and imposed a new sentence. Because there is no injury than can be redressed with a favorable decision, the case is moot. <em>See Burnett v. Lampert, </em>432 F.3d 996, 1000-01 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-20\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b748-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
