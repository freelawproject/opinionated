The district court applied what the Sentencing Commission\u2019s Guidelines Manual refers to as a \u201ccross reference\u201d and sentenced James in the same manner as if he had committed attempted second-degree murder. James argues that applying the cross reference was procedurally improper and that, even if it were proper, the district court lacked sufficient evidence to sentence James under the attempted-murder cross reference. James also argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. Because applying the cross reference was procedurally appropriate and because the district court carefully explained the evidentiary foundation for employing it, we affirm the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b617-21\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b617-22\">At sentencing, the parties accepted the facts stated in James\u2019s presentence report.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 30, 2012, James was at the apartment of his girlfriend, Tabron Houston. While James was there, Percil Walls, also known as Pig, arrived. According to James, Walls had been fighting with Houston, and Walls kicked down Houston\u2019s apartment door, dragged her outside, and began punching, kicking, and choking her.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> James stated that five minutes into Walls\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>attack on Houston, he ran toward Walls, who fled. According to James, he and several companions then left in a car for a store.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">James stated that, while he was away, Houston called to inform him that Walls had returned and \u201cbusted\u201d her window. According to James, he returned to check on Houston and saw Walls running from the broken window. James stated that he \u201ckind of got out of the car window\u201d on the passenger side and fired one shot \u201cup in the air.\u201d The bullet struck a parked car.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The Memphis Police Department responded to a report of gunshots at Houston\u2019s apartment complex. Officers stopped and searched James\u2019s vehicle, which matched the description provided to them. In the trunk, officers found a black .40-caliber handgun and a loaded magazine.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Officers subsequently obtained a surveillance video of the incident. According to the presentence report, the video depicted a car entering the apartment complex and a man walking on the sidewalk. As the car approached the pedestrian, a man in the car climbed out of the front passenger window and fired a shot over the top of the car in the direction of the pedestrian. Several individuals ran from the scene. Officers identified James as the shooter in the video. James is a convicted felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">On March 22, 2013, James pleaded guilty, without a plea agreement, to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). His presen-tence report determined that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 provided the base offense level for the sentencing of offenses under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Because James had a prior felony conviction for either a crime of violence or a controlled-substance offense, his base offense level would have been 20, under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4). But the presentence report noted that \u00a7 2K2.1(c) instructs that a sentencing court should apply a \u201ccross reference\u201d if the defendant used a firearm in connection with the commission or attempted commission of another offense. The presentence report determined that James possessed a firearm in connection with attempted murder, and it therefore assigned him a base offense level of 27, under \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(2), the guideline applicable to attempted second-degree murder. After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1, James\u2019s offense level was 24. The presen-tence report assigned James six criminal-history points, which corresponded to a criminal-history category of III. An offense level of 24 and a criminal-history category of III resulted in a guideline range<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of 63-78 months for James.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">On June 28, 2013, the district court held a sentencing hearing. At sentencing, James objected to the application of the cross reference of \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(2) for attempted second-degree murder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The gov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>eminent provided evidence to support applying the cross reference. The district court found that the evidence supported applying the cross reference and stated its reasoning on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">At sentencing, the government objected to a three-level \u2014 rather than a two-level\u2014 reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The government\u2019s rationale was that \u201cthe government had to introduce witnesses and testimony\u201d to justify applying the attempted-murder cross reference. The district court granted the government\u2019s motion for only a two-level aeceptance-of-responsibility reduction. This resulted in a total offense level of 25 and a criminal-history category of III, which corresponded to a guideline range of 70-87 months. After allocution and analysis of the \u00a7 3558 factors, the district court sentenced James to 80 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">On appeal, James argues that applying the \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(2) cross reference was procedurally inappropriate because the act of attempting second-degree murder does not facilitate the underlying violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1), i.e., being a felon in possession of a firearm. He also argues that the evidence was insufficient to show that he possessed the mens rea of intending to cause death, a necessary element of attempted murder. Additionally, James argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is longer than necessary to accomplish justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s legal conclusions underlying the guideline range chosen, and we review for clear error the court\u2019s factual findings. <em>United States v. Bolds, </em>511 F.3d 568, 579 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">A. Application of the Cross Reference for Attempted Second-Degree Murder</p>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">James argues that the district court committed procedural error in determining his guideline range using the guideliiie for attempted second-degree murder. As in other cases interpreting the Guidelines, this case requires us to navigate the Manual\u2019s structure with a careful reading of its language.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">The Guidelines Manual\u2019s statutory index specifies \u00a7 2K2.1 as the guideline section applicable to convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). U.S.S.G. app. A. This section assigns an offense level for a defendant convicted of unlawful possession of firearms. Ordinarily, defendants receive a base offense level of 20 if they possessed a firearm as a felon previously convicted of either a crime of violence or a controlled-substance offense. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). But \u00a7 2K2.1 also provides for a \u201ccross reference,\u201d under which the sentencing court must apply U.S.S.G \u00a7 2X1.1 \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm ... in connection with the commission or attempted commission of another offense.\u201d \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l)(A).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Manual defines \u201canother offense\u201d as \u201cany federal, state, or local offense ... regardless of whether a criminal charge was brought, or a conviction obtained.\u201d \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 14(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-16\">Section 2X1.1, in turn, assigns offense levels for offenses of attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy not covered by a specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>offense guideline. \u00a7 2Xl.l(b). This section, furthermore, contains its own cross-reference provision: \u201cWhen an attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy is expressly covered by another offense guideline section,\u201d the sentencing court must apply <em>that </em>guideline section. \u00a7 2Xl.l(c). Because \u00a7 2A2.1 expressly covers the offense of attempted murder, a sentencing court must apply that section rather than \u00a7 2Xl.l(b). Under \u00a7 2A2.1, a defendant receives a base offense level of 27 for attempted second-degree murder. \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Additionally, \u00a7 1B1.3, titled \u201cRelevant Conduct (Factors that Determine the Guideline Range),\u201d restricts how a sentencing court may apply the Manual\u2019s various cross-reference provisions. The section provides, in relevant part, that \u201ccross references ... shall be determined on the basis of ... all acts ... that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction.\u201d \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">James argues that his conduct does not satisfy the Manual\u2019s definition of \u201crelevant conduct\u201d because attempted second-degree murder is not a crime that <em>facilitates </em>a violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1), being a felon in possession of firearms. Under James\u2019s reading of \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l), a sentencing court should ask \u201cwhether the conduct alleged <em>facilitated the defendant\u2019s completion of his or her criminal acts </em>that led to an indictment and conviction.\u201d Appellant Br. 17-18 (emphasis added). Under James\u2019s theory, his shooting the gun cannot be \u201crelevant conduct\u201d because he did not do so <em>\u201cin an effort to complete the act </em>that led to his conviction.\u201d Appellant Br. 19 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The problem with James\u2019s argument is that it imposes a restriction on \u201crelevant conduct\u201d that does not exist in the Manual. Nothing in the language of \u00a7 1B1.3 suggests that the alleged conduct must facilitate or further the underlying offense of conviction. And James points us to no case that has so interpreted \u201crelevant conduct.\u201d James cites <em>United States v. Mayle, </em>334 F.3d 552 (6th Cir.2003), in which we held that the sentencing court properly determined that a murder committed \u201cin order to facilitate [a] fraud offense\u201d was relevant conduct under \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l). <em>Id. </em>at 564. Nothing in <em>Mayle </em>suggests, however, that the alleged conduct need <em>always </em>further the offense of conviction. In fact, even in <em>Mayle, </em>the dispositive finding for the court was that the murder \u201cwas conduct that occurred <em>during the commission of </em>the fraud offense,\u201d which is the actual language of \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l). <em>Mayle, </em>334 F.3d at 564 (emphasis added). James also relies on a statement in <em>United States v. Scolaro, </em>299 F.3d 956, 957 (8th Cir.2002): \u201cThe plain meaning of [\u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l) ] contemplates conduct taken prior to, and in order to facilitate, the charged offense.\u201d Again, nothing in <em>Scolaro </em>suggests that \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l) <em>requires </em>that the relevant conduct facilitate the charged offense. Because James allegedly shot at Walls \u201cduring the commission of the offense of conviction\u201d \u2014 i.e., while being a felon in possession of a firearm \u2014 the district court properly applied \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(2) as a cross reference for attempted second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">James also argues that we \u201cshould not continue to allow defendants to be subjected to [the] practice\u201d of being sentenced based on uncharged conduct. This view has support from some jurists. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 288, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (Stevens, J., dissenting, joined by Souter &amp; Scalia, JJ.) (\u201c[I]ncreasing a defendant\u2019s sentence on the basis of conduct not proved at trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>... is contrary to the very core of <em>Appren-di.... </em>[C]ertain applications of \u2018relevant conduct\u2019 sentencing are unconstitutional.\u201d); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>910 F.2d 1321, 1331-32 (6th Cir.1990) (Merritt, J., dissenting) (\u201cAlmost the entire spectrum of Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights granted to the accused are denied by the literal reading and enforcement of [the \u2018relevant conduct\u2019 provision] because, according to its procedure, a defendant may never be informed of the specific charge against him until the probation report issues.... The real charge for which the defendant will be sentenced will be drawn up in the probation office, and the sentence will be imposed without the right of confrontation at the sentencing hearing by the court on the basis of hearsay information.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">These views, however, do not represent prevailing law. Our task on appeal is limited to considering whether the district court\u2019s application of the cross reference was correct under existing law. It is. The Manual itself states that under \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l), the \u201crelevant conduct\u201d \u201cfocus is on the specific acts and omissions for which the defendant is to be held accountable in determining the applicable guideline range, rather than on whether the defendant is criminally liable for an offense.\u201d \u00a7 1B1.3 cmt. n. 1. And James himself recognizes that binding precedent forecloses his argument. <em>See </em>Appellant Br. 19. We have repeatedly held that the Manual allows uncharged conduct to form the basis for the base offense level and that such action is constitutional. <em>United States v. Shafer, </em>199 F.3d 826, 830 (6th Cir.1999) (\u201cOur cases have interpreted the relevant conduct provision of \u00a7 IB 1.3(a)(2) to include conduct of a criminal nature for which a defendant could not otherwise be held criminally liable.\u201d); <em>United States v. Davern, </em>970 F.2d 1490, 1494 (6th Cir.1992) (en banc) (\u201cThe law in this Circuit is clear that a base offense level is determined by the amount of drugs included in the defendant\u2019s relevant conduct, not just amounts in the offense of conviction or charged in the indictment.\u201d); <em>Miller, </em>910 F.2d at 1327 (majority opinion); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>887 F.2d 104, 108 (6th Cir.1989); <em>see also United States v. Sanchez, </em>527 Fed.Appx. 488, 492 (6th Cir.2013) (\u201cCircuit precedent is clear: the use of a firearm is relevant conduct that can trigger \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l)\u2019s cross reference to \u00a7 2Xl.l\u2019s enhancement provision even if the weapon used in the related conduct is different from the weapon that formed the basis for the \u00a7 922(g) offense,\u201d under certain circumstances.).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">James argues, however, that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), calls into question the practice of sentencing defendants based on uncharged conduct. <em>Al-leyne </em>held that \u201cany fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury.\u201d <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2155. James correctly notes that <em>Alleyne </em>is not <em>directly </em>controlling because the Court\u2019s holding involved \u201cfacts that increase mandatory minimum sentences,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2163, and that the conduct at issue in his case \u2014 attempted murder\u2014 did not increase a mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>Appellant Br. 22. There is no statutory minimum sentence for the felon-in-possession offense. The government states that the rule of <em>Alleyne </em>does not apply to James because the use of the attempted-murder guideline in sentencing for the felon-in-possession offense was only an \u201cenhancement\u201d based on \u201ca guideline provision, not a statutory provision.\u201d Ap-pellee Br. 18. Sentencing James based on a finding of attempted murder rather than simply for the convicted offense, however, had the effect of more than doubling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>James\u2019s guideline range.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The government goes further, stating: \u201cThe <em>Apprendi </em>rule does not extend to guideline determinations that do not change the statutory range, as long as the district court considers the guidelines to be advisory and not mandatory.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The government, however, fails to contend head on with <em>Alleyne, </em>the Court\u2019s most recent statement on the <em>Apprendi </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">It is true that <em>Alleyne </em>contains expansive language suggesting that the Court may be rethinking the precise contours of the <em>Apprendi </em>doctrine. \u201cWhen a finding of fact alters the legally prescribed punishment so as to aggravate it, the fact necessarily forms a constituent part of a new offense and must be submitted to the jury. <em>It is no answer to say that the defendant could have received the same sentence with or without that fact. </em>\u201d <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2162 (emphasis added). In <em>Alleyne, </em>the defendant was convicted of using a firearm in relation to a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). The statute authorizes a sentence of five years to life; if the firearm is brandished, the authorized sentence is seven years to life. <em>See Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2155. In <em>Alleyne, </em>the sentencing court treated brandishing as a sentencing factor that it could find by a preponderance of the evidence, and it sentenced the defendant to seven years of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 2156. The Court held that this was impermissible \u201cbecause the legally prescribed range <em>is </em>the penalty affixed to the crime ... [and] that a fact increasing either end of the range produced a new penalty and constitutes an ingredient of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2160. The dissent objected that the seven-year sentence could have been statutorily imposed, with or without a judicial finding of brandishing, because the jury\u2019s verdict alone authorized a sentence of five years to life. <em>Id. </em>at 2169-70 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). For the majority, however, \u201cthis fact [was] beside the point,\u201d and it rejected this reasoning. <em>Id. </em>at 2162, 2162 n. 3 (majority opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Somewhat similar logic applies here. Sentencing James to 80 months of imprisonment is presumably permissible because the authorized sentence is up to 120 months. \u00a7 924(a)(2). The sentencing court could have legally imposed a sentence of 80 months of imprisonment, with or without applying the attempted-murder cross reference. Yet the <em>Alleyne </em>majority rejected this reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">The advisory nature of the guidelines system may also not be a dispositive answer to James\u2019s claim. In another sen-teneing-law case last term, the Court recognized that the guidelines, <em>in practice, </em>at least drive, if not determine, a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See Peugh v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2072, 2083, 186 L.Ed.2d 84 (2013). In <em>Peugh, </em>the Court held that sentencing a defendant under a version of the Manual promulgated after commission of the criminal act violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 2078. In doing so, the Court acknowledged that in usual cases, a sentencing court will impose a within-guidelines sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 2083. \u201cThat a district court may ultimately sentence a given defendant outside the Guidelines range does not deprive the Guidelines of force as the framework for sentencing.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court recognized the reality that a sentence outside the guideline range is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>often unlikely.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 2083-84. The dissent objected that the \u201cGuidelines do not constrain the discretion of district courts and, thus, have no legal effect on a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2089. The Court rejected this reasoning, at least for ex post facto purposes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 2086-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Additionally, Justice Thomas, writing for four Justices in Part III-A of <em>Alleyne, </em>went even further, stating that a \u201cwell-established,\u201d early American practice was \u201cincluding in the indictment, and submitting to the jury, <em>every fact </em>that was the basis for imposing or increasing punishment.\u201d <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2159 (plurality opinion as to Part III-A) (emphasis added). Justice Thomas wrote: the \u201cdefendant\u2019s ability to predict with certainty the judgment from the face of the felony indictment flowed from the invariable linkage of punishment with crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2160 (quoting <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 478, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Although Justice Thomas\u2019s opinion carries some force here, we decline to extend <em>Alleyne </em>beyond its four corners for three reasons. First \u2014 and foremost \u2014 we believe that if the Court wished in <em>Alleyne </em>to create a sea change in sentencing practice, it would have said so expressly. Second, the <em>Alleyne </em>Court observed that its ruling \u201cdoes not mean that any fact that influences judicial discretion must be found by a jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2163. Arguably, following the guidelines by referring to an uncharged offense does more than \u201cinfluence\u201d judicial discretion, but the point remains. Third, four post <em>-Alleyne </em>unanimous panels of this court have taken for granted that the rule of <em>Alleyne </em>applies only to mandatory minimum sentences. <em>See Rogers v. United States, </em>561 Fed.Appx. 440, 443 (6th Cir.2014) (unpublished) (district court did not violate defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment jury-trial right when it applied a cross reference to the attempted-murder guideline because <em>Alleyne </em>does not \u201crequire that every fact giving rise to [a] cross-reference in [a] guidelines calculation be submitted to a jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>552 Fed.Appx. 432, 440 n. 4 (6th Cir.2014) (unpublished) (\u201cThe judicial fact-finding here did not affect the statutorily authorized penalties, so <em>Alleyne </em>is not implicated.\u201d); <em>United States v. Cook, </em>550 Fed.Appx. 265, 275 (6th Cir.2014) (unpublished) <em>(Alleyne </em>does not require reversal of sentence because \u201c[n]o statutory mandatory minimum applied to his convictions for being a felon in possession of a firearm.\u201d); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>732 F.3d 577, 584 (2013) <em>(\u201cAlleyne </em>did not extend <em>Apprendi </em>to facts that do not increase the prescribed statutory penalties.\u201d). Although it may be troubling to some that the Guidelines Manual instructs sentencing courts to substitute the cross-referenced offense for the conduct actually charged, effectively resulting in an enhanced sentence for a completely different offense, having closely considered Alleyne\u2019s language, we now affirm our <em>pre-Alleyne </em>holdings that a sentencing court may determine an offense level by cross-referencing a guideline for an uncharged offense. Until the Supreme Court directly revisits this issue, the best practice is to remain within the four corners of <em>Alleyne. </em>Accordingly, ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>plying the attempted-murder cross reference was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">James also argues that there was insufficient evidence for the district court to find that he possessed the requisite mens rea to commit attempted murder. James correctly states that at common law, \u201c[a]l-though a murder may be committed without an intent to kill, an attempt to commit murder requires a specific intent to kill.\u201d <em>Braxton v. United States, </em>500 U.S. 344, 351 n. *, 111 S.Ct. 1854, 114 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991); <em>accord Merritt v. Commonwealth, </em>164 Va. 653, 180 S.E. 395, 399 (1935) (\u201cTo commit murder, one need not intend to take life; but to be guilty of an attempt to murder, he must so intend. It is not sufficient that his act, had it proved fatal, would have been murder.\u201d). For the district court to employ the attempted-murder cross reference, it needed to find by a preponderance of the evidence that James intended to kill Walls. <em>See United States v. Gates, </em>461 F.3d 703, 708 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">At the sentencing hearing, James accepted the facts in the presentence report but objected to the government\u2019s determination that the facts constituted attempted murder. James admitted that, consistent with the presentence report, he shot \u201cin the air\u201d but that the bullet hit a parked car. The government characterized the facts differently and argued that James shot the gun with the intent to kill Walls. The district court did not simply accept the government\u2019s characterization. It stated: \u201cIf there\u2019s an objection ... with respect to the facts, whether or not the facts amount to ... an attempted] murder, I would have to receive some proof on that to make the final decision.\u201d The district court also stated that James\u2019s objection \u201cshift[ed] the burden of proof really on the government\u201d and that the government was \u201cgoing to have to prove\u201d attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">At James\u2019s sentencing, the government called three witnesses, and James cross-examined each. The government also introduced the surveillance video into the record. At the close of evidence, the district court afforded both the government and James an opportunity to argue their positions in light of the evidence presented. James argued that the evidence did not prove a specific intent to kill. The district court detailed the evidence in the record and concluded that James possessed the intent to kill. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">The video was just compelling. It is just obvious.... [I]t\u2019s obvious on the video what [James] does. It\u2019s compelling. He is on the side of the car away from [Walls]. He comes out of the window, and y1 all correct me if I am wrong, but this is what I saw on the video, he comes out of the window, actually looks like he sits on the door with his arm over the top of the roof of the car aiming across towards where [Walls] is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEj\">Additionally, the district court addressed and rejected James\u2019s characterization that he shot \u201cin the air.\u201d It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-10\">Shots fired, not in the air \u2014 yes, any shot goes in the air, so I guess \u2014 technically, I guess it was shot in the air, but ... when you shoot in the air, you are shooting upward. And his arm is laying on the roof of the car in the direction of where the ex-boyfriend was, and [a shot is] fired, and it hits an SUV. It doesn\u2019t hit the roof of a building. It doesn\u2019t hit the upstairs window of a building or a tree, it hits a vehicle parked on the driver\u2019s side.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">James argues that the district court\u2019s language suggests that it found that he acted recklessly toward <em>others </em>and not specifically toward Walls, which would be insufficient to support attempted murder. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Appellant Br. 25. James highlights the following statement by the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">I also make note that when that car came around there and shots fired, al 1 the other people that were out there ran for their lives. I don\u2019t know if y\u2019all noticed that. The two guys that were on the side of the building, they ran for their lives because they knew what was happening, and so just based on the proof that was presented and that video, I\u2019m sorry, at least there was an assault with an intent to commit a second degree murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-6\"><em>Ibid. </em>James quotes this statement out of context. In context, it is evident that the district court described the reaction of bystanders chiefly as evidence that James fired the gun <em>parallel to the ground, </em>such that the shot could have hit Walls, and not, as James argued, \u201cinto the air.\u201d James also notes that the presentence report lists \u201csociety\u201d as the victim of his offense. But there is no evidence that the district court placed any weight on this. The district court\u2019s finding that James had the specific intent to kill Walls was not clear error. The district court\u2019s review of the evidence was thorough and nuanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">C. Substantive Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">James argues that his 80-month sentence overemphasized the seriousness of the offense because the application of the attempted-murder cross reference, along with the district court\u2019s emphasis on the seriousness of the offense in its \u00a7 3553(a) analysis, resulted in impermissible \u201cdouble-counting [of] James[\u2019s] offense conduct.\u201d Appellant Br. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">As noted, the district court determined that James\u2019s guideline range was 70-87 months. The district court stated that it must consider the sentencing goals provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court afforded a chance to speak to James, his counsel, and the prosecutor. The court specifically considered \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant involved,\u201d; James\u2019s \u201ccriminal history ... [which was] not the worst criminal [history] I have seen,\u201d <em>ibid.; </em>James\u2019s background, upbringing, and family; James\u2019s \u201cphysical condition,\u201d; his \u201cmental and emotional health,\u201d; his education; employment history; and the seriousness of the offense and the need to promote respect for the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">Because James\u2019s sentence was within the guideline range, we apply a \u201cpresumption of reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Vonner, </em>516 F.3d 382, 389 (6th Cir.2008) (en banc); <em>accord Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). James has not overcome this presumption. \u201cThe fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">James argues the sentence is unreasonable because the sentence double counts his conduct, i.e., shooting at Walls. But no impermissible double counting occurred. The district court did not depart upward from the sentencing range, and the sentence imposed was near the mid-point of the guideline range. James also faults the district court for failing to compare his sentence to those of other defendants convicted of the same crime under similar circumstances. There is no requirement that a sentencing court conduct a side-by-side comparison on the record. \u201c[T]he district judge should ... consider all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, but it need not \u201crefer explicitly to each of the statutory sentencing factors when imposing a sentence,\u201d <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>587 F.3d 348, 358 (6th Cir.2009). Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing James to a within-guidelines sentence of 80 months, we find that the sentence is substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The district court properly applied the attempted-murder cross reference because \u201crelevant conduct,\u201d under \u00a7 lB1.3(a), need not facilitate the underlying offense. It need only \u201coccu[r] during the commission of the offense of conviction.\u201d \u00a7 lB1.3(a). Additionally, <em>Alleyne </em>does not alter our long-established holding that a defendant may be sentenced for uncharged conduct. We, therefore, AFFIRM the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-14\">.
