He argues that the above-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He argues that his offense of illegal reentry was, at most, an international trespass and that his offense level was inflated because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>fectively double counts a defendant\u2019s criminal history. He argues further that the district court gave inordinate weight to his remote, relatively minor prior offenses and failed to give sufficient weight to his personal circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Hernandez has not shown that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. We have rejected the argument that the Guidelines overstate the seriousness of illegal reentry because it is simply an international-trespass offense. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008). We have likewise rejected the argument that a sentence imposed pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2 is necessarily greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a) due to any double counting that is inherent in that guideline. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Furthermore, the record reflects that the district court had an adequate basis for the sentence imposed and was guided by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in deciding that an upward variance was merited. The district court made an individualized assessment and concluded that the guidelines range did not adequately take into account the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including Hernandez\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to promote respect for the laws of the United States, the need to provide a just punishment, and the need to deter future crimes. Specifically, the district court determined that the guidelines range did not account for Hernandez\u2019s extensive prior criminal history. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 709 (5th Cir.2006). Hernandez has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Nor has he shown that the district court abused its discretion with respect to the extent of the variance. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 348-50 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
