We grant the petition and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-25\">Midence sought asylum and withholding of removal based on persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group consisting of young men from Honduras who refused to join gangs. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), 1231(b)(3)(A). He also moved the BIA to remand his case to the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) in light of the IJ\u2019s failure to consider Midence\u2019s membership in a particular social group consisting of young, handicapped, Catholic men in Honduras who refuse to join gangs.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-26\">The BIA reasoned that the particular social groups in which Midence claimed membership are not cognizable under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The BIA has since published two precedential opinions clarifying its interpretation of the term \u201cparticular social group\u201d in light of <em>Henriquez-Rivas v. Holder, </em>707 F.3d 1081 (9th Cir.2013) (en banc). <em>See Matter of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number><em>W-G-R-, </em>26 I. &amp; N. Dec. 208 (2014); <em>Matter of M-E-V-G-, </em>26 I. &amp; N. Dec. 227 (2014). As in a recent case, \u201cwe remand the petition to the BIA to consider [Mi-dence\u2019s] asylum claim in light of those decisions.... We also advise the BIA to consider [Midence\u2019s] petition in light of <em>Henriquez-Rivas </em>....\u201d <em>Pirir-Boc v. Holder, </em>750 F.3d 1077, 1084, 2014 WL 1797657, at *5 (9th Cir.
