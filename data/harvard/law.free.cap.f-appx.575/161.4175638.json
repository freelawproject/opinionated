Ussery reserved the right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the firearm recov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>ered subsequent to a <em>Terry </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> stop. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">When considering a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, we review its factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. McGee, </em>736 F.3d 263, 269 (4th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1572, 188 L.Ed.2d 580 (2014). Where the district court has denied a motion to suppress, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Black, </em>707 F.3d 531, 534 (4th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Consistent with the Fourth Amendment, a police officer may stop a person for investigative purposes when the officer has reasonable suspicion based on articulable facts \u201cthat criminal activity \u2018may be afoot.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002) (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868). Whether there is reasonable suspicion to justify the stop depends on the totality of the circumstances, including the information known to. the officer and any reasonable inferences to be drawn at the time of the stop. <em>Id. </em>at 273-74, 122 S.Ct. 744; <em>United States v. Foster, </em>634 F.3d 243, 246 (4th Cir.2011). The reasonable suspicion assessment is a \u201ccommonsensical proposition,\u201d and deference should be accorded to police officers\u2019 determinations based on their practical experience and training. <em>United States v. Foreman, </em>369 F.3d 776, 782 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">With these standards in mind, and having carefully reviewed the transcript of the suppression hearing, the record, and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the officers had reasonable suspicion to initiate a <em>Terry </em>stop and that the district court properly denied Ussery\u2019s motion to suppress. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b190-23\"> <em>Terry v.
