Morgan Chase Bank (\u201cChase\u201d). Plaintiffs filed suit in October 2012, alleging that Chase breached a contract related to a borrowing agreement entered into in 2000, which affected property owned by Plaintiffs. In May 2008, more than four years prior to initiating the instant case, Plaintiffs filed a voluntary Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, which was converted to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy on August 5, 2008, and then converted again to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy on August 27, 2008. The Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustee is Samera L. Abide.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-23\">The filing of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition creates an estate consisting of \u201call legal or equitable interests of the debtor in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>property as of the commencement of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cThe phrase \u2018all legal or equitable interests\u2019 includes legal claims \u2014 -whether based on state or federal law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A bankruptcy trustee is the representative of the bankruptcy estate and has the capacity to sue and be sued.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThus, a trustee ... is the real party in interest, and is the only party with standing to prosecute causes of action belonging to the estate once the bankruptcy petition has been filed.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(a) requires that \u201c[a]n action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Relying on these principles, the district court found that the Plaintiffs lacked standing because they were not the real party in interest to prosecute their claim for breach of contract. The district court reasoned that the trustee was the only party capable of bringing the claim because it accrued before the filing of their bankruptcy petition in 2008, had never been abandoned by the trustee, and was therefore part of the bankrupt estate. For the reasons stated above and those set forth in the district court\u2019s careful September 24, 2013, Memorandum Order, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion, and affirm its judgment. All pending motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
