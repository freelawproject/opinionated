We dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-22\">Branagh contends that the district court abused its discretion by declining to vary downward from the advisory Guidelines range that applied to him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. The government contends that this appeal should be dismissed based on an appeal waiver. We review de novo whether to enforce an appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Joyce, </em>357 F.3d 921, 922 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-23\">Branagh waived the right to challenge \u201cthe term of imprisonment imposed by the Court,\u201d but he retained the right to chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>lenge the district court\u2019s determination of whether he was a career offender. We dismiss this appeal because Branagh only challenges the term of imprisonment imposed by the district court and does not challenge the correctness of the district court\u2019s career offender determination. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cA defendant\u2019s waiver of his appellate rights is enforceable if the language of the waiver encompasses his right to appeal on the grounds raised, and if the waiver was knowingly and voluntarily made.\u201d). Moreover, contrary to Branagh\u2019s contention, the appeal waiver is unambiguous, and the record reflects that he knowingly and voluntarily entered into the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b766-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
