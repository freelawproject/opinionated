The Appeals Council consolidated her applications, amended the onset date of her disability to August 2007, and remanded. Thompson narrowed her claim to allege that she became disabled from fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. An administrative law judge rejected this claim, and the Appeals Council denied review. The district court concluded that sufficient evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision. Thompson appeals raising six issues, but we conclude that she waived three of those by failing to raise them in the district court. The remaining three issues, challenging the ALJ\u2019s handling of the testimony of her primary-care physician, its RFC determination, and its description of her fibromyalgia diagnosis, lack merit. We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">I.BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">Thompson was 55 years old when she first applied for DIB. She had stopped working a year earlier, in January 2005, after taking a disability leave from her job as a business analyst for State Farm Insurance:</p>\n<p id=\"b698-15\">1) Medical History</p>\n<p id=\"b698-16\">Thompson has received treatment for a host of mental and physical conditions since at least 2003. She began seeing Dr. Stephen Belgrave, a family physician, in 1983, and as early as December 2003 complained to him that fatigue, restless legs, and problems sleeping were keeping her from full-time work. A psychiatrist, Dr. Charles Hawley, prescribed Thompson medication for her fatigue, which she reported \u201chelped a lot,\u201d allowing her to return to full-time work in October 2004. In November 2004, she began complaining of back pain, and Dr. Belgrave referred her to pain specialist and osteopath Dr. Christopher Rink. Dr. Rink noted that Thomp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>son exhibited features often associated with fibromyalgia, except that her pain was limited to her head and did not diffuse into her extremities, as is typical with fi-bromyalgia. Thompson\u2019s sleep improved, and in January 2005 she vacationed in Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">When Thompson returned from her trip, however, Dr. Belgrave advised her not to return to work and to allow further evaluation based on her \u201cconstellation of symptoms and long-standing problems.\u201d Thompson gradually improved in the subsequent weeks, but Dr. Belgrave advised her to remain home because \u201cshe is on the verge of needing disability\u201d and returning to work \u201cmight cause her to be terminated.\u201d In February 2005, Thompson contacted a physician working with State Farm, Dr. Zehr about pursuing disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Dr. Hawley met with Thompson again in March and wrote in his progress notes that he had spoken with Dr. Zehr, who told him that Thompson had been on temporary disability intermittently for several years and feared that Thompson would be fired if she returned to work before fully recovering. Dr. Hawley opined that \u201cprobably she is not going to improve\u201d and \u201cshe probably does have an early dementia,\u201d yet he diagnosed her only with a somatoform disorder \u2014 a mental illness that can cause bodily symptoms, such as pain, without any physical cause. <em>See So-matoform Disorders, </em>WebMD.com, http:// www.webmd.com/mentalhealth/ somatoform-disorders-symptoms-types-treatment (last reviewed on May 29, 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Drs. Belgrave and Hawley in April 2005 referred Thompson to a neuropsychologist, Dr. Joseph Alper, to evaluate her memory problems. He concluded that Thompson\u2019s behavior was \u201cstrongly suggestive of a fronto-temporal dementia,\u201d also known as Pick\u2019s disease, <em>see NINDS Frontotemporal Dementia Information Page, </em>NIH, http:// www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/picks/picks. htm (last updated July 18, 2014). However, it was not until a follow-up in June 2005 that he gave that as his diagnosis. Also in April 2005, neurologist Dr. William Landau evaluated Thompson for back pain. He found no cause for the pain but reported that Thompson had said she felt unable to sit still for two hours at a time, had a tingling sensation in her toes, and \u201creally doesn\u2019t want to go back to work,\u201d preferring to stay home with her new boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">In July 2005, Thompson told Dr. Hawley that she disagreed with Dr. Alper\u2019s diagnosis of Pick\u2019s disease. While Dr. Hawley agreed with Dr. Belgrave that her illness was not work-related, he sent a letter to State Farm recommending that she go on permanent disability based on her Pick\u2019s disease. In August 2005 Thompson saw another neurologist, Dr. Kristopher Bujar-ski. He reported Thompson\u2019s chief complaint as back pain. He also spoke with Thompson\u2019s daughter and boyfriend; the boyfriend related little evidence of a serious condition, but the daughter stated that Thompson\u2019s personality had \u201cdramatically change[d]\u201d and that her lifestyle had changed. Dr. Bujarski agreed that \u201cthe most likely diagnosis is frontotemporal dementia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">In September 2005, Thompson was asked by State Farm to take a permanent disability leave. The next month, on a referral from Dr. Hawley, she saw yet another neurologist, Dr. Karyn Catt, who noted that Thompson seemed to have several memory issues and \u201cprobably is an unreliable historian.\u201d Dr. Catt agreed with the diagnosis of Pick\u2019s disease. Although Thompson initially said that \u201cshe does not mind having this diagnosis so that she can receive disability,\u201d she later became agitated when Dr. Catt mentioned the diagnosis of probable dementia.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>In February 2006, Dr. Belgrave stated in a progress note that Thompson should qualify for permanent disability because she had shown symptoms of back pain for more than six months. He completed a form stating as much. It was then that Thompson first applied for disability insurance benefits based on her diagnoses of Pick\u2019s disease and restless leg syndrome, though she had not complained about the latter since 2004. She did not assert any difficulties working based on back pain, chronic fatigue, or fibromyalgia. Thompson alleged an onset date in January 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The next month, in March 2006, Thompson met with psychologist Dr. William Hil-ger on a referral; Dr. Hilger reviewed Thompson\u2019s psychological problems in connection with her disability application. Dr. Hilger opined that Thompson did not have dementia, \u201ccertainly not of the Pick\u2019s type if she does have dementia,\u201d and was mentally capable of managing benefit payments, if she received them. In April 2006, Dr. Hima Alturi, a consulting physician, examined Thompson and reported no limitations on limb movements, walking, squatting, or any other functions attributable to her back pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">In May 2006, Dr. Belgrave completed a \u201cPhysical Capacities Evaluation\u201d in support of Thompson\u2019s application for disability benefits. He concluded that in an 8-hour workday, Thompson could occasionally climb, balance, stoop, kneel, crawl, reach above her head, and carry up to 50 pounds. He believed a sit \u2014 stand option would benefit Thompson based on her back pain and that Pick\u2019s disease was her \u201cmain disabling factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Also in support of her application, psychologist Dr. Cheri Miller, who had been treating Thompson since May 2005, submitted a letter stating that Thompson seemed unable to \u201chandle the riggers [sic] of full time employment.\u201d By the end of 2006, Dr. Belgrave opined in his notes that Thompson soon could return to part-time work that \u201cdoes not cause a lot of psychological stress.\u201d In May 2007, he wrote in a letter addressed \u201cTo Whom It May Concern\u201d that Thompson \u201cwould be unable to perform her required duties\u201d if placed in a stressful work environment. In July 2007, Dr. Shanna Kurth, yet another neuropsy-chologist, conducted an independent assessment of Thompson from an unspecified referral. Dr. Kurth disagreed with Dr. Belgrave and found \u201c[n]o evidence of a formal thought disorder,\u201d questioned the diagnosis of dementia, and instead concluded that Thompson had a personality disorder or somatoform disorder and simply did not want to return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">In August 2007, State Farm ended Thompson\u2019s disability coverage because, Thompson was told, there was nothing medically wrong with her, and it was \u201call in [her] head.\u201d Soon thereafter, psychiatrist Dr. Carmen Chase examined Thompson, concluding that she did not have dementia but did have Major Depressive Disorder and, in agreement with Dr. Kurth, also might have a somatoform disorder. Dr. Chase added that it was possible Thompson was malingering. In a follow-up visit with Dr. Chase in May 2008, Thompson reported that her disability benefits had been restored by State Farm, and Dr. Chase reported seeing no sign of cognitive decline, which is \u201cinconsistent with Pick\u2019s disease.\u201d <em>See Pick disease, </em>Medline Plus, http://www.nlm.nih.gov/ medlineplus/ency/article/000744.htm (last updated July 9, 2014). Dr. Hilger reevaluated Thompson in March 2009 and agreed that she showed no signs of Pick\u2019s disease, but he did agree with Dr. Kurth that she showed signs of a somatoform disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Although Dr. Rink had first raised the possibility of fibromyalgia in November 2004, Thompson was not diagnosed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>that condition until September 2008 after an exam by a physician specializing in pain management. A rheumatologist agreed with that diagnosis after evaluating Thompson in November 2009, and the next month, Dr. Belgrave referred Thompson to Dr. Ellen King, an anesthesiologist, for \u201ca second opinion for her diagnosis of Fibro-myalgia for insurance purposes.\u201d According to Dr. King, Thompson told her that the purpose of her visit was \u201cto find a physician who will either agree with the diagnosis of Pick\u2019s disease so that she may obtain social security disability or confirm that she will be disabled due to her diagnosis of fibromyalgia.\u201d Dr. King found no neurological distress and advised Thompson that fibromyalgia \u201cis not necessarily a debilitating disease if the recommended therapy is adhered to.\u201d But in February 2010, in support of her second application for disability benefits, Dr. Belgrave reported that Thompson\u2019s fibromyalgia \u201ccontributes wiyh [sic] physical limitations to her return to work,\u201d though he acknowledged that the diagnosis of Pick\u2019s disease \u201cis now questioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Yet another physician, family specialist Dr. James D. Ausfahl, concluded in April 2010 that Thompson had no functional capacity limitations despite her history of fibromyalgia, though he did note that her visual acuity was somewhat limited. And in May 2010, a state-agency reviewing physician and general practitioner, Dr. Sandra Bilinsky, assessed Thompson\u2019s functional limitations, concluding that in an 8-hour workday, Thompson could lift, carry, push, or pull up to 20 pounds, stand or walk for 6 hours, and sit for 6 hours. She found no postural, manipulative, or environmental limitations, and concluded that Thompson\u2019s description of her limitations was not supported by the medical evidence. Dr. Bilinsky also concluded that Thompson\u2019s far visual acuity was limited. A state-agency psychologist, Dr. Phyllis Brister, concluded also in May 2010 that Thompson\u2019s \u201cSomatoform Disorder and Alcohol Dependence in reported remission\u201d did not satisfy any disability under the Listing of Impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">By August 2010, Dr. Belgrave had expressed concern that Thompson was not properly addressing her fibromyalgia. He told her to \u201cbecome more aggressive\u201d in managing her condition, including with aqua therapy and Tai Chi or another stretching regimen. Thompson followed up with Dr. Rink, who noted that Thompson had not yet started her therapy as of January 2011 because \u201cshe is just too tired to get out for therapy.\u201d In March 2011, Dr. Rink again saw Thompson, who was concerned about her pending claim for DIB and whether the diagnosis of fibro-myalgia would entitle her to benefits. In May 2011, Dr. Belgrave wrote in another letter addressed \u201cTo Whom It May Concern,\u201d that Thompson was \u201cunable to perform any work related activities\u201d and \u201cminimally functional\u201d at daily activities. He again acknowledged that the diagnosis of Pick\u2019s disease may not have been accurate and described her fibromyalgia as \u201cvariable in a waxing and waning fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">2) Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">Thompson\u2019s first application for disability benefits, based on Pick\u2019s disease and restless leg syndrome, was denied on September 16, 2009 after a hearing, and she sought review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. In January 2010, while her appeal was pending before the Appeals Council, Thompson filed a second application for DIB, this time identifying \u201cchronic fibromyal-gia/small strokes/unable to focus\u201d as the cause of her disability. In May 2010, on the basis of the second application, the state agency found Thompson disabled as of August 2007. The Social Security Administration challenged that determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>before the Appeals Council, and the Appeals Council consolidated the agency\u2019s appeal with Thompson\u2019s appeal, which still was pending. Almost one year later, in March 2011, the Appeals Council reviewed the ALJ\u2019s denial of Thompson\u2019s first application, reopened the second application, and remanded Thompson\u2019s now consolidated applications for reevaluation as of August 2007 (a date Thompson does not challenge) of her alleged impairments: restless leg syndrome, fibromyalgia, degenerative disc disease (from which apparently Thompson had alleged at her first hearing that she also suffered), and chronic fatigue syndrome and somatoform disorder (from which the state agency had determined Thompson suffered, even though she had not included either in her application).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">On remand, the ALJ conducted a second hearing in September 2011. Dr. Richard Gross, a neuropsychologist who also has a Ph.D. in clinical psychology and who had not met with or examined Thompson, opined that her medical records suggest that she suffered only from a somatoform disorder, a \u201csituational occurrence\u201d that did not significantly affect her functional capacity. Thompson\u2019s daughter testified that she would run errands for her mother, who told her that \u201cshe was in a lot of pain.\u201d Thompson also testified and explained that State Farm had asked her to go on disability in 2005, but the payments had run out on August 1, 2007. She testified that getting dressed had become too painful and that she had hired out her household chores \u2014 grocery shopping, household cleaning, and dog care \u2014 because she lacked the energy to do them herself. She also said that in November 2010 she had graduated from a year-long interior-decorating class and now was a certified interior decorator, though she said she had taken the class \u201cfor fun\u201d and \u201cmainly because to occupy time.\u201d She also testified that as of January 2009 she had been helping a friend manage the books of his landscaping business by making phone calls and sending invoices.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">A vocational expert also testified. According to the VE, Thompson\u2019s previous work with State Farm was project-oriented and flexible, allowing the employee to rest as needed so long as the project was completed by day\u2019s end. He added that limitations on climbing ladders or ropes, bending, stooping, reaching, and exposure to humidity and environmental hazards would not affect a person\u2019s ability to do light work in this field.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">The ALJ, in a 51-page opinion, concluded that Thompson was not disabled between August 2007 and her last date insured, December 31, 2010. The ALJ reviewed Thompson\u2019s claims under the five steps in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a), first finding that during the relevant time period she had not engaged in substantial gainful employment and was suffering from severe impairments: restless leg syndrome, fibromyalgia, degenerative disc disease, and limited visual acuity. The ALJ concluded, however, that the evidence did not support Thompson\u2019s assertions that she also suffered from Pick\u2019s disease or a somatoform disorder. The ALJ noted that Thompson appeared to be a manipulative, demanding patient aimed only at obtaining a diagnosis that would win her disability payments. Regarding her physical limitations, the ALJ accepted the diagnosis of fibromyalgia but rejected the testimony of Thompson and her daughter, which contradicted forms that Thompson and her daughter had submitted in April 2010 stating that the daughter did not assist in a significant or regular manner. The ALJ determined that, at most, Thompson had a \u201cmild\u201d mental impairment. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520a(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>The ALJ found that Thompson\u2019s impairments did not meet or equal those listed in Appendix 1 to 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, and that she had the residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(a). The ALJ noted that Thompson described her ability to pull, bend, stoop, and perform various household activities throughout the day. That did not mean, the ALJ explained, that she could perform the same types of activities during a workday, but her testimony contradicts documents that Thompson had submitted (and her testimony) asserting that she had to hire out all of her household activities. Moreover, the ALJ noted, Dr. Belgrave had opined that Thompson needed to follow her prescribed rehabilitation routine and stay active. As the ALJ summed up, \u201c[n]ot being motivated to work is not equivalent to not being able to work.\u201d Were she motivated, the ALJ concluded, Thompson could perform a limited range of sedentary work, including her past work as a business analyst.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Thompson sought review in the district court, arguing that the ALJ improperly had discounted her diagnoses of Pick\u2019s disease and a somatoform disorder as insignificant, failed to consider her fibromyalgia in connection with her other physical impairments in determining if she met a Listing in section 404 or if she could perform past work, and gave insufficient weight to Dr. Belgrave, who was her primary-care physician. The court determined that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Because the Appeals Council denied review, we evaluate the ALJ\u2019s decision as the final word of the Commissioner. <em>See Schomas v. Colvin, </em>732 F.3d 702, 707 (7th Cir.2013); <em>Roddy v. Astrue, </em>705 F.3d 631, 636 (7th Cir.2013). We will uphold an ALJ\u2019s decision so long as it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Pepper v. Colvin, </em>712 F.3d 351, 361-62 (7th Cir.2013); <em>Shideler v. Astrue, </em>688 F.3d 306, 310 (7th Cir.2012). On appeal Thompson does not challenge the ALJ\u2019s findings regarding her diagnosis of Pick\u2019s disease, so we will not further discuss that issue. Additionally, as the Commissioner argues, Thompson did not raise three of her six appellate challenges in the district court, namely that the ALJ: (1) did not credit Dr. Hilger\u2019s conclusions that she may have a somatoform disorder and difficulty working full time; (2) failed to evaluate her chronic fatigue syndrome; and (3) found her not credible regarding her physical limitations in colder weather. Thompson is silent about waiver in her reply brief. We agree with the Commissioner that these issues were waived and address only those issues properly before this court. <em>See Schomas, </em>732 F.3d at 707; <em>Skarbek v. Barnhart, </em>390 F.3d 500, 505 (7th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">1) Dr. Belgrave</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">Thompson first argues that the ALJ failed to give \u201ccontrolling weight\u201d to letters written by Dr. Belgrave in August 2006, May 2007, January 2009, and May 2011. Dr. Belgrave was Thompson\u2019s primary care physician since 1983, and between February 2003 and May 2011, he examined her at least 34 times and granted and reviewed referrals, Thompson explains, so his opinion deserves controlling weight in the ALJ\u2019s analysis. Thompson says the ALJ did not give any reason for rejecting Dr. Belgrave\u2019s opinion. However, the ALJ properly recognized the August 2006 letter was written before the amended onset date of August 2007, and because the May 2011 letter was written five months after her last date insured, the ALJ gave this final letter \u201cessentially no value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>An ALJ must accord controlling weight to a treating source\u2019s opinion if it is supported by \u201cmedically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques\u201d and is consistent with other substantial evidence in the record. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(2); <em>see Schaaf v. Astrue, </em>602 F.3d 869, 875 (7th Cir.2010). But a medical expert\u2019s report that is based solely on a complainant\u2019s subjective accounts of pain is not given controlling weight. <em>Filus v. Astrue, </em>694 F.3d 863, 868 (7th Cir.2012). As the ALJ noted, Dr. Belgrave never diagnosed Thompson as having fibromyalgia; rather, he simply repeated the diagnosis given by other doctors. And although Dr. Belgrave opined that Thompson would have difficulty performing various physical activities based on common fibromyalgia symptoms and that her condition \u201ccontributes\u201d to her physical limitations, he did not describe the level or severity of Thompson\u2019s symptoms. The ALJ described Dr. Belgrave as having \u201cno reliable objective evidence\u201d regarding Thompson\u2019s condition and relying largely on Thompson\u2019s self-reports, which are prone to bias. <em>See Johnson v. Barnhart, </em>449 F.3d 804, 806 (7th Cir.2006). The ALJ recounted Thompson\u2019s testimony that she could pull, bend, and stoop during household activities, which the ALJ carefully distinguished from workplace duties, and an RFC assessment from 2010 that concluded Thompson could perform light work. From this evidence the ALJ concluded that Thompson could perform at least sedentary work, consistent with Dr. Belgrave\u2019s opinion from 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Dr. Belgrave\u2019s conclusion in May 2011 that Thompson could not work also is inconsistent with other reports. Thompson told Dr. King that her goal of the evaluation was to receive a diagnosis of fibromyalgia and obtain disability benefits. Dr. King told Thompson that therapy could alleviate her symptoms and that her condition need not be debilitating. Dr. Rink referred Thompson to a physical therapist, and Dr. Belgrave in August 2010 agreed that therapy was appropriate, but opined that Thompson needed to be \u201caggressive\u201d about treatment. Yet Dr. Bel-grave does not mention this poor compliance in his May 2011 letter in which he says Thompson is unable to work. As the ALJ said, the evidence suggests not that Thompson could not improve her pain but rather than she lacked the motivation to work towards resolving it. Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Dr. Belgrave\u2019s opinion was of limited value.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">2) RFC Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Thompson next argues that the ALJ gave \u201can inadequate RFC\u201d to the VE that omits several details of her condition, and thus the VE\u2019s conclusion that she could perform her past work is unreliable. She says that the VE\u2019s assessment is based only on her best days, but her fibromyalgia intermittently gets worse, so she does not know how she will feel on a given day. Thompson also says the ALJ did not include in his hypothetical questions to the VE whether she would be able to sit and stand to accommodate her pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">We see no issue with the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical questions. The ALJ proposed to the VE a hypothetical worker limited to light work, with only occasional overhead reaching and manipulative functions. The VE testified that such a claimant would be able to perform the work of a business analyst. As the VE explained, this job allows for breaks as needed, as long as the employee completes her designated projects in a timely manner. So, although Thompson is correct that the ALJ did not specifically reference the need for a sit/ stand option, the VE included in his as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>sessment the need for flexibility with breaks. Based on that assessment, the ALJ concluded that Thompson could perform her past work as a business analyst, which, as sedentary work, is considered less demanding than light work. SSR 83-10, 1983 WL 31251, at *5-6. Moreover, the hypothetical questions that the ALJ posed appropriately were based on the limitations that he accepted as credible. <em>See Simila v. Astrue, </em>573 F.3d 503, 521 (7th Cir.2009); <em>Schmidt v. Astrue, </em>496 F.3d 833, 846 (7th Cir.2007). Those limitations did not include Dr. Belgrave\u2019s recommendation for a sit/stand option because the ALJ concluded that this purported limitation was based entirely on Thompson\u2019s subjective statements, rather than medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">3) Misconstruing Fibromyalgia Diagnosis</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Last, Thompson argues that the ALJ misunderstood fibromyalgia and improperly discredited the medical evidence she presented regarding her diagnosis. She points to SSR 12-2p, which was issued after the ALJ\u2019s decision in this case and provides guidance for determining if a claimant\u2019s fibromyalgia is \u201cmedically determinable.\u201d Thompson encourages us to remand the case so that her claim can be considered further with the aid of SSR 12-2p. But a remand is unnecessary because the ALJ accepted Thompson\u2019s diagnosis of fibromyalgia as a severe physical impairment that limits her functional capacity. That diagnosis, however, does not entitle Thompson to benefits. <em>Denton v. Astrue, </em>596 F.3d 419, 426 (7th Cir.2010); <em>Skinner v. Astrue, </em>478 F.3d 836, 845 (7th Cir.2007). The ALJ instead concluded that Thompson\u2019s condition was not debilitating and would not preclude her from performing her past sedentary work. The ALJ reviewed her test revealing 17 positive tender points but no other issues of pain and assessed her functional capacity based on her limited physical capabilities; yet the ALJ concluded that her fibromyalgia was not incapacitating.

CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">The judgment of the district court and the ALJ\u2019s denial of benefits are Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
