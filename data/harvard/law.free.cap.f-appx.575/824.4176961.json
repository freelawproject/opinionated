The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b853-6\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"AnH\">BOBBY R. BALDOCK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Defendant Christopher Sanchez entered a blind plea to one count of possessing methamphetamine with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(c). The district court sentenced him to 151 months in prison consistent with the low end of the applicable guideline range for career offenders. Defendant timely appealed his sentence. Our jurisdiction arises under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). Now before the Court is defense counsel\u2019s <em>An-ders </em>brief as well as counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Defendant has been notified and told that he could timely file a pro se brief. He has not done so. After plenary review, defense counsel\u2019s brief and motion are well taken. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">In <em>Anders, </em>the Supreme Court held that if appointed counsel \u201cfinds his [client\u2019s] case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Counsel must submit to the court a brief \u201creferring to anything in the record that might arguably support an appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When counsel submits an <em>Anders </em>brief accompanied by a motion to withdraw, we \u201cconduct a full examination of the record to determine whether defendant\u2019s claims are wholly frivolous.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>428 F.3d 928, 930 (10th Cir.2005). If we agree with counsel\u2019s evaluation of the case, we grant the request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal. <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">The docket sheet reflects per return receipt that the clerk of court notified Defendant of the <em>Anders </em>brief and the motion to withdraw. In accordance with 10th Cir. R. 46.4(B)(2), the clerk also notified Defendant of his opportunity to file a response thereto. As stated, Defendant has not responded and the time for doing so has now passed. In his <em>Anders </em>brief, Defendant\u2019s counsel, an Assistant Federal Public Defender, identifies three possible challenges to Defendant\u2019s sentence: (1) the pre-sen-tence report improperly classified Defendant as a career offender; (2) the district court did not adequately explain the sentence imposed; and (3) the sentence imposed is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">Our careful review of the record reveals counsel properly evaluated this case. We agree with counsel\u2019s assessment: \u201cNone of these issues even arguably have merit, and are therefore wholly frivolous.\u201d <em>Anders </em>Brief at 4. Given Defendant\u2019s failure to respond, we need not opine further. We commend defense counsel for his forthrightness. Accordingly, defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and Defendant\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b853-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
