City of Hous., </em>686 F.3d 183, 187 (5th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is appropriate if the record discloses \u201cno genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law\u201d. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cWe may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any basis supported by the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>408 F.3d 214, 218 n. 7 (5th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Before filing a \u00a7 1983 action against prison officials, a prisoner must exhaust his administrative remedies. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). For that purpose, a Louisiana inmate must use the two-step, administrative-remedy procedure (ARP) to file a formal grievance. La. Admin. Code tit. 22, \u00a7 325(D)(1); <em>see Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 265-66 (5th Cir.2010). Exhaustion being mandatory, unexhausted claims may not be considered and \u201ccannot be brought in court\u201d. <em>Gonzalez v. Seal, </em>702 F.3d 785, 788 (5th Cir.2012) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Green\u2019s first step of the ARP was stamped as received on 8 December 2011, the same day this \u00a7 1983 action was filed. Because Green filed this action before completing both steps of the ARP, he did not exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
