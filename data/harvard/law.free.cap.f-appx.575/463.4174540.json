She raises the following claims relating to her sentence and her guidelines sentence range: (1) the upward variance applied by the district court was unconstitutional under <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013); (2) the enhancement for her being an organizer, leader, supervisor, or manager of the criminal activity was inappropriate; and (3) the inclusion of relevant conduct in the loss amount calculation was improper. She asserts that her indictment and conviction were illegal because she was charged with aiding and abetting and the law requires that the taxpayer be charged along with the tax preparer in such cases. She maintains that her trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with the guilty plea and because trial counsel was disciplined by this court. Suarez contends the AUSA prosecuting her case committed prosecutorial misconduct by conferring with trial counsel to obtain a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-25\">Suarez did not raise her claims that her indictment and conviction were illegal be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>cause the indictment charged aiding and abetting and the taxpayers were not charged, that her trial counsel provided ineffective assistance because she was disciplined by this court, and that the AUSA committed prosecutorial misconduct in the district court. Accordingly, we do not consider these claims. <em>See Henderson v. Cockrell, </em>333 F.3d 592, 605 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The district court rejected Suarez\u2019s claims concerning the calculation of her guidelines sentence range on the ground that such claims are not cognizable in \u00a7 2255 motions. Suarez does not address this issue; instead she argues the merits of her challenges to the role enhancement and the use of relevant conduct to increase her guidelines sentence range. As Suarez has not addressed the reasoning supporting the district court\u2019s denial of these claims, she has waived any challenge she could have brought to the denial of these claims. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Suarez\u2019s <em>Alleyne </em>claim is without merit. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that <em>Alleyne </em>is retroactively applicable, the record shows that there was not an <em>Alleyne </em>violation in this case. In <em>Alleyne, </em>the Supreme Court held that any fact that increases a defendant\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence must be submitted to a jury to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2163. If a defendant is not exposed to a statutory minimum sentence, <em>Alleyne </em>is inapplicable. <em>United States v. Tuma, </em>738 F.3d 681, 693 (5th Cir.2013). In the present ease, the sentencing court did not apply a statutory minimum sentence. Accordingly, <em>Alleyne </em>is inapplicable, and Suarez\u2019s claim is without merit. <em>See Tuma, </em>738 F.3d at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">With regard to Suarez\u2019s various claims that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel, the district court denied each claim as either conclusory, unsupported by the record, or inadequate to establish she was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s alleged deficiencies under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To obtain a COA on these claims, Suarez must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). For COA purposes, \u201c[t]he question is the de-batability of the underlying constitutional claim, not the resolution of that debate.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 342, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). \u201c[A] claim can be debatable even though every jurist of reason might agree, after the COA has been granted and the case has received full consideration, that petitioner will riot prevail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029. However, for the reasons that follow, we conclude that Suarez has not shown that reasonable jurists would find it debatable whether she has established a cognizable ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">First, the district court found that Suarez\u2019s claims against trial counsel for allegedly poor preparation were conclusory and without any evidentiary support. In light of trial counsel\u2019s affidavit detailing her preparation and investigatory efforts throughout the pre-plea proceedings, and the absence of any evidence supporting Suarez\u2019s claims, we conclude that jurists of reason would not debate that the district court properly denied this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">With regard to Suarez\u2019s ineffective-as-sistanee-of-counsel claim that trial counsel misinformed her regarding the likely sentencing range that would result from her plea, Suarez does not contend that if she had accurate information from counsel regarding her potential sentence, she would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>not have pled guilty or would have insisted on going to trial. Accordingly, the district court properly concluded that she failed to plead or establish any facts to demonstrate that she was prejudiced by her trial counsel\u2019s alleged deficiency. Lastly, the district court rejected Suarez\u2019s claim that trial counsel ineffectively negotiated a plea bargain because the record establishes that counsel negotiated with the government attorney and arranged for a plea agreement in which eight of the nine charges against Suarez were dismissed in exchange for her guilty plea. Suarez has not shown \u201cthat jurists of reason could disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of her constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that Suarez\u2019s request for a COA is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In addition to seeking a COA, Suarez moves for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. She asserts that she seeks to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion based upon newly discovered evidence consisting of an April 1, 2011, email from trial counsel to the prosecuting AUSA. She maintains that counsel did not inform her of this correspondence and that she discovered it sometime in 2013 after she filed a bar grievance against trial counsel. Suarez also appears to assert that this court\u2019s order removing her trial counsel as her appointed counsel during her direct appeal constitutes newly discovered evidence sufficient to warrant a successive \u00a7 2255 petitioner. Neither the email correspondence, revealing the professional communication between trial counsel and the government attorney, nor the court order disciplining trial counsel for her performance on unrelated appeals establishes any deficiency in trial counsel\u2019s representation of Suarez, nor bear upon Suarez\u2019s offense of conviction and thus do not constitute \u201cnewly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255(h). Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that Suarez\u2019s motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b491-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
