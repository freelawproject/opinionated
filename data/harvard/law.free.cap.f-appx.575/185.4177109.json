Because Traore fails to raise any arguments that meaningfully challenge the propriety of the Board\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider in the argument section of his brief, we find that he has failed to preserve any issues for review. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A) (\u201c[T]he argument ... must contain ... appellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d); <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999) (\u201cFailure to comply with the specific dictates of [Rule 28] with respect to a particular claim triggers abandonment of that claim on appeal.\u201d). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Traore </em>(B.I.A. Nov.25, 2013). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-19\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
