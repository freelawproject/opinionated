On appeal, Hubbard provides only conclusory assertions that the district court erred and that he demonstrated deliberate indifference to his medical needs. Hubbard provides no citations to the record or reference to relevant legal authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-18\">Hubbard has effectively abandoned all arguments on appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Because Hubbard\u2019s appeal fails to set forth any issue of arguable legal merit, it is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-19\">Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. Hubbard is WARNED that future repetitious or frivolous filings may result in the imposition of sanctions including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b526-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
