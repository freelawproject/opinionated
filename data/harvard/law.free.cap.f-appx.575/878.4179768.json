Deem appeals from a final order of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) denying her petition for review of the Board\u2019s January 7, 2013 initial decision dismissing her involuntary resignation claim for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Deem v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>No. SF0752120777-I-1, 120 M.S.P.R. 75 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>(M.S.P.B. Sept. 26, 2013) <em>(\u201cFinal Order\u201d). </em>For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Ms. Deem was previously employed as a Program Services Assistant in the Mission Support Division in the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (\u201cFEMA\u201d) Region IX office. While employed in the Mission Support Division, Ms. Deem\u2019s supervisor was Debbie Lewis. Resp\u2019t App. 10. Ms. Deem claims that she was harassed, humiliated, and demeaned for over twelve years by Ms. Lewis. Resp\u2019t App. 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">From January 11 to 15, 2010, Ms. Deem was placed in absence without leave status (\u201cAWOL\u201d) for failure to submit medical documents to support her absence. Ms. Deem had called Ms. Lewis on the first day of her absence and submitted a doctor\u2019s note on the second day. Eventually, the status was converted to paid leave after a discussion with Ms. Deem\u2019s doctor. On February 10, 2010, Ms. Deem filed a formal complaint with the agency\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity (\u201cEEO\u201d) Counselor, alleging a hostile work environment and discrimination based on age, mental disability, and prior EEO activity based on having been placed on AWOL status. In her complaint she stated that \u201cbecause of my illnesses and the way others react around me, I feel that it is almost impossible for me to continue working in the Region. I feel I\u2019m being forced into retirement.\u201d Resp\u2019t App. 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">That same month, after filing her EEO complaint, Ms. Deem agreed to transfer to a different division, the Grants Division of Region IX, where Ms. Lewis would no longer be her supervisor. Resp\u2019t App. 11. Ten months later, on December 31, 2010, Ms. Deem retired. On August 16, 2012, the agency issued a final decision on her EEO complaint, concluding that she had not established the claimed discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">On September 10, 2012, Ms. Deem filed an appeal with the Board alleging that her retirement was involuntary. The administrative judge issued an order informing Ms. Deem that the Board might not have jurisdiction over her appeal because her retirement was presumed voluntary and that she bore the burden of proof to show otherwise. In response to this order, Ms. Deem submitted a statement from a former coworker that included allegations and examples of Ms. Lewis\u2019s disparate treatment of Ms. Deem.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">On January 7, 2013, the administrative judge concluded that Ms. Deem had failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation in support of the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Deem v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>No. SF0752120777-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Jan. 7, 2013) <em>(\u201cInitial Decision\u201d). </em>The administrative judge found that a reasonable person in her position would not have felt compelled to resign based on her work conditions. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6. She also found that Ms. Deem initiated her retirement ten months after she transferred to a different division and was no longer supervised by Ms. Lewis, which indicated the retirement was not due to Ms. Lewis\u2019s behavior during the time she was Ms. Deem\u2019s supervisor. <em>Id. </em>at 6. Ultimately, the administrative judge concluded that the Board lacked jurisdiction over Ms. Deem\u2019s appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">Ms. Deem filed a petition for review of that decision with the Board and claimed that she had to retire because Ms. Lewis was determined to either make her \u201cso sick [she] would die or force [her] into retirement.\u201d Resp\u2019t App. 31. On September 26, 2013, the Board affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s decision and denied the petition for review. <em>Final Order </em>at 2. The Board also concluded that Ms. Deem did not prove that her working conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>during the ten months were so intolerable that a reasonable person in her position would have felt compelled to retire. <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Ms. Deem timely appealed the Board\u2019s final order. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Our review of Board decisions is limited by statute. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c), we may only reverse a Board decision if we find the decision to be: (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>Ward v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>634 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed.Cir.2011). \u201cThe [Board\u2019s] determination that it lacked jurisdiction is a question of law that the court reviews de novo.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>635 F.3d 1215, 1218 (Fed.Cir.2011) (citing <em>Forest v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>47 F.3d 409, 410 (Fed.Cir.1995)). \u201cBefore the Board, an appellant bears the burden of establishing board jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Fields v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>452 F.3d 1297, 1302 (Fed.Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">An employee-initiated resignation or retirement is presumed to be voluntary and therefore outside of the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Garcia v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>437 F.3d 1322, 1329 (Fed.Cir.2006) (en banc); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 752.401(b)(9). The burden is on the appellant to present sufficient evidence to overcome this presumption. <em>Garcia, </em>437 F.3d at 1329. To establish involuntariness by coercion an employee must show: \u201c(1) the agency effectively imposed the terms of the employee\u2019s resignation or retirement; (2) the employee had no realistic alternative but to resign or retire; and (3) the employee\u2019s resignation or retirement was the result of improper acts by the agency.\u201d <em>Shoaf v. Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>260 F.3d 1336, 1341 (Fed.Cir.2001). The test is objective rather than subjective. Id. at 1342. The employee must establish that a reasonable person confronted with the same circumstances would have felt forced to retire. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">Ms. Deem first argues that the Board erred by failing to take into account that she suffers from severe depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and the impact of the alleged hostile workplace on these already present medical conditions. We disagree. The Board first noted that the agency transferred Ms. Deem out of Ms. Lewis\u2019s supervision in February 2010 to address precisely those complaints. <em>Final Order </em>at 4. Moreover, the Board then considered Ms. Deem\u2019s working conditions after the transfer and \u2014 based on the record as a whole \u2014 concluded that she simply had not alleged \u201cany facts to show that her working conditions between February and December 2010 were so intolerable such that a reasonable person in her position would have felt compelled to retire.\u201d <em>Final Order </em>at 5. For example, before the Board, Ms. Deem argued that she had difficulty learning the duties of her new position because of her stress. Resp\u2019t App. 30. However, as the Board noted, dissatisfaction with work assignments and difficult working conditions do not generally give rise to a claim of involuntary resignation. <em>See Final Order </em>at 5 (citing <em>Miller v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>85 M.S.P.R. 310 \u00b6 32 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">Moreover, in reaching its determination, the Board gave particular weight to the fact that Ms. Deem had stayed in the new position for a full ten months after her transfer. <em>Id. </em>Indeed, we have previously noted that the amount of time between the employer\u2019s alleged behavior and the employee\u2019s retirement is highly probative as to whether an employee\u2019s retirement is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>involuntary. <em>Terban v. Dep\u2019t of Energy, </em>216 F.3d 1021, 1024 (Fed.Cir.2000). In one case, the time period between the final incident and the appellant\u2019s retirement was three weeks and the court found this time period short enough to indicate involuntariness. <em>Bates v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>70 M.S.P.R. 659, 668 (1996). In contrast, a long period of time between the actions and the employee\u2019s retirement diminishes the causal link between the two events. <em>Terban, </em>216 F.3d at 1024. The Board was therefore correct to note that the ten month time period in Ms. Deem\u2019s case diminishes the idea that her retirement was due to Ms. Lewis\u2019s behavior prior to the February 2010 transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Ms. Deem\u2019s second argument is that the Board did not consider the indirect contact she had with Ms. Lewis in her new position during the ten months and therefore that the transfer did not improve her work conditions. Specifically, Ms. Deem states that after her transfer she was: (1) frequently called by Ms. Lewis\u2019s subordinates, (2) subjected to Ms. Lewis trying to create problems with her new supervisor, and (3) constantly sent to HR, where Ms. Lewis worked. <em>See </em>Pet\u2019r Informal Br., question 4. Ms. Deem also submitted a letter from her doctor, Dr. Hasser, stating that Ms. Deem continued to have significant impairment in mental health symptoms after her transfer. <em>See id., </em>attachments.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">As an initial matter, Ms. Deem did not raise this argument before the Board and so it is waived. <em>Henry v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>902 F.2d 949, 953 (Fed.Cir.1990). But regardless, these allegations are insufficient to establish the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. The Board found that the agency initiated and Ms. Deem accepted a transfer to a position that no longer required her to work under Ms. Lewis\u2019s supervision a full ten months prior to her retirement. <em>Final Order </em>at 5. We conclude that in light of the fact that the agency successfully transferred Ms. Deem to a new situation where she had little, if any, contact with Ms. Lewis, the Board did not err in finding that the Government had provided an adequate solution to Ms. Lewis\u2019s disparate treatment of Ms. Deem.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">We find no reason to conclude that the Board\u2019s findings were unsupported by substantial evidence or were not in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Board correctly denied Ms. Deem\u2019s petition for review and affirmed the dismissal of her appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
