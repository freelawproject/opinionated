Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Avagyan v. Holder, </em>646 F.3d 672, 674 (9th Cir.2011). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-20\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying as untimely Lakha\u2019s motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel by his first former attorney because he filed the motion nearly three years after issuance of his final order of removal, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and failed to demonstrate the due diligence necessary to warrant equitable tolling of the filing deadline, <em>see Avagyan, </em>646 F.3d at 680 (holding that the tolling period ends \u201cwhen the alien obtains a complete record of his immigration proceedings and is able to review that information with competent counsel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-21\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Lakha\u2019s unexhausted claims of ineffective assistance of counsel by his second and third former attorneys and contentions regarding his lack of motive to delay filing his motion to reopen at an earlier time. <em>See Tijani v. Holder, </em>628 F.3d 1071, 1080 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-22\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b845-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
