O\u2019Neal\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>An-ders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), concluding there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning \u201cwhether the ownership of the firearms found in Mr. O\u2019Neal\u2019s garage would have made any difference in his sentence.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. At 10). Specifically, O\u2019Neal argues that he should not have been convicted of being a felon in possession because the weapons did not belong to him and, therefore, he did not possess them. In the alternative, he contends that his sentence should have been lower because he did not own the firearms. O\u2019Neal was notified of his right to file a supplemental pro se brief but has not done so. Following careful review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-22\">O\u2019Neal argues that he should not have been convicted of being a felon in possession of firearms because the firearms did not belong to him and they were outside of his house, thus preventing his access to them. Under \u00a7 922(g)(1), it is unlawful for any person convicted of a crime punishable by a term exceeding one year to possess a firearm. \u201c[P]roof of actual or exclusive possession [is not necessary]; constructive or joint possession is sufficient.\u201d <em>United States v. Lawing, </em>703 F.3d 229, 240 (4th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1851, 185 L.Ed.2d 854 (2013). \u201cConstructive possession is established when the government produces evidence that shows ownership, dominion, or control over the contraband itself or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>premises ... in which the contraband is concealed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Because the weapons were found in or near a garage on O\u2019Neal\u2019s property, we reject O\u2019Neal\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">O\u2019Neal also asserts that his sentence is unreasonable because the firearms that were found on his property actually belonged to his cousin, and therefore his sentence should have been lower. This argument is meritless. In sentencing O\u2019Neal, the district court followed all necessary procedural steps, properly calculating the Guidelines range, considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) (2012) factors and the parties\u2019 arguments, and providing an individualized assessment based on the facts presented. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). O\u2019Neal\u2019s below-Guidelines sentence is presumed substantively reasonable on appeal, and he has not met his burden to rebut this presumption. <em>United States v. Susi, </em>674 F.3d 278, 289 (4th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006). Thus, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing O\u2019Neal. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and have found no meritorious grounds for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform O\u2019Neal, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If O\u2019Neal requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on O\u2019Neal.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
