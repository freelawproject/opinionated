Tigar, District Judge for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b828-16\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-17\">Jesus Medina-Castro appeals the sentence imposed following his guilty plea to bulk cash smuggling, in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5332(a). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We vacate Medina-Castro\u2019s sentence and remand for resentenc-ing.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-20\">The district court\u2019s finding during sentencing that Medina-Castro knowingly smuggled 17.88 kilograms of methamphetamine was not \u201csupported by a preponderance of the evidence \u2014 \u2018a showing that the relevant fact is more likely true than not.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Highsmith, </em>268 F.3d 1141, 1142 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>United States v. Collins, </em>109 F.3d 1413, 1420 (9th Cir.1997)). Thus, Medina-Castro\u2019s \u201csentence must be vacated [because] the district court demonstrably relie[d] upon false [and] unreliable information.\u201d <em>United States v. Safirstein, </em>827 F.2d 1380, 1387 (9th Cir.1987). Specifically, the district court relied on \u201c[u]nreasonable inferences and material assumptions\u201d to enhance Medina-Castro\u2019s penalty. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-21\">The district court\u2019s assumption that Medina-Castro knew about the drugs, and did not mind transporting drugs, is unsupported by the record. First, the emails between Medina-Castro and Ricardo Man-riquez indicate that Medina-Castro was only aware of the- potential violation of currency reporting requirements at the border. Medina-Castro was also explicitly assured that no narcotics were involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-22\">Second, there is no indication that Medina-Castro\u2019s \u201cbad feeling about the situation\u201d sprung from his knowledge that he was transporting narcotics \u2014 rather, that \u201cbad feeling\u201d could have just as easily pertained to his reluctance to violate currency reporting .requirements. Medina-Castro neither had any prior interaction with the criminal justice system, nor had he ever transported contraband. Although Medina-Castro possessed a valid border-crossing visa, evidence before the district court established that he had not entered the United States for approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>mately a year prior to his arrest. Thus, the district court\u2019s inference of knowledge from Medina-Castro\u2019s \u201cbad feeling\u201d was thus unreasonable because the statement \u201ccould support inferences of other activities, legal or illegal, as readily as they support an inference of trafficking in narcotics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1386.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Third, in light of the unique facts presented in this case, the district court abused its discretion and committed procedural error in presuming awareness of the narcotics on the part of Medina-Castro based on mere possession. In sum, then, because the \u201ctrial court inferred that [Medina-Castro] was a participant in a crime with which he was not charged [and t]he inference directly resulted in the enhancement of [Medina-Castro\u2019s] penalty,\u201d the district court violated Medina-Castro\u2019s due process rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1385.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">We remand this case for resentencing. \u2018While we believe that on remand the district judge would be fair and impartial, this case presents an unusual circumstance wherein reassignment to a different judge is desirable\u201d and would serve \u201c[t]he appearance of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>313 F.3d 1152, 1160 (9th Cir.2002). Thus, upon remand, this case shall be reassigned by the Clerk of the Southern District of California to another district court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">VACATED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b828-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
