The case of a mortgagee forms an exception to the general rule, that a party shall not be allowed to sue at law, and here, at the same time, for the same debt. The one remedy is <em>in rem. </em>and the other in <em>personam ; </em>and the general rule to which this case is an exception, applies only to cases where the demand at law and in equity are equally personal, and not where the cumulative remedy is in <em>personam, </em>while the other remedy is upon the pledge. <em>(Booth </em>v. <em>Booth, 2 </em>Atk. 343. <em>Schoole </em>v. <em>Sall, </em>1 <em>Sch. &amp; Lef. </em>176 Lord <em>Kenyon, </em>in <em>Smart </em>v. <em>Wolf 3 Term Rep. </em>342. <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Heinzelman, </em>1 <em>Vesey &amp; Beam. </em>381. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>10 <em>Johns.
