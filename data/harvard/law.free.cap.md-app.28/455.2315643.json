After a four-day jury trial in the Criminal Court of Baltimore he was convicted of rape, and subsequently sentenced by Judge Meyer M. Cardin to 10 years imprisonment. On appeal, he assigns three alleged errors to the trial court: admission of testimony that a third party attempted to induce prosecution witnesses to alter their statements; admission of improper rebuttal testimony; and impeachment of appellant with his assertion of Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">In order to put the case in proper perspective, a brief recital of the pertinent facts is necessary. On Easter Sunday afternoon, April 14, 1974, Narvis Bruce, an eighteen year old girl, met appellant\u2019s cousin, Vincent Reynolds, and the cousin\u2019s girlfriend, Corinne Lemon, on Park Heights Avenue in Baltimore City. After visits to various places in the neighborhood, during some of which marijuana was smoked, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Reynolds, according to Lemon and Miss Bruce, introduced appellant to her. Late in the evening, the foursome eventually went to a party in a house on Reisterstown Road. After midnight, Reynolds and Lemon left the party. Shortly thereafter, Miss Bruce left. She testified that as she walked, looking for Lemon, a man grabbed her, pulled her into a park, tore her clothes, raped her and hit her in the eye and lip. She described her assailant as wearing a white wool knitted hat with a blue dungaree jacket, a flowered shirt, and dark pants. She did not identify the appellant as her assailant in her initial complaint to the police; however, she did identify him in court. Lemon testified that the following morning after spending the night at Reynolds\u2019 house, she awoke to find appellant there wearing the same flowered shirt as the night before. At his trial, Saunders\u2019 defense was twofold; 1) that he had an alibi and 2) that the rape may have been committed by his twin brother, Michael, who had died of a narcotic overdose two months prior to trial. He contended that he had never met Miss Bruce and was at home at the time of the crime. Six witnesses were produced in his behalf who corroborated his testimony in varying degrees that he was home the evening of April 14th and 15th. Jerome Shaw, a witness for the defense, testified that he saw appellant\u2019s twin brother, Michael, but not the appellant at the party preceding the alleged rape. Glena Coleman, Saunders\u2019 aunt, testified that a white knitted hat, dungaree jacket and dark pants had been purchased for appellant\u2019s twin brother and that the twin brother was wearing these clothes on April 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">In the State\u2019s case in chief, Ernest Womble, who attended the party on Reisterstown Road, testified over Saunders\u2019 objection that Reynolds endeavored to induce him to change his testimony to the effect that the party that evening was a \u201cplanned gathering\u201d as opposed to an \u201cunplanned gathering\u201d. Cross-examination by defense counsel elicited same from Womble. Next, the State called Corinne Lemon, who testified over objection that Reynolds talked to her about altering her testimony relating to the shirt Saunders was wearing the day of the rape. In the presentation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>defense, no testimony was either solicited or produced by\u2018the defendant or his witnesses &gt;on direct 'examination or cross-examination as to Reynolds\u2019 endeavors to have -the prosecution witnesses, Womble and Lemon, alter their testimony. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the State was allowed in \u201crebuttal\u201d to call Reynolds as a \u201chostile\u201d witness. Reynolds stated that the appellant was not present at the party prior to the rape and denied attempting to influence the testimony of any witness. The State was then allowed to call Detective Carl Reichelt, Baltimore City Police Department, to rebut the testimony of Reynolds to the extent that in a telephone conversation, Reynolds had indicated that the appellant was present at the party. Lemon was then recalled by the State in \u201crebuttal\u201d. She was shown a note she said had been given her by Reynolds\u2019 brother and she identified it as having been written by Reynolds. The note, introduced into evidence and exhibited to the jury without objection, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">\u201cHello baby \u2014 inside\u2014Corinne I will see you in court and please change your statement. I will talk to you in court. Love, Vincent, smile.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">On cross-examination, the following exchange took place between appellant\u2019s counsel and Lemon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">\u201cQ. Did you testify at your last appearance that Vincent had talked to you and all he asked you to do was to say there was no shirt that color? Did you use those wordk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">A. I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">Q. Now tell me what Vincent did ask you to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">A. He asked me to say it was Michael who was with us that night and not Mitchell, and he asked me to say that there was no shirt and that we didn\u2019t see Mitchell the next morning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">In closing argument the prosecutor argued to the jury the alleged attempts by Reynolds to get the State\u2019s witnesses to change their statements. Appellant challenges as error the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>admission of the remarks of Womble and Lemon that Reynolds sought to influence their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">While the precise question raised by the appellant is one of first impression in Maryland, the authorities and the jurisdictions which have Considered the point are in agreement with the general principle that an attempt by an accused to suborn a witness is relevant and may be introduced as an admission by conduct, tending to show his guilt. <em>State v. Graves, </em>301 So. 2d 864, 866 (La. 1974); <em>People v. Hooper, </em>50 Mich. App. 186, 212 N.W.2d 786 (1973); <em>People v. Perez, </em>169 Cal.App.2d 473, 337 P. 2d 539 (1959); <em>Staggs v. State, </em>51 Ala. App. 203, 283 So. 2d 652 (Ala. Cr. App. 1973); <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>204 Ky. 601, 265 S. W. 10 (1924); <em>State v. Reuschel, </em>312 A. 2d 739 (Vt. 1973); <em>People v. Moore, </em>70 Cal.App.2d 158, 160 P. 2d 857 (1945); C. Torcia, 1 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence, </em>462 (13th Ed. 1972), 29 Am.Jur.2d <em>Evidence, </em>Secs. 292 &amp; 293 (1967). Evidence of such attempts by another is not admissible, however, where there is no evidence to connect the accused therewith. In order to make admissible evidence of attempts by a third person to influence a witness not to testify or to testify falsely, it must be established that such attempts were done by the authorization of the accused. <em>State v. Graves, supra; People v. Terry, </em>21 Cal. Rptr. 185, 370 P. 2d 985 (1962); <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U. S. 960 (1963); <em>People v. Moore, supra; </em>29 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Evidence, </em>Sec. 293 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Neither the State nor the defendant challenges the validity of this principle. However, the State argues that \u201cthe closeness of the relationship between the appellant and Reynolds was sufficient to allow the prosecutor to make inquiry into the attempts by Reynolds to have Womble and Lemon change their testimony.\u201d In effect, the State contends that the close relationship between Saunders and his cousin under the facts of this case indicates that appellant authorized attempts to induce witnesses to testify falsely. We disagree. A thorough review of the record indicates that other than the fact that Reynolds was a cousin of the appellant, there is no evidence to link the appellant to the alleged abortive attempts of Reynolds.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Although the authorization by the 'accused may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence, <em>People v. Caruso, </em>174 Cal.App.2d 624, 345 P. 2d 282, 292 (1959) (cases cited therein), and an inference may be sufficient to connect the accused, <em>State v. Esposito, </em>73 R. I. 94, 54 A. 2d 1 (1947), the fact that the third party and the accused are related has not been held to be adequate proof, by itself, of the necessary authorization. <em>People v. Terry, supra. </em>In <em>Tyler v. State, </em>145 Tex. Cr. R. 315, 167 S.W.2d 755 (1942), the Court found that an accused is not bound by the efforts of relatives or friends to suppress evidence unless his connection with the third party is clearly shown. <em>People v. Perez, supra, </em>citing <em>People v. Moore, supra, </em>held that \u201c[i]n the instant case it is not denied that the person identified by complaining witness as the person making the offer was defendant\u2019s brother. But mere relationship, of itself, has never been held sufficient, respondent\u2019s contention to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In this regard, the State relies on <em>State v. Graves, supra, </em>which held that \u201c[t]he close relation demonstrated between this accused and his wife convinces us that though the evidence of her attempt to induce an alibi witness to lie is prejudicial, it is admissible as revealing consciousness of guilt on the part of the accused.\u201d In <em>Graves, </em>the Supreme Court of Louisiana, citing <em>People v. Terry, supra, </em>as authority, accepted the general principle that before such attempt (to induce a witness to testify falsely) is admissible, there must be some evidence to connect the accused therewith or show that the attempt by a third person was made with the authorization of the accused. The Court went on to hold that the prosecutor\u2019s erroneous argument to the jury that the defendant attempted to induce an alibi witness to lie when in fact, defendant\u2019s wife had allegedly made such attempt, was made harmless by trial court\u2019s admonition to the jury and by the prosecutor\u2019s correction soon after. Furthermore, the majority of the Court predicated their ruling on \u201cthe close relation <em>demonstrated </em>(emphasis added) between the accused and his wife\u201d although it is not clear from reading the opinion as to what evidence besides the marital relationship demonstrated that the accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>authorized her act. See dissent on this point, 301 So. 2d at 871. We do not accept the State\u2019s interpretation of the results reached in <em>Graves.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Here the State offers nothing more than the fact appellant and Reynolds were cousins; that they were together the day of the crime and the morning after (testimony which was challenged by the defense); and a hefty dose of conjecture, surmise or suspicion to prove authorization. We hold that mere relationship, of itself, is not sufficient. There must be additional evidence tending to connect the defendant with efforts to tamper with the witness. Therefore, it was error to admit the testimony of Womble and Lemon on Reynolds\u2019 alleged attempt to alter their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The erroneously admitted evidence is intertwined with the second contention of the appellant, to wit: admission of improper rebuttal testimony. Therefore, we shall, next, consider how that testimony came before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Over the objection of the appellant, Womble and Lemon testified for the State that Reynolds endeavored to have them alter their testimony. Even though the defense did not produce any evidence on this point, the State over the objection of defense counsel was permitted to call Reynolds in \u201crebuttal\u201d. When Reynolds denied attempting to influence the testimony of any witness, the State was allowed to recall Lemon in \u201crebuttal\u201d to contradict him and offer additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Recently, we have reiterated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">\u201cAny competent evidence which explains, or is a direct reply to, or a contradiction of, material evidence introduced by the accused may be produced by the prosecution in rebuttal. <em>Shanks v. State, </em>185 Md. 437, 45 A. 2d 85 (1945). And what constitutes rebuttal testimony in a criminal prosecution is a matter resting in the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Dobson v. State, </em>24 Md. App. 644, 659 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>275 Md. 747, Misc. No. 78, September Term, 1975, filed June 2, 1975. See also <em>Lane v. State, </em>226 Md. 81, 90 (1961).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Since no testimony was either solicited or produced by the appellant or bis witnesses on direct examination or cross-examination as to Reynolds\u2019 endeavors to have the prosecution witnesses, Womble and Lemon, alter their testimony, the trial court by allowing the State to question Reynolds in rebuttal in effect placed the State in the position, not of rebutting evidence produced by the accused but of supporting or contradicting the testimony of its own witnesses. When to the surprise of no one, Reynolds denied the allegations of suborning the witnesses, the error was compounded when the State was allowed to recall Lemon in \u201crebuttal\u201d. Lemon then proceeded to contradict and impeach the testimony of Reynolds, and in addition, produced a note to support her contention, and then expanded her initial testimony as to what Reynolds had requested. Neither the testimony of Reynolds nor Lemon, on this point, serve to rebut anything the defense had demonstrated or implied. Therefore, it was admitted in violation of our holding in <em>Dobson, supra, </em>and was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The State argues that the testimony of Reynolds\u2019 attempts to suborn the prosecution witnesses and the admission of it as rebuttal evidence, even if error, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because there was no resulting prejudice to Saunders. The State reaches this conclusion primarily on the basis that in its opinion the evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt is overwhelming. However, a review of the record does not support this contention. The nature of the prosecution\u2019s case, to wit: the mental condition of the victim prior to the rape;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> her testimony at trial;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the conflict between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>statements to police and testimony at trial by both Lemon and Reynolds; considered in the light of the defendant\u2019s defense and the witnesses produced in support thereof, confronted the jury with a classic question of credibility of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">While we are unable to state to what extent, if any, the testimony that Reynolds allegedly attempted to suborn prosecution witnesses and the manner in which that evidence was admitted influenced the jury\u2019s decision, there is present the very real possibility, based on a thorough reading of the record, that this improperly admitted evidence obfuscated the issue and contributed to Saunders\u2019 conviction. <em>Fahy v. Connecticut, </em>375 U. S. 85, 84 S. Ct. 229, 11 L. Ed. 2d 171 (1963). Where trial is by a jury, all reasonable doubts as to the effect of erroneously admitted evidence upon the jury\u2019s determination of guilt must be resolved in favor of the objecting party. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>23 Md. App. 131, 138 (1974); <em>Gilchrist v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 635, 638 (1967); see also <em>Younie v. State, </em>272 Md. 233 (1974). Hence this is not a case of harmless error. As Judge Richard P. Gilbert of this Court stated in <em>Dobson, supra, </em>at page 662:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">\u201cThe State\u2019s introduction of uncharged misconduct evidence denied appellant the protection which the rules of evidence are designed to afford.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">\u2018Guilt in a criminal case must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and by evidence confined to that which long experience in the common-law tradition, to some extent embodied in the Constitution, has crystallized into rules of evidence consistent with that standard. These rules are historically grounded rights of our system, developed to safeguard [citizens from unlawful] convictions, with resulting forfeitures of life, liberty and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>property.\u2019 <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U. S. 160, 174, 69 S. Ct. 1302, 93 L. Ed. 1879 (1949).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Therefore, we hold that the trial court committed prejudicial error in admitting the testimony, and accordingly we reverse and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">In view of our holding, it is unnecessary for us to discuss the other contentions raised by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">\n<em>Case remanded for new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-6\">. Miss Bruce\u2019s mental condition, prior to the crime, was described by both prosecution and defense witnesses as \u201cacting strange\u201d; \u201cwas tripping\u201d; \u201cout of it\u201d; \u201cvery high\u201d; and \u201cwalking around paranoid\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\">. The prosecutor in his argument to the jury candidly characterized the testimony of the victim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">\u201cNow whether Narvis Bruce was merely high on marijuana on Sunday, April 14th or whether she was tripping on acid, you will recall that she said she had not used LSD for a long period of time before that, and to be fair, as it might be, the State is not disillusioned, she was quite high, she was disorientated, there is no question. If the State\u2019s case rested on the testimony of Narvis Bruce, believe me this case would have not been before you. I am <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>under no delusion that Narvis Bruce makes this case. It wouldn\u2019t convict Adolph Hitler for spitting on the sidewalk based on Narvis Bruce\u2019s testimony standing alone.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
