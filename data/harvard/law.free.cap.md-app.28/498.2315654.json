The litigation had been initiated by Copperstone Limited Partnership (Landlord) against Helen Green (Tenant) in the District Court for Howard County by a Complaint in Ejectment-Tenant Holding Over, under Real Property Article \u00a7 8-402<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Annotated Code of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Maryland. After hearing in the District Court, judgment of restitution of leased premises to the landlord was extended. Tenant appealed to the Circuit Court for Howard County. After hearing on appeal, monetary judgment against tenant and a warrant of restitution to landlord was entered in the Circuit Court. A stay of execution of judgment was granted pending petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Tenant occupied apartment 4 of 5858 Stevens Forest Road, Columbia, Maryland under a written lease executed by both landlord and tenant. The lease, dated December 17, 1971, was for the term of twelve (12) months beginning on that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>date, at a monthly rental of $137.00. Landlord and tenant agreed that the fair market rental of the premises was $215.52 monthly. Paragraph 4 of the lease read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">\u201c4. Unless terminated as provided herein, this lease shall be automatically renewed for successive terms of one month each at the aforesaid rental, subject to adjustment as herein provided, payable in advance without demand on the first day of each month. Either party may terminate this lease at the end of the initial term or any successive term by giving 30 days written notice in advance to the other party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">After tenant had continued in possession under that lease for almost three years she received the following letter by certified mail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">\u201cSeptember 5,1974</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa3\">Ms. Helen Green</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYi\">5858-4 Stevens Forest Road Columbia, Maryland 21045</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUKV\">Dear Ms. Green:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">This letter is to constitute a thirty-day (30-day) written notice of our intent to terminate the month-to-month lease agreement between yourself and Copperstone Limited Partnership, as called for in Page 2, Paragraph 4, of your lease for the unit at 5858-4 Stevens Forest Road, and to notify you that you must vacate the premises on or by October 31, 1974. Should you fail to do so, you will be considered a tenant holding over, and appropriate measures will be instituted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">It is our duty, under the law, to advise you that if you hold over beyond the expiration of this term ending October 31, 1974, you can be held liable for double the amount of rent apportioned for the duration of the hold-over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">Your monthly rent for September and October must be paid as usual per your lease agreement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Failure to do so will afford immediate appropriate legal action prior to the October 31st termination date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">Sincerely,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">PATRICIA L. WEYHRAUCH</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAKG\">Resident Manager Copperstone Circle Apartments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">When tenant refused to vacate the premises on October 31, 1974, the landlord filed its complaint in the District Court for Howard County seeking restitution of the premises pursuant to the cited provisions of the Annotated Code of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">For reasons that will become apparent we emphasize at this point that both the notice to the tenant and the complaint against her for restitution as filed in the District Court declared that expiration of the term of the lease was the sole ground for termination of the tenancy, and <em>no other cause was assigned.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">The case presents the issues: (a) whether an apartment complex developed pursuant to section 236 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1715z-1, et seq.) involves such government action that a landlord must assure due process of law before eviction of a tenant may occur; (b) whether the appellant, as a tenant in such a facility, acquired such a property right as entitled her to the protection accorded by the due process of law provisions of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States; and (c) whether eviction may be based solely upon expiration of a lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Appellant tenant contends that procedural due process demands that there be notice of eviction and a hearing to determine if good cause exists for eviction, and that the mere expiration of the term of a lease is not good cause. Appellant concedes that the provisions for a hearing set forth in the Real Property Article \u00a7 8-402 comply with procedural due process requirements, if notice and proof at the hearing demonstrate good cause for eviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">Appellee landlord contends that the litigation is between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>private parties contesting their respective contractual rights under a Maryland statute authorizing eviction, after notice, when the term of the lease has expired, and that there is no constitutional bar to her eviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Section 236 of the National Housing Act, as amended, (12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1715z-l) is a statutory scheme seeking to achieve improved housing at reduced rentals for low and middle income families. The statutory aim is accomplished in part by governmental rent supplements to some tenants and in part by periodic federal government payments of interest for owners to mortgagees who meet the special requirements of the section. Among project owners authorized to participate in the statutory scheme are limited dividend corporations or other limited entities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Tenants of a section 236 facility include some who receive rent supplement payments;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and some whose monthly rent is on a sliding scale, depending on income, not less than a basic monthly rental charge and not more than a fair market monthly rental charge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The tenant in the subject case pays only the basic monthly rental charge but does not receive a rent supplement.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">In sum, landlord is a limited dividend owner of a multi-family apartment complex developed pursuant to section 236 of the National Housing Act (Title 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1715z-1-6) and tenant derives benefits under that section by virtue of being required to pay only the basic monthly rental of $137.00, rather than the fair market rental of $215.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>In the subject project twenty-five tenants are subsidized by government provided rent supplements. The remaining one hundred seven tenants pay rent based on income,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> varying from $137.00 to $215.52 monthly.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Tenant acknowledges that she received the letter notice dated September 5, 1974, <em>supra, </em>and that she executed a lease that included the provisions contained in paragraph 4 thereof, <em>supra. </em>She contends, however, that such paragraph 4 is invalid as applied to tenancies arising under section 236 of the National Housing Act. Landlord acknowledges that the apartment was constructed under section 236 of the National Housing Act, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">That the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments affect only Federal and State action, and do not relate to the conduct of private individuals is firmly fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court. The Fifth Amendment \u201cis a limitation only upon the powers of the general government.\u201d <em>Talton v. Mayes, </em>163 U. S. 376, 382, 16 S. Ct. 986, 988, 41 L. Ed. 196, 198. It is not directed against the action of individuals. <em>Corrigan v. Buckley, </em>271 U. S. 323, 46 S. Ct. 521, 70 L. Ed. 969. The prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment \u201chave reference to state action exclusively, and not to any action of private individuals.\u201d <em>Virginia v. Rives, </em>100 U. S. 313, 318, 25 L. Ed. 667, 669. \u201cIt is state action of a particular character that is prohibited. Individual invasion of individual rights is not the subject matter of the Amendment.\u201d <em>Civil Rights Cases, </em>109 U. S. 3, 11, 3 S. Ct. 18, 21, 27 L. Ed. 835, 839. \u201cIt is obvious that [neither] of these amendments prohibited private individuals from entering into contracts respecting the control and disposition of their own property. * * * \u201d <em>Corrigan v. Buckley, supra, </em>at 330 [972].</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Thus, it would appear at first blush that the subject case involves no Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">There are, however, Supreme Court decisions exemplified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>by <em>American Communications </em>Asso., <em>C.I.O. v. Douds, </em>339 U. S. 382, 70 S. Ct. 674, 94 L. Ed. 925, declaring that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">\u201c * * * when authority derives in part from Government\u2019s thumb on the scales, the exercise of that power by private persons becomes closely akin, in some respects, to its exercise by Government itself.\u201d (at 401, [945])</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Thus in <em>Public Utilities Comm. v. Pollak, </em>343 U. S. 451, 72 S. Ct. 813, 96 L. Ed. 1068, the Capital Transit Company, a privately owned corporation contracted with a privately owned radio broadcasting company for radio programs to be received and amplified in busses operated by the transit company. Protesting passengers who were compelled to listen, argued that their Fifth Amendment right to liberty was infringed. The Supreme Court, although denying that the facts showed violation of Fifth Amendment rights, acknowledged its obligation to pass upon the constitutional issue, saying in 343 U. S. at 461, 72 S. Ct. at 820, 96 L. Ed. at 1076-77:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">\u201cIt was held by the court below that the action of Capital Transit in installing and operating the radio receivers, coupled with the action of the Public Utilities Commission in dismissing its own investigation of the practice, sufficiently involved the Federal Government in responsibility for the radio programs to make the First and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States applicable to this radio service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">adding in 343 U. S. at 462, 72 S. Ct. at 820, 96 L. Ed. at 1077:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">\u201cWe find in the reasoning of the court below a sufficiently close relation between the Federal Government and the radio service to make it necessary for us to consider those Amendments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">Tenant urges that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect her valuable property right from invasion by action of landlord because the authority of the latter derives \u201cfrom Government\u2019s thumb on the scales.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>The seminal case involving constitutional limitations upon private owners of apartment projects developed under the provisions of the National Housing Act is that of <em>Joy v. Daniels, </em>479 F. 2d 1236 (4th Cir. 1973). That case arose under Section 221 of that Act<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> under facts thus summarized by the Court (at 1238):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">\u201cOn September <em>2, </em>1970, plaintiff leased one of defendant\u2019s apartments. The standard form lease provided in relevant part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">\u2018At the end of one year, lease is automatically renewed from month to month, rent to be payable in advance without demand on first day of each month. Either party may terminate lease at end of term or any successive term by giving 30 days\u2019 notice in advance to other party.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">On September 11,1971, the defendant gave plaintiff 30 days\u2019 notice to vacate, no cause being assigned. It appears that the plaintiff has continued to occupy her apartment on a month-to-month basis, with her tenancy dependent on the outcome of this litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">\u201cSection 221(d)(3) of the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715l(d)(3) (1971), is a statutory scheme for encouraging housing for low income families. To participate in this program, defendant was required to conform to a regulatory agreement with the Federal Housing Administration governing, inter alia, the construction, occupancy, and daily operations of the project. The FHA also grants defendant rent supplements for the plaintiff and other tenants under Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701s(b) (1971). Plaintiff, for example, enjoys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>occupancy of an apartment worth $157.00 per month at a cost to her of $48.00. FHA pays the difference, <em>i.e., </em>$109.00 per month, directly to defendant. As a prerequisite to participation in the rent supplement program, there must be local government approval. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.15(c) (1971). The County Council specifically approved rent supplements for Joseph Paul Apartments on August 6,1968.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The Court, concluding that State action had \u201c \u2018so far insinuated [the state] into a position of interdependence\u2019 with the defendant that the challenged activity \u2018cannot be considered to have been so \u201cpurely private\u201d as to fall without the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019 \u201d declared: (at 1239)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">\u201cAccordingly, we hold there is sufficient state involvement to constitute \u2018state action\u2019 for purposes of the fourteenth amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The Court in <em>Joy </em>then discussed in considerable depth the rights of the tenant; the congressional purposes sought to be served by passage of \u00a7 221; and the regulations adopted to carry out those purposes, saying at 1239, <em>et seq.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">\u201cThe district court concluded that plaintiff had no right of occupancy upon expiration of the term of the lease. Plaintiff contends that despite expiration of the term she may be evicted only for \u2018good cause\u2019 and is entitled to the protection of procedural due process in the determination of whether cause exists. Since procedural due process applies only to the deprivation of interest protected by the fourteenth amendment, <em>i.e., </em>liberty and property, we must first determine plaintiff\u2019s substantive rights. <em>See </em>Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 569, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972); <em>McQueen, </em>317 F.Supp. at 1128.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>\u201cAs stated in Board of Regents v. Roth:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">\u2018Certain attributes of \u201cproperty\u201d interests protected by procedural due process emerge from [the Court\u2019s] decisions. To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it. It is a purpose of the ancient institution of property to protect those claims upon which people rely in their daily lives, reliance that must not be arbitrarily undermined. It is a purpose of the constitutional right to a hearing to provide an opportunity for a person to vindicate those claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">\u2018Property interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law \u2014 rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">408 U. S. at 577, 92 S. Ct. at 2709.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">\u2018A person\u2019s interest in a benefit is a \u201cproperty\u201d interest for due process purposes if there are such rules or mutually explicit understandings that support his claim of entitlement to the benefit and that he may invoke at a hearing.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">Perry v. Sinderman, 408 U.S. 593, 601, 92 S. Ct. 2694, 2699, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972). Thus we must now look to applicable statutes, governmental regulations, and the custom and understandings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>public landlords in the operation of their apartments to determine if a public tenant has a \u2018property interest\u2019 in a tenancy beyond the term of the lease except for cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">\u201cWhen Congress legislated with regard to mortgage insurance benefits which defendant receives, it provided: \u2018The Congress affirms the national goal, as set forth in section 1441 of Title 42, of \u201ca decent home and suitable living environment for every American family\u201d.\u2019 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701t. This policy of improving the \u2018living environment of urban areas\u2019 was also the policy of Congress in enacting the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965. Pub.L. 89-117, 79 Stat. 451 (Aug. 10, 1965). \u2018This [policy] includes adequate, safe, and sanitary quarters. But it also implies an atmosphere of stability, security, neighborliness, and social justice.\u2019 <em>McQueen, </em>317 F.Supp. at 1130. <em>Cf., </em>Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, 93 S.Ct. 364, 34 L.Ed.2d 415 (1972).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">\u201cIn addition to the policy statements contained in the relevant funding statutes, Congress has also expressed itself in part on how these programs should be run. \u2018No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d. The policy of this statute, a person\u2019s right to be free of invidious discrimination in federally assisted programs, is contained in many statutes, <em>see, e.g., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000a.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">\u2018This legislative establishment of policy carries significance beyond the particular scope of each of the statutes involved. The policy thus established has become itself a part of our law, to be given its appropriate weight not only in matters of statutory construction but also in those of decisional law.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc, 398 U.S. 375, 390-391, 90 S.Ct. 1772, 1782, 26 L.Ed.2d 339 (1970).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">\u201cNot only the statutes, but also FHA regulations authorized under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701s(f), imply a right to be free from arbitrary and discriminatory action. For example, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 221.-536 (1971) provides that a landlord in a \u00a7 221(d)(3) apartment may not discriminate against any family because of children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">The House Report dealing with the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 said, with regard to the rent supplement program:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">\u2018If his income increases sufficiently so that he can pay the full economic rent with 259r of his income, rent supplement payments on his behalf would cease to be made. The tenant could, however, continue to live in the project and would not be required to pay more than the full economic rent.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">H.R. Rep. No. 365, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965), 1965 U.S.Code Cong. and Ad. News, pp. 2614, 2618. This suggests the Congress was contemplating more occupancy entitlement than limited leasehold terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">\u201cThe tenant\u2019s expectation of some degree of permanency, seemingly shared by the Congress, if not by the landlord, is bolstered by \u2018custom.\u2019 Just as there may be a \u2018common law\u2019 of tenure at a college or university, there may be a common law of tenancy in public housing projects. <em>See Perry, </em>408 U.S. at 602, 92 S. Ct. 2694.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-12\">\u2018The actual workings of the subsidized housing program must be examined to determine whether there is a reasonable basi\u00e9 for tenants to expect that in normal circumstances they will be permitted to remain in the housing indefinitely. And indeed one finds that the normal practice in subsidized housing, as in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>private housing, is to permit tenants to remain beyond the expiration of a lease unless a reason has arisen for eviction; termination is the exception, not the rule.

We therefore hold that the lease provision purporting to give the landlord power to terminate without cause at the expiration of a fixed term is invalid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">and added at 1242:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">\u201cTo allow a quasi public landlord to evict upon expiration of a fixed term is to enable secret and silent discrimination and would wholly emasculate the procedural safeguards of Caulder.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>In <em>Joy, supra, </em>decision was grounded upon the Fourteenth Amendment. In the subject record we perceive no evidence of State action or involvement save the use of State statutory eviction procedures. We believe that this circumstance, standing alone, would not constitute such State action as to give rise to Fourteenth Amendment protection. <em>McGuane v. Chenango Court, Inc., </em>431F. 2d 1189 (2nd Cir. 1970), cert. den. 401 U. S. 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Such a conclusion does not, however, resolve the issues that confront us. In <em>Short v. Fulton Redevelopment Co., </em>390 F. Supp. 517 (U.S.D.C. S.D. N.Y. 1975), a \u00a7 221 project; and in <em>Anderson v. Denny, </em>365 F. Supp. 1254 (U.S.D.C. W.D. Va. 1973), a \u00a7 236 project, issues identical to those in <em>Joy </em>were presented. However, the position taken in <em>Joy </em>was sustained in <em>Short </em>and <em>Anderson, </em>not only upon Fourteenth Amendment grounds but also upon Fifth Amendment grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\"><em>Anderson, supra, </em>is particularly noteworthy because of its discussion of the interdependence of the Federal Government and owners of projects developed under \u00a7 236. The Court said at 1256-57:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">\u201cThe question is thus whether the state or the federal government, or both, have become so involved in the conduct of this otherwise private enterprise that its actions are also the actions of these governments and performed under their aegis without the private body necessarily becoming either their instrumentality or their agent in a strict sense. Simkins v. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, 323 F.2d 959 (4th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 938, 84 S.Ct. 793, 11 L.Ed.2d 659 (1964). Decision on this question requires consideration of \u00a7 236 of the National Housing Act of 1968 as well as the involvement of the state and local governments in the activities of the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-9\">\u201cThe benefits received from the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>government by qualifying as a \u00a7 236 project include reduction in the interest rate paid on the mortgage to one percent per annum, rent supplements for 209 of the tenants, provision for up to 959c of the funds needed during construction by the Federal National Mortgage Association in participation with an originating mortgagee, provision for the purchase of the mortgage by the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Government National Mortgage Association upon completion of construction, guaranteed builders\u2019 fees, and certain tax benefits including accelerated depreciation with limited recapture as ordinary income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">\u201cQuite understandably such inducements to private enterpreneurs to encourage them to provide housing for low income families result in federal control. The statute pursuant to which Oak Ridge Gardens qualified for federal subsidies provides that the owners \u2018shall operate the project in accordance with such requirements with respect to tenant eligibility and rents as the Secretary may prescribe.\u2019 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-l(e). In addition, the Secretary is given the power \u2018to make such rules and regulations, to enter into such agreements, and to adopt such procedures as he may deem necessary or desirable to carry out the provisions of the statute.\u2019 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-1(h). Restrictions on the management of \u00a7 236 projects are set forth in 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 236.1 et seq. The defendants in this case are restricted in the following particulars among others: (1) the amount of rent that may be charged; (2) admission to the project is limited to persons of specified income levels; (3) the landlord cannot discriminate on account of children in a family; (4) preference in admission must be given to families displaced by government activities; (5) the landlord cannot convey, transfer or encumber the property; (6) without written approval of the Federal Housing Administration, the landlord cannot convey a beneficial interest in the property or convey a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>to manage it or collect its rent nor can he remodel, add to or destroy a portion of the property; (7) the landlord must maintain the mortgaged property in good condition subject to FHA inspection; (8) the owners cannot voluntarily go into bankruptcy; and (9) the owners must furnish monthly occupancy reports and must answer questions relative to income, assets, liabilities, contracts, operation and condition of the property and the status of the mortgage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">adding at 1258-59:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">\u201cBeyond the mere relationship of Oak Ridge Gardens to the state and federal governments in the form of benefits and regulations, the fact that defendants in effect perform a government function by helping to implement the congressional policy of providing decent housing to low income families makes their actions subject to constitutional limitations. See Evans v. Newton, 382 U.S. 296, 86 S.Ct. 486, 15 L.Ed.2d 373 (1966); Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U.S. 501, 66 S.Ct. 276, 90 L.Ed. 265 (1946); Simkins v. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, 323 F.2d 959 (4th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 938, 84 S.Ct. 793, 11 L.Ed.2d 659 (1964). Related to the theory that defendants are performing a government function is the idea that defendants have the power to deprive their tenants of government benefits. It is clear that tenants at Oak Ridge Gardens must meet certain income requirements and that they receive a government subsidy amounting to the difference in their rental payments and the market value of comparable housing. Eviction of a tenant obviously results in a deprivation of this benefit which can fairly be described as a necessity. It follows that the defendants, by electing to act as a means of distributing these government subsidies, have made themselves government actors for purposes of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The Court then said at 1260:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">\u201cAccordingly, this court concludes that as a matter of substantive federal law the tenants at Oak Ridge Gardens have a property interest in their tenancies and cannot be evicted except for good cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">\u201cThis substantive right not to be arbitrarily evicted on the mere expiration of a lease, in turn requires that a tenant be afforded the following protections: (1) timely notice specifying the reasons for the eviction; (2) an opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses and present his own evidence; (3) the right to retain an attorney; and (4) the right to an impartial decision based solely on the evidence adduced at the hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">In <em>Lopez v. Henry Phipps Plaza South, Inc., </em>498 F. 2d 937 (2nd. Cir. 1974), although factually dissimilar and invoking other sections of the National Housing Act, the Court spoke with clarity as to evictions solely grounded upon lease termination, saying at 943:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">\u201cThe federal government, the states and the cities which have extended aid to low and middle income housing hardly expected that a tenant could be evicted at the end of his term simply at the landlord\u2019s whim, when substitute housing could be obtained, if at all, only with delay, disruption in living habits and expense. <em>Cf. </em>Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 479, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). Purely private housing is, of course, a different matter, see Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56, 74, 92 S.Ct. 862, 31 L.Ed.2d 36 (1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">The issues now before us have been considered in at least one State Appellate Court. In <em>Appel v. Beyer, </em>39 Cal. App. 3d Supp. 7, Super., Supp. 15, 114 Cal Rptr. 336, 341, dealing with a \u00a7 221 project, the Court concurred with the decision in <em>Joy, supra, </em>but did so on the basis of federal governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>action under the Fifth Amendment. The Court in footnote 9 said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">\u201cIn view of our holding that appellants have been denied due process of law because of federal involvement, it is not necessary to consider whether entertainment of these eviction proceedings by our local courts or payment of rent supplements involve \u2018state\u2019 action by California or its agencies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The decisions in <em>Joy, Short, Anderson </em>and <em>Appel, </em>all <em>supra, </em>are indistinguishable on their facts. The soundness of their reasoning is uncontested by contrary decisions. We shall follow them. In the subject case we are persuaded that the benefits of the landlord and the tenant are the products of government action. As was said in <em>Appel, supra, </em>at Supp. 13 [339]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">\u201cThe government is, essentially, the landlord. Without the government, there would be no such low cost housing; with the government, the quality and cost of the housing is such as the government allows.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Here, the federal government has so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with the landlord that it must be recognized as a joint participant in the landlord-tenant relationship. <em>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, </em>365 U. S. 715, 725, 81 S. Ct. 856, 862, 6 L.Ed.2d 45, 52. Thus, the scope of government involvement brings the subject case within the ambit of the Fifth Amendment. By reason of this the tenant has a property right of entitlement to continued occupancy until there exists a cause to evict other than the mere expiration of the lease. An effort to evict a tenant from a \u00a7 236 project without notice and proof of good cause is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">Appellee landlord, asserting an alternative position, asks us to hold that in any event due process was accorded because proper notice and good cause for eviction was shown. There was, indeed, some evidence that the apartment had sustained substantial' physical damage inferentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>attributable to the tenant\u2019s misconduct. It was shown also that written demands for payment of the costs of necessary repairs had been made upon the tenant. We have previously pointed out, however, that neither the notice by the landlord to the tenant to vacate, nor the allegations in the complaint by which her eviction was sought had set forth any cause save expiration of the term of the lease. Thus, even if we assume, without deciding, that the conduct of the tenant was such as to justify eviction, neither notice nor pleadings have alleged that cause for such action existed. The tenant is entitled to be explicitly informed of the grounds upon which her eviction is sought. Moreover, the record makes clear that the judgment of the trial court was entered on the basis that the landlord was not required to show more than that the term of the lease had expired and that notice to vacate had been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Our holding is limited solely to these propositions: (a) that landlord is bound to assure due process to the tenant; (b) that due process requires a hearing and proof of good cause for eviction after notice of the grounds upon which eviction is sought and (c) that mere expiration of the term of a lease is not such good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">We find no constitutional impediment to utilizing summary Maryland statutory eviction procedures provided proper notice is given and good cause for eviction is shown at hearing. <em>Joy v. Daniels, supra; Appel v. Beyer, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">\n<em>Appellee to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-11\">.

The court shall forthwith issue its summons to the tenant or person in possession that he be and appear on a day stated in the summons before the court to show cause (if any he have) why restitution of the possession of the said estate so leased should not be forthwith made to the landlord.
