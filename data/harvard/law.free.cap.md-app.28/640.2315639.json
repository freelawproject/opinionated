That time came on June 9, 1975, with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U. S. 684, 95 S. Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975).

At some time between 2 and 3 p.m. on June 20, 1974, the appellant struck Alonzo Counts with a knife several times. The victim bled to death shortly thereafter, the fatal blow having been a stab to the neck. The homicidal agency of the appellant is not in dispute. Testimony by State\u2019s witnesses and defense witnesses alike, including testimony from the appellant himself, established a pattern of angry and violent confrontations between the appellant and the victim during the hour immediately preceding the homicide, such confrontations broken by periods when the two were out of contact with one another. There was evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the appellant struck the victim without justification, excuse or legally adequate provocation. Just as surely, there was evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the appellant struck in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>necessary self-defense or that he struck in hot blood in the course of mutual combat. It is sufficient for present purposes to note that the questions of excuse (the self-defense in this case) and mitigation (by way of the hot blood of mutual combat) were substantially present as issues in the case. Correct instructions were, therefore, in order both to define those issues and to allocate the burden of persuasion as to them by the appropriate standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">With respect to the allocation of the burden of persuasion generally as to these issues, the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury was, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">\u201cYou are advised that the statutory law of Maryland provides that all murder which shall be perpetrated by means of poison, or lying in wait, or by any kind of wilful, deliberate, and premeditated killing, shall be murder in the first degree. The law further provides that all other kinds of murder shall be deemed to be murder in the second degree. Upon proof by the State of murder, without anything else, the presumption is that it is murder in the second degree. The State has the burden of proving the elements of the crime which would raise the degree to murder in the first degree. That is, in this case, that it was wilful, deliberate, and premeditated. <em>The Defendant has the burden of showing the elements which would reduce the crime to manslaughter or which would make the homicide justifiable and excusable.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">At another point in the instruction, the court defined the element of malice necessary to a finding of murder and also referred to the presumption of malice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">\u201cThe difference between murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree is this; where the evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was done with <em>malice, that it was the result of the intentional doing of a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number><em>wrongful or illegal act to another without legal excuse or justification, then murder in the second degree has been proven under our law. The use of a deadly weapon directed at a vital part of the body gives rise to the presumption that malice existed. </em>Subsequently, <em>you, as jurors, may also draw an inference that the killing was done with malice from the fact that the deadly weapon was used and directed at a vital part of the body of the deceased.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The immediately following instruction mingled the self-defense, which might render a homicide excusable, with the provocation, which might limit it to manslaughter. It seemed to postulate that all killing not in self-defense is <em>ipso facto </em>without adequate provocation and, therefore, malicious:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">\u201cNo provocation, however grievous, will reduce a voluntary homicide to manslaughter if the circumstances show that the slayer acted not in self-defense but from malice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">In going on to the subject of self-defense, the trial judge seemed clearly to put the burden of establishing its necessary elements upon the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">\u201cThe Defendant in this case contends, however, that he is not guilty of any degree of homicide by reason of the fact that he was acting in self-defense. The Defendant has contended that the deceased, Alonzo Counts, was stabbed in the act of assaulting the Defendant, Edward Evans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-10\"><em>In order to justify or excuse the killing of another in self-defense it is necessary to establish that the Defendant was not the aggressor and did not provoke the conflict, that the Defendant believed at that time that he was in such imminent danger of losing his own life or suffering bodily harm, that it was necessary for him to take the life of the deceased, to save himself, and that the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number><em>circumstances were such at the time to warrant reasonable grounds for such belief in a mind of ordinary reason. </em>\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">In ultimately allocating the burden of persuasion on the question of self-defense, the trial judge accurately recited the self-contradictory and mutually exclusive statements which have chronically plagued the common law of Maryland on this elusive and confused subject. The burden of proving all elements of the crime seems to be upon the State, but the burden of negating one of those elements seems simultaneously to be upon the defense. The quandary is unresolved as to what to do if the defense has offered enough persuasion to throw doubt upon the State\u2019s case but not enough persuasion to establish self-defense affirmatively by a preponderance of the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">\u201cExcusable self-defense is where a person becomes engaged in a sudden affray or combat and in the course of the affray or combat kills his adversary to save himself from death or great bodily harm after retreating as far as he could with safety. The Defendant has presented evidence tending to show that his act was justifiable and excusable self-defense. <em>If his evidence, considered with all the other evidence, raises a reasonable doubt to his guilt; if that has been shown, the Defendant is entitled to an acquittal.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\"><em>The Defendant is not obliged to establish this defense beyond a reasonable doubt, but by a preponderance of the proof. The prosecution must prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>\n<em>The Preliminary Hurdle of Plain Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Before considering the effect of <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>upon the instructions in this case specifically and upon the common law of Maryland with respect to felonious homicide generally, one preliminary hurdle must be overcome: The appellant lodged no objection to the instructions given the jury in this case. Although ordinarily the failure to object to an instruction will preclude review on appeal, <em>Parker v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 62, 67, 241 A. 2d 185; <em>Hicks v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 225, 238 A. 2d 577; Maryland Rule 756 g, certain circumstances will cause this Court to exercise its discretion and to notice \u201cplain error\u201d. These exceptional circumstances were incisively analyzed and lucidly set out by Judge Powers in <em>Brown v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 415, 422, 287 A. 2d 62:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">\u201c [W]e think that as a general guide, we may say that under Rule 756 g we will take cognizance of and correct an irremediable error of commission, but not an error of omission. Of course, the error must be plain, and material to the rights of the accused, and, even then, the exercise of our discretion to correct it should be limited to those cases in which correction is necessary to serve the ends of fundamental fairness and substantial justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">See also <em>Bieber v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 522, 533-534, 261 A. 2d 202. This is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">For reasons to be hereinafter discussed, we hold that there were errors in the instructions. They were errors of commission; they were irremediable; they were plain; they were material to the rights of the appellant. We note moreover as we exercise our discretion in this regard, although the point is not of pivotal significance, that the appellant and his attorney could not have anticipated <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>and may have been persuaded that the instructions given accurately reflected the law of Maryland. More significantly, we exercise our discretion in noticing this particular \u201cplain error\u201d because of the legion of cases already beginning to surface in the wake of <em>Mullaney v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number><em>Wilbur, </em>and because of the inevitably greater legions yet to follow. We deem a prompt review of these instructions, and those like them, \u201cnecessary to serve the ends of fundamental fairness and substantial justice\u201d even beyond the confines of this particular case. This case is, in short, an appropriate and necessary vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">\n<em>I. The Ghost of Homicide Past</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">A. <em>The Retroactivity of Mullaney v. Wilbur</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The decision in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>which decision governs our holding in this case, was handed down by the Supreme Court on June 9, 1975. The appellant\u2019s trial was on November 12, 13 and 14, 1974, some eight months earlier. The immediate question arises as to whether <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>will be applied retroactively and, if so, to what extent. The answer is that it must be given fully retroactive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">In this regard, we conclude that <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>was but an application to a murder conviction of the broad constitutional principle earlier laid down in <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U. S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368, 375 (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">\u201cLest there remain any doubt about the constitutional stature of the reasonable-doubt standard, we explicitly hold that the Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">At the very outset of the <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>opinion, the issue before the Court was posed explicitly in terms of compliance with the broad mandate of <em>Winship:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-11\">\u201cWe must decide whether this rule [the Maine rule as to the burden of persuasion on the issue of manslaughter] comports with the due process requirement, as defined in <em>In re Winship. . ., </em>that the prosecution prove beyond a reasonable doubt every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged.\u201d <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>44 L.Ed.2d, at 511.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>The consistent and, indeed, exclusive theme running throughout the entire <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>opinion is the applicability to homicide law of <em>Winship\u2019s </em>requirement that the State prove every element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Any doubt as to the retroactive effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number><em>Winship </em>was resolved in <em>Ivan V. v. City of New York, </em>407 U. S. 203, 204-205, 92 S. Ct. 1951, 32 L.Ed.2d 659, 661-662 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">\u201cWe disagree with the holding of the Court of Appeals that <em>Winship </em>is not to be applied retroactively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">\u2018Where the major purpose of new constitutional doctrine is to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impairs its truth-finding function and so raises serious questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in past trials, the new rule has been given complete retroactive effect. Neither good-faith reliance by state or federal authorities on prior constitutional law or accepted practice, nor severe impact on the administration of justice has sufficed to require prospective application in these circumstances.\u2019 <em>Williams v. United States .. .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\"><em>Winship </em>expressly held that the reasonable-doubt standard \u2018is a prime instrument for reducing the risk of convictions resting on factual error. The standard provides concrete substance for the presumption of innocence \u2014 that bedrock \u2018axiomatic and elementary\u2019 principle whose \u2018enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law\u2019.... \u2018Due process commands that no man shall lose his liberty unless the Government has borne the burden of . . . convincing the factfinder of his guilt.\u2019 To this end, the reasonable-doubt standard is indispensable, for it \u2018impresses on the trier of fact the necessity of reaching a subjective state of certitude of the facts in issue.\u2019 \u2019 . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-10\">Plainly, then, the major purpose of the constitutional standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt announced in <em>Winship </em>was to overcome an aspect of a criminal trial that substantially impairs the truth-finding function, and <em>Winship </em>is thus to be given complete retroactive effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>It follows, therefore, ineluctably that <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>is also \u201cto be given complete retroactive effect.\u201d The fully retroactive operation of <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>however, does not, <em>ipso facto, </em>forebode another <em>Schowgurow v. State,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>240 Md. 121, 213 A. 2d 475, destined to empty the prisons of all inmates serving terms for any form of felonious homicide. We will now look to the limitations upon that retroactivity, not limitations on the ability of <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>to reach into the distant past but rather limitations upon the classes of convicted felons eligible for its coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The full ramifications of <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>will be discussed in greater detail hereinafter in dealing with the present and future impact of the decision on Maryland law. For the moment, it is enough to set out, by way of shorthand summary, that it dooms as unconstitutional any procedural device which 1) imposes upon a defendant a burden of proving, by any standard, his innocence as to any element of a crime or 2) relieves the State of its burden of ultimate persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt as to any issue fairly in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">B. <em>Erroneous Allocation of the Burden of Persuasion as to Mitigation (Mitigation Being an Issue in the Case) Where the Conviction is Only for Manslaughter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The common error in this regard would be, in its lesser form, an instruction to the jury to the effect that, under certain circumstances, felonious homicide is presumed to be with malice and is, therefore, presumed to be murder in the second degree (thereby relieving the State, where mitigation is a legitimate issue in the case, of proving the absence of mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt); and, in its slightly more aggravated form, an instruction to the jury going further and placing upon the defendant the burden of proving (by any standard) such mitigation as would lower the felonious homicide to the manslaughter level. Notwithstanding such error, where the verdict is one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>manslaughter only, the defendant has suffered no cognizable harm \u2014 any error is manifestly harmless, at the constitutional level, and non-prejudicial, at the non-constitutional level.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Where the issue which a defendant has fairly generated (see Part IIH <em>infra) </em>is whether sufficient mitigation existed to lower the <em>mens rea </em>to the non-malicious, though still felonious, level of manslaughter, the verdict has cured the error. The defendant has received everything for which he was contending and to which he may arguably have been entitled. He was, to be sure, put to an unfair burden in lowering the conviction to the manslaughter level, but he nonetheless shouldered his burden successfully. The law will not countenance the reversal of a manslaughter conviction, which the defendant agrees he deserved, merely so that upon retrial he may achieve the same end more effortlessly.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">In concluding that the verdict as to a lesser charge cured any error in instructions as to a greater charge, we are not here dealing with the question of whether the erroneous submission of greater charges to the jury, where the record reveals that judgments of acquittal should have been granted as to them, might or might not constitute error by facilitating a compromise verdict on the lesser charge. We intimate nothing in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">We are dealing here with a question of a different order. It is the broad consensus of authority, and we concur therein, that a mere error in instructions as to a greater degree of a crime will be deemed immaterial and non-prejudicial where the verdict is brought in for a lesser degree of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">In this regard, we find highly persuasive the statement of law contained at 40 Am.Jur.2d <em>Homicide, </em>\u00a7 528, \u201cEffect of erroneous instructions \u2014 As to higher grade or degree, where defendant convicted of lower,\u201d p. 784:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-9\">\u201cThe rule that the accused ordinarily cannot complain of an error in instructing the jury as to the higher grade or degree of the crime charged where the jury is properly instructed as to, and returns a verdict of guilty of, the lower grade or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>degree, is especially applicable with respect to charges upon the different grades and degrees of culpable homicide. Thus, error in a charge upon first degree murder is not to be deemed prejudicial to one convicted of a lower degree of murder, voluntary manslaughter, or involuntary manslaughter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">And see 24B C.J.S. <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 1922(15)c, \u201cCure of Error by Verdict or Judgment,\u201d pp. 197-200; <em>State v.

See also 4 <em>Warren on Homicide, </em>\u00a7 380, \u201cEffect of Conviction of Manslaughter,\u201d pp. 643-646.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">As to the highly speculative theory that an erroneous instruction by way of lessening the burden of proving some higher grade of an offense might in some vague and indefinite way have facilitated a compromise on a lesser grade of the offense, on which a conviction was fully supported by the evidence, we agree with the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in <em>Commonwealth v. Kaminsky, </em>434 Pa. 38, 252 A. 2d 695. In that case, the Pennsylvania high court agreed that an instruction placing the burden upon a defendant to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter was in error. The conviction in that case was, however, only for manslaughter. In rejecting the claim that the error may have facilitated a prejudicial compromise, the court said, at 252 A. 2d 696:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">\u201cEven if the trial judge placed an extra burden on appellant to reduce his conviction to voluntary manslaughter, the harmless nature of the error becomes clear in light of the subsequent voluntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>manslaughter verdict. It can hardly be argued that if the jury had been given the correct charge on voluntary manslaughter, they would have been more inclined to find appellant not guilty. The only possible effect of the erroneous instruction was for the jury to think appellant had to prove more in order to convince them that he was <em>only </em>guilty of voluntary manslaughter; but he <em>did </em>convince them that this was the proper verdict despite the handicap. Thus the best verdict appellant could have received if the charge had been correct was the <em>same </em>one the jury actually rendered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">Appellant argues that because compromise verdicts often occur in criminal cases, the introduction of the incorrect standard as to voluntary manslaughter might have affected the process by which the jury reached the compromise. However whether this was a compromise verdict is pure speculation; whether a different charge would have changed the \u2018compromise\u2019 ventures even further into the territory of the uncertain. It certainly does not seem appropriate for a court to declare an otherwise harmless error to be grounds for reversal on the basis of such conjecture.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">In this regard, see also <em>Walker v. People </em>(Colo.), 248 P. 2d 287, 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">The curative effect of the verdict upon the erroneous allocation of the burden of persuasion (either by way of relieving the State of its burden or affirmatively placing the burden upon the defendant) would not be dissimilar if the verdict had been rendered in a court trial rather than in a jury trial. If, for example, the court-, in gratuitously articulating its mental processes, had indicated an erroneous understanding of the allocation of the burden but had nonetheless convicted the defendant only of the lesser crime, the only resultant harm would have been that the defendant worked a little harder than necessary in obtaining the end he both sought and deserved \u2014 a harm not requiring a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>C. <em>Erroneous Allocation of the Burden of Persuasion as to Mitigation (Mitigation Being an Issue in the Case) Where the Conviction is for Murder in the First Degree</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">By the same token, any error in instructing as to the allocation of the burden of persuasion on the subject of mitigation (such mitigation, for purposes of holding the homicidal <em>mens rea </em>down to the manslaughter level, being fairly an issue in the case) will have been cured by a verdict of murder in the first degree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The evil aimed at by <em>Mullaney v. </em>Wilbur; where the issue is manslaughter versus murder, is that a presumption of malice unfairly relieves the State of the burden of proving non-mitigation (mitigation being fairly an issue in the case). Where the ultimate verdict is that of murder in the second degree, the presumption may, therefore, have been pivotal. Where, on the other hand, the verdict is murder in the first degree, the State will have proved every element, including the negating of hot blood, beyond a reasonable doubt and due process will not have been offended.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">It is the well-settled law of Maryland that to prove murder in the first degree, the State must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt \u201cthat the killing was wilful, deliberate, and premeditated.\u201d <em>Wilson v. State, </em>261 Md. 551, 564, 276 A. 2d 214. Our equally well-settled definitions of the terms wilfulness, deliberation and premeditation, all of which elements the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, make it clear that that act of proof will, <em>ipso facto, </em>have negated beyond a reasonable doubt any possibility that the killing was in \u201chot blood\u201d \u2014 in sudden response to provocation where the passions had not yet had an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>opportunity to cool and, therefore, to allow a deliberate judgment. These elements were well defined in <em>Hyde v. State, </em>228 Md. 209, 215-216, 179 A. 2d 421:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-5\">\u201c \u2018Premeditated\u2019 means that the killing must have been meditated, planned in the mind, beforehand; that the design to kill must have preceded the killing by an appreciable length of time, time enough to deliberate; and in order to justify a conviction of first degree murder, the trier of facts must find the actual intent (wilfulness), the fully formed purpose to kill (deliberation), with <em>enough time for deliberation and premeditation to convince the trier of facts that this purpose is not the immediate offspring of rashness and impetuous temper </em>(lack of deliberation and premeditation), but that the mind has become fully conscious of its own design. Although the design to kill must precede the killing by some appreciable length of time, that time need not be long. If the killing be not the instant effect of impulse, if there be hesitation or doubt to overcome a choice made as the result of thought, however short the struggle between the intention and the act, it is sufficient to characterize the crime as deliberate and premeditated murder.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Cited with approval in <em>Wilson v.

Maryland, </em>402 F. Supp. 76, (filed on October 15, 1975), Judge C. Stanley Blair in the United States District Court for Maryland employed a similar analysis. Wilkins claimed that upon his trial in a Maryland criminal court he had been denied due process under <em>Winship </em>and <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>when the jury was instructed that it could presume an unlawful killing to have been perpetrated with malice. Wilkins was convicted of murder in the first degree. Judge Blair ruled that the jury instructions, even if erroneous, were harmless because the first-degree murder conviction had cured any arguable error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">\u201cIn finding Wilkins guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the willful, deliberate and premeditated killing of the victim \u2014 or alternatively, of killing the victim during the perpetration of a robbery \u2014 the jury necessarily rejected, <em>beyond a reasonable doubt, </em>that the defendant acted recklessly without an intention to take a life or in the heat of passion. Phrased otherwise, in proving the elements of first degree murder beyond any reasonable doubt in the jurors\u2019 minds, the state necessarily disproved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>manslaughter beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the gist of <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, supra, </em>that the state prove all elements of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt, is satisfied in fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">See also 4 <em>Warren on Homicide, </em>\u00a7 380, \u201cEffect of Conviction of Murder in First Degree, pp. 639-641.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Nor will <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>be applicable retroactively to any conviction of murder in the first degree rendered by a judge sitting without a jury (where mitigation is fairly an issue in the case). Even if the judge,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in the course of articulating his verdict, has gratuitously and erroneously mentioned the presumption of malice, his ultimate finding of the elements of wilfulness, deliberation and premeditation beyond a reasonable doubt will have cured, by making immaterial, any error of misunderstanding in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">D. <em>Erroneous Allocation of the Burden of Persuasion as to Mitigation (Mitigation Being an Issue in the Case) Where the Conviction is for Murder in the Second Degree</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">Where, on the other hand, an erroneous instruction has been given to the jury either to the simple effect that an intentional killing gives rise to a presumption of malice (thereby relieving the State of its burden of negating mitigation, where mitigation is fairly an issue in the case) or, in slightly more aggravated form, to the effect that the burden is upon the defendant to prove such mitigation as would lower murder to manslaughter, and the ultimate verdict is for murder in the second degree,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Mullaney v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number><em>Wilbur </em>will have retroactive application. Here the constitutional error is manifest, and the requirement of <em>Winship </em>that the State prove each and every element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt has not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">By the same token, a verdict rendered in a court trial of murder in the second degree will bear scrutiny under <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>if the judge, in the course of rendering his decision, indicates that he relied upon the now unconstitutional presumption of malice or that he in any way placed upon the defendant the burden of proving such mitigation as would reduce murder to manslaughter (mitigation fairly being an issue in the case).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">E. <em>Erroneous Allocation of the Burden of Persuasion as to Justification or Excuse (Either Being An Issue in the Case) Where the Conviction is for Felonious Homicide in Any Degree</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">The erroneous jury instructions (now that we have the benefit of hindsight per <em>Mullaney v. </em>Wilbur) strewn throughout our Maryland experience have sometimes taken the form, \u201cIn the absence of justification or excuse, all intentional homicide will be presumed to have been with malice,\u201d or its equivalent, \u201cAll intentional and unlawful [thereby excluding justifiable and excusable] homicide will be presumed to be with malice.\u201d In these qualified forms, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>the error has been limited to the now unconstitutional presumption of non-mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Frequently, however, the erroneous instructions were not even thus partially qualified and took the broader form, \u201cAll intentional homicide will be presumed to be with malice.\u201d In this totally unqualified form, the homicide is unconstitutionally presumed to be non-justified and non-excused as well as non-mitigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">If a fair reading of the instructions indicates that the \u201cpresumption of malice,\u201d in that broader and unqualified form, operated to relieve the State of its burden of ultimate persuasion on the issue of non-justification and/or non-excuse (where either is a fair issue in the case), <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>will require a reversal regardless of the degree of felonious homicide on which the conviction was had. Unlike the situation dealt with where the only issue in the case affected by the presumption was mitigation and the only advantage the defendant was denied was the possible lowering of murder in the second degree to manslaughter, the harm on the issues of presumed non-justification and presumed non-excuse operates across the entire spectrum of culpability. If the defendant had had the benefit of a fair allocation of the burden of persuasion on these issues, he might well have been found not guilty totally and not simply guilty to a lesser degree. Self-defense, for example, would relieve one of guilt for a premeditated and deliberated killing as well as for a killing in hot blood.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Similarly, a verdict rendered in a court trial of guilt for any degree of felonious homicide will bear scrutiny under <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>if the judge, in the course of rendering his decision, indicated that he relied in any way upon the now unconstitutional presumption of malice or that he in any way placed upon the defendant the burden of proving such justification or such excuse as would render him not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>guilty (justification or excuse fairly being an issue in the case).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">F. <em>Erroneous Allocation of the Burden of Persuasion as to Justification, Excuse or Mitigation Where None Is a Fair Issue in the Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">As boiler-plate instructions have been handed down from judicial generation to judicial generation and solemnly intoned whether they have any bearing on the case then at bar or not,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> there have been frequent occasions when erroneous jury instructions have been given but where the error has no conceivable relevance to any issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">As will be discussed more fully in Part IIH <em>infra, </em>before it can be said that there is in a case a legitimate jury issue on the question of justification, excuse or mitigation, there must be evidence sufficient to generate the issue. That evidence may be, but need not be produced by the defendant. It may be found in the State\u2019s own evidence. But whatever its source, unless there is evidence sufficient to generate a fair jury question (or to generate the issue in like manner in a court trial), there is no requirement that instructions in these regards even be given. Indeed, they are inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Instructive in this regard is 40 Am.Jur.2d <em>Homicide </em>\u00a7 485, \u201cConfining instructions to evidence,\u201d pp. 737-738:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">\u201cIt is elementary that instructions to the jury in relation to matters not put in issue by the proof adduced are unnecessary, and requests therefor are properly refused.

The court is not bound, and should not be bound, to instruct the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>respecting the abstract rules of the law of homicide, but only respecting the principles applicable to the evidence of killing in the case at bar, although the giving of an abstract instruction is a cause for reversal only when it is reasonably apparent that the jury has been misled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">Even though the malice engendered in the heart of the defendant must have been without legal justification or excuse in order that he be found guilty of murder in the first or second degree, yet where there is no evidence tending to show such justification or excuse, the court is not called upon to cover that matter in the instructions. It is held that in a homicide case in which there is no evidence raising or tending to prove the issue, the court need not instruct the jury on questions of self-defense, or of the insanity or intoxication of, the accused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">And see <em>Braunie v.

When any consideration of an issue by the fact finder (court or jury) would properly be totally foreclosed, the defendant cannot complain that the issue was submitted under an unduly heavy burden upon him, since he has, even in that event, received more than he deserved. To carry an undue burden of persuasion may be a critical handicap to one legitimately in a race; it is no handicap at all when one is not entitled to run in the race.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The general law is well stated at 5 Am. Jur.2d <em>Appeal and Error </em>\u00a7 811, \u201cFacts in issue; materiality,\u201d p. 253: \u201c[A]ny errors in instructions which are expressly confined to issues . . . which are immaterial, or on facts not in issue . . . are generally harmless.\u201d In <em>Street v. State, supra, </em>the jury was instructed that the defendant had the burden of proving self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The Court went further and actually directed a verdict against the defendant on this subject. With respect to the innocuousness of even an erroneous instruction on an issue not fairly in the case, we said, at 26 Md. App. 340-341:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">\u201cIt is clear the appellant in this case was not entitled to have the issue of self-defense considered by the jury.

State, </em>234 Md. 459, 199 A. 2d 807. A jury had there been charged that the ultimate burden of persuasion was upon a defendant to prove his insanity by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>preponderance of the evidence.

Wilbur </em>and <em>Winshi/p </em>upon the future. Some of our law is squarely unconstitutional. Much of it is questionable but salvageable, if only an antiquated and treacherously ambiguous vocabulary could be trimmed away from it. One thing is clear: it needs to be resurveyed in light of <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">A. <em>The Mullaney v. Wilbur Decision Itself</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">The immediate issue before the Supreme Court was the requirement that a defendant charged with felonious homicide in Maine \u201cprove that he acted \u2018in the heat of passion on sudden provocation\u2019 in order to reduce the homicide to manslaughter.\u201d 44 L.Ed.2d at 511. The Supreme Court was called upon to decide whether that requirement of Maine law comported \u201cwith the due process requirement, as defined in <em>In re Winship . . . </em>that the prosecution prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt every fact necessary to constitute the crime <em>charged.\u201dIbid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The evidence was undisputed that Wilbur had fatally assaulted one Claude Hebert in the latter\u2019s hotel room. There were no witnesses to the crime other than Wilbur himself, who did not take the stand at his trial. Introduced against him was his confession acknowledging his homicidal agency. In the course of that confession, however, Wilbur had claimed \u201cthat he had attacked Hebert in a frenzy provoked by Hebert\u2019s homosexual advance.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The alternative theory of the defense (the theory which was ultimately pertinent) was that \u201cat most the homicide was manslaughter rather than murder, since it occurred in the heat of passion provoked by the homosexual assault.\u201d Pp. 511-512.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The Maine law on homicide, under review by the Supreme Court, bore remarkable similarity to the Maryland law on that subject.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As summarized by the Supreme Court, Maine recognized that certain elements are common to all felonious homicide \u2014 both murder and manslaughter. Those elements are that the homicide 1) be unlawful, that is, that it be neither justifiable nor excusable, and 2) be intentional. The State is required to prove these elements beyond a reasonable doubt. Only upon proof of them would a Maine trial court go on to consider the further distinction between murder and manslaughter. It did go on to consider that further distinction in the trial of Wilbur.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">In language ominously familiar to Maryland ears, the Maine court defined murder and manslaughter. It pointed out that \u201cWhoever unlawfully kills a human being with malice aforethought, either express or implied, is guilty of murder. ..\u201d P. 512, n. 3. It further pointed out that \u201cWhoever unlawfully kills a human being in the heat of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>passion, on sudden provocation, without express or implied malice aforethought [is guilty of manslaughter] . . .\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Maine trial court further charged that \u201c \u2018malice aforethought is an essential and indispensable element of the crime of murder\u2019 . . . without which the homicide would be manslaughter.\u201d P. 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The Maine trial court then moved on to the constitutionally significant nub of the instruction. As found by the Supreme Court, it told the jury that \u201cif the prosecution established that the homicide was both intentional and unlawful, malice aforethought was to be conclusively implied unless the defendant proved by a fair preponderance of the evidence that he acted in the heat of passion on sudden provocation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The trial court pointed out that \u201cmalice aforethought and heat of passion on sudden provocation are inconsistent things\u201d and that \u201cby proving the latter the defendant would negate the former and reduce the homicide from murder to manslaughter.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court then defined \u201cheat of passion\u201d and \u201csudden provocation\u201d in constitutionally inoffensive terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Wilbur was convicted of murder and predicated his appeal, first to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court and then to the Supreme Court of the United States,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> upon the proposition that \u201che had been denied due process because he was required to negate the element of malice aforethought by proving that he had acted in the heat of passion on sudden provocation.\u201d p. <em>513. </em>He claimed that by allowing the jury to presume non-mitigation \u2014 the sole element of \u201cmalice\u201d distinguishing murder from manslaughter \u2014 the prosecution had been relieved of its burden under Wins hip \u201cto prove the existence of that element beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The Supreme Court cleanly isolated the issue before it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">\u201cThe Maine law of homicide, as it bears on this case, can be stated succinctly: Absent justification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>or excuse, all intentional or criminally reckless killings are felonious homicides. Felonious homicide is punished as murder . . . unless the defendant proves by a fair preponderance of the evidence that it was committed in the heat of passion on sudden provocation, in which case it is punished as manslaughter. . . . The issue is whether the Maine rule requiring the defendant to prove that he acted in the heat of passion on sudden provocation accords with due process.\u201d 44 L.Ed.2d at 515.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>decision went on to trace and to analyze incisively the development of the common law of felonious homicide, the splitting of that crime into the separate crimes of murder and manslaughter, and the procedural devices that emerged to move culpability upward or downward between the two. It reaffirmed the undergirding tenet of <em>In re Winship </em>that the prosecution must, under the Due Process Clause, prove .beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element necessary to establish guilt and/or necessary to enhance punishment. The ultimate holding of the Court, as applied to the Maine conviction before it, was clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">\u201cMaine law requires a defendant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he acted in the heat of passion on sudden provocation in order to reduce murder to manslaughter. Under, this burden of proof a defendant can be given a life sentence when the evidence indicates that it is <em>as likely as not </em>that he deserves a significantly lesser sentence. This is an intolerable result in a society where, to paraphrase Mr. Justice Harlan, it is far worse to sentence one guilty only of manslaughter as a murderer than to sentence a murderer for the lesser crime of manslaughter. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S., at 372 (concurring opinion). We therefore hold that the Due Process Clause requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of the heat of passion \u00f3n sudden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>provocation when the issue is properly presented in a homicide case.\u201d 44 L.Ed.2d at 522.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">B. <em>A Reader\u2019s Guide to Mullaney v. Wilbur</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Although a very narrow reading of <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>could conclude that it dealt only with instructions, in a jury trial, on the subject of the allocation of the burden of proof on the question of \u201cheat of passion on sudden provocation\u201d in a case where the issue before the jury was whether a guilty verdict should be for murder or only for manslaughter, such would be a grudging and unduly restrictive reading of this groundbreaking decision. A fairer reading makes it clear that what is involved is the broader question of the allocation of the burden of persuasion where a wrongful allocation of that burden will operate to relieve the State of its obligation under the Due Process Clause, as interpreted by <em>Winship, </em>to prove each and every element of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt. This goes beyond the limited defense of mitigation and it goes beyond the limited confines of jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Particularly in reaching out for the broader import, a mere surface reading will not suffice. In writing for the Court, Justice Powell, as is his wont, produced a thoroughly researched and well-crafted opinion. His analysis is articulate and his logic is impeccable. Notwithstanding these qualities, the opinion stands for far more than it can say \u2014 it is but the tip of an iceberg above the waterline. Justice Powell refers in his footnotes to a qualitatively and quantitatively rich reservoir of superb source materials.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Some of these are deep and intellectually groundbreaking academic efforts which mark analytical breakthroughs in our understanding of the law \u2014 particularly in the troubled field of presumptions and their collision with the Due Process Clause. Although they can be little more than alluded to in an opinion that stops short of book-length, a reading of them makes it apparent that they animate and undergird all that appears on the surface of the <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>opinion itself. For a thorough appreciation of <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>and its unmistakable import for the future, it is indispensable to read and to digest the underlying sources that breathe through its every pore.</p>\n<p id=\"A89\">C. <em>The Common Law\u2019s Tower of Babel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">In looking to the impact of <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>and <em>Winship </em>upon Maryland\u2019s homicide law, one fixed star of reference must be kept constantly in mind. These cases are concerned exclusively with due process, the modality or process by which we do certain things in the criminal law. They are concerned with the criminal law\u2019s procedures and not with its substance. It is, therefore, not the definitions or elements of our various grades of felonious homicide that require scrutiny under <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>and <em>Winship, </em>but rather our mechanical, evidentiary and procedural devices. The ultimate concern here is not with what we do but with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>how we do it. We will look then to our procedural devices and to the subversion of those devices over the decades by a shifting and unreliable vocabulary.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Unlike simpler crimes with a single <em>mens rea, </em>felonious homicide has over the centuries developed a broad spectrum of more or less blameworthy mental states. To move backward and forward along that continuum between the least culpable and the most culpable ends of the band, the common law invented a series of procedural devices \u2014 presumptions (true and so-called), inferences and burdens of proof (both of going forward with the evidence and of ultimate persuasion). The devices, which might have had great utility if carefully employed, have produced instead a juridical madhouse \u2014 a linguistic hall of mirrors where meaning and direction are endlessly shifting \u2014 primarily because different devices with different functions have been cursed with the same name.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">A journey through the case law in search of clear and consistent meaning can only be described as Kafkaesque. Where terms such as \u201cmalice implied,\u201d \u201cmalice presumed\u201d and \u201cmalice inferred\u201d are employed with phantasmagoric interchangeability, the case law is a semanticist\u2019s nightmare. It is as if the word \u201cknife\u201d could connote either a surgeon\u2019s scalpel or a butcher\u2019s ax. Court A describes a delicate operation using a \u201cknife\u201d (meaning thereby a surgeon\u2019s scalpel). Court B attempts meticulously to follow the teaching of Court A but is doomed to inevitable disaster because the word \u201cknife\u201d means to it, a butcher\u2019s ax.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The analogy is not farfetched. In our procedural vocabulary, two words or phrases are particularly contagious spreaders of confusion \u2014 \u201cburden of proof\u201d and \u201cpresumption\u201d. \u201cBurden of proof\u201d connotes two very different things:</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">1) <em>the burden of ultimate persuasion (the risk of nonpersuasion); and</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">2) <em>the burden of producing some evidence (the risk of dismissal and/or the risk of not getting an issue before the jury).</em></p>\n<p id=\"An_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>All too frequently, the phrase is employed in both jury instructions and in our case law without a clear differentiation as to which meaning is attached to the phrase on a particular occasion. All too frequently, it appears that the user was not even aware of the distinction. When the user (opinion writer or jury instructor) is not even aware of the ambiguity, the recipient of the message (the opinion reader or the jury) cannot possibly receive a clear and unambiguous message.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The culprit \u201cpresumption\u201d is even more protean in its myriad manifestations. It connotes five very different things:</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">1) <em>a mere statement as to who has and what is the burden of persuasion (e.g., the \u201cpresumption of </em>innocence\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>);</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>2) <em>a rule of substantive law (a conclusive presumption </em><footnotemark>14</footnotemark>);</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">3) <em>a permitted inference of fact (e.g., the so-called \u201cpresumption\u201d that the possessor of recently stolen goods is the thief)-,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">4) <em>a presumption of law, or true presumption, in the Morgan tradition of shifting the burden of ultimate persuasion and entailing either a directed verdict or a jury instruction-, </em>and</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">5) <em>a presumption of law, or true presumption, in the Thayer- Wigmore tradition of something which shifts only the burden of going forward with evidence and which totally dissipates or disappears from the case once that burden is met (the \u201cbursting bubble\u201dconcept).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">All too frequently, no differentiation is made as to which of these five distinct meanings is attached to the word \u201cpresumption\u201d on a particular occasion. When the same word or phrase means one thing to the writer or speaker and something quite different to the reader or hearer, communicative chaos is inevitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">This treacherous procedural vocabulary has been superimposed upon an equally treacherous definitional vocabulary, which describes the elements of the various degrees of blameworthiness in now anachronistic terms which have, over the centuries, lost their original meaning and become terms of art totally divorced from common usage. The prime culprit, in this regard, is \u201cmalice.\u201d It is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>a single notion but an \u201cumbrella term\u201d encompassing three distinct aspects. It connotes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">1) <em>that the act which produces the homicide be intentional;</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">2) <em>that the act be without justification or excuse;. </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-8\">3) <em>that the act be unmitigated.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">The root problem is that we use the undifferentiated \u201cumbrella term\u201d when we are sometimes referring only to one of its three aspects. Certain procedural devices which are constitutionally appropriate in establishing one aspect of \u201cmalice\u201d happen to be unconstitutional with respect to the establishment of other aspects of \u201cmalice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">The heart of the problem is the far-from-consistent interaction of the two meanings and functions of \u201cburden of proof\u201d and the five meanings and functions of \u201cpresumption\u201d with the three aspects of \u201cmalice.\u201d This haphazard interaction has produced some results which must now be recognized as unconstitutional and many other results which are chaotic even short of being unconstitutional. <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>has not created the problem; it has simply spotlighted the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">We must cull out our procedures which are unconstitutional. In the process, we should also identify the linguistic baggage which is now totally outdated, serves no present purpose, only encumbers us by its presence and ought to be forthwith discarded. The season is at hand for a systematic linguistic housecleaning. Although one could program a survey of our homicide law by tracing its historical development or, alternatively, by proceeding through it from its most culpable degree through its least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>culpable degree, the most appropriate route of survey will probably be, in light of <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur\u2019s </em>concern with procedural devices, an examination of the various employments of that Hydra-headed monster: \u201cPresumption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">D. <em>Head One of the Hydra: A Mere Statement as to the Burden of Proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Remarkably, the jury instructions on homicide which come before us for review frequently contain the sentence, \u201cAll murder will be presumed to be murder in the second degree.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It is as likely as not that such a sentence is simply a slip of the tongue and that what was intended was some other sentence such as, \u201cAll felonious homicide will be presumed to be murder in the second degree,\u201d or, even more broadly, \u201cAll homicide will be presumed to be murder in the second degree.\u201d With the speaker\u2019s attention being drawn to the predicate of the sentence, \u201c. . . will be presumed to be murder in the second degree,\u201d there may well have been careless indifference to whether the subject of the sentence was \u201cMurder,\u201d \u201cFelonious homicide,\u201d or \u201cHomicide.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Assuming, however, that the sentence is sometimes literally intended, it is constitutionally unoffending.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Such a statement is, of course, no presumption at all. It is simply a circuitous and roundabout way of saying that the burden is upon the State of proving beyond a reasonable doubt all elements that go to make up murder in the first degree. As a purely redundant restatement of a burden already naturally upon the State, it is a statement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>behaves exactly like the statement having to do with \u201cthe presumption of innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">There are good reasons, however, for studiously avoiding any such statement as, \u201cAll murder will be presumed to be murder in the second degree.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is, in the first place, a very roundabout and indirect way of saying something about the burden of proof which could be said much more simply and directly. In the second place, it has the potential for generating confusion in two regards. Although a merely innocuous statement about, \u201cAll murder being presumed . . .,\u201d it may too easily be misunderstood to be a statement about, \u201cAll felonious homicide being presumed . . .\u201d or \u201cAll homicide being presumed . . .\u201d In the second place, the misuse of the word \u201cpresumed\u201d has its own potential for confusing, since this is not a case where anything is \u201cpresumed.\u201d Although less than unconstitutional, the statement ought to be avoided at all costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">We would, however, make it absolutely clear that our criticism with existing practice in this regard is only with the misuse of the word \u201cpresumption\u201d and not with the proper emphasis placed by such instructions upon the heavy burden of the State to prove the special elements of first-degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt. A defendant continues to be entitled to a jury instruction emphasizing the undisputed legal truth that mere proof even of <em>murder </em>will not give rise to an automatic permissible inference of deliberation or premeditation. If the jury is in a state of doubt or equipoise as to the establishment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>aggravating elements, the defendant is entitled to an assumption that the murder is only in the second degree. The jury should be told that the burden is upon the State of proving every aggravating element beyond a reasonable doubt and that in the absence of such proof by such a standard, guilt must be assumed to be only at the lower level.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Our only point in this regard is that the vocabulary is rich enough to find words to describe this heavy burden upon the State without resorting to a misuse of that procedural word of art \u201cpresume,\u201d which, to avoid future confusion, should be restricted to its technically proper role of describing a <em>shifting </em>of a burden. <em>The burden </em>to prove murder in the first degree <em>begins </em>with the State <em>and </em>always <em>remains </em>upon the State; it never <em>shifts. A </em>defendant will continue, therefore, to be entitled to the \u201cassumption\u201d that all <em>murder </em>is only murder in the second degree. That perfectly valid \u201cassumption,\u201d however, should not be misnamed a \u201cpresumption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">E. <em>Head Two of the Hydra: A Statement of Substantive Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\"><em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>does not affect any of our rules of substantive law \u2014 only our procedures. The pitfall of possibly overapplying <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>is lurking in our path, however, because some of what are now substantive rules began their careers as legitimate procedural devices or as seemingly necessary legal fictions and only slowly hardened into conclusive presumptions (or rules of substantive law) over the centuries. Some other present substantive laws give the deceptive appearance of having traveled that evolutionary route. Three situations which now involve solid substantive law, and are not remotely procedural in nature, merit discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">\n<em>1. The Less Common Forms of First-Degree Murder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">By the clear direction of Maryland statute, murder in the first degree is, by definition, any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-10\">a. All murder which shall be perpetrated by means of poison (Art. 27, \u00a7 407);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>b. All murder which shall be perpetrated after lying in wait (\u00a7 407);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">c. Any kind of wilful, deliberate and premeditated murder (\u00a7 407);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">d. All murder committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any arson (\u00a7 408);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">e. All murder committed in the burning or attempted burning of any barn, tobacco house, stable, warehouse or other outhouse having therein any tobacco, hay, grain, horses, cattle, goods, wares or merchandise (\u00a7 409);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">f. All murder committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any rape, sodomy, mayhem, robbery, burglary, kidnapping, storehouse breaking, daytime housebreaking or escape (\u00a7 410).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">The difficulty is that of all of the forms of first-degree murder listed above, one of them \u2014 c.: \u201cwilful, deliberate and premeditated killing\u201d \u2014 has quantitatively so dominated the literature and the case law as to be taken for the norm, if not indeed for the universal statement of the offense. Our law, therefore, frequently makes statements that apply to that one form of first-degree murder alone but does so in unqualified and overly broad terms that seem to be universal truths rather than statements of simply limited utility. It is not unusual to find in our case law such seemingly universal statements as \u201c. . . in order for the State to elevate the crime to first degree murder it must show that the killing was wilful, deliberate, and premeditated.\u201d <em>Wilson v. State, </em>261 Md. 551, 563, 276 A. 2d 214. In the factual context of its own case, the statement (and numberless ones like it) was unquestionably correct. The danger of its unqualified language, however, is that it is leading the overly zealous <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>addicts into the ready trap of looking upon all other varieties of first-degree murder as constitutionally suspect shortcuts to a finding of \u201cwilfulness, deliberation and premeditation.\u201d They read into certain felony-murder convictions, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>instance, an unconstitutional relieving of the State of some postulated burden, under the Due Process Clause, of proving the special <em>mens rea </em>spelled out in the latter part of \u00a7 407. There is, of course, no such proof required.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">What are now \u00a7\u00a7 407-410 were taken directly from \u00a7 III of Chapter 138 of the Acts of 1809, which for the first time separated murder in Maryland into degrees.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> That act did not create a new crime but simply divided murder into two degrees for punishment purposes, leaving the common law definition of the crime of murder undisturbed. <em>Davis v. State, </em>39 Md. 355. The desirability of some form of codification was twofold. That same Chapter 138 of the Acts of 1809 had, in \u00a7 XI thereof, abolished benefit of clergy in Maryland. Theretofore, the more aggravated forms of murder had been non-clergyable, that is, capital. The less aggravated forms of murder were clergyable, that is, non-capital. With the abolition of the ameliorating device known as benefit of clergy, all murder would have become capital. The effect of \u00a7 III of the Acts of 1809 separating murder into categories was to give us, in the form of the categories of first-degree murder and second-degree murder, the functional equivalents of the former categories \u201cnon-clergyable\u201d and \u201cclergyable,\u201d respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">To the extent to which certain of the less aggravated forms of murder were non-clergyable (and, thereby, capital) prior to the Acts of 1809, a second moving force was at work in Maryland. Pennsylvania had by its Act of 1794 moved to mitigate \u201cthe rigor of the common law by dividing murder into degrees,\u201d Moreland, <em>Law of Homicide </em>(1952), at 199-200. This reform movement spread from Pennsylvania to seven other states, including Maryland. Moreland, <em>op.cit., </em>at 204-205; Note, <em>The Developing Law of Intentional Murder in Maryland, </em>13 Md.L.Rev. 327 (1953). What is now \u00a7 407 of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>law was taken virtually verbatim from the Pennsylvania Act of 1794.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">In spelling out the crimes which, because of \u201cthe degree of their atrociousness,\u201d would be first degree and, therefore, capital (the formerly non-clergyable category), \u00a7 III gave us what has been our law ever since:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">\u201cAND, whereas the several offences which are included under the general denomination of murder, differ so greatly from each other in the degree of their atrociousness, that it is unjust to involve them in the same punishment, therefore, BE IT ENACTED, That all murder which shall be perpetrated by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any kind of wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing, or which shall be committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any arson, or to burn any barn, tobacco-house, stable, warehouse, or other out-house, not parcel of any dwelling-house, having therein any tobacco, grain, hay, horses, cattle, or goods, wares and merchandize, rape, sodomy, mayhem, robbery or burglary, shall be deemed murder of the first degree; and all other kind of murder shall be deemed murder of the second degree. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">The other forms of first-degree murder, albeit perhaps less common, are not mere pale reflections of wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing. They stand upon their own feet as self-sufficient definitions of murder in the first degree. Their own sets of circumstances do not constitute first-degree murder because wilfulness, deliberation and premeditation may somehow be inferred, presumed or implied, but because such wilfulness, deliberation and premeditation are irrelevant considerations and are flatly superfluous. A poisoning, for example, could be sudden and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>spontaneous rather than deliberate and premeditated, and yet constitute murder in the first degree. Although it is difficult to hypothesize, a killing by lying in wait need not, of necessity, be deliberate and premeditated in order to constitute murder in the first degree.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In most of these other forms of first-degree murder, it is the particular <em>actus reus,</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the dreaded modality or means of the murder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>which we have singled out for our gravest criminal sanction and not a particular <em>mens rea. </em>In the various felony-murders listed in \u00a7\u00a7 408, 409 and 410,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> no intent to kill is even necessary, let alone a deliberated and premeditated intent. <em>Lynch v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 441, 265 A. 2d 283; <em>Wiggins v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 598, 261 A. 2d 503; <em>Parker v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 167, 254 A. 2d 381.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">These other varieties of first-degree murder are separate and equal combinations of circumstances invoking our highest penalty and not simply means of establishing wilfulness, deliberation and premeditation. They have rather been designated by statute as independently self-sufficient conditions to constitute murder in the first degree. They are, therefore, not remotely affected by anything in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">\n<em>2. The Doctrine of Transferred Intent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">There is a second rule of substantive law which is totally unaffected by anything in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>but which may, at first glance, appear to be vulnerable simply because the word \u201ctransferred\u201d seems to indicate that some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>procedural device is at work. This is the doctrine of transferred intent. This ancient rule of the common law that if A, with requisite malice, aims a deadly weapon at B, misses B and hits C (an unintended victim), the killing of C will nonetheless constitute murder, is now firmly established as part of the common law of Maryland. <em>Gladden v. State, </em>273 Md. 383, 330 A. 2d 176, <em>aff'g </em>20 Md. App. 492, 316 A. 2d 319. In earlier evolutionary stages, a legal fiction or a procedural device may have been at work. It is now clearly recognized, however, that what is involved is simply a rule of substantive law that the <em>mens rea </em>of murder as to anyone coupled with the <em>actus reus </em>of a homicide is sufficient to constitute the crime of murder. As long as the <em>mens rea </em>and the <em>actus reus </em>correspond in time, there is no requirement that the <em>mens rea </em>be directed specifically at the actual victim. The modern and better explanations of the doctrine point out the inappropriateness of the word \u201ctransferred\u201d in the earlier case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>(2d Ed. 1969) makes it plain that to speak of \u201ctransferring the malice\u201d was simply \u201cto offer an unsound explanation ... to support a very sound conclusion,\u201d saying at 826:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">\u201cIf, without justification, excuse or mitigation, D with intent to kill A fires a shot which misses A but unexpectedly causes the death of B, D is guilty of murder. To speak of transferring the malice from A to B is merely to offer an unsound explanation (carried over from the law of torts) to support a very sound conclusion. The proper explanation is that D is guilty of murder in such a case because all elements of the offense are present, with mention if it seems necessary of the fact that as a crime the wrong was committed against the state. An intent to commit homicide without justification, excuse or mitigation, is malice aforethought; D had such an intent and therefore had malice aforethought; an act done by D with this malice aforethought caused the death of another \u2014 and hence D has committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>homicide with malice aforethought, which is murder by definition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">To a similar effect is LaFave and Scott, <em>Criminal Law </em>(1972), at 253, pointing out that the right result is reached but that the earlier \u201csort of reasoning is, of course, pure fiction\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">\u201cThese proper conclusions of law as to criminal liability in the bad-aim situation are sometimes said to rest upon the ground of \u2018transferred intent\u2019: To be guilty of a crime involving a harmful result to <em>C, A </em>must intend to do harm to C; but A\u2019s intent to harm <em>B </em>will be transferred to <em>C; </em>thus <em>A </em>actually did intend to harm <em>C; </em>so he is guilty of the crime against <em>C. </em>This sort of reasoning is, of course, pure fiction. <em>A </em>never really intended to harm <em>C; </em>but it is not necessary, in order to impose criminal liability upon <em>A, </em>to pretend that he did. What is really meant, by this round-about method of explanation, is that when one person (A) acts (or omits to act) with intent to harm another person (B), but because of a bad aim he harms a third person (C) whom he did not intend to harm, the law considers him (as it ought) just as guilty as if he had actually harmed the intended victim. In other words, criminal homicide, battery, arson and malicious mischief do not require that the defendant cause harm to the intended victim; an unintended victim will do just as well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">The very thorough and scholarly opinion of Judge O\u2019Donnell in <em>Gladden v. State, supra, </em>brought Maryland squarely into line not simply with the proper result but also with the more modern and more accurate explanation of that result, reasoning at 273 Md. 403-404:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">\u201cSince murder is homicide committed with malice aforethought petitioner\u2019s argument would necessitate the engrafting of an ingredient that such homicide must be committed \u2018with malice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>aforethought <em>against the deceased\u2019 </em>\u2014 an element never required under the common law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">Put another way, \u2018if one intends injury to the person of another under circumstances in which such a mental element constitutes <em>mens rea, </em>and in the effort to accomplish this end he inflicts harm upon a person other than the one intended, he is guilty of the same kind of crime as if his aim had been more accurate.\u2019 In such cases all the components of the crime are present. The psychical element which consists of a certain general mental pattern is not varied by the particular person who may be actually harmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Thus, as a purely substantive rule of law (despite its somewhat suspect name), the doctrine of transferred intent is not affected by anything in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">\n<em>S. The Labyrinth of Implied Malice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">There is a third body of law which is today clearly substantive but which, just as clearly, during earlier stages of its evolution went through the process of being a series of inferences and/or rebuttable presumptions slowly hardening into conclusive presumptions (or rules of substantive law) over the course of several centuries. This body of law deals with those several mental states constituting the <em>mens rea </em>of murder which we have grouped under the general label of \u201cimplied malice.\u201d To understand what is now meant by \u201cimplied malice,\u201d one must understand something of the development of the requirement of a particular mental state for a conviction for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">a. <em>The Mental State Generally</em></p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">Felonious homicide at the early common law, tracing from earlier Norman and Saxon antecedents to that common law, did not look to the question of intent but imposed virtually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>an absolute criminal liability for the killing of a human being.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> By the middle of the 13th century, however, under the combined influence of Roman law (largely through the writings of Bracton), \u201cwhich stressed the psychical element in criminal liability by emphasizing <em>dolus </em>and culpa,\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and canon law, \u201cwith its persistent and relentless accent upon moral guilt,\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the phrase <em>\u201cmens rea\u201d </em>began to take on significance in terms of ultimate criminal responsibility. The phrase <em>\u201cmens rea\u201d </em>had first appeared early in the 12th century <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> but grew in significance during the 13th.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">During that 13th century, various mental states began to take on significance as they bore upon the question of moral blameworthiness. The earliest agency of amelioration in cases of the less blameworthy homicides was not an acquittal but rather a royal pardon as a matter of course. Already by the early 13th century, one who killed by misadventure or in self-defense or was a lunatic or an infant of tender years, while still technically guilty of homicide, was deemed deserving of a royal pardon, which pardons were consistently and regularly granted.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> By the 14th century, homicide fell into four categories:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">\u201c(1) justifiable homicide, a killing in pursuit of justice, which entitled the accused to an acquittal; (2) homicide committed through misadventure or in self-defense or by a lunatic or a child of tender years, in which cases pardons were consistently given; (3) murder,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> indistinctly characterized as \u2018the worst kind of homicide,\u2019 punishable by death; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>and (4) all other homicides, each of which was a felony and a capital offense.\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">For both of the culpable categories where the royal pardon was not available as a matter of course (3 and 4 above), benefit of clergy came to apply as a device which was in effect a commutation of capital punishment for all who could claim to read and write. Because of the feeling, however, that the law had become too soft on major offenders, a series of statutes at the end of the 15th and the beginning of the 16th centuries <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> removed the benefit of clergy from murder with \u201cmalice prepensed.\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The term \u201cmurder\u201d thenceforth was limited to this more blameworthy form of homicide with malice aforethought, for which benefit of clergy was no longer available and which was thereby capital. The lesser felonious homicide without malice aforethought, for which benefit of clergy was still available,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> later came to be called manslaughter.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Thus, between 1496 and 1547 \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d came to be the criterion by which three distinct discriminations were made. With little significant change in function, these are the three aspects of blameworthiness which the word \u201cmalice\u201d still connotes today. In the first place, the presence of malice aforethought separated non-clergyable and thereby capital murder from justifiable homicide (homicide which is either authorized or commanded by law), which entitled the accused to a complete acquittal. In the second place, the presence of malice aforethought separated non-clergyable and thereby capital murder from excusable homicide, which entitled one to a royal pardon as a matter of course (although not an acquittal). In the third place, the presence of malice aforethought separated non-clergyable and thereby capital murder from the less blameworthy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>clergyable felonious homicide, which gradually evolved into the felony of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">These are essentially still the three aspects of \u201cmalice\u201d and the three functions performed by those aspects. \u201cMalice\u201d today requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">1) that the act which produces the homicide be intentional (thereby excluding a purely accidental, to wit excusable, homicide per misadventure);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">2) that the act be without justification or excuse (thereby excluding justifiable and other excusable homicides, both of which today would entitle the accused to an acquittal); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">3) that the act be unmitigated (thereby excluding the mitigated or extenuated, albeit still felonious, homicide which is punished simply as manslaughter).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">b. <em>Non-Malicious \u201cMalice\u201d and Non-Premeditated \u201cAforethought\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">Over the centuries since 1547, malice aforethought has lost a great deal of its original meaning but has also taken on a great deal of new meaning. We will look first to the semantic erosion and then to the semantic growth.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">It is a source of inevitable jury confusion that \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d today is neither \u201cmalicious\u201d nor \u201cthought of beforehand.\u201d It has, of course, become a commonplace to lawyers that \u201cmalice\u201d connotes nothing which would strike a layman as \u201cmalicious.\u201d It has come to mean simply an intention to commit a criminal act with no hatred or ill-will required. As Holmes noted in his <em>Common Law </em>(1881), at 53:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-12\">\u201cIt is just as much murder to shoot a sentry for the purpose of releasing a friend, as to shoot him because you hate him. Malice, in the definition of murder, has not the same meaning as in common speech, and, in view of the considerations just men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>tioned, it has been thought to mean criminal intention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">. . . [A] newly born child is laid naked out of doors, where it must perish as a matter of course. This is none the less murder, that the guilty party would have been very glad to have a stranger find the child and save it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Equally to the point is Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>(2d Ed. 1969), at 35:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">\u201cIn ordinary conversation the word \u2018malice\u2019 conveys some notion of hatred, grudge, ill-will, or spite, but no such idea is incorporated in the legal concept of \u2018malice aforethought.\u2019 . . . this crime may be perpetrated without the slightest trace of personal ill-will. Illustrations include the case of a mother who kills her illegitimate offspring to hide her own disgrace, feeling at the time no hatred toward it or any other person and even having the yearnings of a mother\u2019s love toward the innocent victim \u2014 \u2018loving its life just less than her own reputation.\u2019 There may be added the case of the husband who killed his wife at her request, because his love was too great to permit the continuance of her suffering from a hopeless disease. Even such extreme cases as these have been held to fill every requirement of malice aforethought. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">A similar erosion took place with respect to the word \u201caforethought.\u201d In its pristine state, it connoted that the intention to kill had existed some appreciable time before the actual execution of the deed. It connoted the same thing by way of preplanning that premeditation connoted early in the 19th century (when it entered the law as an attempt to rejuvenate the earlier meaning of \u201caforethought\u201d) and significantly more by way of preplanning than premeditation connotes today (premeditation having in the meantime suffered a semantic erosion of its own). The word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>\u201caforethought\u201d today is devoid not simply of an ordinary, layman\u2019s meaning but of any meaning at all, even as a term of art. As is pointed out by Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>(2d Ed. 1969), at 34-35:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">\u201cUndoubtedly the word \u2018aforethought\u2019 was added to \u2018malice\u2019 in the ancient cases to indicate a design thought out well in advance of the fatal act. But as case after case came before the courts for determination, involving killings under a great variety of circumstances, there came to be less and less emphasis upon the notion of a well-laid plan. And at the present day the only requirement in this regard is that it must not be an <em>afterthought. </em>\u2018Killing with malice\u2019 is sufficient of itself to negative any possible notion of an afterthought, and apart from the historical background the word \u2018aforethought\u2019 would not be needed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">To the same effect is Purver, <em>The Language of Murder, </em>14 U.C.L.A.L.Rev. 1306, 1309 (1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">\u201cJust as the word \u2018malice\u2019 confuses and misleads, the word \u2018aforethought\u2019 likewise muddles thinking:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">\u2018The fact that malice aforethought means merely that malice must exist at the same time as the act, in effect makes \u2018aforethought\u2019 meaningless surplusage, since the requirement is satisfied by the presence of malice or \u2018concurrent\u2019 malice rather than an antecedent malice. The unimportant character of the adjective \u2018aforethought\u2019 is seen in the fact that in many opinions \u2018malice\u2019 and \u2018malice aforethought\u2019 are used interchangeably and that in many, \u2018aforethought\u2019 is itself omitted.\u2019 [Quoting from 1 Wharton, <em>Criminal Law and Procedure </em>\u00a7 243, at 527 (Anderson Ed. 1957)]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-10\">Since today \u2018aforethought\u2019 may be \u2018as instantaneous as successive thoughts of the mind\u2019 or \u2018on the spur of the moment,\u2019 the word no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>serves its original function of drawing attention to the duration of the deliberation to kill as the criterion for distinguishing murder from other homicides.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The use of the now anachronistic language still haunts us, however. As Purver further points out, at 1306:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">\u201cPrecision in the use of legal language is essential, particularly in the law of homicide. In a murder trial the use of a word or turn of a phrase may mark the difference between whether the accused leaves the courtroom free \u2014 or sentenced to death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">Yet the phrase \u2018malice aforethought,\u2019 used in defining murder, peers at us like a demon through the dust of more than four hundred years of history, lying in wait to clutter statutes and confuse juries. In examining the historical background of the phrase, one probes the roots of a term which, though withering on the vine, lives on to strangle the penal codes of the several states.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">And, at 1309:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">\u201cSince \u2018malice\u2019 does not mean \u2018ill-will\u2019 and \u2018aforethought\u2019 does not mean \u2018beforehand,\u2019 jury instructions, though necessary, sound ridiculous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">The word \u201caforethought\u201d is today an absolutely useless appendage on our law. It has over the centuries been utterly drained of any meaning whatsoever. As a word of no utility but with an ever-present potential for confusion (some may innocently think that \u201caforethought\u201d means aforethought), it should be struck from the lexicon of our homicide law.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">c. <em>The Growth of Implied Malice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">Throughout the 17th century, the meaning of \u201cmalice\u201d grew even as the meaning of \u201caforethought\u201d shrank. With the use by the year 1547 of \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d as the criterion to separate serious and non-clergyable murder from less serious felonious homicide, English society and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>responsive judiciary began to feel the need to expand the more serious or \u201cmalicious\u201d category. \u201cAn advancing civilization was reaching the point where it demanded punishment for certain additional homicides.\u201d Moreland, <em>op.cit., </em>at 11. This growth of the category \u201cmurder\u201d was accomplished in three ways. As was discussed in the preceding section, the meaning of \u201caforethought\u201d (as a limitation upon malice) shrank to the point of nothingness, so that many sudden and unexplained killings could be punished as murder. This period also saw the birth and early growth of the doctrine of transferred intent (discussed in section II E 2 above). Most significantly, this period marked the birth and full maturing of \u201cimplied malice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Originally, the intent required for murder was the \u201cintent to kill\u201d \u2014 the state of mind which we today call \u201cexpress malice.\u201d The 17th century (and very late 16th century) recognized the need to punish as murder homicides resulting from other life-endangering intents, even though such intents did not involve literally the intent to kill. These additional mental states were added to the <em>mens rea </em>of murder during this period and they are what we today call:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">1) intent-to-do-serious-bodily-injury murder;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">2) felony-murder; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">3) depraved-heart murder.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> (Perkins gives this mental state the less emotionally charged and probably better label of \u201cWanton and Wilful Disregard of Unreasonable Human Risk\u201d.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">It is beyond the scope of this review to analyze substantively these additional mental states that today represent various forms of the <em>mens rea </em>of murder. They are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>well recognized in Maryland law. As Chief Judge Orth noted for this Court in <em>Lindsay v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 100, 104-105, 258 A. 2d 760:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\">\u201cMalice is divided into express and implied malice. Express malice exists whenever an accountable person kills another intentionally unless the killing is justifiable or excusable or unless there is a mitigating circumstance. . .. But a specific intent to kill is not a requisite of murder. One may commit murder without an actual intent to kill, for the law will imply malice in some unintentional killings and this is called \u2018implied malice\u2019 or \u2018constructive malice\u2019 or \u2018malice in law.\u2019 Two of such classes of unintentional killing, committed without justification or excuse or a mitigating circumstance, in which malice is implied, are where (1) there was an intent to inflict great bodily harm; and (2) conceding that there was no actual intent to injure, an act was done or duty omitted wilfully, the natural tendency of which was to cause death or great bodily harm.\u201d [And, by way of n. 6, adding, <em>inter alia, </em>the typical felony-murder situation \u201cwhen death was caused during the commission of, or attempt to commit, some other felony.\u201d]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The important thing to be noted for present purposes, as we survey the homicide field under the microscope of <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>is that the mental states here involved are today definitely a part of our substantive law. Four separate intents are each sufficient to constitute the <em>mens rea </em>of murder whenever an unlawful and unmitigated homicide results from the intended act. The first of these \u2014 the intent to kill \u2014 we happen to call \u201cexpress malice,\u201d because it was the original intent recognized by our law of murder. The other three of these \u2014 the intent to do grievous bodily harm, the intent to do a wanton and depraved life-endangering act and the intent to do a dangerous felony \u2014 we sometimes group under the umbrella label of \u201cimplied malice,\u201d because of the mechanism by which they came to be added to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>During the 17th century, the common law judges went through the fiction of \u201cinferring,\u201d \u201cimplying,\u201d or \u201cpresuming\u201d an intent to kill from these other intents. Whatever the roundabout historic mechanism of getting these intents into the law, we now flatly recognize that they are independent and self-sufficient mental states to constitute murder and are not mere avenues to the finding of \u201cintent to kill.\" Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>(2d Ed. 1969), summarized the historic process, at 35-36:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-5\">\u201cThe more difficult aspect of the problem is that there may be malice aforethought without an actual intent to kill. The older authorities assumed the necessity of an intent to kill and then resorted to an \u2018implied intent\u2019 of this nature when none in fact existed. But now the courts speak more factually and say frankly that murder may be committed under some circumstances without an intent to kill.. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">In dealing with one variety of \u201cimplied malice\u201d that may or may not now be a part of our substantive law \u2014 the intent to resist lawful arrest \u2014 Moreland, <em>op.cit., </em>at 13, describes eloquently the process by which additional mental states were gradually incorporated into our expanding notion of \u201cmalice\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">\u201cIn the beginning, this extension in the law was rationalized as an intentional killing. By strained reasoning, it was inferred that the killer had thought the matter over in advance and determined to kill rather than to be taken into custody. This seems fictitious rather than a reasonable inference of fact and was apparently occasioned by the fact that malice aforethought at the time was considered in its popular sense of a deliberate intent to kill formed prior to the fatal act, so some such reasoning was necessary to satisfy this requirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">However, as malice aforethought began to lose its natural meaning and to become a phrase of art with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>a number of meanings, the requirement of actual intent to kill formed prior to the homicide was dispensed with and the resistance to lawful authority was substituted for, or more accurately speaking became a type of, malice aforethought.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Perkins, <em>A Re-examination of Malice Aforethought, </em>43 Yale L.J. 537 (1934), describes the same process by which the intent to commit a felony was incorporated or absorbed into the expanding notion of \u201cmalice,\u201d at 547:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">\u201cThe notion that one who killed a man whom he had intended only to rob, was guilty of murder had made its appearance in the days of Lambard, and was explained by him on the ground that the law \u2018implyeth a former malicious disposition in him rather to kill the man, than not to have his money from him.\u2019 This does not carry conviction as an inference of fact. It falls distinctly into the field of fiction, by which there is imputed to a man a state of mind which was not actually present. On this cornerstone is laid the foundation for quite a different meaning for the words \u2018express\u2019 and \u2018implied,\u2019 as qualifying the phrase \u2018malice aforethought,\u2019 and there begins to appear, thinly camouflaged by fiction for a time, the recognition of an actual difference in the states of mind represented by these two terms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Perkins, <em>op.cit., </em>further points out, at 547-548, the fact that we have outgrown the fiction and recognize the growth of substantive law for what it truly is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">\u201cFor a time the fictitious formula prevailed. An intent to kill or injure was required for malice aforethought; but in certain cases, such as the robber who killed his victim by accident during the attempt to rob him, the slayer was conclusively presumed to have had such an intent. This could not conceal the fact that the malice \u2018implied\u2019 in such a case had reference to a different psychical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>element than the actual intent to cause death or bodily harm, and in the course of generations judges tended more and more to override the fiction and to recognize frankly that there may be malice aforethought without any design to kill or injure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Despite the continued use of the treacherous and illusive participle \u201cimplied,\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> the separate mental states that we group under the category \u201cimplied malice\u201d do not today <em>imply </em>anything. They are not presumptions which may be rebutted. They are not inferences which may be declined. A jury may not be told that if it finds an intent to rape, rob, burglarize, etc., it <em>may, but need not, </em>find a resulting homicide to have been with malice. It is not the case that these mental states <em>imply </em>malice; it is rather the case that they <em>are </em>malice by definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Since these mental states are today unequivocally a part of our substantive law on the <em>mens rea </em>of murder, they are unaffected by anything in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">d. <em>A Linguistic Sandtrap: \u201cImplied Malice\u201d is Not Necessarily Inferred</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">The thing to be proved \u2014 the probandum \u2014 does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>control the method of proving it. The four alternative mental states that will establish the <em>mens rea </em>of murder \u2014 1) an intent to kill, 2) an intent to do grievous bodily harm, 3) an intent to do a wantonly life-endangering act with a high risk of causing death, and 4) an intent to commit a dangerous felony \u2014 are the alternative things to be proved, the probandi. Each is an alternative substantive element of the crime of murder. These elements, just as any element of any crime, may be proved by any available and acceptable method of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Because of the associative power of words, however, a \u201cknee-jerk\u201d reaction is frequently triggered \u2014 and it is wrong. Because the label \u201cexpress\u201d has been put upon the first of these substantive mental elements, we erroneously assume that the method of proving it must be direct rather than inferential or circumstantial. Such is, of course, not the case. By the same token, because the label \u201cimplied\u201d (largely by historic accident) has been put upon the latter three of these substantive mental elements, we erroneously assume that the method of proving them must be inferential rather than direct. Again, such is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The purely coincidental and unfortunate use of the words \u201cexpress\u201d and \u201cimplied\u201d to describe substantive elements suggests nothing whatsoever about the method of proving those elements. Each of the alternative mental elements \u2014 whatever its label \u2014 may be proved either directly or indirectly as the facts of each case dictate.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">An intent to kill \u2014 \u201cexpress malice\u201d \u2014 may, of course, be proved directly. (Witness: \u201cI heard the defendant say, T am hereby killing you because I hate you.\u2019 \u201d) It may also be, and frequently is, proved inferentially. As will be discussed in the next section, the use of a deadly weapon directed at a vital part of the human anatomy gives rise to an inference of an intent to kill. (We therefore infer \u201cexpress malice.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Similarly, the intents to do 1) grievous bodily harm, 2) a depravedly reckless life-endangering act or 3) an underlying felony \u2014 the three forms of \u201cimplied malice\u201d \u2014 may all be proved directly. (Witness 1: \u201cI heard the defendant say, T am now going to horsewhip that scoundrel within an inch of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>life to teach him a lesson\u2019 Witness 2: \u201cI heard the defendant say, T am hereby throwing this heavy desk from the roof of the Empire State Building during lunch hour for the sheer thrill of it. I hope no one will be hurt, but that\u2019s not my problem\u2019 Witness 3: \u201cI heard the assailant say, \u2018Hands up! Give me the money in the cash drawer.\u2019 \u201d) Implied malice \u2014 by definition, any of the above intents \u2014 is thus proved directly and not inferentially. It may also be proved inferentially, of course, just as anything may be proved inferentially. The intent to do grievous bodily harm may be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon; the intent to do a depravedly reckless act may be inferred from the doing of the act; the intent to perpetrate an underlying rape may be inferred from knocking a woman to the ground, ripping off her clothing and inserting the penis into her body.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The words \u201cexpress\u201d and \u201cimplied\u201d \u2014 describing substantive elements \u2014 cannot carelessly be taken in a procedural sense as suggesting modes of proof. There is absolutely no correlation between the words \u201cexpress\u201d and \u201cimplied,\u201d on the one hand, and evidentiary modes, on the other. Notwithstanding this lack of correlation, the number of Maryland opinions which have linguistically \u201cgone into\u201d*\u2019 the rough\u201d on this hazard is embarrassingly legion.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">F. <em>Head Three of the Hydra: A Permitted Inference of Fact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Some mislabeled \u201cpresumptions\u201d have turned out, upon careful examination, to be nothing more than permitted inferences of fact. Some apologists generously have explained that the earlier use of the word \u201cpresumption\u201d was merely intended to connote a \u201cpresumption of fact\u201d (to wit, an inference), which was always to be distinguished from a true \u201cpresumption of law.\u201d When the due explanations have been made and the \u201cinference\u201d drops down from the burden-shifting world of legally significant \u201cpresumptions\u201d to the more ordinary world of the inductive, reasoning process, what is the creature \u201cinference\u201d that we are looking at?</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">In a real sense, the whole decision-making process is the process of drawing inferences. From fact A, we infer fact B. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>From a confession, we infer guilt. From the pulling of a trigger, we infer an intent to harm. From the possession of recently stolen goods, we infer the theft. From the motive, we infer the criminal agency. From the presence of the sperm, we infer the penetration. From the muddy footprints on the living room rug, we infer the unlawful entry. The whole phenomenon of circumstantial evidence is the phenomenon of inferring facts in issue from facts established. The study of the process of drawing inferences is as much the field of the psychologist and the logician as it is the field of the reviewing judge. Yet certain inferences, out of the infinite swarm of their fellows, have been singled out for legal analysis. Why?</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">It is difficult to say why certain of this infinite company of factual inductions have been marked for special scrutiny. It was most likely the accident of fortune that caused some of the stronger and more frequently employed inferences to be elevated to the level of \u201cpresumptions\u201d in the first place and then, because some of that number were not sufficiently compelling to remain as true \u201cpresumptions,\u201d to drop back again to the world of ordinary inferences. It was probably this rise to and fall from prominence that marked them for special treatment by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">In any event, an inference comes to our attention in only two situations. When we are called upon to measure the legal sufficiency of evidence, we have to determine whether established facts A and B are legally sufficient to give rise to a fair inference of fact C, the ultimate fact in issue. We are similarly called upon to measure the efficacy of certain inferences when we are asked to instruct a jury that it may (although it need not) infer fact C from established facts A and B.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Since an inference does not shift a burden either of persuasion or of going forward with evidence to a defendant, it does not come under the scrutiny of <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>in that regard. Since an illogical or improbable \u201cinference\u201d would, however, unfairly relieve the State of part of its burden of proving every element of a case beyond a reasonable doubt, the inference, even as a mere inference, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>must pass constitutional muster under <em>United States v. Gainey, </em>380 U. S. 63, 85 S. Ct. 754, 13 L.Ed.2d 658 (1965); <em>United States v. Romano, </em>382 U. S. 136, 86 S. Ct. 279, 15 L.Ed.2d 210 (1965), and <em>Leary v. United States, </em>395 U. S. 6, 89 S. Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969). It must, therefore, be based upon a rational connection between the facts established and the fact to be inferred. Conversely, it \u201cmust be regarded as \u2018irrational\u2019 or \u2018arbitrary,\u2019 and hence unconstitutional, unless it can at least be said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact [the inferred fact] is more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.\u201d <em>Leary v. United States, supra, </em>at 89 S. Ct. 1548, cited in <em>Lindsay v. State, supra, </em>at 8 Md. App. 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The only inference of any significance in our homicide law is the permitted inference of an intent to kill or of an intent to do grievous bodily harm from the directing of a deadly weapon at a vital part of the human anatomy or from some similar use of deadly force. The earlier case law sometimes spoke of the use of a deadly weapon as giving rise to a \u201cpresumption of malice.\u201d In <em>Lindsay v. State, supra, </em>however, Chief Judge Orth stole a march on <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>and strove mightily to refine the appellate vocabulary of Maryland and to bring it into the 20th century. He meticulously explained that we do not \u201cpresume\u201d anything from the use of deadly force; we are only permitted (but not required) to draw inferences from such use of deadly force. He further pointed out that this permitted inference of fact passes full constitutional muster under <em>Leary v. United States, supra. </em>We reaffirm and add that it thereby also passes constitutional muster according to <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>and <em>Winship.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">One strong caveat in this regard is of overriding importance. Even when we are careful simply to permit an inference from the use of deadly force and not to presume anything therefrom, we must meticulously limit the predicate which may be inferred. Much of our case law speaks carelessly of inferring (or presuming) <em>malice </em>from the use of deadly force. This is an overly broad employment of the inference which is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>The danger lurks in the fact that \u201cmalice\u201d means all of three different things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">1) the intention of doing a particular act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">2) the absence of justification or excuse; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-7\">3) the absence of mitigating circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">The use of deadly force properly gives rise to a permitted inference only of the first aspect of malice, that is, the intent to kill (or, alternatively, the intent to do grievous bodily harm).<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> It does not, with any degree of probity or probability, give rise to a permitted inference that the killing was without justification or excuse. The lawful executioner, the soldier in combat, the policeman chasing the dangerous and fleeing felon, the homeowner rightfully defending himself \u2014 all may direct deadly force. It is a fair inference that they all intended to kill, but it is not a fair inference that they did so without justification or excuse. By the same token, the outraged and cuckolded husband, who is still in hot blood upon discovering his wife in an act of adultery, may also direct deadly force at his victim. It is a fair inference that he intended to kill but not a fair inference that he did so without the mitigating circumstance of hot blood upon legally adequate provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">The Maryland case law is replete with the overly broad statements that \u201cmalice\u201d may be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon directed at a vital part of the human body. The qualification is not made that only one aspect of malice may be inferred and that two other aspects may not be so inferred. <em>Tate v. State, </em>236 Md. 312, 317, 203 A. 2d 882; <em>Houston v. State, </em>225 Md. 403, 404, 171 A. 2d 233; <em>Chase v. Jenifer, </em>219 Md. 564, 569, 150 A. 2d 251; <em>Chisley v. State, </em>202 Md. 87, 105, 95 A. 2d 577; <em>Woodard v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 114, 123, 282 A. 2d 9. If the word malice must be used at all, any statement as to it should be carefully qualified, as was done in <em>Cook v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 214, 218, 263 A. 2d 33, \u201cIt has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>been consistently held, that <em>in the absence of excuse, justification or a mitigating circumstance, </em>malice is inferred from the use of a deadly weapon directed at a vital part of the body.\u201d (Emphasis supplied) It would, of course, be preferable to speak simply of the intent to kill or the intent to do grievous bodily harm as being inferable and not to speak of malice at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">When we speak of the inference, therefore, we must scrupulously restrict its operation to that limited aspect of malice involving the intent to kill or the intent to do grievous bodily harm. We must never speak of inferring malice generally. This universal statement may all too easily be taken as permitting the inference of those other aspects of malice which are 1) the absence of justification or excuse and 2) the absence of mitigation. Such an inference would, of course, be clearly unconstitutional under <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>and <em>Winship. </em>It would relieve the State unfairly of proving both the absence of justification or excuse and the absence of mitigation. It would thereby put upon the defendant the unconstitutional burden of exculpating himself generally or of lowering his guilt to manslaughter. Again, the transparently simple solution is to refer directly to the intent element as the subject of the inference and to eliminate altogether the circuitous and unnecessary middle term \u201cmalice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">G. <em>Head Four of the Hydra: A True Presumption (In the Morgan Tradition)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Whereas an inference may be drawn by a fact finder but may be just as readily rejected, a presumption, if unrebutted, is mandatory in effect. It has immediate legal consequences and controls the procedural course of the trial. It operates not so much upon the decision-making function of the fact finder as upon the ruling-making function of the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">The most immediate and direct impact of <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>is to outlaw in a criminal trial any presumption in the Morgan tradition that operates against a defendant.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>that Morgan tradition, a presumption cast upon the party against whom the presumption operated the burden of ultimate persuasion when it came to contradicting the presumed fact. That burden generally had to be sustained by a preponderance of the evidence. The jury received instructions on 1) the existence of the presumption (it had evidentiary weight for the jury) and also 2) the burden to be borne by the defendant if he would overcome the presumption. (\u201cIf you do not find that the defendant has persuaded you to the contrary by a preponderance of the evidence, you <em>will </em>find the presumed fact.\u201d) This was the rule throughout much of the common law world with respect to the so-called \u201caffirmative defenses.\u201d The defendant bore the ultimate risk of non-persuasion. If the minds of the jurors were in a state of equipoise on the existence or non-existence of self-defense, hot-blood, entrapment, etc., the defendant lost because he had not carried his burden of preponderating persuasion. Casting upon a defendant that sort of burden of ultimately persuading the jury of his innocence (by negating in one fashion or another the necessary criminal element of a guilty mind) was the thing condemned in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>and <em>Winship. A </em>presumption as conceived of by Morgan may still have some utility for civil trials,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> but in a criminal trial it cuts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>squarely athwart the due process requirement that the State prove every element of a crime (including <em>mens rea) </em>beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\"><em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>set out the earlier tradition, of which the Maine manslaughter law was an example, at 44 L.Ed.2d 516:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">\u201cAbsent proof that an unlawful homicide resulted from \u2018sudden and sufficiently violent provocation,\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>the homicide was \u2018presumed to be malicious.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 201. In view of this presumption, the early English authorities, relying on the case of <em>The King v. Oneby, </em>92 Eng.Rep. 465 (KB 1727), held that once the prosecution proved that the accused had committed the homicide, it was \u2018incumbent on the prisoner to make out . . . all . . . circumstances of justification, excuse or alleviation ... to the satisfaction of the court and jury.\u2019 4 Blackstone\u2019s <em>Commentaries </em>201. See Foster, <em>Crown Law </em>255 (1762). Thus, at common law the burden of proving heat of passion on sudden provocation appears to have rested on the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The Supreme Court then set out to trace how the notion that a defendant would have to negate malice by a preponderance of the evidence had ever been injected into the law in the first place. The source of the idea, from which it spread rapidly to other American jurisdictions, was Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw for the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in <em>Commonwealth v. York, </em>9 Met. (50 Mass.) 93 (18451). <em>Commonwealth v. York </em>required a defendant to negate malice aforethought by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he acted in the heat of passion.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number><em>Davis v. United States, </em>160 U. S. 469, 16 S. Ct. 353, 40 L. Ed. 499 (1895), the Supreme Court rejected the <em>Commonwealth v. York </em>approach for the federal courts. <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>went on to point out how England itself had rejected such an approach in 1935 in <em>Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions, </em>1935 A. C. 462, and now requires \u201cthe prosecution to negate heat of passion on sudden provocation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>by proof beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d at 44 L.Ed.2d 518, n. 22. It pointed out that \u201cthe large majority of States have abandoned <em>York </em>and now require the prosecution to prove the absence of the heat of passion on sudden provocation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Indeed, the Supreme Court noted that Chief Justice Shaw himself appeared to waver in <em>Commonwealth v. Hawkins, </em>3 Gray (69 Mass.) 463, 465 (1855), ten years after his decision in <em>York, </em>and restricted the doctrine of <em>York </em>to the situation \u201cwhere the killing is proved to have been committed by the defendant, and <em>nothing further is shown . </em>..\u201d (Emphasis supplied by Supreme Court) 44 L.Ed.2d 517, n. 20. The Supreme Court went on to describe the amended position of Chief Justice Shaw, pointing out, at 44 L.Ed.2d 517, n. 20:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">\u201cHe further noted that this presumption did not govern when there was evidence indicating that the defendant might have acted in the heat of passion. In that situation, \u2018if the jury, upon all the circumstances, are satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that [the homicide] was done with malice, they will return a verdict of murder; otherwise they will find the defendant guilty of manslaughter.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 466. Thus, even the author of <em>York </em>quickly limited its scope to require only that the accused produce some evidence on the issue of passion; that is, that he satisfy the production but not the persuasion burden. Other jurisdictions blurred the distinction between these two burdens by requiring the defendant to prove \u2018to the satisfaction of the jury\u2019 that he acted in the heat of passion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">In stating clearly that once the issue of manslaughter was fairly in the case the State had the burden of proving non-mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt, the Supreme Court disposed of the argument that the prosecution ought not be required to negate a mental state known best to the defendant himself, reasoning, at 44 L.Ed.2d 521:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-8\">\u201cIt has been suggested . . . that because of the difficulties in negating an argument that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>homicide was committed in the heat of passion the burden of proving this fact should rest on the defendant. No doubt this is often a heavy burden for the prosecution to satisfy. The same may be said of the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of many controverted facts in a criminal trial. But this is the traditional burden which our system of criminal justice deems essential.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">Indeed, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court itself acknowledged that most States require the prosecution to prove the absence of passion beyond a reasonable doubt... In this respect, proving that the defendant did not act in the heat of passion on sudden provocation is similar to proving any other element of intent; it may be established by adducing evidence of the factual circumstances surrounding the commission of the homicide. And although intent is typically considered a fact peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant, this does not, as the Court has long recognized, justify shifting the burden to him . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The holding was then clear, at 522:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-8\">\u201cMaine law requires a defendant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he acted in the heat of passion on sudden provocation in order to reduce murder to manslaughter. Under this burden of proof a defendant can be given a life sentence when the evidence indicates that it is <em>as likely as not </em>that he deserves a significantly lesser sentence. This is an intolerable result in a society where, to paraphrase Mr. Justice Harlan, it is far worse to sentence one guilty only of manslaughter as a murderer than to sentence a murderer for the lesser crime of manslaughter. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S., at 372, 25 L.Ed.2d 368, 90 S.Ct. 1068 (concurring opinion). We therefore hold that the Due Process Clause requires the prosecution to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of the heat of passion on sudden provocation when the issue is properly presented in a homicide case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">1. <em>The Applicability to Affirmative Defenses Generally</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">There can be do doubt as to the applicability of the <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>principle to the so-called \u201caffirmative defenses\u201d generally. The <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>opinion itself, in pointing out that even Maine law required the State to carry the full burden on the issue of negating self-defense, essentially equated the situations involving mitigation and self-defense, saying, at 44 L.Ed.2d 521-522:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">\u201cNor is the requirement of proving a negative unique in our system of criminal jurisprudence. Maine itself requires the prosecution to prove the absence of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State v. Millett, </em>273 A.2d 504 (1971). <em>Satisfying this burden imposes an obligation that, in all practical effect, is identical to the burden involved in negating the heat of passion on sudden provocation. </em>Thus, we discern no unique hardship on the prosecution that would justify requiring the defendant to carry the burden of proving a fact so critical to criminal culpability.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">That Maryland clearly cast upon a defendant the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence on the issue of self-defense cannot be doubted. <em>Gunther v. State, </em>228 Md. 404, 410-411, 179 A. 2d 880; <em>DeVaughn v. State, </em>232 Md. 447, 457, 194 A. 2d 109; <em>Perry v. State, </em>234 Md. 48, 52-53, 197 A. 2d 833; <em>Davis v.

Wilbur, </em>twenty-four states had recognized that once a defendant had fairly raised the issue of self-defense by producing some evidence in that regard, the burden fell upon the State to negate self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">In <em>Wilson v. State, </em>28 Md. App. 168, 343 A. 2d 537, Judge Menchine, for this Court, dealt with the situation where the issue in a homicide case is excuse because of accident or misadventure. He concluded with respect to that defense, at 28 Md. App. 178:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">\u201cWe hold, accordingly, that where, as here, there is evidence tending to show that a killing was unintentional, occasioned in the course of a lawful act, the accused is entitled to an instruction that the burden rests upon the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that such lawful act was grossly negligent. The charge of the trial court, placing that burden of proof upon the accused, was reversible error.\u201d <footnotemark>44</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">The Court of Appeals has recently, in <em>State v. Grady, </em>276 Md. 178, 345 A. 2d 436, utilized the principle of <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>and <em>Wins hip </em>to disapprove a jury charge placing upon a defendant the burden of proving an alibi defense. Although the alibi defense had not, to be sure, been one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>the \u201caffirmative defenses,\u201d the opinion of the Court of Appeals, speaking through Judge Digges, teaches clearly that <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>will not be read narrowly and grudgingly, 276 Md. 182, at 345 A. 2d 438:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">\u201cExtending the rationale of <em>Winship, </em>the Supreme Court interpreted the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment as requiring the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of heat of passion when that issue was properly presented in a homicide case. . . We conclude that the teachings of these Supreme Court cases apply to the issue of who has the burden of proof and what that burden is when an accused relies on an alibi as a defense. In sum, under the Federal Constitution, as well as the law of Maryland, the burden is on the State to prove all elements of the alleged crime and to do so beyond a reasonable doubt. . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The principle of <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>will apply to the affirmative defenses generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">2. <em>The Five Faces of Heresy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">The forms taken by the constitutional heresy in Maryland have been curiously varied. The most blatant and visible, of course, is where the jury is instructed that a defendant must prove mitigation (or justification or excuse or whatever) by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Even in the subtler forms, however, whenever a jury is told that an element of the <em>mens rea </em>is to be presumed, the State has been unconstitutionally relieved of its rightful burden under the Due Process Clause of proving every element of the crime (including all necessary aspects of the <em>mens </em>rea) beyond a reasonable doubt. It may be helpful to catalogue briefly five frequently employed errors made in describing the so-called presumption of malice \u2014 four of them unconstitutional and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>one of them an absurd tautology. In looking at the errors, we need again to take our bearings on the fixed point that \u201cmalice\u201d comprehends three distinct aspects: 1) intent, 2) absence of justification or excuse and 3) absence of mitigation. Unless all three coalesce, there is no \u201cmalice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">a. <em>The Threefold Unconstitutionality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The statement is sometimes made, \u201cThe law presumes all homicides to be committed with malice aforethought and to constitute murder.\u201d <em>Chisley v. State, </em>202 Md. 87, 105, 95 A. 2d 577 [the errors, some now of the third and fourth generation, which can trace their pedigrees back to this single case, are almost without number]; <em>Faulcon v. State, </em>211 Md. 249, 257, 126 A. 2d 858; <em>Elliott v. State, </em>215 Md. 152, 159, 137 A. 2d 130; <em>Bruce v. State, </em>218 Md. 87, 98, 145 A. 2d 428; <em>DeVaughn v.

This broadest of the statements relieves the State of proving 1) an intent to kill or do grievous bodily harm; 2) the absence of justification or excuse and 3) the absence of mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">b. <em>The Twofold Unconstitutionality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">The statement is sometimes slightly less broad, \u201cThe inference of malice may be drawn from the fact of the use of a deadly weapon directed at a vital part of the body.\u201d <em>Tate v. State, </em>236 Md. 312, 317, 203 A. 2d 882; <em>Veney v. State, </em>251 Md. 159, 175, 246 A. 2d 608; <em>McFadden v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 725, 728, 237 A. 2d 93. The use of a deadly weapon directed at a vital part of the human body, of course, simply gives rise to the inference that the killing was intentional. From this established fact of an intentional killing \u2014 but one aspect of malice \u2014 the remainder of malice is then presumed. The State is relieved of its burden of proving 1) the absence of justification or excuse and 2) the absence of mitigation. A variant form of this unconstitutionally broad statement is found in <em>Coit v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 70, 73, 253 A. 2d 526, \u201cThe intent to commit <em>murder </em>is shown by an intent to commit grievous bodily harm . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>c. <em>The Onefold Unconstitutionality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Sometimes, slightly more careful statements offend the Constitution only in a single regard, \u201cAn intentional killing, absent justification or excuse, will be presumed to be with malice.\u201d <em>Gunther v. State, </em>228 Md. 404, 411, 179 A. 2d 880; <em>Lindsay v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 100, 104, 258 A. 2d 760. A variant form of the same mistake is, \u201cAn intentional and <em>unlawful </em>[thereby precluding justification or excuse} killing will be presumed to be with malice.\u201d <em>Law v. State, </em>21 Md. App. 13, 30, 318 A. 2d 859; <em>Abney v. State, </em>244 Md. 444, 448, 223 A. 2d 792. When the presumption appears in these forms, the first two aspects of malice are given as having been established and the State is relieved of its burden of proving only the third aspect of malice \u2014 the absence of mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">d. <em>A Reverse Form of the Onefold Unconstitutionality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">The presumption sometimes appears in the following form, \u201cThe law presumes that in the absence of mitigation, all homicides are committed with malice and constitute murder.\u201d <em>Woodard v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 114, 122, 282 A. 2d 9; <em>Simms v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 160, 168, 242 A. 2d 185. In this form, the absence of mitigation is a given fact and the State is relieved of its burden of proving simply the second aspect of malice \u2014 the absence of justification or excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">e. <em>The Tautology</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">Sometimes the constitutionally inoffensive but semantically inane statement is made, \u201cAn intentional killing, absent justification, excuse or some circumstance of mitigation, will be presumed to be with malice.\u201d <em>Tate v. State, </em>236 Md. 312, 317, 203 A. 2d 882; <em>Davis v. State, </em>237 Md. 97, 103, 205 A. 2d 254; <em>Veney v. State, </em>251 Md. 159, 175, 246 A. 2d 608; <em>Wilson v.

The obvious question is, \u201cWhy presume malice when all of its elements are already given as established facts?\u201d Since malice <em>is, </em>by definition, \u201cintentional killing absent justification, excuse or mitigation,\u201d the above statement posing as a presumption is no presumption at all. From A, B and C, we may presume D; but from A, B and C, we do not <em>presume </em>A, B and C. The \u201cpresumption\u201d as thus expressed is the equivalent of saying, \u201cFrom the given establishment of all elements of malice, we will presume malice,\u201d or, alternatively, \u201cFrom an intentional killing, absent justification, excuse or mitigation, we will presume an intentional killing, absent justification, excuse or mitigation.\u201d No matter how constitutionally innocuous this meaningless tautology, it has abiding potential to confuse the hearer as it has obviously confused the utterers.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The obvious source of most of the semantic difficulty is the confusing presence of an unnecessary middle term \u2014 \u201cmalice.\u201d Our problem is to define \u201cmurder.\u201d We do so by calling it a killing with \u201cmalice.\u201d Since no layman has the remotest idea what that means, we then define \u201cmalice\u201d as \u201c1) the intent to kill (or its equivalents) plus 2) the absence of justification or excuse plus 3) the absence of mitigation.\u201d Why not simply define \u201cmurderous intent\u201d as \u201cthe intent to kill (or its equivalents) without justification, excuse or mitigation \u201d? If A equals B and B equals C, why not say simply that A equals C? Only the powerful inertia of ingrained habit can account for the failure of fresh thought to expunge the misbegotten term \u201cmalice\u201d from the vocabulary of our homicide law. In this regard, we agree specifically with the Supreme Court of Michigan in <em>People v. Dunn, </em>233 Mich. 185, 197, 206 N. W. 568, 572:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">\u201c \u2018If the jurors are told what constitutes legal justification or excuse, and what circumstances will reduce the killing to manslaughter, they have all the law they need to determine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>particular homicide is murder or not, without the mention of the word \u201cmalice.\u201d \u2019 13 R.C.L. 773.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Even more generally, we agree with the Court of Appeals of Michigan in <em>People v. Morrin, </em>31 Mich. App. 301, 187 N.W.2d 434, 445:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">\u201cIf the language of the common law is misleading it should be clarified. It is the duty of the common-law courts to speak clearly in language that jurors can understand, not to persist in the lazy repetition of words which have lost all capacity to convey relevant thoughts and which are frequently misleading.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">In dealing with the presumption of malice, the Maryland case law indicates that it has been unsure of itself. The opinions give off certain intimations occasionally that they are groping, tentatively and unsurely, toward the light of the Thayer-Wigmore concept of the presumption (to be discussed in the next section). Even as some of our cases place the burden on a defendant of proving his affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence, they sometimes precede this a few sentences earlier or follow this a few sentences later with some such statement as, \u201cBut if upon all of the evidence, you are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant (did not act in self-defense, did not kill in hot blood, etc.) you should acquit.\u201d These cases seem to be trying to put the burden of persuasion simultaneously on both the State and the defense. The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine, in <em>State v. Millett, </em>273 A. 2d 504, 506, pinpointed the judicial ambiguity in terms we find incisive, citing Maryland as an example of the semantic drift:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-9\">\u201cWe are aware that over the years the trial courts in Maine have treated self-defense as an affirmative defense to be proven by the defendant by evidence from whatever source by the fair preponderance of that evidence ... It is perhaps because of an awareness that there has been no guiding decision on the point in this State and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>further awareness that there is a conflict of authority in other jurisdictions, that the practice has grown up in our trial courts of giving the secondary or saving instruction given in this case requiring acquittal if upon the whole evidence the jury entertains a reasonable doubt as to guilt. Yet upon examination it is clear that the two instructions impose two different burdens with respect to self-defense which stand in conflict with each other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-5\">. . .Without doubt the problem is at times one of semantics. In <em>Gunther v. State </em>(1962) 228 Md. 404, 179 A. 2d 880, 883, after stating the rule that self-defense must be proved by a fair preponderance of the evidence and the State is not required to overcome the defense beyond a reasonable doubt, the Court continued, \u2018It is thus apparent that the burden of proving self-defense <em>to the satisfaction of the jury </em>or the court (as the case may be) is on the defendant, but, it is likewise clear that if, upon all of the evidence, a reasonable doubt exists as to the guilt of the defendant, the trier of the facts ought to acquit him.\u2019 (Emphasis ours) Here the Court seemingly equates proof \u2018to the satisfaction of the jury\u2019 with proof by the fair preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-8\"><em>State v. Malone, </em>327 Mo. 1217, 39 S.W.2d 786, dealt with an erroneous instruction placing the burden upon a defendant of proving self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence. It dealt further with whether that error could be averted by a concluding sentence \u201cto the effect that if there is reasonable doubt of defendant\u2019s guilt he should be acquitted.\u201d On the effect of these conflicting instructions, the court said, at 39 S.W.2d 790:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-9\">\u201cA lawyer might work out a construction to reconcile and harmonize that positive direction with the concluding sentence and the presumption of innocence to which defendant is entitled, but it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>not likely a jury of laymen could do so. To say the best of it, the instruction was likely to be misunderstood by, and to mislead, the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">A similar situation was dealt with in <em>State v. Grady, supra. </em>There, as the Court of Appeals found, an erroneous instruction was given placing the burden upon the defendant to establish his alibi defense. Earlier in the jury instruction, the jury had, to be sure, been told that if \u201cafter a full and fair consideration of all the facts and circumstances in evidence, you find that the government has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was present at the time when, and the place where, the offense charged was allegedly committed, you must find the defendant not guilty.\u201d Notwithstanding this correct statement as to the burden upon the State, contained in one section of the instructions, Judge Digges squarely held that Maryland will brook no strained apologia in an effort to rationalize the irrational, at 276 Md. 185, 345 A. 2d 440:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">\u201cReading this instruction in that light, we conclude that it was improper to explain alibi testimony as did the trial judge since, at the very least, one rational interpretation of the words used would place an impermissible burden of proof upon the respondeat. The Achilles\u2019 heel of the instruction is that it could be understood as meaning that, while the State must prove its case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant has the responsibility of establishing his alibi, and apparently must even do so conclusively. Though, from the trial judge\u2019s words, the jury may have properly construed the respondent\u2019s obligation, we must assume that the improper inference was drawn because the latter portion of the instruction, quoted earlier in this opinion, is misleading, ambiguous and confusing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Whatever tentative gropings there may have been, it is nonetheless clear that Maryland has been applying the presumption of malice in the Morgan tradition and not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>the Thayer-Wigmore tradition. It is clear that we have been referring to a burden of persuasion being upon a defendant and not a mere burden of producing some evidence, since our statements as to the burden on a defendant to exculpate by way of justification or excuse or to mitigate by showing hot blood almost invariably have followed and have grammatically paralleled a preceding statement about the burden being upon the State to raise murder to murder in the first degree. It cannot be argued that different types of burden were being dealt with on opposite sides of the semicolon. It is clear from the statements themselves that whatever type of burden (indisputably a burden of persuasion) was upon the State in the first instance was the same type that was upon the defendant in the second instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">It is, moreover, clear that our cases were speaking of a burden of persuasion and not a mere burden of producing evidence, since our discussions invariably were in the context of jury instructions. Under the Thayer-Wigmore theory of presumptions, once there is in the case, whether produced by the defense or by the State, sufficient evidence to generate a genuine jury issue, the presumption dissipates and the jury never hears of it. When a jury, therefore, has been instructed about \u201cpresumptions\u201d and \u201cburdens,\u201d the thing being discussed is by definition a burden of persuasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">A presumption in this sense, placing a burden of persuasion upon a defendant, is flatly unconstitutional under <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>and <em>Winship.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">H. <em>Head Five of the Hydra: A True Presumption (In the Thayer-Wigmore Tradition)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\"><em>A </em>presumption in the Thayer-Wigmore tradition simply places upon a defendant the onus of producing evidence, or of relying at his risk upon evidence produced by the State, sufficient to generate a jury issue with respect to a particular defense. Once the issue is generated by evidence, the presumption totally dissipates (the bubble bursts) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>the State assumes the burden of persuasion on that issue beyond a reasonable doubt. Since the presumption has totally served its purpose once a jury issue has been created, the jury never hears of the presumption. If the issue has not been generated by evidence, the jury never receives the issue. Once the issue is generated, the jury gets the issue with the burden of persuasion thereon falling upon the State. The preliminary skirmishing on the generation <em>vel non </em>of the jury issue is of no concern to the jury itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The reasons of necessity requiring such an initial burden of producing some evidence, or of relying upon evidence produced by the State, to fall upon a defendant are clear. They are well set out in LaFave and Scott, <em>Criminal Law </em>(1972), at 47:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">\u201cAs to the burden of production of evidence, it is uniformly held that the defendant is obliged to start matters off by putting in some evidence in support of his defense \u2014 e.g., evidence of his insanity, or of his acting in self-defense, or of one of the other affirmative defenses \u2014 unless of course the prosecution, in presenting its own side of the case, puts in some evidence of a defense, in which case the matter of defense is properly an issue though the defendant himself produces nothing further to support it. Experience shows that most people who commit crimes are sane and conscious; they are not compelled to commit them; and they are not so intoxicated that they cannot entertain the states of mind which their crimes may require. Thus it makes good sense to say that if any of these unusual features are to be injected into the case, the defendant is the one to do it; it would not be sensible to make the prosecution in all cases prove the defendant\u2019s sanity, sobriety and freedom from compulsion. Perhaps experience might show that homicides and battery are, as often as not, committed in self-defense; but even if this is so, it would still be wise (in the interests of simplifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>issues and saving time which would be spent in presenting matters on which there is no dispute, and because the defendant normally has greater opportunity to know the facts) to place the burden of production on the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">In dealing with the presumption of sanity, which presumption in the proper Thayer-Wigmore sense places upon a defendant the obligation to see that there is produced sufficient evidence of insanity to generate a jury question in that regard, <em>Bradford v. State, </em>234 Md. 505, 509, 200 A. 2d 150, pointed out very concisely the reason of necessity behind such a presumption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">\u201cThis presumption is a creature of necessity and serves principally to save time in the trial of the issues presented by the pleadings. Otherwise a great deal of time and effort would be wasted if in every case the prosecution had to introduce full evidence of sanity as it does of all other material facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Maryland has traditionally placed upon a defendant, by the device of giving the State the benefit of a presumption to the contrary, the obligation to see that there is produced sufficient evidence to generate a jury question on such issues as intoxication, <em>Bateman v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 630, 272 A. 2d 64; <em>Mock v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 771, 237 A. 2d 811; insanity, <em>Bremer v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 291, 315-316, 307 A. 2d 503; <em>Dennis v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 564, 569, 284 A. 2d 256; <em>Strawderman v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 689, 698, 244 A. 2d 888; self-defense, <em>Street v. State, </em>26 Md. App. 336, 338-341, 338 A. 2d 72; and entrapment, <em>Fisher v. State, </em>28 Md. App. 243, 345 A. 2d 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">We are persuaded that nothing in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>adversely affects in any way the status of presumptions in this limited function of requiring that there be produced sufficient evidence to generate a jury issue. The holding of <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>was very careful to add a qualifying clause, at 44 L.Ed.2d 522:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-9\">\u201cWe therefore hold that the Due Process Clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of the heat of passion on sudden provocation <em>when the issue is properly presented in a homicide case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-5\"><em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>went on very explicitly, at 44 L.Ed.2d 521, n. 28:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">\u201cMany States do require the defendant to show that there is \u2018some evidence\u2019 indicating that he acted in the heat of passion before requiring the prosecution to negate this element by proving the absence of passion beyond a reasonable doubt. . . <em>Nothing in this opinion is intended to affect that requirement.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-7\"><em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>went on, at 522, n. 31, to explain that constitutionally proper presumptions simply shift to a defendant the burden of producing evidence (or of relying, at his risk, upon the evidence produced by the State) and not the burden of ultimate persuasion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">\u201cGenerally in a criminal case the prosecution bears both the production burden and the persuasion burden. In some instances, however, it is aided by a presumption, see <em>Davis v. United States . . . </em>(presumption of sanity), or a permissible inference, see <em>United States v. Gainey . . . </em>(inference of knowledge from presence at an illegal still). These procedural devices require (in the case of a presumption) or permit (in the case of an inference) the trier of fact to conclude that the prosecution has met its burden of proof with respect to the presumed or inferred fact by having satisfactorily established other facts. Thus, in effect they require the defendant to present some evidence contesting the otherwise presumed or inferred fact. See <em>Barnes v. United States .. .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">In each of these cases, however, the ultimate burden of persuasion by proof beyond a reasonable doubt remained on the prosecution . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Instructive as. well are the authorities cited by <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur. </em>It refers, at 44 L.Ed.2d 521, n. 28, to LaFave and Scott, <em>Criminal Law </em>(1972), 539, whereat it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">\u201c[I]t is everywhere agreed that the prosecution need not in the first instance introduce evidence of facts which negative the existence of mitigation, justification or excuse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The same footnote in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>also refers to Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>(2d Ed. 1969) 50-51. Professor Perkins\u2019 treatment of the- presumption of malice states, in pertinent part, at 49-50:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">\u201cThere is, however, a true presumption of malice aforethought. It would be an unreasonable burden upon the prosecution to require it in every murder case to prove not only the killing of the deceased by the defendant, but also the non-existence of every conceivable set of circumstances which might be sufficient to constitute either innocent homicide or guilt of manslaughter only. Thus the state is not required to prove (in addition to the killing of the deceased by the defendant) that the defendant was not so insane as to be wanting in criminal capacity, or that the killing was not by accident, or that it did not result from the privileged use of deadly force, or that it did not result from the sudden heat of passion engendered by adequate provocation, or other matters of this kind. To require such proof would constitute an absurd waste of time. This difficulty is avoided by a rule of law in the form of a presumption. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">Since this is a presumption in the true sense it merely places upon the defendant the burden of going forward with the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">Another of the authorities relied on heavily by <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>was Fletcher, <em>Two Kinds of Legal Rules: A Comparative Study of Burden-of-Persuasion Practices in Criminal Cases, </em>77 Yale L.J. 880 (1968), wherein the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>propriety of shifting a production burden to a defendant and the impropriety of shifting a persuasion burden to the defendant was made clear, at 908:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">\u201cYet acknowledging the prosecutor\u2019s problems of proof does not compel the conclusion that the defendant must bear the burden of persuasion on the issue; his difficulties properly justify only a demand that the defendant go forward on the issue. Once the defendant has raised a triable issue under one of the statutory exceptions, one might reasonably expect the prosecutor to bear the risk that the jury in the end would be in equipoise on the issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Maryland is familiar with the proper functioning of a presumption in a criminal case, that is, in the Thayer-Wigmore tradition, because this is our established mode of operating in dealing with insanity. There is initially a presumption of sanity, which presumption shifts to the defendant the obligation to see that there is produced legally sufficient evidence to generate a jury question. When that burden is met, the presumption dissipates and disappears totally from the case. The jury receives no instruction as to any presumption in that regard. The State rather bears the full burden of proving sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. This proper treatment of a presumption was spelled out very clearly in <em>Bradford v. State, supra, </em>at 234 Md. 512:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">\u201c[A]t the outset, the presumption of sanity places the initial burden of producing evidence on the defendant. But once the presumption has been rebutted it disappears as a rule of law and has no probative value as evidence. See Thayer, <em>A Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law, </em>p. 576. When this takes place, the burden of producing evidence as well as persuading the trier of facts falls upon the State and it must then prove sanity beyond a reasonable doubt as it must do in proving all other elements of the crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>As to the quantum of evidence necessary to generate a jury issue, it was well set out by Judge Powers in <em>Fisher v. State, supra, </em>at 28 Md. App. 248-249, 345 A. 2d 114:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">\u201cIt should here be emphasized that the defense of entrapment cannot be considered as \u2018having been raised\u2019 \u2014 that entrapment cannot become an issue for the trier of the facts \u2014 unless there is sufficient evidence which, if deemed weighty and credible by the trier of the facts, would support a finding that the police, directly or through their agent, induced the defendant to commit the offense charged. .. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">The initial test of the evidence, within the framework of the substantive law of entrapment, is always a matter of law for the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Generally speaking, the defensive evidence will be controverted by the evidence, circumstantial or direct, in the State\u2019s case. When the defendant, therefore, produces evidence, he has in most cases simply generated an issue for the jury. The jury retains full prerogative to accept or reject the defensive evidence and it must be persuaded by all of the evidence that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In some instances, however, where all evidence points toward the existence of the defense and where nothing in the State\u2019s case, circumstantial or otherwise, controverts the defense in any regard, the evidence may be so clear and decisive as to leave no issue of fact and to generate a counter-presumption (not a mere jury issue) and to entitle the defendant to a directed verdict as a matter of law. As a general rule, however, the defendant will simply generate a jury question.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Of particular interest is <em>Mullaney v. Wilburs </em>reference, at 44 L.Ed.2d 521, n. 30, to the decision of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court in <em>State v. Millett, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">\u201cIn <em>Millett </em>the Maine Supreme Judicial Court adopted the \u2018majority rule\u2019 regarding proof of self-defense. The burden of producing \u2018some evidence\u2019 on this issue rests with the defendant, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>the ultimate burden of persuasion by proof beyond a reasonable doubt remains on the prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">That decision of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court in <em>State v. Millett </em>is a superlative statement of the effect of a presumption in the Thayer-Wigmore tradition. The decision points out emphatically that no instructions to the jury involving the presumption are ever appropriate in any way. The treatment, at 273 A. 2d 507-508, is a classic, textbook analysis of how oroperly to deal with the presumption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-7\">\u201cWe are satisfied that we should now adopt the majority rule. It has the virtue of relative simplicity and should eliminate that apparent confusion which has arisen when trial courts have attempted to harmonize a burden of proof imposed upon the defendant with the continuing obligation of the State to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Since the claim of justification by self-defense is not raised by plea, it need not be anticipated by the State but will enter the case as an issue only if and when substantial evidence bearing on the issue is introduced, from whatever source that evidence may come. In that sense only can it be said that the defendant has a burden, the burden of coming forward with evidence of justification which will generate the issue and justify a finding by the factfinder, if indeed one is made, that by reason of the claimed justification a reasonable doubt exists as to defendant\u2019s guilt. As has frequently been stated, the defendant\u2019s burden under these circumstances is purely procedural and there is no occasion for instructions to the jury with respect to it. . . . \\ . . \u201cThe shifting of the burden of evidence is governed by rules of procedure which are designed solely for the guidance of the court; with respect to their observance, operation, or effect, the jury has no function to perform.\u201d \u2019. . . Having concluded as a matter of law that the self-defense issue is thus properly tendered, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>trial court need only instruct the jury as to the elements of self-defense.v He will have no occasion to speak of burden of proof other than to explain the State\u2019s burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If the evidence adduced, so viewed, is legally insufficient to raise the issue, the trial court will have no occasion or obligation to instruct the jury on the elements essential to a valid claim of self-defense, but rather will remove the issue of self-defense from jury consideration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">We conclude that nothing in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>adversely affects the presumption in Maryland of the latter two aspects of malice, to wit, the absence of justification or excuse and the absence of mitigation, just so long as the courts are careful to attach to the word \u201cpresumption\u201d its properly limited meaning, in the Thayer-Wigmore tradition, of merely placing upon a defendant the obligation of producing evidence, or of relying, at his peril, upon the evidence produced by the State, sufficient to generate a jury issue. His is the risk of non-production. Whether a jury question is or is not generated by the evidence is always for the court, never for the jury, to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">To all of the foregoing, a fitting benediction is McCormick, <em>Law of Evidence </em>(1st ed. 1954), at 639:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">\u201cOne ventures the assertion that \u2018presumption\u2019 is the slipperiest member of the family of legal terms, except its first cousin, \u2018burden of proof \u2019. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">One need only add \u201cmalice\u201d for a grand slam.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">\n<em>III. The Ghost of Homicide Present</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">We hold that <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>applies retroactively to this case. The issue of mitigation, by way of an arguably hot-blooded response to the provocation of a mutual affray, was fairly in the case. Under the circumstances, the jury instruction to the effect that malice might be presumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>(including therein the presumption of non-mitigation) unconstitutionally relieved the State of its burden of proving the element of non-mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt. When the instruction went further and placed an affirmative burden on the defendant to prove mitigation by a preponderance of the evidence, it aggravated what was already unconstitutional even without the aggravation.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">We further hold that the jury instruction was unconstitutional on the subject of self-defense. That issue was fairly in the case. The jury instruction to the effect that malice might be presumed (including therein the presumption of non-justification and non-excuse) unconstitutionally relieved the State of its burden of negating justifiable or excusable self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. The additional instruction placing an affirmative burden on the defendant to prove justification or excuse by a preponderance of the evidence simply aggravated what was already unconstitutional even without the aggravation.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b666-13\"> A number of opinions dealing with and explaining various aspects of the Mullaney v.

This analysis presupposes that the type of mitigation fairly in issue is of the common and orthodox \u201chot blood in response to legally adequate provocation\u201d variety. The foreclosing effect of a first-degree murder conviction would not, however, apply in those very rare cases where manslaughter is predicated upon the far more esoteric extenuating circumstances, \u201cnot yet far advanced,\u201d of \u201can \u2018imperfect\u2019 right of self-defense or defense of others, or of crime-prevention, or of the defenses of coercion or necessity, in which the killing, though not justifiable, is not bad enough to be murder.\u201d LaFave and Scott, <em>Criminal Law </em>(1972), \u00a7 77, \u201cOther-Extenuating-Cireumstances Voluntary Manslaughter,\u201d pp. 583-586.

In the interest of practicality, this analysis has been confined to that variety of murder in the first degree involving a \u201cwilful, deliberate and premeditated killing.\u201d (Art. 27, \u00a7 407) Although similar analyses could be made with respect to the negating of \u201chot blood\u201d (and, thereby, the proving of malice) in cases involving the other mental states sufficient to establish first-degree murder \u2014 the intent to kill by poisoning or by lying in wait (\u00a7 407); the intent to perpetrate an arson (\u00a7 408); the intent to burn any barn, tobacco house, stable, warehouse or other outhouse, etc. (\u00a7 409); or the intent to perpetrate rape, sodomy, mayhem, robbery, burglary, kidnapping, storehouse breaking, daytime housebreaking, or escape (\u00a7 410) \u2014 it is difficult to hypothesize these mental states as hot-blooded responses to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>legally adequate provocation.

The appropriateness of measuring court trials as well as jury trials by the standard of <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>is clear, since the undergirding issue dealt with by both <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>and <em>In re Winship </em>is the ultimate allocation of the burden of persuasion. Jury instructions, the surface problem dealt with in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>are simply one of the means employed in allocating the burden. It is, of course, the ultimate fact of allocation and not merely the means of the allocation which is critical on the question of due process of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b682-10\">. A qualification in this terribly complex field is again necessary. We are, in the context of this analysis, dealing with the more typical of the \u201cmalicious\u201d intents \u2014 1) intent to kill (express malice) and 2) intent to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>serious bodily harm (form one of implied malice) \u2014 and not with the less typical \u201cmalicious\u201d intents \u2014 3) depraved heart murder (form two of implied malice) and 4) felony-murder (form three of implied malice). Since a passionate and hot-blooded response to a legally adequate provocation triggers an intentional killing or an intentional doing of grievous bodily harm (and is, therefore, voluntary rather than involuntary manslaughter), it is, by definition, an ameliorated form only of 1) or <em>2) </em>above and not of 3) or 4), which do not involve intentional killing or intentional doing of grievous bodily harm at all. The entire issue of provocation and the now unconstitutional presumption which negates it involve, therefore, only the more common forms of second-degree murder and not the rarer forms. Where a conviction for murder in the second degree appears clearly to have been predicated upon the common law felony-murder doctrine or upon the depraved heart doctrine, it is difficult to imagine how provocation could be a legitimate issue in the case. Even an admittedly erroneous instruction presuming malice (by way of presuming non-mitigation), would appear under those circumstances to have been palpably immaterial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b684-8\">. The inevitable application of the <em>Mullaney v.

The \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d is, of course, not a presumption at all. 9 <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>(3rd Ed. 1940), \u00a7 2511, points out at p. 407, \u201c[T]he \u2018presumption of innocence\u2019 is in truth merely another form of expression for a part of the accepted rule for the burden of proof in criminal cases, <em>i.e. </em>the rule that it is for the prosecution to adduce evidence . . . and to produce persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .\u201d Thayer, <em>Preliminary Treatise on Evidence </em>(1898), is equally clear, at p. 551, \u201cIn the first place, the so-called presumption of innocence is not, strictly speaking, a presumption in the sense of an inference deduced from a given premise. It is more accurately an assumption which has for its purpose the placing of the burden of proof upon anyone who asserts any deviation from the socially desirable ideal of good moral conduct.\u201d And see Morgan, <em>Basic Problems of Evidence </em>(1962), p. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">If the \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d were a true presumption of law or permitted inference of fact, it would be flagrantly unconstitutional under <em>Leary v.

Quite the reverse likelihood, of course, applies to one arrested, indicted and brought to trial. As McCormick, <em>The Law of Evidence </em>(1954), astutely pointed out, at 647-648: \u201c[W]hen it came to be employed, in argument and in instructing juries, in criminal trials under the common law, it became a source of mysticism and confusion. As applied to the accused, any assumption, or \u2018presumption\u2019 of innocence, in the popular sense of an inference based on probability, is absurd. The probability is the reverse. The assumption of innocence which is reasonable in the absence of contrary facts becomes quite unrealistic when we include in the picture the facts that the person \u00a1has been officially charged with the crime and has been brought to trial. Nevertheless, the phrase \u2018presumption of innocence\u2019 has been adopted by judges as a convenient introduction to the statement of the burdens upon the prosecution, first of producing evidence of the guilt of the accused and, second, of finally persuading the jury or judge of his \\guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b697-10\">.

Indeed, killing from ambush or while lying in wait is far more ancient than premeditated killing as the object of our deepest opprobrium. Murder was originally a secret killing by waylaying of the newly arrived Norman conquerors at the hands of the native and subjugated Saxons. The ghost of this secret ambush still animates our notion of the highest degree of guilt. Such secret killings were particularly vexing to the Crown and difficult to suppress. To crush the evil, an entire hundred (a local administrative unit) was held responsible whenever a Norman was found slain by an unknown hand. The hundred was subjected to a heavy fine or amercement called the <em>murdrum. </em>In 1340, almost 300 years later when all Normans had long since become Englishmen, the <em>murdrum </em>was finally abolished, but the term \u201cmurder\u201d lived on to connote the worst kind of homicide. Pollock and Maitland, <em>History of English Law </em>(2d Ed. 1911) at 486-487; Moreland, <em>Law of Homicide </em>(1952), at 9, 198-199.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Yet a second variety of what is today first-degree murder antedates significantly a deliberated and premeditated killing. In the early 1600\u2019s, Lord Coke speaks in his <em>Third Institute </em>of felony-murder. It is well established by the time of Sir Matthew Hale\u2019s <em>History of the Pleas of the Crown </em>(1736), being referred to at 1 <em>Hale P.C. </em>465-467. The doctrine is referred to as well-established law in Foster, <em>Crown Law </em>(2nd Ed. 1791), at 258-259; 1 <em>Hawkins Pleas of the Crown </em>(8th Ed.), at 86, 100; 4 <em>Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries </em>(1765), at 200-201; 1 East, <em>Pleas of the Crown </em>(1806), at 255-260. And see generally Moreland, <em>Law of Homicide </em>(1952), at 42-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">By way of contrast, the phrase \u201cdeliberate and premeditated\u201d is very much of a late starter in the murder field, tracing back only to the Pennsylvania Act of 1794, whence it came into Maryland law in 1809. Even allowing for the fact that the word \u201cpremeditated\u201d was simply an attempt to revivify the original meaning of \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d or \u201cmalice prepensed,\u201d even those notions date only to the period 1496-1547, when a series of early Tudor statutes excluded from the benefit of clergy the more serious forms of felonious homicide, referring to them as murder committed with \u201cmalice prepensed.\u201d 12 Hen. VII, c. 7 (1496); 4 Hen. VIII, c. 2 (1512); 23 Hen. VIII, c. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4 (1531); 1 Edw. VI, c. 12, \u00a7 10 (1547).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\">. By the phrase <em>actus reus </em>we mean, of course, the harmful act, by way of contrasting it with the <em>mens rea </em>or guilty mind. Both phrases are taken originally from Lord Coke, 3 <em>Institutes </em>107: <em>\u201cActus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea\u201d: </em>\u201cThe act does not make [one] guilty unless his mind be guilty.\u201d Professor Perkins uses the phrase in this sense, pointing out that it was earlier used by Kenny, <em>Outlines of Criminal Law </em>(15th ed. 1936), 45, 50, 75, 91, etc. See Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>(1st ed. 1957), 652-654, particularly at 654;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-9\">\u201cWhat has been said emphasizes the fact that there are two components of every crime; One of these is objective, the other is subjective; one is physical, the other is psychical; one is the <em>actus reus, </em>the other is the <em>mens rea.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b706-8\">. It is sometimes falsely asserted that \u00a7\u00a7 408-410 constitute felony-murder doctrine in Maryland. That is not true. The felony-murder doctrine (see Part IIE 3 <em>infra) </em>is the common law rule \u2014 defining <em>one </em>of the at-least three varieties of implied malice \u2014 which raises a homicide resulting from the perpetration or attempted perpetration of a felony to the murder level generally. It is only at that point, after the felony-murder rule has already operated, that \u00a7\u00a7 408-410 come into play to provide further that in the case of certain designated felonies, the <em>already established murder </em>shall be punished as murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Only one state, incidentally \u2014 Ohio \u2014 fails to recognize the felony-murder doccrine. Moreland, <em>Law of Homicide </em>(1952), at 49. For good Maryland discussions of felony-murder, see <em>Stansbury v. State, </em>218 Md. 255, 146 A. 2d 17, and <em>Wood v. State, </em>191 Md. 658, 62 A. 2d 576.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b706-10\">. Thus, the intoxication which can sometimes negate a specific intent or special <em>mens rea </em>and reduce first-degree to second-degree murder would have no such extenuating effect when the first-degree murder is predicated upon a special <em>actus reus </em>\u2014 poisoning, lying in wait or perpetrating one of the felonies designated in \u00a7 408, 409 or 410 \u2014 instead of a special <em>mens rea, unless the underlying actus reus </em>itself requires a specific intent or special <em>mens rea </em>beyond the general intention of doing the underlying act. \u201cWhen proof of specific intent to kill is eliminated any defense on that particular issue is also barred.\u201d Clark and Marshall, <em>Law of Crimes </em>(6th Ed., Wingersky Revision, 1958), at 562; <em>Stansbury v.

It is arguable that there is yet a fourth category of \u201cimplied malice\u201d involving intent-to-resist-lawful-arrest murder, but the modern authorities are skeptical of this addition to the category, thinking that any truly murderous situations are well handled by one or another of the other members of the category. In any event, the addition or deletion of one member of the \u201cimplied malice\u201d family is unnecessary for purposes of this survey of the homicide field in terms of due process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b720-9\">. The word is from the language of procedure and not from the language of definition. It suggests that what the facts imply, the fact finders may infer. One can only rue the needless confusion wrought by an anachronistic vocabulary and long for the clarifying wisdom of Professor Perkins at <em>Criminal Law </em>(2d Ed. 1969) 46:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-10\">\u201cSince murder cannot be adequately defined in terms of an intent to kill, without resort to the ancient fiction whereby such an intent was \u2018implied\u2019 in certain cases in which it did not exist in fact, some other phrase must be used. And since malice aforethought is neither a self-explanatory phrase, as used in the law, nor one which designates any single and invariable frame of mind, it is probably wise to employ a phrase to which a meaning may be assigned\" quite arbitrarily. The phrase \u2018man-endangering-state-of-mind\u2019 is suggested for this purpose with the assumption that it be arbitrarily understood to include every attitude of mind which includes (1) an intent to kill, or (2) an intent to inflict great bodily injury, or (3) an intent to do an act in wanton and wilful disregard of an unreasonable human risk (i.e. the wilful doing of a wanton act under such circumstances that there is obviously a plain and strong likelihood that death or great bodily injury may result), or (4) an intent to perpetrate a dangerous felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b725-10\">. The second intent is not totally redundant to the first. Even from the use of a deadly weapon, the jury might decline to infer the intent to kill but nonetheless choose to infer the intent to do grievous bodily harm. The <em>mens rea </em>of murder would, thus, still be proved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b726-9\">. A presumption in this tradition could not operate against the State in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>a criminal trial, since the State may not have <em>shifted </em>to it the thing which it already has, to wit, the burden of persuasion. The effect of a presumption, in either tradition, is always to shift a burden (of some sort) to the opposing party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b727-7\">. <em>Mullaney </em>v. <em>Wilbur's </em>reliance upon and indebtedness to the profound analysis of Fletcher, <em>Two Kinds of Legal Rules: A Comparative Study of Burden-of-Persuasion Practices in Criminal Cases. </em>\u201d 77 Yale L.J. 880 (1968), is apparent when the Supreme Court opinion and the law review article are read side by side. Professor Fletcher demonstrates convincingly that there are two distinct sets of rules and procedures at work in our law \u2014 \u201cthe model set by private litigation\u201d and \u201cthe model focusing on the justification for invoking criminal sanctions\u201d \u2014 and that much of our present-day confusion resulted from the tendency of 19th century jurists falsely to analogize the latter to the former. He discusses the pattern dominant in the 19th century of \u201cassimilating burden-of-proof disputes in criminal cases to the model set by private litigation\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">\u201cIn the course of a century, the orientation of the criminal process has shifted from the model set by private litigation to a model focusing on the justification for invoking criminal sanctions. . . . Since that time [the mid-19th century] the courts of the Western world have come to appreciate the uniqueness of the fact-finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>process in criminal cases. The problem in criminal trials is not one of efficiently arriving at a fair settlement of a dispute, but of determining whether the state may justly condemn a man and deprive him of his liberty. The problem, in short, is to justify the use of the state\u2019s coercive powers. Concern for justifying the use of criminal sanctions is increasing; and that increasing concern explains the progressively more favorable position of defendants on the risk of residual doubt at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">A specific theory of justification has emerged from the burden-of-persuasion decisions of the last 100 years. That theory is that the state may justly punish only those individuals whose violation of the law is morally blameworthy.\u201d Fletcher, op.cit, at 888.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">What emerges is that the use of a presumption in the Morgan tradition may remain perfectly appropriate for civil litigation, where burdens even of ultimate persuasion may shift back and forth throughout the course of a trial. It is not inappropriate in such civil litigation to require a person asserting a position to bear the burden of proving that position. \u201cThe proponent of an issue bears the burden of that issue.\u201d Nor is it inappropriate to adjust the burden of persuasion where facts are \u201cpeculiarly within the knowledge\u201d of one of the parties. McCormick, <em>Evidence </em>(1954), at 675. Such a tradition, however, is not appropriate as a model for the criminal law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-10\">\u201cOriented as they were toward private litigation, courts in the 19th century regarded rules of criminal liability as functional analogues to rules for settling private disputes. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-11\">In contrast, the emergent rules of criminal liability are rules that do not admit of exceptions. Unlike rules of private law, they encompass all relevant substantive issues; their function is to enumerate the necessary and sufficient substantive conditions for the justified use of criminal sanctions. When applied at trial, they generate only one question: are the conditions of criminal guilt satisfied? Defensive issues, like self-defense and insanity, are raised not as exceptions, but as denials of liability under the rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-12\">... The virtue of this unified structure is that all substantive issues thus encompassed, be they affirmative or negative in form, be they inculpatory or exculpatory in effect, play the same functional role in determining the defendant\u2019s liability for crime. This functional parity derives from the one factor unifying the issues so structured: they all relate to the defendant\u2019s moral guilt in acting contrary to law.\u201d Fletcher, <em>op.cit., </em>at 892-893.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b729-6\">. Professor Fletcher, <em>op. cit., </em>diagnosed clearly where Chief Justice Shaw had gone wrong in 1845. Sir Michael Foster in his <em>Crown Law </em>(1762) 255. asserted that the prisoner had \u201csatisfactorily\u201d to prove circumstances of \u201caccident, necessity and infirmity.\u201d Sir William Blackstone, at 4 <em>Commentaries </em>201 (1776), simply took the statement from Foster and reformulated it to the effect that the defense had the burden of showing \u201ccircumstances of justification, assurance and alleviation.\u201d Professor Fletcher points out how both Foster and Blackstone relied upon a single case, Rev <em>v. Oneby, </em>92 Eng. Rep. 465 (1727). In looking to the source case, Professor Fletcher explained that Oneby\u2019s case came before the judges of the King\u2019s Bench on a special verdict stipulating that the defendant had killed a man in a fight over a game of cards. The facts stipulated in the verdict did not admit the construction that Oneby killed under provocation. As Professor Fletcher points out, the rule of that case to the effect that the burden was upon the defendant to show mitigation in all probability meant that the burden was upon him of producing evidence in order to generate a jury issue. Professor Fletcher makes clear, at 904-906:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">\u201cFor all of its influence, the Blackstonian rule on the burden of persuasion contains serious flaws. It was born of a particular method of trial \u2014 the special verdict; but it came to be applied as a rule on the instructions to be given to juries with the responsibility for making ultimate determinations of guilt. As one passes from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>one system of trial to the other, one encounters a critical ambiguity in the phrase \u2018burden of proof \u2014 an ambiguity that remains in the background of cases like <em>Oneby, </em>where the court\u2019s task is merely to construe gaps in the jury\u2019s specification of the facts....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">So far as the rationale of <em>Oneby\u2019s Case </em>is applicable in instances of general verdicts, the language of the opinion (\u2018It lies on the party indicted to prove the sudden quarrel\u2019) may refer either to the burden of persuasion or to the burden of going forward. The problem, of course, is deciding to which of these burdens the language of the case should be deemed to refer.... [T]he principle of <em>Oneby </em>is clear: it is up to the defendant, not the prosecution, to raise a triable issue of malice. This the defendant may do by going forward with \u2018some evidence\u2019 on the issue of provocation by a sudden quarrel; therefore, in the context of a trial leading to a general verdict, the <em>Oneby </em>demand that the defendant \u2018prove\u2019 the issue should mean no more than the defendant must go forward with evidence on that issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">For several reasons, Chief Justice Shaw failed to confront the ambiguity of the \u2018burden of proof in his <em>York </em>opinion. First, in the mid-19th century there was little, if any, sensitivity to the ambiguity. ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Indeed, the Supreme Court in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>pointed out that the blurring of the distinction between a burden of persuasion and a burden of producing evidence was almost inevitable at the time of Chief Justice Shaw because his times were not sensitive to that subtle distinction, saying, at 44 L.Ed.2d 517, n. 20:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">\u201cSome confusion developed, however, as to precisely what <em>York </em>required. Contemporary writers divide the general notion _ of \u2018burden of proof into a burden of <em>producing </em>some probative evidence on a particular issue and a burden of <em>persuading </em>the fact finder with respect to that issue by a standard such as proof beyond a reasonable doubt or by a fair preponderance of the evidence. See, <em>e.g., </em>McCormick, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 336 (2d ed. 1972). This distinction apparently was not well recognized at the time <em>York </em>was decided, and thus in some jurisdictions it was unclear whether the defendant was required to bear the production burden or the persuasion burden on the issue of heat of passion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">Thus, the principle of a single English decision, in the limited context of what legal significance to attach to a special jury verdict, in 1727 was set out without necessary qualification by a text writer (Foster) in 1762, picked up from that source by a second text writer (Blackstone) in 1776, applied uncritically by a Massachusetts chief justice in 1845, and- haunts the common law of Maryland (and many other jurisdictions) in 1975, some 248 years later.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b734-9\">.
