Garland, acting as trustee,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> purchased 359.43 acres in Charles County, Maryland, from Francis Hill. The agreed price was one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per acre, a total of three hundred fifty-nine thousand, four hundred thirty dollars ($359,430.00). Garland paid Hill seventy-two thousand dollars ($72,000.00) toward the purchase price and the balance took the form of a purchase money mortgage from Garland to Hill in the amount of two hundred eighty-seven thousand, four hundred thirty dollars ($287,430.00). The mortgage, dated November 1, 1972, called for ten annual installments of twenty-eight thousand, seven hundred forty-three dollars ($28,743.00) together with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>annual interest of seven percent (7%) on the unpaid principal balance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The mortgagor defaulted, and M. W. Munday, Esquire, attorney for Hill and assignee for the purpose of foreclosure, placed an advertisement in <em>The Times-Crescent, </em>a newspaper printed in Charles County. The advertisement first appeared in the edition of October 30, 1974, and last appeared on November 13,1974. Munday, as assignee of Hill, filed an \u201cOrder to Docket Suit\u201d in the Circuit Court for Charles County, Maryland, on November 6, 1974, one week <em>after </em>the first insertion of the advertisement relating to the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The property was sold at public auction at the courthouse door on November 15, 1974. At the time of the sale the balance due on the mortgage as of October 1974 was two hundred eighty-six thousand, six hundred eighty-seven dollars ($286,687.00). Hill, the mortgagee, bid twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00), and his bid was the only bid. The property was \u201cknocked down\u201d by the auctioneer to Hill. Thereafter, the assignee reported the sale to the court, and an order <em>nisi </em>was passed warning everyone to show cause within a prescribed period of time why the sale should not be ratified and confirmed. Garland filed exceptions to the sale, and the matter was heard before Judge James C. Mitchell who, on March 31, 1975, denied the exceptions and ratified the sale. Garland appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In this Court Garland argues, as he did in the circuit court, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">I. \u201cThe sale should . . . [be] set aside because the advertisement and the sales price do not support a conclusion that the sale was fairly made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-9\">II. \u201cThe proceedings were improper. The case should have been docketed and placed under the supervision of the court as the first act of the assignee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>The Court of Appeals has repeatedly held that the description of the property that is contained in the notice of sale under a foreclosure proceeding is sufficient if the notice enables . . any one, by the exercise of ordinary intelligence, to locate the property and to obtain more detailed information concerning it. ...\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Preske v.

The notice also made reference to the fact that the acreage to be sold was part of Hilltop Farm. Patently, the advertisement placed anyone of ordinary intelligence upon notice of what property was to be sold, where it was situate, and where one could obtain more detailed information. <em>Preske v. Carroll, supra. </em>Had a person read the notice, he would have discovered, without any difficulty, not only that the property was, as we have said, a part of Hilltop Farm, but that it bordered on Hughesville-Benedict, State Route 231. Furthermore, he could, if he so desired, have referred to the mortgage for additional information or he could have made contact with the assignee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We think the assignee, in this case, did all that he was required to do, under the decisions of the Court of Appeals, and that Judge Mitchell correctly rejected Garland\u2019s argument to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">We agree with Garland, however, that a twenty-five thousand dollar ($25,000.00) sales price at a foreclosure sale, for a parcel of land that two (2) years before had sold for three hundred fifty-nine thousand, four hundred thirty dollars ($359,430.00) is \u201cso insignificant as to shock the conscience of the Court,\u201d Suburban <em>Garden Farm Homes Corp. v. Duckett, </em>179 Md. 648, 22 A. 2d 467 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Johnson v. Dorsey, </em>7 Gill. 269, 294 (1848), said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">\u201c. . . [inadequacy of price is to be regarded as a strong auxiliary argument, in combination with circumstances calculated to cast doubt or suspicion upon the correctness of a sale. But standing alone, ... it is insufficient to authorize an interference with the sale, unless, ... it is so inordinate, as to indicate some mistake or unfairness in the sale, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>which the purchaser is responsible, or misconduct or fraud in the trustee, to whom the management of the sale has been committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-5\"><em>See Ten Hills Co. v. Ten Hills Corp., </em>176 Md. 444, 5 A. 2d 830 (1939); <em>Stallings v. Annapolis Sav. Institution, </em>167 Md. 4, 172 A. 283 (1934); <em>Wagner v. Cohen, </em>6 Gill. 97 (1847).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">At the hearing on the exceptions Garland testified that he thought that, as of the date of sale, \u201cthe property would be worth twelve hundred dollars [($1,200.00)] an acre as a fair and reasonable price.\u201d We are not informed whether Garland\u2019s \u201cfair and reasonable price\u201d looked to a forced sale at public auction or a privately negotiated sale, nor need we, in this case, be concerned with the difference as the trial judge was not required to believe Garland\u2019s appraisal. We view the twenty-five thousand dollar ($25,000.00) sales price in the instant case as so inordinate that it gives rise to an inference of \u201csome mistake or unfairness in the sale, for which the purchaser is responsible. . . .\u201d If the facts in this case ended here we would have no hesitation in reversing the trial court and remanding the matter with instructions that the circuit court order a new sale. The facts of this case, however, do not end with the inadequate sales price and, because of the additional significant facts hereinafter discussed, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The additional facts which lead us to that conclusion are that at the time of the hearing on the exceptions, Hill, through the assignee, offered to waive his right to any deficiency judgment against Garland. Before the order denying the exceptions and ratifying the sale was filed by Judge Mitchell, Hill placed in the proceeding a \u201cWaiver of Deficiency\u201d in which he waived his \u201cright to a deficiency judgment against Thomas A. Garland, Trustee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Hill argues that the net effect of his waiver is that the \u201creal consideration\u201d or sales price is not twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00), the auction sales price, but that sum added to the dollar value of the waiver. Garland, on the other hand, asserts that the \u201creal price\u201d was twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00), and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>chancellor impermissibly \u201cescalated the price ... to more than $300,000.00.\u201d On oral argument it was conceded by Garland that if Hill had bid the same amount as Hill waived, disregarding objections relative to costs of the sale, Garland would have no sound basis for objecting to the sales price on the ground that it is inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">As we see it the waiver of deficiency judgment actually raised the \u201creal\u201d purchase price to equal the total amount due, including interest, from Garland to Hill, plus the costs of the foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">A mortgagee, in Maryland, has the right to secure a judgment against a mortgagor for any deficiency between the amount received at a foreclosure sale and the amount of the mortgage, interest, and the costs of foreclosure. If one has knowledge that the foreclosure sales price will result in a deficiency, that fact, generally, is a motivating factor for a post-sale challenge over adequacy of price. Although Maryland does not appear to have decided heretofore whether a mortgagee\u2019s waiver of deficiency will elevate an otherwise inadequate purchase price to the level of adequacy, some other jurisdictions have ruled on the issue. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in <em>Equitable Life Assur. Soc. v. Vaughn, </em>82 F. 2d 978, 981 (6th Cir. 1936) held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">\u201c. . . [I]n Tennessee . . . where a mortgagee has purchased mortgaged property for less than the mortgage debt, but afterwards releases its claims to a deficiency judgment, the effect is the same as if the full mortgage debt had been bid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-8\"><em>See Erwin National Bank v. Riddle, </em>18 Tenn. App. 561, 79 S.W.2d 1032 (1934).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>If Hill had bid a sum equal to the total amount of Garland\u2019s indebtedness to Hill, plus costs, we fail to see how Garland could be heard successfully to complain that the price was inadequate. Yet, Hill\u2019s waiver of deficiency amounts, in cold dollars and cents, to exactly the same thing as if Hill had made such a bid at the auction. We think the reasoning of the court in <em>Equitable Life Assur. Soc. v. Vaughn, supra, </em>to be not only legally sound, but a common sense solution to the problem. Accordingly, we hold that when a mortgagee purchases at a foreclosure sale the property upon which he holds the mortgage, for an amount less than the mortgage debt and costs, and the mortgagee thereafter waives any claim to a deficiency judgment, the effect of the waiver is the same as if the bid had been for the full amount of the mortgage debt and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In an oral opinion given at the conclusion of the evidence at the hearing on the exceptions, Judge Mitchell said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">\u201cCourts of equity do not let properties be sold in a mortgage foreclosure for a grossly inadequate price and let the mortgagee claim a deficiency judgment, it is innately inequitable and unjust, but here we don\u2019t have that situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">We have an offer to waive any deficiency, which in effect gives the mortgagor credit for some, for the full amount of the balance on the mortgage that was over $300,000.00 and also imposes upon the purchaser the duty of paying some additional charges, taxes and so forth, that were due at the time of the sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">So I think we have to really consider the overall amount for which the mortgagor is getting credit as the actual sale price in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">In doing that, we do not find that over $300,000.00 for this property shocks the conscience of the Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">For the reasons that we have heretofore set forth, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">Garland next avers that the procedure authorizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>advertising of a foreclosure sale prior to the docketing of the proceedings vitiates the sale. During the life of the mortgage, the sale thereon and the hearing in the circuit court, Maryland Rule W74 a 2 (a) provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\">\u201cBefore making a sale of mortgaged property, the person authorized to make such sale shall give notice of the time, place and terms thereof by advertisement in some newspaper published in the county where the mortgaged property, or some portion thereof is located, if there be one so published and, if not, in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in said county; provided, however, that in the City of Baltimore the notice shall be published in one or more of the daily newspapers published in said City. Such notice shall be given for the period of time specified below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">(i) For the sale of real estate or chattels real \u2014 at least once in each week for three successive weeks, the first such publication to be not less than fifteen days prior to sale and the last such publication to be not more than one week prior to sale.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The Rule, we note, commands that before a sale the property must be advertised, however, it does not specifically require that the advertising await the commencement, by docketing, of the foreclosure. <em>See </em>Rule W72 c and W71 d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Apparently, because former Rule W74 a 2 (a) did not proscribe the advertising of property that was to be foreclosed before the actual filing of the foreclosure proceeding, there seem to have evolved within the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>different interpretations of the Rule with respect to whether the foreclosure action had to be filed in court before the advertising commenced, or following the advertising,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> so long as the sale did not occur prior to the docketing of the action and the filing of an approved bond. <em>See </em>Md. Rule W74 a 1. In the Seventh Judicial Circuit the erstwhile practice was to allow advertising prior to the docketing of a case. We observe that a number of cases involving mortgage foreclosures have gone to the Court of Appeals from the Seventh Judicial Circuit,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and not one of them discussed the propriety, <em>vel non, </em>of advertising before docketing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">In one case, however, <em>Hardy v. Gibson, </em>213 Md. 493, 133 A.2d 401 (1957) the Court, speaking through the late Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e, recognized and implicitly sanctioned the practice employed in the Seventh Circuit, and perhaps elsewhere, when he pointed out, 213 Md. at 500:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">\u201cThe property was sold on June 27, 1956, pursuant to an advertisement in a Prince George\u2019s County newspaper published for the first time on May 31, 1956. On June 22, 1956, the Trustees docketed this suit in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County and filed their bond before the sale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">A reading of the above quoted paragraph makes it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>manifest that the Court was well aware that the property in that ease was advertised twenty-two days before the suit was docketed. We glean from <em>Hardy v. Gibson, supra, </em>that the Court not only knew of the custom that had arisen in the Seventh Judicial Circuit relative to advertising before docketing, but, as we have previously stated, implicitly approved the practice. To underscore our belief that such a practice as that prevailing in the Seventh Judicial Circuit was both recognized and sanctioned by the Court of Appeals, we note that on June 16, 1975, effective July 1, 1975, the Court altered Md. Rule W74 by adding thereto a new section known as W74 a 2 (a) and which mandates that, henceforth, no sale shall be advertised before an action is instituted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the prior rule did not authorize \"pre-foreclosure sale advertising\u201d, there would have been no need to modify the rule so as to forbid such advertising. Prior to July 1, 1975, however, it was permissible to advertise a foreclosure sale prior to the filing of the foreclosure suit in the circuit court, and thus, no error is present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-15\">. The record does not reflect for whom Mr. Garland acted as trustee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b644-11\">. The mortgage contained various other terms not here pertinent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b645-13\">. According to Garland\u2019s testimony only five persons attended <em>the </em>sale. The five were Garland, Munday, the auctioneer, Hill, and Hill\u2019s driver, but lack of attendance does not indicate a lack of notice any more than a lack of interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b647-9\">. The mortgage contained no \u201cbeing clause\u201d, but a purchase money mortgage is ordinarily recorded immediately after the deed from the seller to the buyer-mortgagor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b649-9\">. The Rhode Island appellate court in Island Savings Bank v. Galvin, 20 R. I. 158, 37 A. 809 (1897) considered the matter from a different angle. The court held that where the mortgagee knowingly permits a property to be sold at foreclosure for less than its fair market value, so that his representative may purchase at a lower price, the mortgagee is equitably estopped from obtaining a deficiency judgment or decree against the mortgagor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b651-7\">. The Rule was amended effective July 1, 1975. The amendment, <em>inter alia, </em>added an entirely new section known as W74 a 2 (a) Condition Precedent. \u201cNotice of sale in an action to foreclose a mortgage shall not be advertised until the action has been instituted in accordance with . . .\u201d Md. Rule W72 or W73.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\">. Rule W72 c was also amended, effective July 1,1975. The substance of former Rule W71 d is now found in Rule W73. The \u201ctransplant\u201d of the substance of Rule W71 d to Rule W73 occurred July 1,1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b652-8\">. The effect of such a practice, it seems, was to save the mortgagor money. If the mortgagor prior to the filing of the foreclosure in the court, but after notice of advertising, could arrange to pay off the mortgage, or refinance or come to some mutually satisfactory terms with the mortgagee, the sale could be cancelled with a minimum of additional cost to the mortgagor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b652-9\">.
