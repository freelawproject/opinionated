When Christ said \u201cwhoever says to his brother \u2018Raca,\u2019 shall be liable to the Sanhedrin and whoever says, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u2018Thou fool!\u2019, shall be liable to the fire of Gehenna,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His opinion was not expressed <em>vis a vis </em>First Amendment rights as interpreted by the Supreme Court. While the danger of hell-fire is not lessened by each opinion that Court hands down, the dangers of retribution in this life certainly are. The courts historically \u2014 and more so contemporarily \u2014 have declined to restrict legally the freedoms of speech and press<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the extent they were morally restricted by the Christian religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">This perhaps arises from the origin of the action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defamation was treated initially as a dispute to be arbitrated by local seignorial courts in their super-parent roles. As these dissipated, along with the feudalism that sustained them, defamation fell under the aegis of the ecclesiastical courts where it was punished with a penance as a sin. While some defamatory tort action trickled into the civil courts during the sixteenth century, the marked metamorphosis had to await the historically renowned Court of the Star Chamber. The jurisdiction was not gracefully given over by the ecclesiastical courts and was even more grudgingly received from them, by the civil courts, on a case by case basis. With the abolition of the Star Chamber, however, common law courts assumed libel in its entirety, and slander more gradually.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">There continued to be recognized a difference between libel, which was criminal as well as tortious, and slander which was not criminal unless made punishable by statute. <em>Perkins on Criminal Law, </em>(2nd ed.), at 414. Although not as frequently expressed as in years past, the reverence given the printed word has continued to project libel as the more onerous tort. Indeed, as slander jurisdiction was eased upon the common law courts, they preserved the jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>barrier by requiring proof of \u201ctemporal\u201d damage. Prosser, <em>Law of Torts, </em>(4th ed.), at 754 citing Holdsworth, <em>Defamation in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">The distinction between the two torts has survived the Revolution and appears in Maryland case law in the form of a presumption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">\u201cThere is, however, a distinction between oral and written or printed defamation, and the presumption that words are defamatory arises much more readily in cases of libel than in cases of slander.\u201d <em>Bowie v. Evening News, </em>148 Md. 569, 574; See also <em>Greenbelt Coop. Pub. </em>Ass <em>\u2019n v. Bresler, </em>253 Md. 324, 355.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Beyond that presumption and the common sense maxim <em>\u201cscripta manent, verba </em>volent,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the primary recognition given the distinction <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> has been based on the extent of the defamation\u2019s dissemination resulting from the means of publication used.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">One further and basic difference retained is the emphasis placed in slander cases upon the type of damage allegedly done. Arising from the transitional requirement of proof of temporal damages, there arose a practice, if not a rule, that slander is not actionable unless actual damage is proven. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>From this grew certain exceptions which did not require allegations or proof of actual damages. They included imputation of a crime or of a loathsome disease and defamations affecting one in his calling. Maryland has added by statute the slander of a female by injuring her character or reputation for chastity. Cts. Art., Sec. 3-501, 502. This type of defamation was considered so obviously detrimental, no proof of any actual harm to reputation or any other damage was required for either nominal or substantial damages. Proof of the statement itself is considered to establish the existence of some damages, <em>i.e., per se, </em>and the jury is permitted, without other evidence, to estimate the amount. Prosser, <em>Law of Torts, </em>at 754. This oddity of tort law recognized as \u201cthe doctrine of presumed damages\u201d (although usually referred to as \u201cgeneral damages\u201d) is not applicable, however, to <em>less substantial slanderous utterances </em>which become actionable only by reason of some \u201cspecial damage\u201d <footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> (i.e., per quod) </em>whereby the claimant has been put to expense or inconvenience as a consequence of the defamatory language; or the loss of some benefit by reason of the wrongful utterance. Poe, <em>Pleading and Practice, </em>Tiffany Ed., Vol. 1, Sec. 174, at 132. Accord <em>General Motors v. Piskor, </em>27 Md. App. 95 at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The issue of whether the words used are in and of themselves damaging, <em>i.e., </em>actionable <em>per se, </em>is a matter of law for the court\u2019s determination. <em>American Stores v. Byrd, </em>229 Md. 5; <em>Piskor, supra, </em>at 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">In the absence of an alternative, the issue may be resolved as a pleading question by a demurrer. <em>Cf. Thompson v. Upton, </em>218 Md. 433. If a plaintiff asserts defamatory language which is not damaging in and of itself and fails to set forth (or to support by specific proof) special damages whereby he was injured <em>(per quod), </em>it follows that he cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Exemplary or punitive damages, as the name connotes, are rather a punishment for and deterrent to wrongdoing than a means of recompensing the victim. To the victim they are a windfall not necessarily related to the injury he has suffered. \u201cInstead, they are private fines levied by civil juries to punish reprehensible conduct and to deter its future occurrence.\u201d <em>Gertz v. Welch, </em>418 U. S. at 350, 41 L.Ed.2d at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The Court of Appeals early held that punitive damages are not proper in libel and slander cases, unless malice is shown on the part of defendant. <em>Snyder v. Fulton, </em>(1871) 34 Md. 128; <em>Fresh v. Cutter, </em>(1890) 73 Md. 87. Once again, however, the court\u2019s decision on whether the utterance was damaging <em>per se </em>may be significant in determining the propriety of punitive damages. Where the words <em>are </em>damaging <em>per se, </em>and there is nothing to rebut the imputation of malice, punitive damages as well as \u201cgeneral\u201d compensatory damages, may be awarded. <em>Shockey v. McCauley, </em>101 Md. 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Appellants,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> who were tenants in an apartment building, sued their corporate landlord, J.B.G. Properties, Inc. (J.B.G.) and the apartment manager, Alfred A. Flori (Flori) for slander and trespass. It appears that Mr. Flori and an assistant came to the Cheeks\u2019 apartment to perform plumbing repairs. An argument ensued in which Mr. Flori, in the presence of guests, was quoted by Mrs. Cheek as saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-9\">\u201c \u2018He wheeled and came up and said \u2018I have had it with you Cheeks, you have been nothing but trouble makers ever since you moved into the building. You can\u2019t control your kids and your son was out playing football and the football hit the window. I came out and the boy told me he could play where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>he wanted to.\u2019 I said T don\u2019t believe that.\u2019 He said T watched your daughter break branches off a $50 tree that I just bought.\u2019 I said T don\u2019t believe that.\u2019 He said \u2018It\u2019s true, I don\u2019t care whether you believe it or not.\u2019 I said \u2018Why didn\u2019t you say something to her if she was in the wrong.\u2019 He said T couldn\u2019t be bothered.\u2019 He said \u2018First of all, I thought it was a little girl out there playing football. I asked my wife if it was a boy or a girl and she said it was Joey Cheek.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">After this outburst she became emotional and went into her bedroom and called her husband. During the period of time between the incident and the trial she was in an emotional state at various times, apparently from this event. Mrs. Cheek was allowed to testify that she had to obtain a prescription for tranquilizers from her doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The jury returned a verdict on May 3, 1974 for each plaintiff against each defendant:</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">1. Aubrey A. Cheek, against:</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">a. Flori \u2014 $250 compensatory; $1250 punitive</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">b. J.B.G.\u2014 250 compensatory; 250 punitive</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">2. Debra Ann Cheek, against:</p>\n<p id=\"b55-13\">a. Flori \u2014 $250 compensatory; $1250 punitive</p>\n<p id=\"b55-14\">b. J.B.G.\u2014 250 compensatory; 250 punitive</p>\n<p id=\"b55-15\">3. Joseph Scott Cheek, against:</p>\n<p id=\"b55-16\">a. Flori \u2014 $250 compensatory; $1250 punitive</p>\n<p id=\"b55-17\">b. J.B.G.\u2014 250 compensatory; 250 punitive</p>\n<p id=\"b55-18\">4. Eugenia Sue Cheek, against:</p>\n<p id=\"b55-19\">a. Flori \u2014 $250 compensatory; $1250 punitive</p>\n<p id=\"b55-20\">b. J.B.G.\u2014 250 compensatory; 250 punitive</p>\n<p id=\"b55-21\">A motion for judgment n.o.v. or for a new trial \u201cor Remittitur\u201d was filed on May 6, 1974. On June 21, 1974 the motion was heard and\u2019decided. The trial judge denied the motion for a new trial although he candidly admitted that he \u201cwould have reached an entirely different result.\u201d While on the one hand noting the difficulty we often have of sensing the flavor of the case from the cold record,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>adopted a unique means of ameliorating the result he did not like. He decided that the jury wrongfully apportioned the punitive damages as between the two defendants. He decided that punitive damages were a \u201cjoint and several obligation\u201d and could not be apportioned by the jury. He therefore entered judgment n.o.v. for all those punitive damages which exceed $1000. In effect he reduced the punitive damages from a total of six thousand dollars from both defendants, to a total of one thousand dollars presumably to be divided equally among the four plaintiffs in the amount of $250 each.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Seven weeks later, acting sua sponte, he decided that the judgments he had directed be entered as reduced by him \u201cwere below the jurisdiction of [the] court\u201d and he therefore:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">\u201cORDERED, pursuant to Maryland Rule 625 that the Judgments heretofore entered in this case BE and the same ARE hereby vacated, and it is further ORDERED, pursuant to Maryland Rule 653 that judgments of non-pros shall be entered in this case on the final verdicts. ...\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The plaintiffs below (appellants here) were apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>satisfied with the verdict of the jury but question the action of the trial court following that verdict. They contend that the court\u2019s after-the-fact determination that punitive damages are not apportionable is error, that the entry of judgment n.o.v. reducing the punitive damages to the lowest common denominator was error, and that the entry of judgment non-pros pursuant to Md. Rule 653 was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Defendants below countered by cross-appeal. They contend here (among other things) that \u201cthe words alleged to have been spoken are not slander <em>per se </em>as a matter of law.\u201d Because the trial judge left that for the jury to determine as a matter of fact, rather than ruling upon it as a matter of law, we shall reverse. Cross-appellants\u2019 tangential issues need not be discussed; however, because we will remand for new' trial it is desirable if not necessary that we comment upon issues raised by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Slander <em>Per Se, </em>A Question of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The record reveals that the appellees, who have cross-appealed, excepted to the court\u2019s instruction on slander <em>per se.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">\u201cMR. ABELL: I would also like an exception to the slander <em>per </em>se; I don\u2019t think that the language that you can\u2019t control your children is specific enough to indicate the charge of any crime. Secondly, the instructions as it goes to the daughter of cutting down tree branches from trees, at her age it would not be a crime in any event. She was a juvenile and this would be my exception on that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Those portions of the judge\u2019s instructions relating to slander <em>per se </em>and the damages premised thereon were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-10\">\u201cThe first category of slander is what we call \u2018slander per quad\u2019 or quod, if you are a real purist in Latin. In order for the plaintiffs to recover for the utterance of defamatory words in this class, you must find all of the following. That they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>false, that they were spoken with malice, that they were published and that they caused some specific damage to the plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">Now, the words that are alleged to fall into this category are the statement \u2018You Cheeks have been nothing but troublemakers since you moved in\u2019, or words to that effect. Those words, if slanderous, are slanderous per quod. <em>The second category of slander is what we call \u2018Slander per se.\u2019 That translated means words as such are slanderous. In order for the plaintiffs to recover under this category, you must find only that the words were false and published and that they accused the plaintiffs or any of them of the commission of a crime intended to injure them and their reputation. </em>You will understand that if you accuse someone falsely of the commission of a crime, you have tended to injure his reputation, so the crucial part about these words of this type is that they must be false as well as published.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">Now, the statements that are alleged to fall into this category are the statements allegedly made by Mr. Flori to the effect that \u2018You can\u2019t control your children and I watched your daughter snap branches off a tree I paid $50 for just yesterday\u2019, or words to that effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">Compensatory damages in a slander case is divided into two parts. We will call the first part special damages. Those are damages which have actually occurred as the natural result of the wrong committed. They include money actually expended, time lost from work as well as pain and suffering, humiliation, mental anguish and so on. If you find that the words were slanderous per quod, those are the only kind of special damages that you can consider. If you find that there were words which were slanderous per se, you are also permitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>consider in addition to the special damages, general damages. These are damages which the law presumes must necessarily result from the publication of the defamatory matters. Even if there were no special damages shown, you may allow damages to the plaintiffs or any one of them for the value that you assign to the loss of reputation that you are satisfied has been proven as a result of the slander. In addition to the general damages and special damages, which are part of compensatory damages, you don\u2019t itemize or break them down, compensatory damages would be a single lump sum or figure encompassing either or both types of damages. In addition to that, the plaintiffs claim punitive damages. Compensatory damages as the name suggests are damages to compensate. Punitive damages on the other hand are damages designed to punish. You may not allow punitive damages unless you find some compensatory damages. If you find some compensatory damages, you will consider whether or not you will allow punitive damages. Punitive damages are designed to punish the defendants for the wrong they have done for two reasons. First, to warn them that they must not do it again and secondly that if anyone hears about their predicament would be dissuaded from doing similar things and getting in such a predicament themselves. If you find that the statements were slanderous per quod, made with malice <em>or if you find there were statements made slanderous per se, </em>which case you don\u2019t need malice, you may award punitive damages.\u201d [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">In <em>American Stores Co. v. Byrd, </em>229 Md. at 15, after a thorough analysis of the historical distinction between slander damaging <em>per se </em>and <em>per quod, </em>Judge Horney said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">\u201cWith respect to the further contention concerning actionability <em>per se, </em>we agree that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>ordinarily it is the responsibility of the court, when required to do so, to rule as a matter of law (and not the duty of the jury to find as a fact) whether the words and behavior of a speaker are actionable <em>per se. </em>But inasmuch as there was no objection to the instructions, we need <em>not </em>decide in this case whether the slanderous <em>per se </em>character of the alleged defamatory words and behavior were properly submitted to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">More recently Judge Levine quoted that same paragraph in <em>Montgomery Ward and Co. v. Cliser, </em>267 Md. 406, 423, but was able to avoid the issue for other reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">\u201cWe need not decide whether in this case the issue should have been decided by the court as a matter of law, since we have determined that the words and conduct were actionable per se.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">We are not so fortunate; here we must face the issue. The words and conduct were not damaging <em>per se </em>and timely exception was taken to the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Appellants contend that Mrs. Cheek was slandered <em>per se </em>since the assertion that she could not control her children charged a violation of Article 26, \u00a7 91<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (now Cts. Art., \u00a7 3-840) and that her children were slandered <em>per se </em>by the charge that they broke branches off of a fifty dollar tree. Appellants contend the latter is an indictable offense, although they do not tell us what one can be indicted for if one breaks twigs off of a tree. Presumably they assume the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>accusation charged some crime such as malicious destruction of property, Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 111. Even allowing for such an assumption, that accusation could hardly be said to have the ominous overtones that a charge in 1808 of poisoning another\u2019s horse would carry, and yet so harsh a charge as that was held not to be actionable <em>per se. Chaplin v. </em>Cruikshanks, 2 H &amp; J 247. The offending words must impute an indictable offense for which corporal punishment is the immediate penalty to be actionable in slander cases,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Griffin v. Moore, </em>43 Md. 246; <em>Dorsey v. Whipps, </em>8 Gill 457, and it is hardly likely under our current law and philosophy that the breaking off of a branch or branches of a fifty dollar tree would be such an offense even if the perpetrators had not been juveniles. Cts. Art., \u00a7 3-801, <em>et seq. </em>(former Art. 26, \u00a7 51.)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Nor do we see the charge that Mrs. Cheek could not control her children as a crime or as such an indictable offense. The juvenile law to which appellants point calls for \u201cwilful neglect\u201d of a parent before the offense is punishable and even then it falls under the juvenile jurisdiction of the circuit court. It is apparent that the language used was intended to offend, but it is certainly not language that the average lay person could construe as charging indictable offenses as a matter of law. <em>Pollitt v. Brush-Moore Newspapers, Inc., </em>214 Md. 570, 575; <em>Blumhardt v. Rohr, </em>70 Md. 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Since we do not know whether the jury verdict awarding punitive and compensatory damages was based on a <em>presumption </em>of malice arising from what it erroneously treated as a slanderous <em>per se </em>remark, that possibility requires that we reverse and remand for a new trial. An award of compensatory damages on a slander <em>per quod </em>theory would require proof, and a jury finding, of actual damages; an award of punitive damages upon that theory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>would require proof, and a jury finding of actual malice. <em>Fresh v. Cutter, </em>73 Md. at 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">As we have indicated, we see no purpose to be served in reviewing the contentions raised by cross-appellants on the issue of trespass. We are concerned with the procedural aftermath of the trial and the reasons given by the court for its action which were the essence of the direct appeal by plaintiffs below. Although our ultimate result would release us from the obligation of responding to the question of apportionment of punitive damages \u2014 as yet undecided in Maryland \u2014 or the unique procedural wake that flowed from the court\u2019s views on that question, we feel that in this instance to apply the \u201cLaw of Judicial Parsimony\u201d would result in a \u201cjudicial short change.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Judgment N.O.V.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">On June 21, 1974 the court heard cross-appellants\u2019 motion for judgment n.o.v. or, in the alternative, for a new trial. Reflecting upon the disparity between the punitive damages assessed against each of the defendants the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">\u201cIt is my understanding that punitive damages are joint and several obligations and therefore the verdict as to the punitive damages, and I am positive that the Court\u2019s instructions were to this effect, it should be a single verdict of the punitive damages. ... I am not prepared to upset the verdict on punitive damages but I think the law requires me to give Judgment N.O.V. for all these punitive damages which exceed $1,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-9\">Madam Clerk, the docket entries will show the fact of this hearing, that the motion for a new trial is overruled \u2014 and the motion for n.o.v. is granted as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>to the judgment of punitive damages only and only to the extent that that judgment would be reduced to the total of one thousand dollars to be entered jointly and severally against all defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">We find no authority for the use of judgment n.o.v. to reduce the verdict of the jury. The dispositional authority of the court on the motion heard is limited by Md. Rule 563.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">\u201cIf a verdict was returned, the court may allow the judgment to stand or may reopen the judgment, and either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed.\u201d Md. Rule 563 b 1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Although the court might have granted a conditional new trial, <em>i.e., </em>unless plaintiffs agreed to a remittitur, once the new trial was denied the judgment n.o.v. could only be granted or denied but could not be used to amend, reduce or alter a jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Apportionment of Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">It is apparent that the jurors below, without instruction by the court, apportioned the punitive damages among the defendants depending upon their differing degrees of culpability. It is equally clear from the reason assigned by the court for reducing the verdict that they did so contrary to the court\u2019s understanding of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">It is clear in Maryland, and appears to be generally recognized, that compensatory damages may not be apportioned among joint tort-feasors. The issue as to punitive damages is less clear in Maryland. Courts throughout the country which have met the punitive damages issue are divided. Annot. 20 A.L.R.3d 666. Of approximately eighteen jurisdictions, apportionment is favored two to one. We are persuaded that <em>Nance v. Gall, </em>187 Md. 656, 674 inclines us in the direction taken by the majority of states.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">Those jurisdictions favoring apportionment seem to rely on the reasonable view that a jury should be permitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>vary the damages depending upon the degree of culpability since punitive or exemplary damages are not compensation for injury; instead, they are private fines levied by civil juries to punish reprehensible conduct and to deter its future occurrence. <em>Cf., Gertz v. Welch, supra, </em>418 U. S. at 350, 41 L.Ed.2d at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Appellee directs our attention to a Supreme Court case which he argues \u201cdisallows an apportionment of punitive damages among joint to't feasors.\u201d <em>Washington Gaslight Co. v. Lansden, </em>172 U. S. 534. Our reading of that case does not provide us that conclusion. The issue there decided was whether evidence of the wealth of one joint tort-feasor could be introduced so as to subject another joint tort-feasor to unapportioned punitive damages based upon the affluent defendant\u2019s ability to pay. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">\u201cWhile all defendants joined are liable for compensatory damages, there is no justice in allowing the recovery of punitive damages in an action against several defendants, based on evidence of wealth and ability to pay such damages on the part of one defendant only.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">As to the issue of apportionment the Court indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\">\u201cWhat the true rule is in such case is not, perhaps, certain .... But we have no doubt it prevents evidence regarding the wealth of one of the defendants as a foundation for computing or determining the amount of damages against all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">Although the court below issued no instruction relating to apportionment and was not so requested by either party, it did instruct the jury to consider the financial standing of the appellees.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-11\">\u201cIn making your award of punitive damages, you will take into consideration what you know from the evidence in this case about the financial standing of the defendants. What may be nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>more than a drop in a bucket to a rich person may completely wipe out a poor man. What you are trying to do is punish him. In connection with that you have to arrive at an amount that is proper to punish him based upon the financial position you find from the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">If is apparent that if the jury is instructed to consider the wealth and affluence of the defendants for punitive damage assessment, the reasoning of <em>Washington Gaslight, supra, </em>is persuasive. Without apportionment of punitive damages, the admission of evidence of wealth of an affluent defendant can be devastating to an impecunious co-defendant who may well be far less culpable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">\u201cAnd the verdict enhanced by the evidence of the wealth of one defendant, might be collected from the defendant the least able to respond and the least culpable of all, who would thus be mulcted in punitive damages, the amount of which might have been measured by the evidence of wealth of another defendant.\u201d <em>Washington Gaslight, </em>172 U. S. at 552.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Such reasoning affirms our view that Maryland should be in the majority of states permitting apportionment of punitive</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Judgment Non-Pros</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">On August 14, 1974, nearly a month after the Notice of Appeal was filed by appellants, the trial judge filed the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-9\">\u201cThe Court discovered this date as a result of a review of the docket entries in this case in connection with a Motion for an Extension of time for filing the record in the Court of Special Appeals that this Court by mistake on June 21, 1974, directed the entry of Judgments in amounts which are below the jurisdiction of this Court. The Court is of the opinion that this mistake ought to be corrected. It is therefore this 14th day of August, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>1974, by the Circuit Court for Calvert County, Maryland</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">ORDERED, pursuant to Maryland Rule 625 that the Judgments heretofore entered in this case BE and the same ARE hereby vacated, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">ORDERED, pursuant to Maryland Rule 653 that Judgments of non-pros shall be entered in this case on the final verdicts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">AND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that the Clerk shall make appropriate correction of Judgment Records of this Court in accordance with this Order, nunc-pro-tunc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Proemially we point out that our further comments are desirable dicta rather than conclusively necessary since it is apparent that the appeal and cross-appeal to this Court, noted on July 18, 1974 and July 22, 1974, divested the lower court of authority to issue the order of August 14, 1974, nunc pro tunc or otherwise. <em>Bullock v. Director of Patuxent Institution, </em>231 Md. 629, 633.<footnotemark>12A</footnotemark> As a result of substantial changes in jurisdictional statutes, arising most recently out of the creation of the District Court and the consequent repeal of the jurisdictional statutes for Justices of Peace and related courts (found formerly in Md. Code, Art. 52, Secs. 5, et seq.), the consequences which may arise from an erroneous entering of the judgment non-pros presupposed by Rule 653, such as the instance before us, cause us to comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">Initially we note our inability to explain the reasoning of the lower court when applying Rule 653 (which is limited to a \u201cverdict of a jury\u201d) to a verdict arrived at by the court even assuming it had been \u201cbelow the jurisdiction of the court. . . .\u201d Furthermore, it is apparent that the rule does not provide an authority for judgment non-pros, but rather presupposing the absence of jurisdiction, it provides for what follows where one is entered. But see <em>H. J. McGrath Co. v. Wisner, </em>189 Md. 260, 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>It is unfortunate that the court below provided us with no foundation as to its reasoning for its order and we are equally distressed that counsel on either side provided us but cursory assistance justifying or decrying the order. We were told, however, that the $1,000 total to which the judge reduced the punitive damages was to be divided equally among the four appellants, <em>i.e., </em>$250 each. Thus each appellant would have received $250 compensatory and $250 punitive only. Since this totals $500, had that been all that each appellant <em>claimed, </em>it would not quite reach the sum permitting a jury trial as of right. Md. Const., Art. XY, Sec. 6, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">\u201cThe right of trial by Jury of all issues of fact in civil proceedings in the several Courts of Law in this State, where the amount in controversy exceeds the sum of five hundred dollars, shall be inviolably preserved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Cts. Art., Sec. 4-401 sets the monetary limit of District Court jurisdiction. Sec. 4-402 provides exceptions thereto which exceptions include subsection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">\u201c(e) <em>Jury trial. </em>\u2014 (1) In a civil action in which the amount in controversy exceeds $500, a party may demand a jury trial pursuant to the Maryland District Rules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">We can but surmise that the court below assumed either or both of these prerequisites to a right to jury trial as jurisdictional minimum limitations of amounts <em>recovered </em>in jury trials. The availability of the constitutional guarantee and its Code companion relating to District Court jurisdiction, is obviously dependent not on the size of the verdict, but on \u201cthe amount in controversy.\u201d (Here, that amount was substantially in excess of $500.)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">The jurisdictional statutes extant prior to the advent of the District Court varied from county to county; however, they were generally perceived to have been one hundred dollars. Md. Code (1972 Replacement Vol.) Art. 52, Sec. 6.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">\u201cIf the sum <em>claimed </em>in actions for redress for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>wrongs, or <em>recovered </em>in actions for the enforcement of contracts, <em>exceeds </em>one hundred dollars, justices of the peace have no jurisdiction. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">As a necessary extension of this doctrine it appears that where a people\u2019s court has exclusive jurisdiction of matters in excess of this amount, the law courts of Baltimore City and the circuit courts of the particular county are likewise without jurisdiction in any amount below the limit of exclusive jurisdiction in the inferior court. If the verdict shall be below the jurisdiction of the court and a <em>non pros </em>accordingly entered, the record is a bar to any action founded upon the same cause of action in any court the limit of whose jurisdiction is greater than the amount of the verdict; but the amount of the verdict, less any costs assessed against the plaintiff, constitutes a debt due by the defendant and is recoverable in any court (such as a people\u2019s court) or before any justice of the peace having jurisdiction to that amount.\u201d (Citing by footnote Md. Rule 653). 1 <em>Poe\u2019s Pleading and Practice, </em>Sixth Ed., Sec. 40.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Appellees here directed us to <em>Associates Discount v. Hillary, </em>262 Md. 570, 583 where Judge Barnes for the Court of Appeals applied Md. Rule 653 to a verdict of $19.91 and remanded the case for entry of judgment of non-pros presupposed by the rule, \u201cinasmuch as such verdict is below the jurisdictional amount of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.\u201d It seems apparent there, although left unsaid, that Judge Barnes alluded to then Md. Code, Art. 52, Sec. 12 which set forth. exclusive monetary jurisdictional limits for each of the counties\u2019 then justices of the peace and people\u2019s courts, wherein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">\u201c . . . the jurisdiction of the judges of the people\u2019s court shall be exclusive in civil cases involving amounts not exceeding $300.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">That statute was in full force and effect on June 25, 1971 when <em>Associates Discount v. Hillary, supra, </em>was decided, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>and was not repealed until the creation of the District Court in 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">With the advent of the District Courts, exclusive jurisdiction was given them over tort cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">\u201c ... if the . . . damages claimed do not exceed $5000.\u201d Cts. Art., Sec. 4-401.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">In addition to substantially having increased the monetary jurisdiction for the newly created District Court, the Legislature significantly clarified its \u201cexclusive original jurisdiction\u201d as being determined by the \u201cdamages claimed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\"><em>Associates Discount, supra, </em>would thus seem inapposite on its face to the present case. It related to entry of a non-pros judgment where the \u201cverdict\u201d of a jury was \u201cbelow the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d Since jurisdiction under the new District Court system is, by definition, a matter of claim rather than a matter of verdict, a non-pros does not appear appropriate by virtue of any existing jurisdictional statute. The trial judge here was seemingly misled by the exception to the District Court\u2019s general monetary jurisdiction contained in Cts. Art., Sec. 4-402 (e) (1) which reiterates in'jurisdictional context the constitutional right to a jury trial for amounts in controversy in excess of $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">We conclude that application of the rule to contemporary courts may very well be an anomaly, phrased as it is almost as its progenitor was originally enacted by the Laws of Maryland, 1888, Ch. 366. Nor are we persuaded that its current utility was affirmed by the Rules Committee when it was amended to substitute \u201cDistrict Court\u201d for \u201cPeoples Court\u201d as that transition became imminent. Such amendment may have resulted from a word search by a computer in the housecleaning of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">\n<em>Case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">\n<em>Costs to be paid one-half by appellants and one-half by appellees.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-7\">.
