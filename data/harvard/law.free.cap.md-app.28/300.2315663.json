Mills, appellant, was convicted of rape, armed robbery and two counts of kidnapping by a jury in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Shure, C. J. presiding), and received a twelve-year sentence. From the judgments entered thereon, he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">On July 13, 1974, in Gaithersburg, two married women, ages 22 and 23, were accosted at knife-point by a male who forced them to drive him in their car to a secluded, rural area where he robbed and raped one of them. He then compelled the victims to drive him back to Gaithersburg where he exhibited them to a number of the community residents,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> then left the car and walked away. After the women returned to the rape victim\u2019s apartment, where their husbands were awaiting their return from an errand, the police were called.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">The following day, Detective Thomas D. Evans took the rape victim in a police car through residential areas in Gaithersburg at which time she observed and identified the appellant, Clement F. Mills, as her attacker. Mills was arrested and taken to the Wheaton-Glenmont Police Station. He received his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and asked for an attorney\u2019s presence during interrogation. The police made two telephone calls but could not secure an attorney\u2019s services for appellant at that moment. Mills spoke with an attorney who had been assigned by the Public Defender to represent him in another matter but the latter explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>that he could not assist appellant in the instant case without formal authorization. Evans did not attempt thereafter to question Mills about the offenses. He desisted, he said, because the answers to any such questions would be inadmissible at trial, in view of Mills\u2019 request for an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Evans did, however, ask Mills for his address and for a specific and detailed description of the house where he resided \u2014 including the colors of the walls, floors and door of the room which he occupied. His purpose was apparently twofold: to complete a form pertaining to arrested individuals and to obtain information he believed necessary for the acquisition of a warrant to search Mills\u2019 residence for the knife described by the victims. Evans verified the address with Mills\u2019 uncle and an unidentified woman who came to the station house with the uncle on the afternoon of the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The next day, a District Court Judge in Montgomery County signed a search warrant and, upon execution, a 9-inch hunting knife with sheath was found in appellant's room. A pretrial motion to suppress was denied and the knife and sheath were identified at trial by the victims as having been used by their assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Prior to trial the State petitioned to have a sample of appellant\u2019s blood taken, representing that \u201cin order ... to go forward with certain evidence ... it is necessary to obtain a blood sample from the defendant to determine his blood group .... as necessary corroboration to other scientific evidence.\u201d This petition, filed on November 20, 1974, was styled a \u201cMotion for Appropriate Relief.\u201d It in no way complied with the standards pertaining to applications for search warrants found in Art. 27, Md. Code Annot. \u00a7 551 (1974 Supplement). On November \"21, 1974, the trial court ordered, without a hearing, that such sample be taken \u201cby the State of Maryland Department of Medical Examiners . ..; counsel for the defendant may be present.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>there was expert testimony, based upon the blood test, that both Mills\u2019 blood and the semen stains on the rape victim\u2019s clothing contained blood group factor A and that the victim also had type A blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Appellant had been identified on the street by the rape victim and at a lineup by the other victim of the kidnapping. Both of them had described a distinctive scar on appellant\u2019s forearm and the knife and sheath found pursuant to the search warrant. Appellant, his girlfriend, and two of her friends testified that he had been at his girlfriend\u2019s house during the time the offenses were being committed. A policeman testified that the girlfriend had previously made contrary statements to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Mills rests his appeal upon two grounds. He argues that the knife and sheath should not have been admitted into evidence because the application for the warrant did not establish probable cause for the search and certain of the facts recited in the application were obtained in a manner violative of <em>Miranda. </em>His second contention is that the evidence of the blood test was inadmissible because the blood sampling was a search and seizure and no search warrant had been obtained. We address these contentions in that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">I \u2014 THE KNIFE AND SHEATH</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Appellant contends that the knife and sheath should have been suppressed on the grounds that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">\u201c(a) The facts as recited in the application for the search warrant did not establish probable cause for the search, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\">(b) An essential portion of the facts were [sic] obtained from the appellant in violation of his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">We shall dispose of (b) first. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the details learned by Detective Evans after Mills had requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>an attorney were \u201cessential\u201d,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we are not persuaded that Mills\u2019 constitutional rights were abridged.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">At oral argument appellant\u2019s counsel urged upon this Court that <em>Everhart v. State, </em>274 Md. 459, 337 A. 2d 100 (1975), in which fruits of an unlawful search were held to have provided invalid affidavits supporting an application for a search warrant, rendered the instant search warrant, and therefore the admission into evidence of the knife and sheath, unlawful. We conclude otherwise. Simply put, there was no poisonous tree here. That portion of the warrant application which was based on Mills\u2019 answers to Evans\u2019 questions about the details of the residence was not tainted.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Indeed, the entire <em>Miranda </em>argument is inapposite since there was a singular lack of any admission, confession or other inculpatory statement on Mills\u2019 part. As a federal court observed, in respect of a warrant based on similar questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">\u201cThe place where [defendant] lived was, of course, not a matter within [his] exclusive knowledge, and he no doubt recognized that a little investigation by the officers would locate that place.\u201d <em>Farley v. United States, </em>381 F. 2d 357 (5th Cir. 1967).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-8\"><em>See, also, Clarke v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 447, 240 A. 2d 291 (1968) where Judge Morton, writing for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">\u201cThe questions were routine; were ordinarily addressed to every individual who was subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the booking procedure; and were not intended to elicit answers which would incriminate Appellant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">We thus do not find that the acquisition of information concerning Mills\u2019 residence violated Mills\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The remaining question is, therefore, whether the affidavit as presented demonstrated probable cause within its four corners, as required. We think that the law in Maryland is clear in this regard. In <em>Grimm v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 321, 251 A. 2d 230 (1969), <em>cert. denied </em>397 U. S. 1001 (1970) and <em>Reidy v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 169, 259 A. 2d 66 (1969) this Court found no defects in warrants issued to search residences where weapons used in the commission of recent crimes could reasonably be found. Chief Judge Murphy, in <em>Reidy, </em>where the affidavit related that an individual had been shot with a .22 caliber weapon and that there was a witness to the crime who identified the defendant as the perpetrator, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">\u201cWe think that it was reasonable, given the information set out in the application for the warrant, for police to believe that the gun used in the crime could be found in appellant\u2019s house.\u201d [Citing <em>Grimm.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">We reach the same conclusion concerning the knife and sheath in the instant case and therefore find no error in their admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">II \u2014 THE BLOOD TEST</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">It is clear that all blood tests are seizures subject to the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Mr. Justice Brennan, writing for the Supreme Court in <em>Schmerber v. California, </em>384 U. S. 757 (1966) noted, at 767, that \u201c[i]t could not reasonably be argued . . . that the administration of the blood test in this case was free of the constraints of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AMT\">Both the State and appellant here rely on <em>Schmerber. </em>In that case, as in most reported blood-test cases, the purpose of the test was to determine the alcoholic content of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>defendant\u2019s blood as a means of establishing his intoxication <em>vel non. </em>Since the alcohol level in human blood diminishes rapidly after the ingestion of alcohol ceases, the Court, in <em>Schmerber, </em>while finding that blood tests were within the scope of the Fourth Amendment, carved out an exception to the warrant requirement because the time necessary to seek out a magistrate and secure a warrant could lead to the dissipation of evidence. <em>Preston v. United States, </em>376 U. S. 364 (1964). That such immediacy is not involved when the objective of a blood test is the determination of blood type rather than alcohol content seems self-evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Indeed, the permanence of blood types has been judicially noticed in <em>Graves v. Beto, </em>301 F. Supp. 264 (E.D. Tex. 1969),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> aff'd 424 F. 2d 524 (5th Cir. 1970) and <em>Commonwealth v. Davenport, </em>308 A. 2d 85 (Pa. 1973). In each of these cases it was held to have been error for the results of a Mills-like blood test to have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In <em>Graves, </em>a convicted rapist who had exhausted his State remedies sought a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>in a United States District Court. That Court held that an unconsented,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> warrantless test for blood type was an unlawful search and seizure and the writ issued. District Judge Justice quoted <em>Schmerber </em>as to the necessity of a warrant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">\u201cSearch warrants are ordinarily required for searches of dwellings, and <em>absent an emergency, </em>no less could be required where intrusions into the human body are concerned.\u201d 301 F. Supp. at 265. [Italics in Graves.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">In <em>Davenport </em>the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that a murder conviction could not stand where it was based in part on a warrantless blood typing. The Court cited <em>Schmerber </em>concerning the propriety of warrantless searches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>where evidence was threatened with destruction and <em>Cupp v. Murphy, </em>412 U. S. 291 (1973) regarding the need to \u201cpreserve the highly evanescent evidence\u201d (fingernail scrapings) at issue there. Justice Pomeroy then observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">\u201cNo such dangers, however, excused the warrant requirement here. <em>Whereas the percentage of alcohol in the bloodstream begins to diminish shortly after drinking stops and a person can easily scrub his hands to destroy incriminating evidence, the blood type of an individual never changes. </em>Similar characteristics of fingerprints prompted the Supreme Court of the United States in Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U. S. 721, 728 .. . (1969) to hold that \u2018the general requirement that the authorization of a judicial officer be obtained in advance of detention would seem not to admit of any exception in the fingerprinting context.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) At 87, 88</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">We agree that there is no exigent-circumstances exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment where the State desires to test an individual\u2019s blood type. It was error for the trial court to order the blood test without strict compliance with the warrant requirements contained in Art. 27, Md. Code Annot. \u00a7 551 (1974 Supplement). As Judge Gilbert stated for this Court in <em>Robinson v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 678, 308 A. 2d 734 (1973), \u201cWe think the withdrawal of appellant\u2019s blood . . . was violative of the appellant\u2019s constitutional rights. . . .\u201d At 694, 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Upon careful examination of the record, however, we find that the appellant in this case has effectively waived his right to object to the admission in evidence of the blood test results because they were not brought out in the first instance by the State but came in, on redirect examination by the State of its expert witness, only after the subject of blood tests had been opened up by appellant\u2019s trial counsel on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">After the serologist was qualified as an expert witness, his testimony was limited on direct examination entirely to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>point that he had found semen stains on the pants and \u201cpanties\u201d of the victim. Thus he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">\u201cQ All right, and did you subsequently conduct an examination on those two items?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">A Yes, sir; I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">Q And what were the results of your examination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">A First of all, on . .. the area of the crotch in the panties, ... I identified the presence of semen containing spermatozoa, the male reproductive cells.... [I]n the same area, the crotch of the pants, I also identified semen containing spermatozoa, once again the male reproductive cells.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">MR. HICKEY: I have no further questions, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">Immediately thereafter, on cross examination by the defense, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-11\">\u201cQ Agent Gavin, did you conduct any other examinations in this case, other than on the two specimens that you have just testified about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-12\">A Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-13\">Q And those examinations were of items submitted to you also by Detective Swain?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-14\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-15\">Q What other kinds of examinations did you conduct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-16\">A Examined other articles of clothing to determine the possibility of the presence of-either blood or semen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-17\">Q What articles of clothing did you examine, if you recall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-18\">A The other articles would be a sweater and a brassiere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Q And what was the result of your examination of those articles?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">A On the sweater ... I determined that human blood was present; however, it was too limited in quantity to conduct any grouping tests upon it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">Q Where was the blood on the sweater?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">A Blood was in, around the neck of the sweater.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">Q Around the neck of the sweater?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">A Towards the top of the sweater, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-10\">Q But you were not able to type it, or tell anything further about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-11\">A That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-12\">Q Now, in examining the semen that you identified, or testified to on direct examination was on the girl\u2019s pants and panties, <em>were you able to tell anything else about the semen, other than that it contained spermatozoa?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-13\">A <em>Yes, sir. I was.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-14\">Q <em>What else could you telVl</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-15\">A In examining the dried stains of other body fluids, sometimes it is possible to determine the presence of a blood group in the dried stain. About eighty-five percent of the population are what we call secretives. They secrete their blood group factors in other body fluids, not just blood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-16\">In examining [the victim\u2019s clothing], <em>I determined in the semen stain the presence of A blood group factor.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-17\">Q Now, could you determine that the stain was semen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-18\">A Yes, sir; I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-19\">Q Is it possible that the stain could have been vaginal fluid or anything of that kind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>A (No response.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">Q Or mixed in with the semen somewhat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">A It is not possible for me to tell the presence of vaginal fluid, and that is why in determining the blood group, I do not report it as semen originating from an individual who is A, but simply the presence of the A blood group factor, because the possibility of the presence of semen mixed with vaginal fluid does exist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Only after the aforegoing sequence of examination did the State, on redirect examination, advert to the blood test. The witness was asked by the State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">Q Mr. Gavin, did you conduct an analysis of a sample of blood submitted to you, marked Clement Franklin Mills?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-9\">A Yes, sir; I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-10\">Q All right, and did you conduct an analysis of that blood for a blood type?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-11\">A Yes, sir; I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-12\">Q And what was the conclusion of that analysis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-13\">A The liquid sample of blood identified to me as having originated from Clement Franklin Mills was determined to be group A blood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-14\">MR. HICKEY: No further questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-15\">On recross, the serologist was also asked to give testimony concerning the victim\u2019s blood type:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-16\">\u201cQ Special Agent Gavin, did you also take a blood sample from the [victim] in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-17\">A Yes, sir; I did receive a blood sample from her. I didn\u2019t take it personally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-18\">Q Did you examine it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-19\">A Yes, sir; I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-20\">Q What type blood was she?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-21\">A She was also determined to be group A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Q What percentage of the population has group A blood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">A Right now it\u2019s approximately forty percent of the population in the United States have group A blood.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">It is well established in Maryland that error cannot be asserted where the evidence whose admission constitutes the alleged error is elicited by appellant\u2019s counsel. <em>Welsh v. Welsh, </em>248 Md. 619, 237 A. 2d 739 (1968); <em>Bean v. State, </em>234 Md. 432, 199 A. 2d 773 (1964); <em>Eastern Shore Brokerage and Commission Co. v. Messenger, </em>143 Md. 221, 122 A. 18 (1923); <em>Gray v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 478, 271 A. 2d 390 (1970); <em>Tierney v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 56, 253 A. 2d 528 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Since appellant, rather than the State, caused the results of the unconstitutional blood test to be brought before the jury, we find that his claim of error is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-10\">. The rape victim testified that appellant had told her that the purpose of the exhibition was to permit his \u201cpartners\u201d to \u201cget\u201d the women if they went to the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\">. Appellant\u2019s counsel did not move to vacate or set aside the trial court\u2019s order but filed, on November 21, 1974, \u201cDefendant\u2019s Objection to Order of Court dated November 21,1974.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b324-10\">. There is a wealth of authority in other jurisdictions in direct support of the proposition that a search warrant concerning a multiple unit building is not fatally unspecific where it contains no more than the street address of the building and the name of the party whose unit is to be searched. <em>See, e.g., </em>State v. Gallo, 279 So. 2d 71 (Fla. App. 1973); People v. Mayfield, 217 N.E.2d 100 (Ill. App. 1966); In re G. 314 N.Y.S.2d 547 (N.Y. Cty. Family Ct.1970); State v. Cortman, 446 P. 2d 681 (Ore. 1968); and Manley v. Commonwealth, 176 S.E.2d 309 (Va. 1970). In Maryland, the Court of Appeals has held that where the affidavit described one room and the warrant authorized a search of the entire premises, the warrant was not defective. Tucker v. State, 244 Md. 488, 224 A. 2d 111 (1966), <em>cert. denied </em>386 U. S. 1024 (1967). This Court has found no fatal defect in a warrant pertaining to an entire building where the police were directed to the defendant\u2019s room immediately upon entry. Butler v. State, 19 Md. App. 601, 313 A. 2d 554 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b326-9\">. \u201cThe court takes judicial notice of the fact that human blood groupings are genetic in their character and not subject to change; hence, there could have been no emergency in connection with the obtaining of the blood sample from petitioner.\u201d 301 F.
