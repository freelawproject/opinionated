Section 19 of the article divides the State into eight Judicial Circuits. From two to five counties comprise each of the first seven Circuits, and Baltimore City constitutes the eighth. Section 1 of the article vests the \u201cJudicial power\u201d of the State in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>certain enumerated courts, including \u201cCircuit Courts\u201d and \u201csuch Courts for the City of Baltimore, as are hereinafter provided for.\u201d Section 20 provides for a Circuit Court for each county, \u201cto be styled the Circuit Court for the County, in which it may be held\u201d, with jurisdiction over law and equity actions and criminal causes. Section 27 provides for the Courts of the City of Baltimore: \u201cThere shall be in the Eighth Judicial Circuit, six Courts, to be styled the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City, the Superior Court of Baltimore City, the Court of Common Pleas, the Baltimore City Court, The Circuit Court of Baltimore City and the Criminal Court of Baltimore.\u201d The jurisdiction of these Courts is set out in \u00a7 28: \u201cThe Superior Court of Baltimore City, the Court of Common Pleas, and the Baltimore City Court shall, each, have concurrent jurisdiction in all civil common law cases, and concurrently, all the jurisdiction which the Superior Court of Baltimore City and the Court of Common Pleas now have, . . .\u201d with designated exceptions which do not derogate from their general jurisdiction over actions at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">In article 20 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of Maryland the People of the State declared \u201cThat the trial of facts, where they arise, is one of the greatest securities of the lives, liberties and estate of the People.\u201d But the Constitution also recognizes that a party may not be able to have a fair and impartial trial in the court in which a case is pending. With respect to an action at law, article IV, \u00a7 8 provides that it will be \u201c. . . transmitted to some other Court having jurisdiction in such case for trial. . .\u201d, \u201c. . . upon suggestion in writing under oath of either of the parties to said proceedings that such party cannot have a fair and impartial trial in the court in which the same may be pending....\u201d Thus, a party in a law action, upon suggestion properly made, had one absolute right of removal to another court having jurisdiction. The right may be subject to reasonable procedural restraint to promote the administration of justice. <em>Dillon v. White\u2019s Ferry, Inc., </em>268 Md. 118 (1973); <em>Shreffler v. Morris, </em>262 Md. 161 (1971). Maryland Rule 542 implements the constitutional provisions and sets out the procedural regulations governing the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>of removal. <em>Bullock v. State, </em>230 Md. 280 (1962). Among other procedures, it requires, as does the Constitution, that the suggestion for removal be in writing under oath of either of the parties to the action. It also specifies that the suggestion may not be of counsel. Rule 542, \u00a7 a 1. Section 3 of the Rule provides that the right of removal is waived unless the written suggestion is filed within 60 days after the action is at issue. See <em>Caledonian Fire Ins. Co. v. Traub, </em>86 Md. 86 (1897). Thereafter, an action may be removed only by order of court for good cause shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Section 1 of Amendment XIV to the Constitution of the United States prohibits a state from denying to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">It was the interplay of these constitutional provisions which provided the basis on which the Court of Appeals, in <em>Davidson v. Miller, </em>276 Md. 54 (1975), held that the provisions of article IV, \u00a7 8, pertaining to removal of civil actions at law violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and, therefore, was unenforceable \u201cso long as the present multiple civil common law court system exists in Baltimore City.\u201d 276 Md. at 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Judicial Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">It was early decided by the Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> steadfastly followed,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and recently affirmed,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 4that the transfer of an action at law from one of the law courts of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City to another of the law courts of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City \u201cgratifies the constitutional provision of a removal to some other court having jurisdiction.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Johnson v. State, </em>258 Md. 597, 600-603 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>(1970) declared that a case is removed, not to be heard before another judge, but to be tried in a different locality, to rid the trial of the influence of such community or local bias or prejudice as would manifest itself in the locality in which the case originated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> *** The appellants in <em>Middleton v. Morgan, </em>263 Md. 154, 156 (1971) relied upon this in contending that the Baltimore City practice of \u201ca removal from one court in Baltimore to another does not gratify the purpose and desired effect of the constitutional provision.\u201d They recognized that the rule of law then existing was flatly against their contention, but they strongly urged \u201cthat the case should be distinguished because in 1882 each court in Baltimore drew its own panel of jurors and in 1971, although each court has its own panel, all the jurors are treated as a pool and may sit from time to time in any court.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 156. The Court was not persuaded. It said, at 158:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\">\u201cIt is clear that the basis of decision in <em>Weis kittle </em>was not that each court in the City drew its own panel of jurors (this being no more than a passing observation), but that each court in the City was a distinct and separate court within a circuit and since the Constitution does not require a removal to be to a court without the circuit, a removal within the City gratified the constitutional right of removal.... In 1971 as in 1882 Baltimore City is still a circuit and the various courts within that circuit are still separate and distinct. We find <em>Weiskittle </em>to be controlling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The petitioners <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in <em>Davidson </em>made substantially the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>claim, but presented it in a different posture. Whereas <em>Middleton </em>had simply affirmed the position of the Court of Appeals that the transfer of an action at law from one Baltimore City law court to another satisfied the removal provisions of the Constitution of Maryland, the petitioners in <em>Davidson </em>contended, not that such practice violated the Maryland Constitution, but that it denied them the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States. Reassessing its view of article IV, \u00a7 8, in this light, a majority of the Court of Appeals<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ***7 concluded that equal protection of the laws was indeed denied when, as to Baltimore City, the absolute right of removal permitted an action at law to be removed from one law court to another within the City, while, as to each county, the transfer of such action was from one county to another county. The Court held, therefore, that \u201cthe portion of Article IV, section 8, which reads \u2018and in all suits or actions at law, issues from the orphans\u2019 court, or from any court sitting in equity\u2019 and the other language relating to this ... [as well as the language in Rule 542 relating thereto] is unenforceable so long as the present multiple civil common law court system exists in Baltimore City.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 276 Md. at 82. The effect of the holding was, in the words of Chief Judge Murphy in his dissent, \u201cto excise all those provisions from \u00a7 8 of Art. IV of the Constitution of Maryland which afford litigants in civil law cases an automatic right of removal to another court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>upon mere suggestion in writing, under oath, that a fair and impartial trial cannot otherwise be obtained. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\n<em>THE INSTANT CASE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">On 5 September 1974 Atlantic Construction &amp; Supply Company (Atlantic) instituted an action <em>ex contractu </em>in the Circuit Court for Talbot County against John Gordon First-man and Joyce Firstman, his wife, (the Firstmans) by the filing of a declaration. On 14 October the Firstmans pleaded the general issue and further answered, averring that they did all things required of them under the contract but that it had been breached by Atlantic. Appended to the answer was a counterclaim to which Atlantic pleaded the general issue on 25 October 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Atlantic attempted three times to have the action removed. The first two times the suggestion was improper in form.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The third Suggestion for Removal was filed on 24 December 1974, and the same day the court ordered the action removed to the Circuit Court for Caroline County for trial. On 26 December the Firstmans moved that the Suggestion for Removal not be received because it was filed too late. On 30 December they moved to strike the order of 24 December, giving for reasons that the Suggestion for Removal was not timely filed and that the order was entered without allowing them time to respond thereto. On 23 January 1975 the court found upon hearing that the Suggestion for Removal had been timely filed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It denied the Motion to Strike and affirmed its order of 24 December 1974 removing the cause to the Circuit Court for Caroline County for trial. The Firstmans noted an appeal from the order of 23 January 1975 denying their Motion to Strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>The Status <em>of the </em>Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">On 21 April 1975, this Court, upon its own motion, dismissed the appeal as prematurely taken. On 2 May the Firstmans moved that we reconsider and rescind our order of dismissal. Upon reconsideration, we concluded that we erred in dismissing the appeal, and on 13 May we rescinded our order. We explain why we did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Ordinarily, a party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil case by a circuit court, Courts Art. \u00a7 12-301, which includes the various Supreme Bench courts, Courts Art. \u00a7 12-101 (d). The Court of Appeals said flatly in <em>Dunnigan v. Cobourn, </em>169 Md. 110, 113 (1935):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">\u201cThe right of removal is conferred by article 4, section 8, of the Constitution of Maryland, and its denial or abridgement is ground for direct appeal. <em>Griffin v. Leslie, </em>20 Md. 15, 19, 20; <em>Negro Jerry v. Townshend, </em>2 Md. 274, 277; <em>Wright v. Hammer, </em>5 Md. 370, 375; <em>Kimball v. Harman, </em>34 Md. 401, 407; <em>McMillan v. State, </em>68 Md. 307, 308, 309, 12 A. 8; <em>Seth v. Chamberlaine, </em>41 Md. 186, 195; <em>Gittings v. State, </em>33 Md. 458, 462; <em>Condon v.

Dunn, </em>245 Md. 651 (1967), a non-jury action at law was removed at the instance of the plaintiff from the Superior Court of Baltimore City to the Circuit Court for Carroll County. The defendant\u2019s motion for recision of the order was denied and the defendant appealed. The Court observed, at 653:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">\u201cThe sole issue to be decided is whether the court had the power of removal under the circumstances. The appellee originally sought to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the order appealed from was interlocutory but now concedes that it was final and appealable under <em>Dunnigan v. Cobourn, </em>169 Md. 110, 113; <em>McMillan v. State, </em>68 Md. 307, 308; <em>Elliott v. Larrimore, </em>203 Md. 526, 528.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>The power of a court to remove an action is to be distinguished from the discretion of a court exercised in determining to which court a case shall be removed. The latter is an interlocutory action and will be reviewed only after final judgment. <em>Middleton v. Morgan, supra, </em>at 158-159. Here, the issue was whether the court below had the power to grant Atlantic an automatic removal in the circumstances. The court\u2019s action thereon is ground for direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The Propriety of the Suggestion for Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">It is manifest that at the time of the order of 24 December 1974 removing the action from Talbot County to Caroline County for trial, Atlantic was entitled to the removal as a matter of right if there was compliance with the procedural regulations. The only question with regard to such regulations was whether Atlantic waived its absolute right of removal by failing to file a suggestion within 60 days after the action was at issue as required by Rule 542, \u00a7 a 3. The suggestion was not filed within 60 days of the date of the filing of the plea by the Firstmans to the declaration. It was filed on the sixtieth day from the filing of the answer by Atlantic to the counterclaim. We think that the action here was at issue within the contemplation of Rule 542, \u00a7 a 3, on 25 October 1974 when the answer to the Firstman\u2019s counterclaim was filed by Atlantic, and not on 14 October 1974, when the answer to Atlantic\u2019s declaration was filed by the Firstmans. In <em>Warchall v. Murphy, </em>23 Md. App. 424, 429 (1974), we found that \u201cit necessarily follows to obtain the patent objective of Rule 542, \u00a7 a 3, that a responsive pleading which brings an action to issue is a plea, responding to an original pleading, which is filed with the object of bringing the action to factual issue or to trial, that is, a plea going to the merits \u2014 a plea in bar.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We think that here it was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>answer to the counterclaim which was the plea going to the merits which brought the action to factual issue, that is, the filing of that plea put the case in the posture of being ready for trial. See generally <em>Elliott v. Larrimore, </em>203 Md. 526 (1954). As the suggestion was filed within 60 days from the filing of this plea, there was no waiver of the right of removal. See Rule 8. Therefore, Atlantic was entitled, under the status of the law on 24 December 1974, to an absolute right of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The Effect of <em>Davidson v. </em>Miller, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Our conclusion that the action of the court below, in ordering the case removed for trial, and in denying a motion to rescind its order so doing, was proper under the law in effect on 24 December 1974, is not dispositive of this appeal. Pending the appeal, the law changed. The action of the court below was predicated upon the absolute right of Atlantic to have the cause removed as prescribed by the Constitution of Maryland. The constitutional provisions requiring the action taken by the court below are no longer enforceable by the dictate of <em>Davidson v. Miller, supra, </em>which, as we have indicated, declared that the constitutional provision as to absolute right of removal was unenforceable \u201cso long as the present multiple civil common law court system exists in Baltimore City.\u201d We take judicial knowledge that it still exists. The question is, then, what effect does the <em>Davidson </em>holding have on the propriety of the order of 24 December 1974 transferring the action to Caroline County for trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>The right of removal of an action was the subject of the appeal in <em>Price v. Nesbitt, </em>29 Md. 263 (1868). \u201cAn action of ejectment was instituted in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, and upon the suggestion of the plaintiffs lessors, was removed to the Superior Court of Baltimore, in the year 1863. Shortly thereafter, on the 14th of September 1863, a suggestion for removal was made by one of the defendants, supported by affidavit that he could not have a fair and impartial trial, and asking that the cause might be removed \u2018to any Circuit Court authorized by the Acts of Assembly.\u2019 An answer resisting this application and traversing the averment of the suggestion, was not filed until the 14th of October, 1865, and thereupon the court (Martin, J.) overruled the suggestion for removal.\u201d The Court of Appeals found that under art. IV, \u00a7 9, of the Constitution of 1864, and the Act of 1865, ch. 187, then in force, the judgment of the lower court was right and proper. But art. IV, \u00a7 8, of the Constitution of 1867, and the Act of 1868, ch. 180, thereafter enacted, largely extended the right of removal, so that under the law existing at the time the case was before the Court of Appeals, the denial of the suggestion for removal was wrong and improper. It was argued that the appeal must be governed and decided by existing laws at the time of consideration by the appellate court without regard to what were the provisions of the former law. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-4\">\u201cIn <em>U. S. v. Sch\u2019r Peggy, </em>1 Cranch, 110, Chief Justice Marshall says: \u2018It is, in the general, true that the province of an appellate court is only to inquire whether a judgment when rendered was void or not. But if subsequent to the judgment, and before the decision of the appellate court a law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>intervenes, and positively changes the rule which governs, the law must be obeyed or its obligation denied.\u2019 This doctrine has been recognized and settled by this court in <em>Atwell v. Grant, </em>11 Md. 104; <em>State v. Norwood, 12 </em>Md. 206; <em>Keller v. State, 12 </em>Md. 326, and will be applied to the decision of this case.\u201d 29 Md. at 266.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">It reversed the judgment, finding, under existing laws, that the appellant was entitled to a removal of the cause. The same rule was set out and applied in <em>Wade v. St. Mary\u2019s Industrial School, </em>43 Md. 178 (1875), the Court stating, at 181:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">\u201cIt is a settled doctrine, that courts in deciding questions arising before them, will look to the law as it is at the time, and are not to be governed by what it may have been \u2014 unless proceedings under a prior existing law had been complete, or rights had become vested. This principle has been held to apply as well to cases before an appellate court, as to those that are pending in courts of original jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">To like effect see <em>Turner v. Bryan, </em>83 Md. 373, 374 (1896); <em>Cockerham v. Children\u2019s Aid Society, </em>185 Md. 97, 102 (1945); <em>Woman\u2019s Club v. State Tax Comm., </em>195 Md. 16, 19 (1949); <em>Yorkdale v. Powell, </em>237 Md. 121, 124 (1964). See also <em>Young v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 538, 554, and n. 12 at 555-556 (1972).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court put it thus in <em>Yorkdale v. Powell, supra, </em>at 124:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-12\">\u201cMaryland consistently has followed the rule that \u2018an appellate court is bound to decide a case according to existing laws, even though a judgment rightful when rendered by the court below should be reversed as a consequence,\u2019 as Judge Marked, for the Court, repeated in <em>Woman\u2019s Club v. State Tax Comm., </em>195 Md. 16, 19 (or, it may be noted, even when a judgment wrong when rendered is made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>right by the change in the law). See also for this proposition that a change in the law after a decision below and before final decision by the appellate Court will be applied by that Court unless vested or accrued substantive rights would be disturbed or unless the legislature shows a contrary intent, <em>Keller v. State, </em>12 Md. 322; <em>Day v. Day, </em>22 Md. 530; <em>Gordy v. Prince, </em>175 Md. 688; <em>Cockerham v. Children\u2019s Society, </em>185 Md. 97; and <em>Tudor Arms Apts. v. Shaffer, </em>191 Md. 342.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The quote from <em>United States v. Schooner Peggy, </em>1 Cranch 103, set out in <em>Price v. Nesbitt, supra, </em>is enlarged in <em>Linkletter v. Walker, </em>381 U. S. 618 (1965) at 626 and in n. 8 at 623. This additional language appears: \u201c... the court must decide according to existing laws, and if it be necessary to set aside a judgment . . . which cannot be affirmed but in violation of law, the judgment must be set aside.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The opinion of the Court in <em>Linkletter </em>went back to the common law, at 622-623:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">\u201cAt common law there was no authority for the proposition that judicial decisions made law only for the future. Blackstone stated the rule that the duty of the court was not to \u2018pronounce a new law, but to maintain and expound the old one.\u2019 1 Blackstone, Commentaries 69 (15th ed. 1809).\u201d (footnotes deleted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The Court observed, at 623:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">\u201cThis Court followed that rule in Norton v. Shelby County, 118 U. S. 425, 6 S. Ct. 1121, 30 L. Ed. 178 (1886), holding that unconstitutional action \u2018confers no rights; it imposes no duties; it affords no protection; it creates no office; it is, in legal contemplation, as inoperative as though it had never been passed.\u2019 At 442, 6 S. Ct. at 1125.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>The Court concluded, at 627, that under its cases it appeared \u201cthat a change in the law will be given effect while a case is on direct review\u201d, and \u201c[t]hat no distinction was drawn between civil and criminal litigation... \u201d, citing cases. It noted, at 628: \u201cWhile the cases discussed above deal with the invalidity of statutes or the effect of a decision overturning long-established common-law rules there seems to be no impediment \u2014 constitutional or philosophical \u2014 to the use of the same rule in the constitutional area where the exigencies of the situation require such an application.\u201d It believed \u201cthat the Constitution neither prohibits nor requires retrospective effect.\u201d At 629. See <em>Wiggins v. State, </em>275 Md. 689 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The short of it is that in reviewing the propriety of the action of the lower court in this case, we apply the law as declared in <em>Davidson v. Miller, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">When the holding of <em>Davidson </em>is applied to the order issued by the trial court on 23 January 1975, wherein it denied the motion to strike the order of 24 December 1974 removing the case to Caroline County for trial and expressly affirmed the removal order, it is patent that the order was improper. Without question, the denial and affirmance were predicated upon the absolute constitutional right of Atlantic to have the action removed, a right to be granted automatically upon proper suggestion, which the court found had been made. But <em>Davidson </em>declared that the constitutional provision bestowing the right could not be constitutionally enforced, so that in legal contemplation it was as inoperative as though it had never been adopted. We vacate the order of 23 January 1975 and the order of 24 December 1974. Maryland Rule 1075, \u00a7 a.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Our vacating the order of 24 December 1974 removing the action to the Circuit Court for Caroline County for trial, places the case back in the Circuit Court for Talbot County, but it does not dispose of this appeal. The majority in <em>Davidson </em>hastened to point out, 276 Md. at 83, that the effect of the ruling \u201cwill in no way deprive or otherwise curtail the circuit courts of the counties or the circuit-level civil courts of Baltimore City from exercising their common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>law discretionary power (which is subject to appellate review for abuse) to remove an action to another jurisdiction, within or without the circuit, in order to rid the case of any prejudicial barnacles which, because of local prejudice, passion or interest, may have attached; thus, as near as is reasonably possible, an action\u2019s consideration by a fair and impartial jury can be insured. <em>Shreffler v.

State, </em>8 Gill 295 (1849).\u201d Thus, despite the unenforceability of the automatic, absolute right of removal provided by the Constitution of Maryland, a party to a law action, having made proper suggestion that he cannot have a fair and impartial trial in the court in which the action is pending, is entitled to the opportunity to make it satisfactorily appear to that court that such suggestion is true, or that there is a reasonable ground that it is true. If he succeeds in making it so appear, the case should be removed in the sound exercise of judicial discretion. We, therefore, remand the case to the Circuit Court for Talbot County with direction that, if Atlantic so desires, a hearing be conducted within such reasonable time as that court may designate. At the hearing, Atlantic shall be afforded the opportunity to show that its suggestion that it cannot have a fair and impartial trial in the Circuit Court for Talbot County, is true or that there is reasonable ground that it is true, and the Firstmans shall be afforded the opportunity to contravene the truth of the suggestion. Upon the hearing, the court below shall take such action with respect to the suggestion as is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\n<em>Order of 23 January 1975 vacated; order of 24 December 1974 vacated; case remanded for further proceedings pursuant to this opinion; costs to be paid one-half by appellants and one-half by appellee; mandate to issue forthwith.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-8\">.
