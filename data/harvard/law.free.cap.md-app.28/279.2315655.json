The first query we must answer is a procedural matter, <em>i.e., </em>has the second substantive issue been preserved for our review? If we resolve the first problem in appellant\u2019s favor, we must then decide whether the trial judge improperly refused to allow cross-examination of the prosecuting witness, which said examination was to have been grounded on an alleged prior inconsistent statement made by the prosecutrix to a public defender investigator. The transcript reveals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">\u201cQ. [By Mr. Keane, Appellant\u2019s Counsel] Josie, do you recall having met a gentleman whose name is Howard Campbell in the last couple of days?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-8\">Q. And did you talk with him about this incident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-10\">Q. Do you recall him asking you about what time did you meet him on February 11? Do you recall Mr. Campbell having asked you the following question: \u2018About what time did you meet him on February 11, 1974, the day of this alleged offense? \u2019 Do you recall \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-11\">MR. KRAVETZ [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-12\">THE WITNESS: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-13\">MR. KRAVETZ: The question is misleading as to the date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-14\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t know. Is it a deposition or something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-15\">MR. KEANE: It is a statement she made to Howard Campbell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-16\">THE COURT: Well, first read her what she said, then ask her if she said it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Q. Do you recall him asking you such a question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">A. No. He asked a question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">Q. Josie, let me show you a document, and you read part of it and just tell me if it refreshes your memory at all. You read this question. Disregarding the date, read what is marked A as your answer. Read that over and see if it refreshes your memory at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">Josie, do you remember what the defendant was drinking when you were sitting at the table with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">Q. Could it have been Bloody Marys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-10\">A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-11\">Q. You don\u2019t recall having told Mr. Campbell he was drinking Bloody Marys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-12\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-13\">THE COURT: Is the statement made under oath?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4H\">MR.

KEANE: Prior inconsistent statement. Doesn\u2019t make any difference if it is under oath or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-18\">THE COURT: I think it does. He is not here.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-19\">MR. KEANE: He probably will be if we need him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYG\">THE COURT: I am not permitting any of that kind of stuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-20\">MR.

If you have something under oath \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">MR. KEANE: I have got that, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">THE COURT: If it is not under oath don\u2019t bother with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">MR. KEANE: I have got her under oath as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">THE COURT: Not some detective\u2019s word.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\">MR. KEANE: That is the reason I didn\u2019t read it to her, and asked her to read it and see if it refreshes her memory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">THE COURT: I just assumed it was under oath or you wouldn\u2019t have brought it out and asked her the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-11\">MR. KEANE: I have a transcript from downstairs under oath. [<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-12\">THE COURT: You can do that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">In the light of the above-quoted dialogue, the State suggests that the substantive issue has not been preserved for our review, and that we are precluded from considering it by Md. Rule 1085. We disagree. When the trial judge refused to allow interrogation of the prosecutrix founded upon \u201cthat kind of stuff, investigative\u201d, which consisted of a supposed out of court, prior inconsistent statement, the judge violated the appellant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial by foreclosing the trial tactic of impeachment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Unlike the situation in <em>White v. State, </em>23 Md. App. 151, 326 A. 2d 219 (1974), the appellant in the instant case did make an attempt to lay a foundation for the impeachment of the prosecutrix, but the trial judge frustrated that effort when he forbade the use of the prior statement because it was not under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-14\">While it may be argued that the appellant should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>made a proffer at trial as to what the allegedly prior inconsistent statement contained,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we do not believe, under the circumstances of this case, that the failure to make such a proffer is fatal. Ordinarily a proffer to show relevancy should have been made, but once the judge ruled that regardless of content it was inadmissible because it was not under oath, the appellant was precluded from showing relevancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">We adopted a similar stand in <em>Phillips v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 56, 59, 250 A. 2d 111, 113 (1969). There, speaking through Judge Anderson, we permitted an appeal from a trial judge\u2019s refusal to allow counsel to argue law to the jury. We considered the issue on appeal even though the appellant failed to note a formal objection to the trial judge\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>ruling proscribing such an argument. <em>Phillips </em>bears resemblance to the case now before us because not only was there no formal objection to the trial court\u2019s ruling, but there, as here, it was the erroneous <em>sua sponte </em>action of the trial judge that curtailed the appellant\u2019s presentation of his case or argument. Moreover, the appellant\u2019s articulation to the trial judge relative to the prior inconsistent statement, while hardly a model of clarity, nevertheless, did supply sufficient data to the judge from which he could have drawn several clear rational inferences. Those inferences, simply stated, are that appellant possessed a statement made by the prosecutrix, prior to her in-court testimony, and which was to some extent inconsistent therewith; appellant desired to impeach the prosecutrix on the strength of her prior inconsistent statement; the law authorizes such impeachment irrespective whether the prior statement was under oath. We think appellant to have laid the foundation for the use of the prior inconsistent statement, and that he should have been allowed to continue the inquiry so as to establish materiality, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>We turn now to the question of the substantive issue. This Court flatly stated in <em>Sanders v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 630, 640, 232 A. 2d 555 (1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\"><em>\u201cProvided a proper foundation has been laid, the credit of a witness may be impeached by showing he has made statements which contradict his testimony in respect to material facts. . . . Davis v. State, </em>38 Md. 15 [(1873)]; <em>Joppy v. Hopkins, </em>231 Md. 52, 56 [188 A. 2d 545, 548 (1963)] and cases cited; <em>Kantor v. Ash, </em>215 Md. 285, 290 [137 A. 2d 661, 664 (1958)]; <em>Mahan v. State, </em>172 Md. 373, 380 [191 A. 575, 579 (1937)]. To lay the foundation for such evidence, the witness must be first interrogated as to the time, place and person to whom such contradictory statements were made.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">To the same effect <em>see: Devan v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 182, 300 A. 2d 705 (1973); <em>Cooper v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 106, 286 A. 2d 579 (1972); <em>Estep v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 53, 286 A. 2d 187 (1972); <em>Jenkins v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 1, 285 A. 2d 667 (1971); <em>Hernandez v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 355, 255 A. 2d 449 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">We did not say in <em>Sanders, </em>nor are we familiar with any case holding that in order to use a prior inconsistent statement for impeachment purposes, the statement must have been made under oath. It is enough that the statement, oral or in writing, be made prior to the giving of the challenged testimony, and that it be material to the facts at issue and not merely collateral or irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">When the trial judge refused to allow the use of the prior inconsistent statement<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for impeachment purposes, he not only failed to adhere to what we espoused in <em>Sanders v. State, supra, </em>and its progeny, but he denied to appellant the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>fair and impartial trial that appellant is guaranteed under the Constitution of the United States and the State of Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Prince George\u2019s County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-21\">. All witnesses had been excluded from the courtroom pursuant to Md. Rule 753.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b302-15\">. A reference to the transcript of the preliminary hearing that was conducted in the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b302-16\">. The value of the use of prior inconsistent statements seems to have been recognized in Biblical times. <em>See </em>Job, ch. 31, v. 35 wherein it is stated: \u201cBehold, my desire is... that mine adversary had written a book.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b303-6\">. The appellant has moved in this Court to supplement the record by adding the alleged prior inconsistent statement. The statement should have been made a part of the record at the time of trial. There is no authority for the introduction of evidence, for the first time, in an appellate court. We deny the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b304-11\">. We are, of course, unable to say what impact, if any, the prior statement, if inconsistent, would have had upon the jury\u2019s attaching of credibility to the prosecutrix\u2019s version of the events giving rise to this case. We are not to be interpreted as holding that the prior statement is or is not inconsistent. The statement is not before us and consequently we express no opinion thereon.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
