K. HALL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">Defendant appeals his convictions for bank robbery, bank larceny and assault during a robbery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finding no merit in any of defendant\u2019s assertions of error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Defendant first argues that his absence from a pre-trial hearing constituted a violation of his right to be present at every stage of the trial. The record reveals that defendant\u2019s two attorneys, on the record, at the commencement of the hearing, informed the court that they had advised the defendant not to attend the hearing since the issue of identification was to be raised, and since potential identifying witnesses would be present. After questioning defendant\u2019s attorneys, the trial court determined that defendant had understood his rights and indeed waived his right to be present. Since the filing of this appeal, defendant has sworn, by affidavit, that he did \u201cnot recall speaking to either [of his attorneys] until after the suppression hearing was completed . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">The statements by defendant\u2019s attorneys were made before the hearing began and indicate a tactical decision to prevent the defendant\u2019s identification by certain witnesses before trial. Defendant does not directly deny that he had a conversation with his attorneys during which he waived his rights; he merely says that he \u201c[did] not recall\u201d such. Although the better practice would be to bring the defendant before the court and place his waiver on the record before the hearing began, we hold that the record here sufficiently indicates that a waiver indeed occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">Second, defendant contends that the court\u2019s failure to grant his request to personally make his closing argument violated his right to act as his own counsel, as expressed in <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). This court has held that it is not error to deny the defendant\u2019s motion to appear as co-counsel. <em>E. g., United States v. Lang, </em>527 F.2d 1264, 1265 (4th Cir. 1975). However, the defendant argues that this rule does not apply since he desired to dismiss his attorneys and assume sole responsibility for his defense. This being so, we nevertheless hold that a defendant does not have an absolute right to dismiss counsel and conduct his own defense after the trial has commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">Although <em>Faretta </em>unquestionably established a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of self-representation, the idea was not new to the federal courts. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> federal defendants had long possessed the statutory right of self-representation, and even before <em>Faretta, </em>many federal courts had also found this right grounded in the Sixth Amendment. <em>E. g., United States v. Denno, </em>348 F.2d 12, 15 (2nd Cir. 1965) (\u201cThe right derives, not from legislative enactments or judicial rules, but from the Federal Constitution.\u201d) However, under either theory, statutory or constitutional, the right was not absolute and could be limited or waived if not raised before trial. <em>E. g., United States </em>v. <em>Dougherty, </em>154 U.S.App.D.C. 76, 86, 473 F.2d 1113, 1123 (1972). In justifying the need to timely raise the right of self-representation, the courts recognized, among other things, the need to minimize disruptions, to avoid inconvenience' and delay, to maintain continuity, and to avoid confusing the jury. In light of this limitation on the right of self-representation existing before <em>Faretta, </em>the courts held that whether the defendant could dismiss counsel and proceed pro se was within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>E. g., United States v. Dougherty, </em>supra; <em>United States v. Denno, supra; Butler v. United States, </em>317 F.2d 249, 258 (8th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number><em>Faretta, </em>although clarifying the Sixth Amendment right of self-representation, did not deal with the situation where the defendant attempts to dismiss counsel and proceed pro se after trial has begun. The facts of <em>Faretta </em>reveal that \u201c[w]ell before the date of trial, . . . Faretta requested that he be permitted to represent himself. . . .\u201d 422 U.S. at 807, 95 S.Ct. at 2527. Such being the facts of <em>Far-etta, </em>that case does not directly control the issue here, nor do we believe that <em>Faretta </em>in any way changes the rule that once trial has begun, it is within the trial court\u2019s discretion whether to allow the defendant to dismiss counsel and proceed pro se. <em>Accord, Sapienza v. Vincent, </em>534 F.2d 1007, 1010 (2nd Cir. 1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The reasons for limiting the right after trial has begun, as explained above, are not diminished by <em>Far-etta </em>and remain viable justifications for trusting this decision to the sound discretion of the trial court. The facts of this case do not reveal an abuse of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">Finally, as the parties agree, defendant\u2019s sentence must be corrected in two aspects. First, the commitment order erroneously indicated that there were aiding and abetting convictions. Admittedly, these were clerical errors, and are vacated. Second, in light of <em>Walters v. Harris, </em>460 F.2d 988, 994 (4th Cir. 1972), the bank larceny charge and the assault charge are vacated, leaving defendant with a twenty-year sentence for bank robbery. We see no need to remand for re-sentencing. <em>United States v. Amos, </em>566 F.2d 899, 901 (4th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">AFFIRMED in part; VACATED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b962-9\">. The commitment order indicated that defendant had been convicted of aiding and abetting as to each offense. Such was not the case, and this point is dealt with below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b962-10\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"A8Vs\">In all courts of the United States the parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel as, by the rules of such courts, respectively, are permitted to manage and conduct causes therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b963-10\">. In <em>Sapienza, </em>the second circuit expressly held that <em>Faretta </em>in no way diminished that circuit\u2019s rule requiring a defendant to raise the right of self-representation before trial, or suffer diminution or loss of the right. <em>See United States v. Denno, </em>supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
