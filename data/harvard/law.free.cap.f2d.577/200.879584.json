In drafting an indictment for perjury, however, a grand jury must take exactly the opposite tack. No guessing is tolerated and the indictment must set out the allegedly perjurious statements and the objective truth in stark contrast so that the claim of falsity is clear to all who read the charge. In the appeal at hand, the indictment and evidence adduced failed to meet that standard. Accordingly, we must vacate the conviction of the defendant for false swearing before a grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-21\">The defendant, James R. Tonelli, was indicted for making false statements to a grand jury in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the conclusion of a bench trial, the district judge found defendant guilty and sentenced him to two years in prison and a $500 fine. He then suspended the sentence and placed defendant on two years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-22\">The case grew out of an investigation by a federal grand jury in Newark, inquiring into possible criminal violations in connection with the management and investment of funds belonging to the Paper Industry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Union Management Fund.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The inquiry disclosed that persons seemingly not connected with the Union or the Pension Fund had approached various banks and offered to deposit the Fund\u2019s monies in exchange for business or personal loans. Government agents discovered that the defendant had been involved with the Fund\u2019s purchase of three $100,000 certificates of deposit from the Lugoff, South Carolina branch of the American Bank and Trust Company. Although the defendant was not affiliated with either the Union or the Fund, his father was president of the International Union and his cousin, James Fabio, was Administrator of the Pension Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Defendant was served with a subpoena duces tecum and appeared before the grand jury on October 21, 1974. He testified he had recommended the Lugoff bank to Fa-bio, but denied he had sought remuneration from the bank in exchange for placing funds with it. On November 8, 1974, at his request, defendant again appeared before the same grand jury to correct certain inaccurate testimony, unrelated' to the deposit of Pension Fund monies, that he had given on his initial appearance. A few months later, in a one-count indictment, defendant was charged with violating \u00a7 1623 by knowingly making false and material declarations in response to certain questions propounded to him during the October 21st grand jury proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Essentially, the indictment listed false answers dealing with three issues. The first two were whether Tonelli was involved with the placement of Pension Fund money with the American Bank and Trust Company and whether he had personally handled the transmission of one or more Fund checks to the bank; the third was whether defendant had discussed placement of Pension Fund monies with Ray Clark, an officer of the bank, in order to obtain a loan for himself. The district judge found that there had been inadequate proof as to the third issue but was satisfied that falsity with respect to the first two had been proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The defendant contends that we should dismiss the indictment because he was not told he was a target of the grand jury probe and had not been advised of his rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Although recognizing the thrust of Supreme Court holdings in <em>United States v. Washington, </em>431 U.S. 181, 97 S.Ct. 1814, 52 L.Ed.2d 238 (1977), and <em>United States v. Wong, </em>431 U.S. 174, 97 S.Ct. 1823, 52 L.Ed.2d 231 (1977), that there is no constitutional right to receive special warnings before testifying before the grand jury, defendant urges us to exercise our supervisory powers as did the court in <em>United States v. Jacobs, </em>531 F.2d 87 (2d Cir. 1976), <em>remanded for reconsideration, </em>429 U.S. 909, 97 S.Ct. 299, 50 L.Ed.2d 277 (1976), <em>on remand, </em>547 F.2d 772 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. granted, </em>431 U.S. 937, 97 S.Ct. 2647, 53 L.Ed.2d 254 (1977). We note that on December 16, 1977 the Justice Department adopted a grand jury practice of warning a putative defendant on the record before he testifies and in light of this recent development, we see no need to exercise our supervisory powers at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">We do, however, perceive more merit to another contention raised by the defendant. In <em>United States v. Slawik, </em>548 F.2d 75 (3d Cir. 1977), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-10\">\u201c[A] conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623 may not stand where the indictment fails to set forth the precise falsehood alleged and the factual basis of its falsity with sufficient clarity to permit a jury to determine its verity and to allow meaningful judicial review of the materiality of those falsehoods.\u201d 548 F.2d at 83-84.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjT\">We find the same prosecutorial deficiency which undermined the <em>Slawik </em>conviction\u2014 the failure to specifically allege in the indictment the precise falsehoods charged\u2014 exists here. <em>See United States v. Crocker, </em>568 F.2d 1049 (3d Cir. 1977). This defect is compounded because the Assistant United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>States Attorney failed to ask specific, unambiguous questions while interrogating defendant in the grand jury room. Since the district court found only two of the three allegations had been established by the prosecution, we review only those items. Of necessity, a detailed description of the indictment and the testimony before the grand jury is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">We discuss first the issue of participation in the placement of pension funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Summarizing defendant\u2019s pertinent testimony before the grand jury, the district court stated \u201cwhen asked if he \u2018participated in the placement of pension fund monies for the purchase of certificates of deposit . including within that concept making recommendations to any individual as to any bank or other financial institution from which certificates of deposit could be purchased,\u2019 Tonelli replied that he had recommended the American Bank and Trust, Lu-goff branch, to James Fabio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Paragraph 8 of the indictment charges that, in response to certain questions, To-nelli made false declarations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">Q. Mr. Tonelli, did you ever have occasion to participate in the placement of funds of the Paper Industry Union Management Pension Fund? By placement, I mean purchase of certificate of deposits [sic] with pension fund moneys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-10\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-11\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-12\">Q. Mr. Tonelli, in connection with these certificates of deposit that the Pension Fund purchased at the American Bank &amp; Trust Company in Lugoff, South Carolina, did you ever in any way assist Mr. Fabio to make those purchases other than introducing him the first time to Mr. Clark?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-13\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-14\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-15\">Q. But he was the one that took care of purchasing that certificate of deposit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-16\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-17\">Q. Personally?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-19\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-20\">Q. And you had nothing to do with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-21\">A. None whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-22\">Q. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-23\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-24\">Paragraph 9 of the indictment states that the material declarations were knowingly, willfully, and deliberately false in that \u201cJames R. Tonelli, in truth and in fact . personally secured the placement of such funds at the American Bank and Trust Company. . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-25\">The indictment, however, lifts the initial questioning and response out of context and omits the qualifying colloquy which followed in the record. After he first inquired about placement of funds, the prosecutor proceeded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-26\">Q. When I say participate in the placement of pension fund monies for the purchase of certificates of deposit, I am including within that concept making recommendations to any individual as to any bank or other financial institution from which certificates of deposit could be purchased. Did you ever have occasion to, in that sense, participate in the placement of funds?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-27\">It is obvious that at this point the prosecutor qualified and defined what he meant by the word \u201cparticipate,\u201d recognizing that his initial question was broad and ambiguous. The defendant\u2019s answer is significant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-28\">A. Do you mean if I made any recommendations for someone to place any moneys in any particular bank?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-29\">Q. Yes, sir, did you ever do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-30\">A. Is <em>that </em>what you are referring to? [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-31\">Q. Yes, among other concepts, did you ever make any recommendations?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-32\">The defendant then explained that he had introduced his cousin, Fabio, to Assistant Vice President Clark.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-33\">There is no contention that Tonelli was untruthful in his statement that he did introduce Fabio to the bank officer and, therefore, his response indicating that he did participate in the placement of funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>did not constitute perjury. The defendant\u2019s initial denial of involvement, standing alone, was not true, but when the prosecutor subsequently defined \u201cparticipated in the placement of . monies . . . for the purchase\u201d as including a recommendation of the bank, Tonelli answered truthfully. Thus, by quoting a question and answer in isolation, the indictment did not accurately represent the statements made by the defendant and in ignoring the qualifying definitions used by the prosecutor, it was misleading. \u201cA charge of perjury may not be sustained by the device of lifting a statement of the accused out of its immediate context and thus giving it a meaning wholly different than that which its context clearly shows.\u201d <em>Fotie v. United States, </em>137 F.2d 831, 842 (8th Cir. 1943). <em>Van Liew v. United States, </em>321 F.2d 674, 678 (5th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Moreover, responding to the prosecutor\u2019s qualifying definition, defendant asked, \u201c[i]s that what you are referring to?\u201d and the prosecutor replied, \u201c[y]es, among other concepts, did you ever make any recommendations?\u201d When Tonelli answered affirmatively, the prosecutor made no further reference to any \u201cother concepts\u201d that he might have intended to be included within the phrase \u201cparticipated in placement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The transcript of the grand jury proceedings shows defendant admitted that he had personally participated in the sense of making a recommendation \u2014 a context suggested by the prosecutor himself. The Assistant United States Attorney\u2019s definition allowed the defendant to limit his answer to an area far narrower, perhaps, than the government intended. To that extent, the defendant could be said to have evaded the broad \u201cother concepts\u201d which the prosecutor wished to probe. A charge of perjury, however, is not a substitute for careful questioning on the part of a prosecutor, and in this respect the interrogation ran afoul of the Supreme Court\u2019s teaching in <em>Bronston v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 352, 93 S.Ct. 595, 34 L.Ed.2d 568 (1973). There, the Court concluded that an earlier perjury statute did not reach witnesses\u2019 answers as long as they were literally true, even if those answers were intentionally misleading.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In so holding, the Court stressed the responsibility of the examiner, and we find its observations pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">\u201cIf a witness evades, it is the lawyer\u2019s responsibility to recognize the evasion and to bring the witness back to the mark, to flush out the whole truth with the tools of adversary examination. \u201cIt is no answer to say that here the jury found that petitioner intended to mislead his examiner. A jury should not be permitted to engage in conjecture whether an unresponsive answer, true and complete on its face, was intended to mislead or divert the examiner; the state of mind of the witness is relevant only to the extent that it bears on whether \u2018he does not believe [his answer] to be true.\u2019 \u201c. . . [T]he perjury statute is not to \u2022be loosely construed, nor the statute invoked simply because a wily witness succeeds in derailing the questioner \u2014 so long as the witness speaks the literal truth. The burden is on the questioner to pin the witness down to the specific object of the questioner\u2019s inquiry.\u201d 409 U.S. 358-60, 93 S.Ct. 600-601. (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-15\">We find that, with respect to the placement issue, the indictment fails to specify in what particular the defendant\u2019s reply was false. The statement in paragraph 9 that the declaration was false because the defendant \u201cpersonally secured the placement of such funds\u201d at the bank is simply conclusory and not contrary to what the defendant said before the grand jury. Thus, as to the \u201cplacement\u201d issue, we conclude that the indictment is defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-17\">The second statement which the court found to be untruthful, regarding the \u201chandling\u201d issue, is also set out in para<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>graph 8, which recites the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">Q. Did you ever handle any pension fund check?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">Q. And you never handled any checks that went to the American Bank &amp; Trust Company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">In paragraph 9, the indictment charged that this statement was false because the defendant had \u201chandled the transmission of one or more of the checks of the Paper Industry Union Management Pension Fund to the American Bank and Trust Company.\u201d It is immediately apparent that the \u201ctruth\u201d paragraph does not track the alleged false answer in paragraph 8; the defendant was not asked if he \u201chandled the transmission\u201d of checks but if he \u201chandled any checks.\u201d The two statements are in fact quite different. A person might \u201chandle a transmission\u201d by arranging for others to send, mail or deliver a check. But \u201chandling a check\u201d may very well imply touching the piece of paper, and apparently it was in this sense that the- defendant answered the questions before the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">The district court found that the defendant \u201cdid in fact \u2018handle\u2019 Pension Fund monies, in any manageable sense of the word, at the time of the original transaction and in conjunction with his August 2, 1972 letter to Ray Clark . . . .\u201d We think this finding does not focus on the critical issue of what was charged in the indictment and said before the grand jury. Once again, what is noteworthy is what the indictment excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">When defendant denied ever handling any pension fund check, the prosecutor asked: \u201cThere would be no reason for your fingerprints to be on any pension fund checks?\u201d Tonelli relied: \u201c[n]ot to my knowledge, no, sir.\u201d Some time later, the prosecutor showed Tonelli a check of the Pension Fund in the amount of $100,000 encased in a plastic folder. After the defendant acknowledged that he had not touched the check that day, the prosecutor asked, \u201c[wjould you have touched the check when you might have seen it with Mr. Fabio?\u201d The defendant answered, \u201cI might have. To my knowledge I don\u2019t recall right now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">A few minutes later, after warning the defendant about perjury, the prosecutor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-16\">\u201c[I]f at any time during today\u2019s Grand Jury proceeding you feel that you have not told the truth in any material respect before this Grand Jury and choose to change your testimony today, you have the right to in effect recant your prior or nontruthful statement and if you do so you cannot be charged with perjury. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-17\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-18\">\u201cUnderstanding that, is there anything, any answer of yours or any statement of yours given so far that you wish to modify in any respect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-19\">A. Well, there is no modification I can possibly make other than you keep reiterating about the check, whether I touched it or not. Now, to my knowledge, back in \u201972 I really couldn\u2019t tell you whether I did or not and that\u2019s the truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-20\">The prosecutor continued examining the defendant about other matters, and then asked him to leave the room. Following Tonnelli\u2019s return, the prosecutor resumed his questioning and again offered defendant the opportunity to recant. Stating that he wished to modify only his testimony about the check, \u201cwhether I handled it or not,\u201d defendant said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-21\">\u201cWell, if I actually handled it in my own person, my own being, as I indicated before when Mr. Fabio did come down South, whether he showed me the check, whether I touched it, I might have, and maybe I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t recall.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-22\">It is clear that the defendant interpreted the prosecutor\u2019s questions about \u201chandling\u201d to mean \u201ctouching,\u201d and, taking advantage of the prosecutor\u2019s two proper offers of recantation, retreated from his denial of \u201chandling,\u201d saying he might have \u201ctouched\u201d the check. At this point, if the prosecutor intended the word \u201chandle\u201d to mean other than \u201ctouch,\u201d it was his responsibility to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>rephrase the questions. <em>Bronston v. United States, supra. See United States v. Wall, </em>371 F.2d 398 (6th Cir. 1967). To sustain a perjury charge based on the ambiguous line of questioning used here would require us to assume Tonelli interpreted \u201chandle\u201d to include more than \u201ctouching.\u201d The record will not allow us to do so and as the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has observed \u201c[ejspecially in perjury cases, defendants may not be assumed into the penitentiary.\u201d <em>United States v. Brumley, </em>560 F.2d 1268 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">At trial, the government offered into evidence a letter dated August 2, 1972 from the defendant to Clark. It read in part: \u201cEnclosed you will find the final deposit regarding my commitment to you, that, I would have by August 1972 $300,000 in your bank.\u201d The prosecutor admitted that he had this letter in his possession at the time defendant was testifying before the grand jury. Accepting that \u201cdeposit\u201d referred to a check of the Pension Fund, the prosecutor therefore knew that defendant had mailed or caused to be mailed a check to the bank. If the government wished to establish that the defendant had transmitted a check by mail, a proper and specific question could easily have been framed. Since the prosecutor chose to leave the record in an equivocal condition, it cannot be the basis of a false swearing conviction. The indictment and proof of the second issue, therefore, are also deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Because the indictment in this case did not \u201cset forth the precise falsehood[s] alleged and the factual [bases] of [their] falsity with sufficient clarity to permit a jury to determine [their] verity and to allow meaningful judicial review of the materiality of those falsehoods,\u201d the conviction here must be vacated. As we stated in <em>Slawik:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">\u201cTo hold otherwise would permit the trial jury to inject its inferences into the grand jury\u2019s indictment, and would allow defendants to be convicted for immaterial falsehoods or for \u2018intent to mislead\u2019 or \u2018perjury by implication\u2019, \u2014 which <em>Bronston </em>specifically prohibited.\u201d 548 F.2d at 83-84.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">In the face of the district court\u2019s finding that the defendant was not truthful, it may be argued that the judgment should stand. However, the same considerations applied in <em>Bronston, supra, </em>409 U.S. at 363, 93 S.Ct. at 602, where the Chief Justice wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATv\">\u201cIt may well be that petitioner\u2019s answers were not guileless but were shrewdly calculated to evade. Nevertheless . any special problems arising from the literally true but unresponsive answer are to be remedied through the \u2018questioner\u2019s acuity\u2019 and not by a federal perjury prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">The judgment of the district court will be vacated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-12\">. \u201c\u00a7 1623 False declarations before grand jury or court</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">(a) Whoever under oath ... in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United States knowingly makes any false material declaration . shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-6\">.
