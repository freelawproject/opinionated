We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">On March 20, 1973, appellant Smith was convicted in Polk County District Court in Iowa of first degree murder. Smith appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court of Iowa on two grounds: (1) the evidence was not sufficient to support a first degree murder conviction, and (2) jury misconduct deprived him of a fair trial. The Supreme Court of Iowa rejected both arguments and affirmed Smith\u2019s conviction. <em>State v. Smith, </em>240 N.W.2d 693 (Iowa 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-18\">Smith then filed the instant action in federal district court seeking a writ of ha-beas corpus. Smith alleged that jury misconduct deprived him of his Sixth Amendment rights as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to be tried by an impartial jury and to confront witnesses against him. The district court, in a well-reasoned opinion, denied appellant Smith\u2019s application for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Smith v. Brewer, </em>444 F.Supp. 482 (S.D.Iowa 1978). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-19\">Smith argues, as he did below, that several incidents which took place during jury deliberations violated his Sixth Amendment right to a fair and impartial jury. These incidents include (1) pressures brought on one juror by other jurors; (2) possible intrusion of racial considerations into the jury\u2019s deliberations; (3) one or more juror\u2019s comments concerning the belief that Smith was likely to commit future violent crime unless convicted; (4) an indication that one juror compared Smith\u2019s case with an earlier trial in which the same juror had served; (5) an indication that the jury used against Smith the fact that he was on bail; and (6) an alleged wager among jurors whether one particular juror would break her promise to vote guilty after hearing certain evidence repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-20\">The district court addressed each of these contentions in its published opinion. Upon a careful consideration of the record and of the briefs of the parties, we have concluded that the decision of the district court should be affirmed on the basis of the district court\u2019s opinion. Judge Hanson\u2019s decision is based on findings <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that are not clearly erro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>neous and no error of law appears. For these reasons, the district court\u2019s denial of Smith\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-15\">.
