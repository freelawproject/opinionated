E. Creel, III v. Birmingham Trust National Bank, et al., </em>383 F.Supp. 871 (N.D.Ala., 1974). The District Court held that the money, about $400,000, was in trust for the employees as beneficiaries of the trust. On appeal, we summarily affirmed, 510 F.2d 1363 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">Upon receipt of our mandate, the depository bank and the beneficiaries applied for reimbursement of reasonable attorney fees incurred in the successful defense of the trust. The trial court determined the reasonableness of the fees and allowed them. The trustee again appeals and, again, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">Viewed as a bankruptcy case the fees were allowable under federal law. If the case is a diversity case (it was so filed) the fees were allowable under Alabama law.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">In <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975), as exceptions to the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d on attorneys fees where not recoverable by contract or by statute, it was held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-15\">\u201c . . . the historic power of equity . [may] permit the trustee of a fund or property, or a party preserving or recovering a fund for the benefit of others in addition to himself, to recover his costs, including his attorneys\u2019 fees, from the fund or property itself or directly from the other parties enjoying the benefit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-17\">* * * * # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akk\">\u201c \u2018[I]n an ordinary diversity case where the state law does not run counter to a valid federal statute or rule of court, and usually it will not, state law denying the right to attorney\u2019s fees or giving a right thereto, which reflects a substantial policy of the state, should be followed.\u2019 \u201d 421 U.S. at 257, 259, 95 S.Ct. at 1621, footnote 31.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-19\">Title 46, \u00a7 63 of the Code of Alabama 1940 (Recomp.1958) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-20\">\u201cIn all suits and proceedings . where there is involved the administration of a trust, . . . the court . may ascertain a reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, to be paid to the attorneys or solicitors representing the trust ... or any party in the suit or proceeding <em>yy</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-23\">Finally, under the circumstances of this case, wherein a trustee in bankruptcy invokes diversity jurisdiction in an effort to seize a huge sum of money from persons not parties to the bankruptcy proceedings, we have been pointed to no sound reason for treating him any differently than any other litigant \u2014 especially where, as here, the District Court found the Trustee\u2019s suit to have been both \u201coverreaching and frivolous\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
