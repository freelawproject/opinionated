The taxpayer contends that this \u201cboot\u201d should be taxed as a long-term capital gain, while the government argues that it has \u201cthe effect of the distribution of a dividend\u201d within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 356(a)(2) and should thus be taxed as ordinary income. The district court agreed with the taxpayer and awarded him a substantial refund.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons stated below, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-23\">The facts are fully stipulated. LaMonte-Shimberg Corp. (LSC), a Florida corporation engaged in home construction and sales, was controlled by taxpayer Mandell Shimberg, Jr., who owned 66.8 per cent of the stock. His wife<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> owned an additional 1.6 per cent for the benefit of their children, and nineteen other unrelated persons held the remaining shares. MGIC Investment Corp. (MGIC) is a holding company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>incorporated under the laws of Delaware that is primarily engaged, through various subsidiaries, in the financial guaranty business. In September 1970, MGIC and LSC executed a merger agreement, pursuant to which LSC was to be merged into MGIC in a transaction qualifying for statutory merger treatment under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 368(a)(1)(A). To so qualify, the merger must satisfy applicable state laws regarding such reorganizations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, MGIC would be the surviving corporation, and the separate corporate existence of LSC would cease. Under the agreement, LSC shareholders were to receive, pro rata, $625,000 in cash and 32,132 shares of MGIC common stock, plus another 32,132 shares in escrow to be delivered in five years if the conditions of the agreement were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">The merger was consummated on December 9, 1970, and taxpayer in exchange for his LSC stock received $417,449, plus 21,461 shares of MGIC common stock and a like number in escrow. Immediately prior to the merger, the undistributed earnings and profits of both corporations were in excess of $625,000 each.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">On his federal income tax return for 1970, taxpayer reported the cash received in connection with the merger as a long-term capital gain. Upon audit and examination of the return, the Internal Revenue Service determined that the cash received was taxable as a dividend, that is, as ordinary income. Accordingly, the IRS assessed a tax deficiency against taxpayer in the amount of $125,883. That amount, plus interest totalling $16,169.93, was paid, and taxpayer then filed for a refund. The IRS disallowed the refund claim in full, and taxpayer commenced this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">Under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 368(a)(1), six types of corporate transactions are defined as \u201creorganizations,\u201d among them a \u201cstatutory merger\u201d pursuant to state law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the corporate transaction meets one or more of these definitions and thus qualifies as a reorganization, favorable tax treatment is available under \u00a7 354(a)(1), which provides that no gain or loss shall be recognized if, pursuant to a reorganization plan, stock or securities of one corporation are exchanged solely for stock or securities of another corporation that is a party to the reorganization. Accordingly, such transactions are generally characterized as \u201ctax-free\u201d reorganizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">However, \u00a7 354(a)(1) makes clear that not all reorganizations will be entirely tax free, for it applies so long as a shareholder of one corporation receives as consideration <em>only stock or securities </em>of another corporation participating in the reorganization. Under some reorganizations \u2014 including the statutory merger \u2014 the transaction is not a stock-for-stock exchange but may involve additional consideration such as cash or property other than stock. In these circumstances, this additional consideration \u2014 commonly known as \u201cboot\u201d \u2014 does not qualify for tax-free treatment. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 356(a)(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, the reorganization is only partially tax-free.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">Most state laws, including the Florida and Delaware statutes applicable here,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>mit other consideration in addition to stock to be utilized in a statutory merger. In the instant case the \u201cboot\u201d was a pro rata distribution of $625,000 to the LSC shareholders. The question in this case is not whether the \u201cboot\u201d is to be taxed \u2014 for \u00a7 356(a)(1) makes clear that it is \u2014 but whether it is to be taxed as proceeds from the sale of a capital asset, <em>i. </em>e., as a capital gain, or as a dividend, <em>i. e., </em>as ordinary income.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The answer turns on whether the payment and receipt of the \u201cboot\u201d has \u201cthe effect of the distribution of a dividend\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 356(a)(2), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"><em>Treatment as dividend. </em>\u2014 -If an exchange is described in paragraph (1) but has the effect of the distribution of a dividend, then there shall be treated as a dividend to each distributee such an amount of the gain recognized under paragraph (1) as is not in excess of his ratable share of the undistributed earnings and profits of the corporation accumulated after February 28, 1913. The remainder, if any, of the gain recognized under paragraph (1) shall be treated as gain from the exchange of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The district court, 415 F.Supp. 832, held that the test to be applied in determining whether the exchange had \u201cthe effect of the distribution of a dividend\u201d is whether the transaction resulted in a \u201cmeaningful reduction\u201d of the taxpayer\u2019s proportionate interest in the corporation, relying on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>397 U.S. 301, 90 S.Ct. 1041, 25 L.Ed.2d 323 (1970), and <em>Wright v. United States, </em>482 F.2d 600 (8 Cir. 1973). The court then compared the taxpayer\u2019s interest in the merged corporation (LSC) with his interest in the surviving corporation (MGIC). Because taxpayer held a controlling interest \u2014 68 per cent of the stock\u2014 in LSC prior to the merger and owned less than one per cent of MGIC\u2019s stock after the merger, the court concluded that the merger resulted in \u201ca radical change and meaningful reduction\u201d in taxpayer\u2019s interest in the continuing business and thus did not have the effect of the distribution of a dividend under \u00a7 356(a)(2). Accordingly, the court held that the \u201cboot\u201d was taxable as a capital gain. Unfortunately, this approach is too simplistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">In <em>United States v. Davis, supra, </em>the Supreme Court was faced with interpreting 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 302,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> under which a stock redemption is treated as a distribution in payment in exchange for the stock and thus qualifies for capital gain treatment under certain circumstances. Under \u00a7 302(b)(1), capital gain treatment is available if the redemption is \u201cnot essentially equivalent to a dividend.\u201d However, if the redemption has dividend equivalency, it is taxed as ordinary income. Although the Court was primarily faced with two other issues,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it followed a long line of prior decisions <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in holding that to qualify under \u00a7 302(b)(1), a redemption must result in a \u201cmeaningful reduction of the shareholder\u2019s proportionate interest in the corporation.\u201d 397 U.S. at 313, 90 S.Ct. at 1048. If the redemption does not result in such a reduction, it is considered essentially equivalent to a dividend and is taxed as ordinary income. The taxpayer in <em>Davis </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>was the sole shareholder in a corporation both before and after he redeemed a certain amount of his stock and thus did not meet the meaningful reduction test. Obviously, his relationship with other shareholders in the corporation did not change and he suffered no loss of voting power or control.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">In <em>Wright v. United States, supra, </em>the Eighth Circuit applied the \u201cmeaningful reduction\u201d analysis to a corporate reorganization. There three corporations were owned and controlled by the same shareholders but in different proportions. The principal shareholders wanted to consolidate two of the corporations into a single entity in which their ownership would be approximately the same proportion as in the other corporation. This goal could not be accomplished through a simple merger because one corporation was worth about twice as much as the other. Accordingly, the reorganization required payment of a \u201cboot\u201d to the taxpayer to reflect his greater entitlement and to result in a new corporation with the desired ownership percentages. Even though a formal redemption did not occur, the court viewed the \u201cboot\u201d from the reorganization as having been paid to the taxpayer by the newly formed corporation when he redeemed his stock in that corporation \u2014 stock which never had been issued and which the taxpayer had never owned. The court thus treated the transaction as if there had been only one corporation all along and as if one shareholder had redeemed his stock. Because this hypothetical redemption resulted in a 23 per cent reduction in the taxpayer\u2019s ownership,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the court concluded that the \u201credemption\u201d had caused a \u201cmeaningful reduction\u201d under <em>Davis. </em>Thus, the court concluded that the \u201cboot\u201d was \u201cnot essentially equivalent to a dividend\u201d under \u00a7 302(b)(1) and therefore did not have \u201cthe effect of the distribution of a dividend\u201d under \u00a7 356(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Application of the \u201cmeaningful reduction\u201d test in <em>Wright </em>was not illogical, given the court\u2019s recasting of the transaction, since a single shareholder was treated as having redeemed his stock in a single corporation. In the instant case, however, the reorganization involves two different corporations of different sizes and with different shareholders. There is no commonality of ownership as in <em>Wright, </em>and, accordingly, no opportunity for reshaping the transaction as a redemption. Moreover, there was not a single \u201cboot\u201d distribution to a single shareholder, as in <em>Wright, </em>but a pro rata distribution to all LSC shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">The \u201cmeaningful reduction\u201d test cannot be indiscriminately applied in the reorganization context. The <em>Davis </em>case illustrates its proper application in a redemption under \u00a7 302, as does the recently decided case of Morris v. <em>United States, </em>441 F.Supp. 76 (N.D.Tex.1977), while <em>Wright </em>indicates that it also is appropriate when a reorganization can be realistically treated as a redemption. Even assuming that <em>Wright </em>is correctly decided \u2014 a point on which we express no opinion \u2014 the instant case presents radically different facts and calls for correspondingly different analysis. We agree with the government that \u201cthe undifferentiating invocation of stock redemption principles in a reorganization case\u201d such as this one is erroneous, and we decline to apply on a wholesale basis the \u201cmeaningful reduction\u201d test in cases arising under \u00a7 356(a)(2).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>that the district court erred in utilizing \u201cmeaningful reduction\u201d analysis in this case. A contrary holding would render \u00a7 356(a)(2) virtually meaningless when a large corporation swallows a small one in a reorganization, for there will always be a marked decrease in control by the small corporation\u2019s shareholders, unless the same shareholders control both corporations. And, even in that situation, disproportionate ownership \u2014 as in <em>Wright </em>\u2014 could result in a meaningful reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Section 356(a)(2) requires that a \u201cboot\u201d be taxed as a dividend if it \u201chas the effect of the distribution of a dividend.\u201d The focal point of our analysis, then, is the <em>effect </em>of the \u201cboot\u201d in the instant case, and we must examine all of the facts and circumstances surrounding its distribution in light of basic tax principles pertaining to dividends and reorganizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 316(a), \u201cdividend\u201d is defined as \u201cany distribution of property made by a corporation to its shareholders . out of its earnings and profits,\u201d either current or accumulated. Thus, a dividend is the severance of profits from the corporation and the distribution of those profits to the shareholders. <em>United States v. Phellis, </em>257 U.S. 156, 170, 42 S.Ct. 63, 66 L.Ed. 180 (1921). Section 301(c) provides that a dividend is to be included in the taxpayer\u2019s gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The theory behind tax-free corporate reorganizations is that the transaction is merely \u201ca continuance of the proprietary interests in the continuing enterprise under modified corporate form.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>176 F.2d 646, 648 (1 Cir. 1949); Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.368-1(b). <em>See generally </em>Cohen, <em>Conglomerate Mergers and Taxation, 55 </em>A.B.A.J. 40 (1969). Indeed, if the transaction does not involve the exchange of sufficient stock or securities, the judicially-created \u201ccontinuity of proprietary interest\u201d test destroys the transaction\u2019s treatment as a reorganization.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">If a pro rata distribution of profits from a continuing corporation is a dividend, and a corporate reorganization is a \u201ccontinuance of the proprietary interests in the continuing enterprise under modified corporate form,\u201d it follows that the pro rata distribution of \u201cboot\u201d to shareholders of one of the participating corporations must certainly have the \u201ceffect of the distribution of a dividend\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 356(a)(2). <em>King Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>418 F.2d 511, 189 Ct.Cl. 466 (1969); <em>Hawkinson v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>235 F.2d 747 (2 Cir. 1956); <em>Ross v. United States, </em>163 F.Supp. 793, 146 Ct.Cl. 223 <em>cert. denied, </em>361 U.S. 875 (1959); <em>Love v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>113 F.2d 236 (3 Cir. 1940); <em>Rose v. Little Inv. Co., </em>86 F.2d 50 (5 Cir. 1936); <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Owens, </em>69 F.2d 597 (5 Cir. 1934). Moreover, the legislative history of \u00a7 356(a)(2)\u2019s predecessor statute makes clear that a distribution that would have been a dividend if made prior to the reorganization is subject to the same treatment when made as part of the transaction. H.Rep. No. 179, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 14-15 (1924) [1939-1 Cum.Bull. (Part 2), 241, 252]; S.Rep. No. 398, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 15-16 (1924) [1939-1 Cum.Bull. (Part 2), 266, 277],</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">Accordingly, \u00a7 356(a)(2) requires a determination of whether the distribution would have been taxed as a dividend if made prior to the reorganization or if no reorganization had occurred. This inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>is essentially a comparison of the effect of actual distribution and the effect of a hypothetical one. Prior to the merger in the instant case, LSC had retained earnings of approximately $725,000. In the course of the merger, LSC shareholders received a pro rata distribution of $625,000 as \u201cboot\u201d. If no reorganization had taken place and LSC had made such a pro rata distribution, or if LSC had taken such action prior to the merger, there is no doubt that this would have been a dividend taxable as ordinary income. The same result should obtain where, as here, the LSC shareholders received a pro rata \u201cboot\u201d of $625,000.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Indeed, the legislative history of the predecessor to \u00a7 356(a)(2) offers virtually the same fact situation as an example of a transaction having the effect of a dividend distribution.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The taxpayer should not be able to reap the benefits of capital gain treatment simply because he received his share of the distribution after the merger in the form of a \u201cboot\u201d rather than before the merger in the form of a dividend.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Taxpayer argues that we ignore economic reality by hypothesizing that LSC could have declared a dividend prior to the merger, since the corporation had only $147,000 in cash on hand when the merger took place. Taxpayer thus asks us to erase approximately $725,000 in retained earnings from the corporation\u2019s pre-merger balance sheet and pretend that these profits were never made. This we refuse to do. It is apparent that taxpayer, who controlled LSC made a considered decision to utilize the corporation\u2019s retained earnings for purposes other than payment of a dividend. It cannot be said that LSC was unable to pay a dividend; rather, for reasons not revealed in the record, it chose not to do so. Moreover, despite taxpayer\u2019s protestations to the contrary, it seems clear that the merger operated as a device for \u201cbailing out\u201d LSC\u2019s retained earnings, which were evidently tied up in certain aspects of the business\u2019 operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Taxpayer also contends that our analysis in this case constitutes abrogation of the \u201cstep transaction\u201d doctrine. We disagree. Under the doctrine, which has application in a variety of tax situations, all parts of a multi-step exchange or reorganization are grouped together to determine the appropriate tax treatment for the entire transaction, if the several steps are an essential and integral part of the overall plan. <em>See Helvering v. Alabama Asphaltic Limestone Co., </em>315 U.S. 179, 62 S.Ct. 540, 86 L.Ed. 775 (1942); <em>Kanawha Gas &amp; Utilities Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>214 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>F.2d 685 (5 Cir. 1954). However, the doctrine is certainly no bar to our comparing the \u201cboot\u201d distribution in the instant case with a hypothetical situation in which the pro rata distribution of LSC\u2019s retained earnings would obviously have been a dividend. If the doctrine forbids such an examination of the \u201cboot\u201d portion of the reorganization scheme, it would be impossible to determine whether the \u201cboot\u201d distribution had the effect of the distribution of a dividend. We are not treating the \u201cboot\u201d distribution as a separate step in the overall transaction but are rather analyzing the distribution in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 356(a)(2).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, taxpayer\u2019s reliance on the step transaction doctrine seems bottomed on his view that the meaningful reduction test applies here and that the appropriate focus is control of the corporation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We again reject this approach, for, as we have previously pointed out, a majority shareholder in a small corporation will always become a minority shareholder in a large corporation that acquires the small one, so long as there is no commonality of ownership. Further, although taxpayer and the other LSC shareholders relinquished their control of LSC, they certainly did not part with their interests in the continuing corporate entity under the reorganization, <em>i. </em>e., MGIC. Taxpayer\u2019s approach also fails to address the effect of the \u201cboot\u201d distribution itself, an inquiry mandated by the plain language of \u00a7 356(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Finally, we are compelled to note that our decision today does not signal a return to the now-discredited \u201cautomatic dividend\u201d rule.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We are concerned in this case with the effect of a pro rata \u201cboot\u201d distribution, not with the effect of a distribution on a non-pro rata basis. Obviously, the latter variety does not bear the earmarks of a classic dividend. Further, we do not totally reject the relevance of principles developed in \u00a7 302 redemption cases in the context of a corporate reorganization implicating \u00a7 356. However, such a blind application of those principles would be somewhat akin to hunting ducks with a deer rifle, since there are fundamental differences between the redemption of stock in a single corporation and the reorganization of two or more corporations that results in a \u201cboot\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Accordingly, we hold that the district court erred in concluding that the meaningful reduction test of <em>Davis </em>was applicable here and that the \u201cboot\u201d received by the taxpayer was to be taxed as a- capital gain. Because the distribution of the \u201cboot\u201d had the effect of the distribution of a dividend, \u00a7 356(a)(2) requires that it be taxed as ordinary income.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AsX\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-13\">. <em>Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas v.

In resolving these questions, the Court held that the rules of attribution of stock ownership in \u00a7 318(a) apply to \u00a7 302(b)(1) and that \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d was irrelevant in determining whether a redemption is equivalent to a dividend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b380-15\">. <em>E. g., Levin v.

We are not unaware of several cases indicating that Sections 356(a)(2) and 302(b)(1) are to be read <em>in pari materia, </em>despite the absence of an express statutory relationship between them. <em>E. g., Hawkinson v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>235 F.2d 747, 751 (2 Cir. 1956); <em>Ross v. United States, </em>173 F.Supp. 793, 797, 146 Ct.Cl. 223, <em>cert. denied, </em>361 U.S. 875, 80 S.Ct. 138, 4 L.Ed.2d 113 (1959). This is correct in that both provisions are usually triggered by pro rata distributions. However, the facts of the instant case illustrate why principles developed in \u00a7 302(b)(1) cases cannot be haphazardly applied in the context of a \u00a7 356(a)(2) reorganization. The Internal Revenue Service has stated that tests developed for \u00a7 302 may \u201cin appropriate cases\u201d serve as \u201cuseful guidelines for purposes of applying \u00a7 356(a)(2).\u201d Rev.Rul. 74-516, 1974-2 Cum. Bull. 121. We agree with the government that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>the instant case is not among those \u201cappropriate cases.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b382-8\">. The purpose of the test is to ensure that the shareholders of the corporations involved in a reorganization retain a significant continuing equity interest in the reorganized business. <em>See Le Tulle </em>v. <em>Scofield, </em>308 U.S. 415, 60 S.Ct. 313, 84 L.Ed. 355 (1940); <em>Helvering v. Minnesota Tea Co., </em>296 U.S. 378, 56 S.Ct. 269, 80 L.Ed. 284 (1935); <em>Pinellas Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>287 U.S. 462, 53 S.Ct. 257, 77 L.Ed. 428 (1933); <em>Southwest Natural Gas Co. v.

The \u201cboot\u201d is to be treated as having been distributed by the acquired corporation \u2014 here LSC \u2014 rather than by the acquiring corporation. <em>See Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Owens, supra; Ross v. United States, supra; James Armour, Inc., </em>43 T.C. 295 (1964). Our decision in <em>Davant v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>366 F.2d 874 (5 Cir. 1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>386 U.S. 1022, 87 S.Ct. 1370, 18 L.Ed.2d 460 (1967), is not to the contrary. There we recognized the general rule stated above, but looked to the acquired <em>and </em>acquiring corporations since both had the same shareholders. As we pointed out, the two corporations \u201cwere but different pockets in the same pair of trousers.\u201d 366 F.2d at 889.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b383-7\">. The House Report states:</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">The necessity for this provision may best be shown by an example: Corporation A has capital stock of $100,000, and earnings and profits accumulated since March 1, 1913, of $50,000. If it distributes the $50,000 as a dividend to its stockholders, the amount distributed will be taxed at the full surtax rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">On the other hand, corporation A may organize corporation B, to which it transfers all its assets, the consideration for the transfer being the insurance by B of all its stock and $50,000 in cash to the stockholders of corporation A in exchange for their stock in corporation A. Under the existing law, the $50,-000 distributed with the stock of corporation B would be taxed, not as a dividend, but as a capital gain, subject only to the 12\u2018/2 per cent rate. The effect of such a distribution is obviously the same as if the corporation had declared out as a dividend its $50,000 earnings and profits. If dividends are to be subject to the full surtax rates, then such an amount so distributed should also be subject to the surtax rates and not to the 12V2 per cent rate on capital gain. Here again this provision prevents evasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">House Report No. 179, <em>supra </em>at 14-15. Senate Report No. 398, <em>supra </em>at 15-16, gives the same example.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b384-4\">. The doctrine\u2019s place in the reorganization context is plain, for when cash is received in a series of transactions in connection with a general reorganization plan, the taxable result may vary considerably depending upon whether the transactions are to be considered separately or as a whole and whether the cash constitutes \u201cboot\u201d or the sole consideration in connection with a single step in the transaction. <em>See </em>3 J. MERTENS, LAW OF FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION, \u00a7\u00a7 20.161 et seq. (1972). There is no doubt in the instant case that the \u201cboot\u201d was distributed pursuant to an overall plan of corporate reorganization.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b384-5\">. Taxpayer cites and discusses various \u00a7 302 redemption cases. <em>E. g., Zenz </em>v. <em>Quinlivan, </em>213 F.2d 914 (6 Cir. 1954); <em>Arthur D. </em>McDonald, 52 T.C. 82 (1969). As we have previously indicated, we will not haphazardly apply \u00a7 302 principles in \u00a7 356 cases. Moreover, the cases relied on by taxpayer only peripherally involve the step transaction doctrine and simply stand for the proposition that either the complete termination of a taxpayer\u2019s interest in a corporation or the substantial reduction of that interest does not result in dividend equivalency. The Supreme Court reaffirmed this principle in <em>Davis.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b384-10\">. This rule stemmed from language in <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Estate of Bedford, </em>325 U.S. 283, 65 S.Ct. 1157, 89 L.Ed. 1611 (1945). The opinion was widely criticized, however, because it appeared to encompass all distributions, regardless of whether they were made on a pro rata basis. Accordingly, a string of lower court decisions have retreated from the rule and have examined, as we have done here, the facts and circumstances of each case in order to determine the effect of the distribution. <em>E. g., Hawkinson v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra; Ross v. United States, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b384-11\">. This case is obviously a complex one, and the court was aided by the excellent briefs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>argument of both parties. We thus cannot say that this tax puzzle is one that \u201ccometh not out save by fasting and by prayer,\u201d <em>Houston Textile Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>173 F.2d 464 (5 Cir. 1949) (Hutcheson, J.), although we certainly do not disparage either of those activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
