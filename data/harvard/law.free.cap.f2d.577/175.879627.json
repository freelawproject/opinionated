KAUFMAN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b267-21\">Gerald Sprayregen appeals from his conviction on all counts of an 11-count indictment, charging him with the preparation and dissemination of false financial statements relating to the John\u2019s Bargain Stores Corp., and with the subsequent concealment of this massive fraud. Specifically, appellant was convicted of submitting materially false financial reports to the SEC, to credit agencies, and to the First Pennsylvania Banking &amp; Trust Co. so that he could receive a loan. Sprayregen now raises two issues on appeal. He contends that the prosecutor\u2019s repeated assertions during summation that he was lying contravene this court\u2019s holdings in <em>United States v. White, </em>486 F.2d 204 (2d Cir. 1973) and <em>United States v. Bivona, </em>487 F.2d 443 (2d Cir. 1973). He also argues that, in important particulars, the testimony of two material witnesses for the government differed, and that, to the extent the government disbelieved one of them, it knowingly countenanced the presentation of perjured testimony. Although we affirm, we do not mean thereby to indicate approval of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-23\">At trial, the government established its case against Sprayregen primarily through the testimony of two witnesses, Jose Uma-na, the comptroller of John\u2019s Bargain Stores, and Walter Spengler, the chain\u2019s Vice President of Operations subsequent to 1972. Their testimony, taken, as we must, in the light most favorable to the government, <em>see United States v. Freeman, </em>498 F.2d 569 (2d Cir. 1974), established that, in 1969, a group of investors, including several sympathetic to the so-called Sprayregen in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>terests, acquired control of John\u2019s Bargain Stores. Immediately thereafter, this group, and the president of John\u2019s, one David Cohen, committed the corporation to an agreement whereby the stores agreed to purchase the appellant\u2019s brokerage firm, Sprayregen &amp; Co., for a sum estimated at fifteen million dollars. Suppliers, apparently concerned over the exercise of this \u201cput agreement\u201d and its effect on the corporation\u2019s liquidity, commenced refusing credit to the John\u2019s Bargain Stores chain consisting of over 200 discount outlets. Throughout 1970, in fact, conditions worsened as store managers, forced to purchase inferior merchandise, found these goods were stagnating on the shelves.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Seeking to revitalize the chain, Sprayre-gen and Walter Spengler, then newly hired, decided to undertake a \u201cmark down\u201d program, reducing the price of merchandise in an effort to increase volume and generate cash. The amount of reductions was greater than expected, however, and the chain sustained a loss of approximately 1.8 million dollars. The instant criminal action derives from appellant\u2019s efforts, along with Spengler and Umana, to conceal this loss through a manipulation of the amount credited to John\u2019s Bargain Stores\u2019 inventory. When, moreover, it appeared that this fraud was about to be discovered appellant, in concert with Spengler and Umana, agreed to fabricate a story placing all blame for the fraud on Umana. This false tale was adhered to until Umana and, eventually Spengler, recounted a totally different version of the events concerning John\u2019s Bargain Stores, and pleaded guilty to charges relating to the fraud. The appellant, who testified in his own behalf, denied any knowledge of the actions taken at John\u2019s to conceal the chain\u2019s massive losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">The case presented to the jury, accordingly, was one dependent on the jury\u2019s assessment of credibility. If the jurors credited the testimony of Umana and Spengler, or portions of their testimony, as their verdict indicates they must have, the government\u2019s case against the appellant was concededly compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">It is in this context that Sprayregen\u2019s complaint regarding the propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks during summation must be considered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>United States v. White, supra, </em>and <em>United States v. Bivona, supra, </em>we instructed prosecutors to perform their tasks with dignity and self-discipline, and directed them to refrain from expressing their personal beliefs that a defendant is lying. In both cases, however, we noted that the defendant was not prejudiced by the excesses of the government attorney. Although <em>White </em>and <em>Bivona </em>dealt with relatively short trials, where an intemperate summation would be more likely to influence a jury, we observed that the strength of the government\u2019s case and the court\u2019s proper instruction to the jury that it was the sole judge of credibility rendered prejudice unlikely. The United States Attorney here certainly did not exercise the restraint appropriate to his office, and his overzealousness contravened our clear instructions in <em>White </em>and Bivona.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Yet, it is even less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>likely than in <em>White </em>and <em>Bivona </em>that his remarks occasioned any prejudice to the defendant. The case against Sprayregen was, as we have indicated, an extremely strong one once the jury resolved the issue of credibility against him. Moreover, the summation, which alone took the better part of an afternoon, came at the end of a long and difficult trial, lasting almost four weeks. The jury was to be swayed either by Sprayregen or by the two primary witnesses for the government, and it is unlikely that a few intemperate remarks made in the course of a month-long trial affected its result.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Sprayregen\u2019s second contention is equally without merit. While it is clear that Spengler\u2019s recollection did not comport precisely with Umana\u2019s, this is hardly a situation where the prosecution knowingly offered false evidence. <em>See Napue v. Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1954); <em>Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). The government presented Umana\u2019s and Spengler\u2019s testimony to the jury with their inconsistencies openly submitted for its consideration and the jury chose to believe the government\u2019s evidence despite the differences. Indeed, it would be far more troubling if the government coached its witnesses to present an identical story.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-5\">. The following are examples of the prosecutor\u2019s objectionable statements cited by appellant:</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Ladies and gentlemen, that man would tell you the sky was green if it would permit him to escape conviction here. ... He will sit there and tell you that your skin is blue if he thinks it will get him off.</p>\n<p id=\"ay-dedup-0\">\n<em>and</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Then I would ask you to compare that [the government\u2019s evidence], ladies and gentlemen, with the testimony of that man, the defendant, who stood up there \u2014 and I don\u2019t hesitate \u2014 and bald-facedly lied to you repeatedly.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">The prosecutor admitted at argument that, had he been aware of this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>White, supra, </em>and <em>Bivona, supra, </em>he would have refrained from making these remarks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b268-13\">. As we noted, the Assistant United States Attorney admitted on argument that he had not been familiar with these cases. We direct his attention further to Standard 5.8(b) of the A.B.A. Prosecution Standards:</p>\n<p id=\"b268-14\">It is unprofessional conduct for the prosecutor to express his personal belief or opinion as to the truth or falsity of any testimony or evidence of the guilt of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-15\">All prosecutors in this circuit should be guided by this rule in the future.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
