The United States also appeals, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>from judgments of acquittal entered by the trial court as to two defendants after they were found guilty by the jury. We reverse the judgments of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-9\">The evidence displayed organized prostitution in its most degrading aspects. The women ranged from experienced professionals to teen-age girls as young as 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>some induced into prostitution by promises of money, clothing and cars, others forced by beatings and threats of violence, even some recruited through their parents. They worked with and often were controlled by pimps to whom they turned over their earnings, and when necessary they were disciplined by threats, beatings and pistol whippings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-5\">By plane, bus and the cars of pimps the women were moved from location to location on command, from Virginia to Alabama, to cities, towns and rural truck stops, where they operated in houses of prostitution, apartments, massage parlors, mobile homes and the outbuildings of rural service stations. Some were \u201cowned\u201d by one pimp, others by \u201cjoint owners.\u201d Women were \u201csold\u201d by one pimp to another.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Arrangements were made for abortions, releases on bail and even dental care. The take was large, for example $110,000 in five to six months at a small-town Georgia truck stop. Prostitutes earned as much as $400-$500 per week; as little as clothing money.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-6\">I. Denial of access to witnesses [1] The assistant United States Attorney handling the case instructed some 30 to 35 witnesses appearing before the grand jury that the proceedings were secret and that they should not discuss their testimony with anyone other than their attorneys or government agents. The defense learned of this and filed a motion asking to be permitted to talk to the witnesses. A magistrate heard the motion and, on March 26, 1976, entered an order 'stating that the witnesses could talk with defense counsel. He ordered that each witness subpoenaed by the government be served forthwith with a copy of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-12\">The case was set for trial April 5. The government asserts that on April 5 a copy of the order was given to all, or most, of the witnesses. The defendants say this was not done until July 12. The case was continued to June 7, and before that date continued again to July 12. On July 12 the court learned that defendants still had not had full access to the witnesses who had appeared before the grand jury. In some instances defense counsel had been able to talk to, and even get a statement from, a witness. The government does not dispute, however, that in the main the witnesses had not been interviewed by the defense. It is unclear whether this was caused by lack of knowledge of the magistrate\u2019s order, failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>of the government to serve the order, dila-toriness of the defendants, or some combination of these factors. For purposes of this appeal, we assume the fault was the government\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-4\">The district judge tried to rectify the matter. The witnesses were assembled in the courtroom with government counsel excluded and advised of their rights and obligations as witnesses. Defense counsel began interviewing persons willing to submit to interviews. There were approximately 12 defense counsel present, and about 10 of some 80 witnesses were interviewed on July 12. As this process began either the magistrate or the assistant United States Attorney told some of the witnesses not yet interviewed that they were excused until the next day. Before the actual trial began the following day the defendants moved for a continuance based on their inability to prepare. The motion was denied. The trial began and lasted three weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-5\">All defendants contend these events deprived them of a fair trial. The government has conceded, grudgingly and halfheartedly, that the instructions to the witnesses were improper.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It has not satisfactorily explained the failure to serve the magistrate\u2019s order forthwith on as many witnesses as could be found. The government erred, but other than general allegations of prejudice the defendants have not shown that they were really harmed by belated access to the witnesses. The names of some witnesses were revealed by the indictments. By July 12 some of the defendants had already talked to, and even obtained statements from, some witnesses. Several days before trial the government furnished statements of witnesses, FBI reports of interviews and grand jury testimony. On the first day of trial the government furnished defendants a list of government witnesses. No particularized prejudice is even argued with respect to any specific witnesses. Defendants made no showing that they could not interview witnesses as the long trial progressed. When the government rested after two weeks and 47 witnesses, no defendant asked for additional time to further prepare a defense or to locate additional witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-9\">Defense counsel were indignant at the government\u2019s interference with their access to witnesses and its inept response to corrective efforts, and they were entitled to be indignant. But they have not demonstrated real, substantive impairment of their right to fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-10\">II. Other prosecutorial misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-11\">On cross-examination it was brought out that government witness Lawrence had given a statement to an investigator for some of the defendants in which he described instructions that he said were given him by the assistant United States Attorney concerning how he should conduct himself when called as a witness. The general effect of the alleged instructions was that when defense objections had been sustained to testimony, upon a signal from the assistant United States Attorney witness Lawrence would get the information over to the jury anyhow. If the alleged instructions were given, it is not shown that any prejudice to defendants resulted. The same analysis applies to the testimony of a hostile government witness, who stated that when she questioned what she said were inaccuracies in a statement previously taken from her by the FBI, the assistant United States Attorney threatened her with a perjury charge \u201cif [she] got on the stand and lied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>III. Discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-5\">Before trial the government turned over to defendants a great volume of Jencks Act material. Defendants complain of the failure to turn over one FBI interr view report, failure to tell the defense that a witness had told an FBI agent of some insignificant errors in the transcript of his grand jury testimony, and failure to tell defendants that in the past a government witness had been a paid informer. These complaints are overblown and in no instance shown to be prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-6\">Also, the government was required to give the names of persons who had been promised immunity. It delayed in doing so despite several demands. Only a limited number of persons \u2014 the government says three \u2014 had been extended formal immunity. Nevertheless, the prosecutor realized that statements had been made informally to witnesses, particularly young prostitutes, that they were not going to be prosecuted for prostitution, and he furnished at trial a list of 30 names. The government\u2019s response was dilatory, but no defendant points out any prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-7\">IV. Single versus multiple conspiracies</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-8\">Some of the defendants raise the Kotteakos<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> contention that a single conspiracy was charged, multiple conspiracies proved. The conspiracy here is similar to that in <em>U. S. v. Perez, </em>489 F.2d 51 (CA5, 1973). We eschew any effort to describe it in structural terms. It was a single-purpose and continuously ongoing undertaking to operate a multi-state prostitution enterprise. Prostitutes were recruited, \u201cbroken in,\u201d cared for, disciplined, moved from location to location, and dropped out of the ring or were put out. Many reappeared and rejoined. The nature of the enterprise necessarily included a cast part permanent and part changeable and changing, and constantly changing locations. Billy Johnson was' the dominant force. Clemones, Dill, Surrett, Joseph Earl Johnson, and others were helpers, associated pimps and junior pimps, some not always present but floating in and out of the ongoing operation. We hold that there was no variance, but if there was the substantial rights of the defendants were not materially affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-10\">V. Defendant Scott</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-11\">Scott was not entitled to judgment of acquittal on count 10. Count 10 charged her with a violation of the Mann Act by aiding and abetting in the transportation of Thelma Ann Lunsford from Georgia to Johnson City, Tennessee, in 1973. Lunsford had been working in various cities for Billy Johnson. Johnson, in Rome, Georgia, told her that he was sending her to Johnson City, Tennessee. In Lunsford\u2019s presence Johnson called Scott, who operated a house of prostitution in Johnson City, and told Scott that he was sending Lunsford to Johnson City. Johnson took Lunsford to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where she caught a bus to Johnson City. She was met there at the bus station by Scott who took her to Scott\u2019s emporium. Lunsford worked there as a prostitute for two weeks, then on instruction from Johnson returned by bus to Chattanooga. Johnson met her there and drove her back to Rome. Lunsford gave Johnson money she had earned working for Scott. Later Lunsford traveled to Johnson City several more times, went to Scott\u2019s, and worked there as a prostitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-12\">Scott contends that on Lunsford\u2019s first trip in 1973 the only act she committed was to meet Lunsford at the bus station in Johnson City at which time the offense already had been completed. This overlooks the prearrangement consisting of the telephone call, followed by the actual interstate transportation with the last leg terminating at Scott\u2019s house in Johnson City. <em>U. S. v. Dimsdale, </em>410 F.2d 358 (CA5, 1969), holds that the transportation necessary for conviction is complete when the state line is crossed. It does not stand for the converse, i. e., that furnishing transportation after the state line is crossed and as part of a prearranged interstate trip is not an offense. <em>See Cwach v. U. S., </em>212 F.2d 520 (CA8, 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>Scott received a three-year sentence on each count, all concurrent. Under the concurrent sentence doctrine, we need not consider the validity of Scott\u2019s convictions on counts 1, 2 and 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-4\">VI. Defendant Joseph Harold Johnson</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-5\">By arrangement between this defendant and Billy Johnson, Lunsford went from Georgia to Florida to entertain \u201cthe Colonel,\u201d a man with whom this defendant was attempting to negotiate a land transaction. The defendant and Clemones drove Luns-ford to this defendant\u2019s motel in Florida, where she met \u201cthe Colonel\u201d and had sexual relations with him. He paid no money to her for her favors, and as far as she knew he paid no money to anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-6\">Defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952, making it unlawful to travel in interstate commerce with intent to carry on an unlawful activity and thereafter to perform an act to carry on said activity. The term \u201cunlawful activity\u201d includes any business enterprises involving prostitution offenses in violation of the laws of the state where committed. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952(b). The appellant says that under Florida law prostitution is confined to sexual intercourse for hire. But Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 796.07 (West 1976) also includes in the definition \u201cgiving or receiving of the body for licentious sexual intercourse without hire.\u201d Appellant also argues that the isolated event with \u201cthe Colonel\u201d does not amount to a business enterprise within \u00a7 1952. The jury could have concluded, however, that \u2022 the defendant\u2019s motel was a business enterprise involving prostitution and that the trip to Florida was intended in part to facilitate the carrying on of unlawful activity in the motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-7\">VII. Defendant Clemones</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-8\">Clemones asserts that he was entitled to judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy count and on substantive counts 2, 16,17,18 and 25. His argument, in essence, is that the evidence of his furnishing or otherwise participating in the transportation of prostitutes to points in other states shows no more than that \u201che went along for the ride\u201d with defendant Billy Johnson. Billy Johnson was the master pimp of the network. Clemones was deeply involved with Johnson and the network in many ways that were described to the jury. The jury could infer that Clemones, who was active on numerous other occasions in various ways \u2014 including transporting prostitutes to other states \u2014 was not an innocent guest on these delivery runs but was a central figure in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-10\">Because Clemones\u2019 sentences under counts 2, 16, 17, 18 and 25 are concurrent with his sentence under the conspiracy count, we need not consider his remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-11\">VIII. Defendant Coburn</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-12\">Coburn was convicted on counts 1 and 41. He received concurrent sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-13\">A pimp named Surrett, with whom Billy Johnson had many dealings, testified that Johnson asked him to go into partnership with Johnson and Coburn for conducting prostitution at Coburn\u2019s truck stop in Cedar Bluff, Alabama. Johnson brought a young girl from his trailer at Rome, Georgia, to Coburn\u2019s place, talked with Coburn and left. The girl declined to engage in prostitution. Johnson returned and beat her, and she then did engage in prostitution, with Co-burn and his wife arranging her dates. After a couple of days of this Coburn drove the girl to Rome and delivered her back to Johnson.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The jury found that Coburn was a member of the conspiracy, and we will not disturb this finding. Coburn also attacks the alleged failure of the government to promptly furnish a list of its witnesses. The list was furnished on the first day of trial. In view of the concurrent sentence, we need not discuss Coburn\u2019s conviction on Count 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-14\">IX. The government\u2019s appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-15\">The jury found Hatmaker and LeCompte guilty on Count One. The trial court, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>ever, found the evidence insufficient to support verdicts against Hatmaker and Le-Compte and granted their motions for judgments of acquittal. From these rulings the government appeals. We reverse'.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-5\">The government can appeal a judgment of acquittal entered after a verdict of guilt. In U. <em>S. v. Boyd, </em>566 F.2d 929 (CA5, 1978), this court held such an appeal permissible pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731 (1976). The decision in <em>Boyd </em>is not inconsistent with the principles announced in <em>U. S. v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977). <em>See U. S. v. Scott, </em>- U.S. -\u2022, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-8\">We must decide whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s conclusions that beyond reasonable doubt the appellees conspired to violate \u00a7 1962(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-9\">[U] Under Count One Hatmaker and LeCompte were charged with a conspiracy to operate an interstate prostitution ring through a pattern of racketeering activity. Our affirmance of the convictions of Billy Johnson, Clemones, Charles Coburn, and Scott establishes that the government proved the existence of the conspiracy. The government was not required to prove that the appellees had full knowledge of all the details of the conspiracy. Knowledge of its essential nature \u2014 to operate a prostitution ring through a pattern of racketeering activity \u2014 is sufficient. <em>U. S. v. Brasseaux, </em>509 F.2d 157, 160 (CA5, 1975). <em>See Blumenthal v. U. S., </em>332 U.S. 539, 557, 68 S.Ct. 248, 256, 92 L.Ed. 154, 168 (1947). In this case the evidence is sufficient that each appellee harbored the required intent to enter the conspiracy as well as the state of mind necessary to commit the object offense of conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. <em>Compare U. S. v. Cantu, </em>557 F.2d 1173 (CA5, 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1063, 98 S.Ct. 1236, 55 L.Ed.2d 763 (1978), with <em>U. S. v. Feola, </em>420 U.S. 671, 95 S.Ct. 1255, 43 L.Ed.2d 541 (1975). <em>See </em>Marcus, <em>Criminal Conspiracy: The State of Mind Crime </em>\u2014 Intent, <em>Proving Intent, and Anti-federal Intent, </em>1976 U.Ill.L.F. 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-11\">The evidence, as it relates to Hat-maker, shows that she operated <em>a </em>house of prostitution in Knoxville, Tennessee. In 1971 Billy Johnson called her from Rome, Georgia, and told her that he would bring Thelma Lunsford to Hatmaker\u2019s place in Knoxville for prostitution. He then brought Thelma to Hatmaker\u2019s house, and she did engage in prostitution there and turned her earnings over to Billy Johnson. In 1973 or 1974, Mildred Lunsford traveled with Billy Johnson and Thelma Lunsford from Rome, Georgia, to Chattanooga, then Mildred traveled by common carrier to Johnson City, Tennessee, where Hatmaker met her. Thereafter Mildred worked in Johnson City as a prostitute. On a second occasion, Hatmaker met Mildred on her arrival in Johnson City. Again, Lunsford worked as a prostitute in Johnson City. The evidence further reveals that Linda Bishop, a prostitute, worked at Hatmaker\u2019s establishment in Knoxville after traveling to Knoxville with Thelma Lunsford. She gave Hatmaker some of her earnings while there. Bishop left Knoxville and flew to Atlanta to meet Billy Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-12\">The evidence, as it relates to LeCompte, shows that he managed the Big Rig Truck Stop near Newport, Tennessee, and that the truck stop was one of the locations at which Billy Johnson placed his prostitutes. Thelma Lunsford was brought there by Billy Johnson. LeCompte was running the Big Rig, and Thelma gave him half the money she made. She overheard conversations between LeCompte and Billy Johnson regarding prostitution. When LeCompte was arrested, records were found in the cabin next to his residence which the jury could infer showed Thelma\u2019s daily earnings. Linda Bishop was brought to the Big Rig by Billy Johnson to engage in prostitution, and while there she gave part of her money to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>LeCompte. Catherine Weathers was brought by Billy Johnson from Roanoke, Virginia, to the Big Rig and introduced to LeCompte.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\">Thus, prostitutes were brought from out of state and delivered, or were sent from out of state and were met, and were set up in business at Hatmaker\u2019s and at the Big Rig. Some or all of them paid over earnings to Hatmaker or LeCompte and to Billy Johnson. Johnson, the pimp, discussed travel arrangements with Hatmaker. He talked prostitution with LeCompte and introduced Weathers to LeCompte. These things occurred in the conduct of prostitution, in which movement of women from place to place, and supervision of women by pimps, and division of money with the pimp and the operator, are characteristic. With respect to both Hatmaker and LeCompte the jury could infer that each knew that the essential nature of the conspiracy embraced a pattern of travel in interstate commerce by persons intending to advance their unlawful business enterprise through the commission of acts specified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 and embraced the division of the earnings of the prostitutes who had been sent or brought in. The jury was entitled to reject inferences that Hatmaker and LeCompte each carried on a local enterprise and had no knowledge that the conspiracy into which they entered as participants involved interstate travel. The trial court erred in granting the motions for judgments of acquittal by Hatmaker and LeCompte.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-5\">The judgments of conviction of the individual appellants are AFFIRMED. The judgment acquitting Hatmaker and Le-Compte on Count One is REVERSED and the case REMANDED for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1343-15\">. Of the defendants involved in this appeal, all except Joseph Harold Johnson were convicted on Count One of the 44-count indictment. Count One charged each defendant with conspiring to operate an interstate prostitution ring through a pattern of racketeering activities in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d) (1976). Billy Johnson, Priscilla Scott and Mike Clemones were convicted on Count Two, which charged them with operating an interstate prostitution ring through a pattern of racketeering activities</p>\n<p id=\"AzDr\">in violation of 18 U.S.C.. \u00a7 1962(c) (1976). Charles Coburn was convicted on Count Forty-one, which charged a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421 (1976). Joseph Harold Johnson was convicted on Count Eighteen, which charged a \u2019 violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952(a) (1976). Additionally, Scott was convicted on two other counts, Clemones on four, and Billy Johnson on 19. Each of these counts charged a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952(a) (1976), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421 (1976), or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>The relevant portions of the statutes, all from 18 U.S.C., are set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-5\">\u00a7 1961.
