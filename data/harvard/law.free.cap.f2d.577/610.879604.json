The district court agreed and dismissed the petition.' The appellant argues that the defense of abandonment should have been left to the arbitrator. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-14\">In <em>Operating Engineers Local 150 v. Flair Builders, Inc., </em>406 U.S. 487, 92 S.Ct. 1710, 32 L,Ed.2d 248 (1971), the Supreme Court held that a district court erred in dismissing a petition to compel arbitration on the ground of laches. The Court held that a broad arbitration clause requiring the parties to arbitrate \u201cany difference\u201d included the defense of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">In this case the collective bargaining agreement provided without limitation for arbitration of any \u201ccomplaint against the other party regarding a grievance which has not been amicably settled\u201d or, more simply, \u201call disputes and grievances.\u201d This language is sufficiently broad to include the defense of repudiation which, under the circumstances here, is equivalent to a defense of laches. <em>See also H &amp; M Box, Inc. v. Bakery &amp; Confectionery Workers Local 45, </em>493 F.2d 1226 (1st Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-16\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
