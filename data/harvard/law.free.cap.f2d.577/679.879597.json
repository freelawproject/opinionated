Inasmuch as La Raza did not qualify as a \u201cmajor party,\u201d the composition of the various precinct election boards was limited to Democrats and Republicans, to the total exclusion of La Raza Unida party members.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">La Raza asked for a preliminary injunction and requested that a three-judge court be convened under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281 to hear the matter. The several defendants responded to the motion for preliminary injunction and answered the complaint. The district court denied the request to convene a three-judge court on the ground that La Raza\u2019s claims were \u201cwholly insubstantial\u201d since such claims were foreclosed by the decision in <em>Pirincin </em>v. <em>Board of Elections of Cuyahoga County, </em>368 F.Supp. 64 (N.D. Ohio), aff\u2019d mem., 414 U.S. 990, 94 S.Ct. 345, 38 L.Ed.2d 231 (1973). Thereafter, the district court, dismissed the action for lack of a substantial federal question. La Raza now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The Supreme Court has held that a three-judge court is not required under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281 if the constitutional claim is insubstantial. <em>Goosby </em>v. <em>Osser, </em>409 U.S. 512, 518, 93 S.Ct. 854, 859, 35 L.Ed.2d 36 (1973). <em>Goosby </em>further holds that a claim is constitutionally insubstantial if it is squarely foreclosed by \u201cprior decisions [which] inescapably render the claims frivolous.\u201d The trial court was of the view that the claim of La Raza in the instant case was, for all practical purposes, the same as the claim asserted, and rejected, in <em>Pirincin, </em>which judgment had thereafter been affirmed, without written opinion, by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The fact that the Supreme Court in <em>Pirincin </em>affirmed without written opinion, as opposed to affirming in a written opinion, is of no particular significance insofar as our present problem is concerned. The action of the Supreme Court in affirming without an opinion the judgment of the three-judge court constitutes a \u201cprior decision\" as that phrase is used in <em>Goosby. </em>In support thereof, see <em>Vazza v. Campbell, </em>520 F.2d 848 (1st Cir. 1975). In <em>Vazza, </em>the district court had refused to convene a three-judge court on the basis of a three-judge decision by the district court for the Northern District of Texas, which judgment was later affirmed without written opinion by the Supreme Court. In <em>Vazza, </em>the First Circuit affirmed the judgment of the trial court refusing to convene a three-judge court with this comment:</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Not only is the opinion [of the three-judge court in the Northern District of Texas] persuasive in its own right, but the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent summary affirmance renders wholly insubstantial appellant\u2019s claim that the Constitution requires that we resolve this case differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">On oral argument, counsel for La Raza agreed that if the rule of <em>Pirincin </em>has present application, then La Raza cannot prevail in its appeal. Thus, the issue is whether the claim in the present case is the same as the claim in <em>Pirincin. </em>If it is, then by virtue of the decision in <em>Pirincin, </em>which was affirmed by the Supreme Court, the present claim, under <em>Goosby </em>is insubstantial, and a three-judge court did not have to be convened. La Raza argues that its claim does not come within the rule of <em>Pirincin. </em>The trial court, however, in rejecting La Raza\u2019s request for a three-judge court, was of the view that the present claim was identical to the claim in <em>Pirincin, </em>and that the election laws under attack in <em>Pirincin </em>were similar to the election laws under attack here. We agree with the trial court\u2019s analysis of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\"><em>Pirincin </em>involved an attack on Ohio election laws, and particularly the manner in which county boards of elections were constituted. Under Ohio law, county boards of elections were appointed from the two parties receiving the highest number of votes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>in the preceding gubernatorial election, which meant that all members of the county boards of elections were either Democrats or Republicans. One plaintiff in <em>Pir-incin </em>was a member of the Socialist Labor Party, a minor party whose members were foreclosed under Ohio law from appointment to a county board of election. Another plaintiff in <em>Pirincin </em>was a black person and a third plaintiff was a female. All claimed their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments were being violated by the Ohio laws which, in effect, restricted appointment to county boards of election to Democrats and Republicans.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">As indicated, in <em>Pirincin, </em>a three-judge court held that the Ohio law relating to county boards of elections was not constitutionally infirm, and its judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court. Without going into further comparison of <em>Pirincin </em>with the instant case, we believe that the instant case is squarely with the rule of <em>Pirincin. </em>A fair reading of <em>Pirincin </em>convinces us that <em>Pirincin </em>and the instant case are for all practical purposes indistinguishable. Under <em>Goosby, </em>then, La Raza\u2019a claim in the present case is squarely foreclosed by prior decision and for that reason is constitutionally insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">A further similarity between <em>Pirincin </em>and the present one, which deserves brief comment, is that each involved, among other things, an attack on a particular election board. In <em>Pirincin, </em>there was an attack on the county election board members for Cu-yahoga County. In the instant case, there was an attack on local election officials in Rio Arriba County. In each instance, the complaint was about the same, namely, misconduct on the part of present election officials appointed under the existing law. In <em>Pirincin </em>the three-judge court rejected this claim with the following comment:</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The May, 1972 \u201celection disaster\u201d in Cuyahoga County does not demonstrate that Ohio\u2019s method of selecting county election board members \u201cviolates the Constitution.\u201d Rather, it is a classic case of a breakdown in the election machinery when the supervisors . . . did not supervise . . . the Director of Elections did not direct, and . . . the Board failed in its responsibilities to keep informed of the activities of the Director and supervisors. 368 F.Supp. at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
