(Kimbrell\u2019s), which operates a furniture store in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Furniture Distributors, Inc., Kimbrell\u2019s corporate parent, alleging that both defendants were liable for statutory damages under the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601 <em>et seq., </em>for violations of certain disclosure requirements set forth in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Truth in Lending Regulations (Regulation Z), 12 C.F.R. Part 226. The district court certified a class consisting of plaintiff and persons who, between July 16,1973 and May 3, 1974, entered into add-on credit transactions at Kimbrell\u2019s downtown Charlotte furniture store. It ruled that Kimb-rell\u2019s and its corporate parent were liable under the Act to plaintiff and the members of the class and, proceeding non-jury, it assessed statutory damages in the amount of $100,000 plus costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Barber v. Kimbrell\u2019s, Inc., </em>424 F.Supp. 42 (W.D.N.C.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-16\">We affirm the district court\u2019s determination of liability against both defendants but reverse and remand for a redetermination of damages. We conclude that the district court improperly computed the maximum class recovery allowable by statute and erred in not submitting the damages question to a jury. Moreover, we conclude that the district court should have made findings to support its award of attorneys\u2019 fees. We therefore vacate the judgment as to the penalty and attorneys\u2019 fees and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-19\">I. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-20\">On July 16, 1973, plaintiff entered into a retail installment contract with Kimbrell\u2019s, Inc. for the purchase of various items of household furniture totalling $592.70. Because she already owed Kimbrell\u2019s $65.00 from a previous credit purchase, the July 16th agreement consolidated both the old and new balance and required repayment of the combined debt in twelve equal monthly installments. The written contract reflecting this agreement purported to disclose credit information as to both the new and combined transactions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-17\">On May 3,1974, plaintiff filed this action, alleging that Kimbrell\u2019s, Inc. had violated \u00a7 121 of the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and praying statutory dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ages as provided for in \u00a7 130(a) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On October 29, 1974, Barber amended her complaint so as to maintain the suit as a class action pursuant to F.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Five months later, after substantial discovery had been conducted, plaintiff, with leave of court, amended her complaint a second time to add Kimbrell\u2019s parent, Furniture Distributors, Inc., as a party defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On June 11, 1975, the court certified a plaintiff class consisting of those persons who entered into add-on credit transactions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> at Kimbrell\u2019s downtown Charlotte store between July 16, 1973 and May 3, 1974. At the time of judgment, this class numbered approximately 740 members.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-16\">The case was heard on June 7, 1976, on cross-motions for summary judgment. Concluding that the defendants, as a matter of law, had violated certain of the disclosure requirements set forth in Regulation Z, 424 F.Supp. at 47-50, the district court granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>judgment as to defendants\u2019 liability. After carefully canvassing the factors specified by Congress as relevant to the determination of statutory damages in the class-action context, 424 F.Supp. at 51-2, the district court awarded the class $100,000, the maximum award then allowable under \u00a7 1640(a)(2)(B).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although plaintiffs\u2019 counsel sought combined attorneys\u2019 fees of $19,-955, the district court, pursuant to \u00a7 1640(a)(3), awarded them $25,000 as \u201ca reasonable sum under the circumstances.\u201d 424 F.Supp. at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">II. <em>Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Kimbrell\u2019s concedes liability as to one violation of Regulation Z. It admits that the use of the term \u201cTotal Time Balance\u201d in its disclosure document<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> rather than the term \u201cTotal of Payments,\u201d as required by \u00a7 226.8(b)(3) of Regulation Z,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> constitutes a technical violation of the Act sufficient to subject it to civil liability under \u00a7 1640. Furniture Distributors, Inc. contends, however, that the district court erred in holding it jointly liable with Kimbrell\u2019s for this or any other violation of the Act on the ground that it is not a statutory creditor within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(f). Further, both defendants argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment as to their liability for any of the other disclosure violations alleged by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Section 1640 imposes civil liability on any \u201ccreditor\u201d who fails to comply with the disclosure provisions of the Act. Section 1602(f) defines a creditor as one \u201cwho regularly extend[s] or arrange[s] for the extension of credit . . . .\u201d There is no doubt that Kimbrell\u2019s, the corporate entity with which plaintiff dealt, is a creditor within the meaning of \u00a7 1602(f). Furniture Distributors contends, however, that it neither extends nor arranges for the extension of credit on a regular basis and that, therefore, it cannot be held to be a statutory creditor. The district court rejected this argument, 424 F.Supp. at 46, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">Section 226.2(h)(2), Regulation Z, provides that a person is an \u201carranger of credit\u201d if he \u201cfh]as knowledge of the credit terms and participates in the preparation of the contract documents required in connection with the extension of credit . . . .\u201d The district court found that the \u201cofficers and directors of . Furniture Distributors, Inc. participated in the development and preparation of the standard contract form . . . and distributed the form for use in Kimbrell\u2019s, Inc. and each of the other forty-seven retail stores in the Kimbrell\u2019s chain.\u201d Further, the district court found that \u201cFurniture Distributors, Inc. has knowledge of the credit terms for all the consumer credit sales by its subsidiaries in that each consummated contract is sent to [Furniture Distributors] for review.\u201d 424 F.Supp. at 46. From our review of the record, we cannot say that these two findings are clearly erroneous, F.R.Civ.P. 52(a), and they place Furniture Distributors squarely within the definition of \u201carranger,\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.2(h)(2), and, hence, within the statutory definition of creditor, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(f). <em>See Zale Corp. and Corrigan-Republic, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number><em>v. Federal Trade Commission, </em>473 F.2d 1317, 1320-22 (5 Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In addition to finding defendants in violation of \u00a7 226.8(b)(3), Regulation Z, as both now concede, the district court found multiple and substantial violations of \u00a7 226.6(a) (disclosures not made in meaningful sequence) and \u00a7 226.6(c) (misleading or incorrect additional information). 424 F.Supp. at 48-50.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Defendants contend that the district court erred in finding these violations as a matter of law and urge that we remand this portion of the case for further proceedings on the merits.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We are of the opinion that the district court acted properly in disposing of the question of defendants\u2019 liability by way of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Of course, F.R.Civ.P. 56(c) provides that summary judgment is appropriate only where there is \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact . . . .\u201d The questions of whether additional information is presented in a misleading or confusing manner, \u00a7 226.6(c), and whether the sequence of disclosed information is meaningful, \u00a7 226.-6(a), are not usually susceptible to summary judgment, because the adequacy or inadequacy of defendants\u2019 disclosure under these provisions, depending as it does on the perceptions of a \u201creasonable\u201d consumer, presents a factual issue about which there is ofttimes a dispute. The questions are similar to that of materiality in federal securities litigation, the resolution of which depends upon the perceptions of a \u201creasonable\u201d investor, where summary judgment is normally inappropriate. <em>TSC Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Northway, Inc., </em>426 U.S. 438, 96 S.Ct. 2126, 48 L.Ed.2d 757 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">Nonetheless, even as to a question of \u2022 materiality in federal securities litigation, summary judgment will lie in an appropriate case. Quoting from an earlier decision in this circuit, Mr. Justice Marshall, speaking for the Court in <em>TSC Industries, </em>wrote: \u201cOnly if the established omissions are \u2018so obviously important to an investor, that reasonable minds cannot differ on the question of materiality\u2019 is the ultimate issue of materiality appropriately resolved \u2018as a matter of law\u2019 by summary judgment. <em>Johns Hopkins University v. Hutton, </em>422 F.2d 1124, 1129 (CA 4 1970).\u201d 426 U.S. at 450, 96 S.Ct. at 2133. In <em>Johns Hopkins, </em>we held that, under the facts of that case, reasonable minds would not differ as to the materiality of the facts misrepresented and withheld and that the disposition of the case by way of summary judgment was therefore appropriate. 422 F.2d at 1129. Likewise, in the instant case, we conclude that reasonable minds would be in agreement that defendants\u2019 disclosure statement was confusing and misleading in the respects documented in the district court opinion. We, therefore, agree with the district court that defendants violated the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>closure requirements of Regulation Z, \u00a7\u00a7 226.6(a) and (c).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">III. <em>Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">We consider next the appropriate damages to be awarded plaintiff class. Section 1640(a), which creates a private right of action against any creditor who fails to disclose the information required by the Act or Regulation Z, authorizes both actual and statutory damages.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The district court, in the instant case, found no actual damages sustained by plaintiff class. But, exercising the discretion authorized by \u00a7 1640(a)(2)(B), the district court awarded statutory damages of $100,000, the maximum amount then allowable under the statute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The district court concluded that the maximum award was appropriate after carefully canvassing the five factors specified by Congress as relevant to the determination of statutory damages in class actions. 424 F.Supp. at 51-52.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While we do not question the correctness of the district court\u2019s factual findings in this regard, we nonetheless conclude that it erred both in fixing the maximum recovery at $100,000 and in not submitting the damages issue to a jury as demanded by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">In determining the maximum recovery in a class action under the Act, we look to the purposes of the Act and the history of its various enforcement provisions. These, we think, provide the answer to the issue we must decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">The Truth in Lending Act was en-. acted by Congress to serve two purposes: (1) to promote the full disclosure of credit terms in consumer credit transactions, and (2) to prescribe a uniform method for stating these terms better to enable the consumer to compare \u201cthe various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601. As enacted in 1968, the Act provided for both administrative enforcement, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1607, and enforcement by private litigation, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640. As an incentive to private enforcement, the Act allowed a successful plaintiff to recover statutory damages of twice the amount of the finance charge imposed in the transaction (but not less than $100 nor more than $1,000), plus reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and court costs. Pub.L. No. 90-321, Title I, \u00a7 130(a), 82 Stat. 157 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-14\">While the private enforcement scheme envisioned by the original Act worked well enough in individual suits, it soon became evident that the scheme was not equally well-suited to class actions. Since a class recovery consisted of simply an aggregation of individual statutory damages, with each class member being entitled to a minimum recovery of $100, courts soon recognized that a recovery of statutory damages by a large plaintiff class had the potential of visiting financial disaster upon a defendant creditor.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As a consequence, courts be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>came increasingly reluctant to certify class actions under \u00a7 1640.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">To strike an appropriate balance between the advantages of the class action as a vehicle of private enforcement and the need of creditors to avoid financial ruin, Congress in 1974 amended \u00a7 1640 as it related to class recoveries of statutory damages. S.Rep. No. 278, 93rd Cong., 1st Sess., 14-15; Note, Class Actions Under the Truth in Lending Act, 83 Yale L.J. 1410, 1428-32 (1974). The amendment (1) eliminated any minimum recovery requirement as to individual class members, (2) placed a ceiling on the total class recovery so that a creditor\u2019s total liability for statutory damages would be no more than \u201cthe lesser of $100,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the creditor,\u201d and (3) made the award of statutory damages in the class context discretionary rather than a matter of right as it had been before the amendment and as it continued to be with regard to individual actions. Pub.L. No. 93-495, \u00a7 408(a), 88 Stat. 1518 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">We think that the district court upset the balance struck by Congress in the 1974 amendment when it fixed the maximum recovery allowable under \u00a7 1640(a)(2)(B) at $100,000. The class certified by the district court consisted of all persons purchasing furniture from Kimbrell\u2019s downtown Charlotte store under an add-on credit arrangement. Yet, in determining the maximum liability of defendants under \u00a7 1640(a)(2)(B), the district court looked not just to the assets allocable to this one store, but to the total net worth of defendant Furniture Distributors, which included the combined assets of all of its subsidiaries as well as assets it held independently of these subsidiaries. Finding 1% of this total net worth to be well in excess of $100,000, the district court concluded that \u00a7 1640(a)(2)(B) limited defendants\u2019 liability to $100,000. We are of the opinion that, given the perimeter of the class certified, the district court erred in looking beyond those assets of defendants properly allocable to the store at which plaintiff dealt.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Accordingly, we remand for a redetermination of the appropriate statutory ceiling.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">Our conclusion is reinforced by this additional consideration. Under established class-action doctrine, a judgment rendered in favor of a Rule 23(b)(3) class binds all class members receiving notice and not requesting exclusion. F.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(3). In the instant case, once summary judgment establishing defendants\u2019 liability under the Act was entered, all members of plaintiff class were thereafter barred from securing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>individual judgments against defendants; but actions by persons who had dealt with other stores in Furniture Distributors\u2019 chain were not foreclosed. Conceivably, class suits could have been brought against Furniture Distributors as to each of its forty-eight stores. If, in each of these suits, each court granting judgment had looked to Furniture Distributors\u2019 total net worth in determining the maximum recovery under \u00a7 1640(a)(2)(B), Furniture Distributors and its subsidiaries could have been liable for as much as $1.5 million, a figure far in excess of the maximum recovery contemplated by the statute.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Such total recovery against a single creditor would transgress the congressional intent to limit such creditor\u2019s financial responsibility. We therefore conclude that, with respect to class actions, the intent of Congress was to place an absolute limit of 1% of net worth on the total recovery potentially realizable against a single creditor for a particular violation or set of violations without regard to the number of class actions into which the litigation against the creditor might be fragmented.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Included in Kimbrell\u2019s answer to Barber\u2019s complaint was a demand that the claims asserted against it be tried by a jury. This demand was twice renewed \u2014 once when Kimbrell\u2019s filed its answer to Barber\u2019s amended complaint seeking class certification and again when Furniture Distributors filed its answer. The record does not disclose that defendants\u2019 demands were later retracted nor their right to a jury trial waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Finding the demand both timely made and still pendent, we conclude that on remand the damage award under \u00a7 1640(a)(2)(B) must be determined by a jury. We think that <em>Curtis v. Loether, </em>415 U.S. 189, 94 S.Ct. 1005, 39 L.Ed.2d 260 (1974), requires this result.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\"><em>Curtis </em>arose in a context not unlike the one before us here. Plaintiff had filed a private enforcement action under Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601 <em>et seq., </em>alleging racial discrimination in housing, for which she prayed both compensatory and punitive damages as authorized by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612. Defendant made a timely demand for a jury trial which was denied by the district court. After a trial on the merits, at which the court found that defendant had engaged in unlawful racial discrimination in housing, plaintiff was awarded $250 in punitive damages, there being no actual damages proved. The Seventh Circuit reversed the district court on the jury trial issue and the Supreme Court affirmed in a unanimous decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">Finding the \u201clegislative history on the jury trial question . . . sparse, and . . . ambiguous, \u201c415 U.S. at 191, 94 S.Ct. at 1007, the Court nevertheless held that there was a constitutional right to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>jury trial in Title VIII cases.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In reaching this holding, the Court first laid to rest any doubt about the applicability of the Seventh Amendment to statutorily-created claims. \u201cThe Seventh Amendment does apply to actions enforcing statutory rights, and requires a jury trial upon demand, if the statute creates legal rights and remedies, enforceable in an action for damages in the ordinary courts of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194, 94 S.Ct. at 1008. This statement suggests two tests which should be utilized in determining whether an action based on federal statute entails a constitutional right to a jury trial. <em>First, </em>are the rights and duties created by the statute analogous to rights and duties historically comprehended by the common law? <em>Second, </em>are the remedies sought legal rather than equitable in nature? <em>See also Ross v. Bernhard, </em>396 U.S. 531, 90 S.Ct. 733, 24 L.Ed.2d 729 (1970); <em>Pons v. Lorillard, </em>549 F.2d 950 (4 Cir. 1977), <em>aff\u2019d on non-constitutional grounds, </em>434 U.S. 575, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Applying these two tests, the Court in <em>Curtis </em>concluded that a jury trial, if demanded, was constitutionally required in Title VIII cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">We think it is clear that a damages action under [Title VIII] is an action to enforce \u2018legal rights\u2019 . . . . A damages action under the statute sounds basically in tort \u2014 the statute merely defines a new legal duty, and authorizes the courts to compensate a plaintiff for the injury caused by the defendant\u2019s wrongful breach. . . . [T]his cause of action is analogous to a number of tort actions recognized at common law. <em>More important, </em>the relief sought here \u2014 actual and punitive damages \u2014 is the traditional form of relief offered in the courts of law. 415 U.S. at 195-96, 94 S.Ct. at 1009 (footnotes and citations omitted, emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\"><em>Curtis </em>thus requires a holding that private civil actions brought to redress violations of the disclosure provisions of the Truth in Lending Act likewise entail a constitutional right to a jury trial upon demand. <em>Accord Mosley v. National Finance Co., </em>440 F.Supp. 621 (M.D.N.C.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"A79\"><em>First, </em>we conclude that \u201ca damages action under the statute sounds basically in tort . . ..\u201d <em>Curtis v. Loether, supra, </em>415 U.S. at 195, 94 S.Ct. at 1009. A duty to disclose is closely akin to the traditional tort duty not to misrepresent or deceive. Under traditional tort principles, a creditor has the affirmative duty not to engage in fraud by intentionally disclosing false information for the purpose of misleading the person seeking credit. The statutory duty to disclose, imposed by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, merely enlarges the creditor\u2019s duty beyond that imposed by common law. Now he has the affirmative duty not only to be accurate in what he does disclose but also to make a full disclosure of information deemed relevant and material by the Federal Reserve Board. To use the Court\u2019s language in <em>Curtis, </em>the Truth in Lending Act \u201cmerely defines a new legal duty, and authorizes the courts to compensate a plaintiff for the injury caused by the defendant\u2019s wrongful breach.\u201d 415 U.S. at 195, 94 S.Ct. at 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-16\"><em>Second, </em>the relief sought by plaintiff in the instant action, statutory damages under \u00a7 1640(a)(2)(B), is nothing more than a prayer for statutorily-authorized punitive damages. As the Court pointed out in <em>Curtis, </em>punitive damages are within the \u201ctraditional form of relief offered in the courts of law.\u201d 415 U.S. at 196, 94 S.Ct. at 1009.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>On remand, therefore, the district court must impanel a jury for the purpose of determining the amount of statutory damages due the plaintiff class.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">IV. <em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Section 1640(a)(3) permits a successful plaintiff to recover, in addition to damages, \u201cthe costs of the action, together with a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as determined by the court.\u201d In the instant case, the district court awarded plaintiff $25,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cwhich [sum] the court [found] to be . reasonable . . . under the circumstances,\u201d notwithstanding that the sum was greater than that requested. 424 F.Supp. at 52. While at this juncture we do not question the appropriateness of this award, we must nonetheless reverse and remand for detailed findings in support of this award.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">It is well established that the allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees \u201c \u2018is within the judicial discretion of the trial judge, who has close and intimate knowledge of the efforts expended and the value of the services rendered. And an appellate court is not warranted in overturning the trial court\u2019s judgment unless under all of the facts and circumstances it is clearly wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lea v. Cone Mills Corp., </em>467 F.2d 277, 279 (4 Cir. 1972), <em>quoting United States v.

The district court also found a violation of \u00a7 226.8(c)(8)(i) (non-disclosure of finance charge components). Since the court\u2019s decision was rendered, the Federal Reserve Board has issued a clarifying amendment requiring disclosure of finance charge components only \u201cwhere the total [finance] charge consists of two or more types of charges . . . Defendants contend that, because the credit transactions conducted by them involve only single-component finance charges, no disclosure of components is required in light of the Board\u2019s subsequent clarification.

The determination of the appropriateness of summary judgment in establishing defendants\u2019 liability is particularly important in view of our conclusion that the Seventh Amendment mandates a right to a jury trial upon demand in civil actions under the Truth in Lending Act. <em>See </em>Part IIIB of this opinion, <em>infra. </em>If the issue of liability were inappropriately disposed of on a Rule 56 motion, then defendants would have a right on remand to have plaintiffs allegations concerning defendants\u2019 violations of the Act\u2019s disclosure requirements submitted to a jury. Of course, where summary judgment is properly granted, no Seventh Amendment issue arises. <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. v.

Recognizing that it is difficult for a consumer to prove actual monetary damages arising out of a disclosure violation, Congress imposed a civil penalty (\u201cstatutory damages\u201d) for noncompliance, awardable to the successful plaintiff. As originally enacted, \u00a7 1640 provided for only statutory damages. Pub.L. No. 90-321, \u00a7 130(a), 82 Stat. 157 (1968). Since amended by Pub.L. No. 93-495, \u00a7 408(a), 88 Stat. 1518 (1974), the Act now authorizes both actual damages (\u00a7 1640(a)(1)) <em>and </em>statutory damages (\u00a7 1640(a)(2)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b316-16\">. Effective March 23, 1977, the maximum class recovery allowable under \u00a7 1640(a)(2)(B) was raised from $100,000 to $500,000. Pub.L.

These are: (1) the amount of actual damages sustained by the class, (2) the frequency and persistence of non-compliance, (3) defendant\u2019s resources, (4) the number of persons adversely affected by non-compliance, and (5) the extent to which non-compliance was intentional.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b316-18\">. <em>See, e. g., Gerlach v.

No. 278, 93rd Cong., 1st Sess., 14-16 (1973); Note, Class Actions Under the Truth in Lending Act, 83 Yale L.J. 1410 (1974). The most frequently cited case denying class certification on account of the magnitude of the likely class recovery is <em>Ratner v. Chemical Bank New York Trust Co., </em>54 F.R.D. 412 (S.D.N.Y.1972), in which Judge Frankel expressed what was to become the prevailing view: \u201c[T]he proposed recovery of $100 each for some 130,000 class members would be a horrendous, possibly annihilating punishment, unrelated to any damages to the purported class or to any benefit to defendant, for what is at most a technical and debatable violation of the Truth in Lending Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416. \u201c[T]he allowance of thousands of minimum recoveries like plaintiffs would carry to an absurd and stultifying extreme the remedy Congress prescribed as the means of private enforcement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b317-11\">. We recognize that in <em>Clausen v. Beneficial Finance Co., </em>423 F.Supp. 985 (N.D.Cal.1976), <em>appeal pending </em>(9 Cir.), the district court likewise looked to the parent company\u2019s net worth in determining the maximum recovery allowable under \u00a7 1640(a)(2)(B) to a limited class. We respectfully disagree with that result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b317-12\">. We are cognizant of the fact that our holding here will substantially reduce the recovery of each individual class member. We note, however, that individual recoveries in class suits under the Act since the 1974 amendments have tended to be quite small. See <em>Eovaldi v. First Nat. Bank of Chicago, </em>71 F.R.D. 334 (N.D.Ill.1976) (95,000 members sharing in statutory damages of $100,000); <em>Haynes v. Logan Furniture Mart, Inc., </em>Civil No. 70-C-1827 (N.D.Ill. 1975) (2,500 members sharing in statutory damages of $10,000). Nonetheless, we think that congruity between the class certified and the asset-base utilized in determining maximum statutory damages allowable under \u00a7 1640(a)(2)(B) is required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b318-6\">. Given the existence of a one-year limitations period, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(e), and the fact that to date no other suits have been filed against defendants with regard to the violations charged in this action, it is unlikely that the potential for multiple recoveries will be realized in this case. But it is the potential overall recovery which concerns us, not the likelihood that it will be realized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b318-7\">. This interpretation is consistent with the generally expressed disapproval of multiple or duplicative recoveries in private enforcement actions under the Truth in Lending Act. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(g) (enacted 1974, Pub.L. No. 93-945, \u00a7 407, 88 Stat. 1518). See <em>also Powers v. Sims and Levin, </em>542 F.2d 1216, 1219-20 (4 Cir. 1976); <em>Turner v.

As will appear from the text, <em>infra, Curtis </em>was decided on constitutional grounds. The recent decision in <em>Lorillard v.

This judgment cannot stand: (1) because of entire want of proof to support it, and (2) for impermissible procedure in its award. With sincere deference to my panelists, I can read no such liability in the document other than the just-mentioned insubstantial exception.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hence, I have no occasion to discuss \u201cdamages\u201d of which, confessedly, none were actual, but purely statutory, indeed exclusively punitive in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">I. NO VIOLATION PROVED</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">To determine its guilt or innocence, the contract\u2019s characteristics, on which plaintiff poses her case, must be tested within the frame of the Act as the Congress had declared it:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">\u201cIt is the purpose of this subchapter to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit, and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing . . . .\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-21\">In none of the plaintiff\u2019s counts against the defendants is there even an intimation of untruth of any kind. There is no hint of concealment, fraud, deceit, arithmetical error or any inadequacy. Thus at least the Congressional aim and purpose here has not been thwarted. Indeed, the indictment is simply to the \u2018layout\u2019 and detail of the statement of account in the printed contract. A casual reading reveals the contract to be clear and readily understandable, as is confirmed by the following annotated verbatim copy of its items:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-22\">[Captioned \u201cPurchase Money Security Agreement\u201d, the first notation is of the goods sold.

This is the sole departure, no more than a misnomer.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Incidentally, it is significant that the contract term was a more informative label than the Regulation provided. The figure was the final and net amount still owing under the contract \u2014 $396.00. The Regulation directed that this item give \u201cthe number, amount and due dates or periods of payments <em>scheduled to repay </em>the indebtedness and . . . the sum of <em>such </em>payments\u201d. Obviously, it was not to be the \u201ctotal of payments\u201d, suggesting those already made, but rather those \u201cscheduled\u201d to be made, of which the defendants\u2019 designation of \u201cTotal Time Balance\u201d is thus more explicit.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">At this juncture it is pertinent to distinguish the omission here from those penalized in <em>Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., </em>411 U.S. 356, 93 S.Ct. 1652, 36 L.Ed.2d 318 (1973). In <em>Mourning </em>neither the total purchase price, nor the amount unpaid after the initial payment, nor any reference to a finance charge \u2014 all obviously of the essence of such an agreement \u2014 was shown. Quite the contrary is manifested instantly. The contract gives precisely and separately both the cash price and the Deferred Payment Price not only of the new account, but of the old and new combined, and thereafter the Total Time Balance. Likewise the Total Finance Charge is stated for both accounts and the reduction of it for the new balance due. The same distinction exists between the present and those contracts faulted in <em>McGowan v. King, Inc., </em>569 F.2d 845 (5 Cir. 1978) and in <em>Walker v. College Toyota, </em>399 F.Supp. 778 (W.D.Va.1974) aff. 519 F.2d 447 (4 Cir. 1975) relying on <em>Mourning </em>and affirmed on same ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">The totally mechanical and insensitive application of the Act now pursued by the majority finds no precedent in Supreme Court or Circuit decision. Surely at some point this pedantic construction becomes unrealistic and so it has here.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">In my view that defendants\u2019 contract comfortably fits into the charter of the Truth in Lending Act, that is, \u201cto protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing\u201d. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601. In fine, the action should have been dismissed because of plaintiff\u2019s failure to prove defendants in violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT IMPERMISSIBLE</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">At all events summary judgment should not have been granted. Jury questions remained throughout for resolution. Even if the Court believed the plaintiff had made out a case sufficient to defeat defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the defendants\u2019 demand for a jury was still virulent. Nevertheless, the Court proceeded alone to decide determinative factual issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-14\">First, the Court rules that the \u201cinformation [as to the indebtedness] cannot be derived by reading straight down\u201d the columns on the contract, forcing the reader to \u201cswitch back and forth between the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>columns of figures\u201d, and finding the result confusing. Next, it is said that the labels are \u201cmisleading\u201d and the additional information obscured the statement. The Court also thought the components of the finance charges were not properly disclosed or not in meaningful sequence. Indisputably these were jury questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">To sustain these summary conclusions, it is necessary for this Court to say that there was \u201cno genuine issue\u201d as to any \u201cmaterial fact\u201d, in regard to the contract\u2019s sufficiency under the Truth in Lending Act. FRCP 56. In short, to affirm we must say that no conflict of fact exists between the parties as to the explicitness of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Again, I have not been cited to, nor do I find, a Supreme Court or a Circuit ease denying a trial by jury on disputed fact issues of liability under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">I would urge that the judgment of liability now on appeal be reversed, with final summary judgment for the defendants on their motion, or failing this disposition, that the case be remanded to the District Court for trial with a jury on the evidence as to liability as well as on damages.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-41\">. This deviation consisted of the designation of an item as \u201cTotal Time Balance\u201d when Regulation Z directed it to be denominated \u201ctotal of payments\u201d. 226.8(b)(3) of Regulation Z.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
