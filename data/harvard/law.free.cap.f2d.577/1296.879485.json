The plaintiff-appellee is Great Western United Corporation (Great Western), a publicly owned Delaware corporation.with its major executive offices located in Dallas, Texas. The principal officers, all directors, and the controlling shareholders of Great Western <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>reside in Dallas. The defendant-appellant is Tom D. McEldowney, Director of the Idaho Department of Finance, charged with responsibility for enforcing the Idaho Takeover Statute, Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 30-1501-13 (Cum.Supp.1977).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1355-4\">Idaho, as well as thirty-one other states, regulates corporate takeovers through a tender offer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This case presents questions whether the Idaho law, as McEldowney seeks to apply it here, may stand under the supremacy and commerce clauses of the United States Constitution and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78a <em>et seq. </em>(the 1934 Act), as amended by the Williams Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The basic questions applicable to all state takeover statutes have never been decided by a federal court of appeals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because this suit was brought in Texas, not Idaho, the case also raises novel questions of jurisdiction and venue. The district court determined that the prerequisites of personal jurisdiction and venue were satisfied. After a hearing on the merits, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>court declared the Idaho statute unconstitutional because the 1934 Act preempts it and because it creates a burden on interstate commerce forbidden by article I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3 of the Constitution. <em>Great Western United Corp. v. Kidwell, </em>N.D.Tex.1977, 439 F.Supp. 420. McEldowney, joined by several states as amici,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> strongly objects to all these rulings. We affirm the district court\u2019s rulings that personal jurisdiction existed and that venue was proper. On the merits, we agree with the position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the Williams Act preempts Idaho\u2019s takeover law because the state statute \u201cpresents a serious conflict with the administration of the federal program for the regulation of tender offers\u201d. SEC amicus brief at 47. We also affirm the district court\u2019s commerce clause ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-6\">Sunshine Mining and Metal Co. (Sunshine) is a publicly owned company incorporated in the State of Washington. Its principal executive office and over fifty percent of its assets are located in Idaho. Sunshine has a wholly owned subsidiary with manufacturing facilities based in Maryland. In addition, Sunshine engages in significant business activities in New York. The shareholders of Sunshine live throughout the United States. Its securities are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. They are not registered in Idaho.</p>\n<p id=\"ahf-dedup-0\">In March 1977, Great Western decided to make a tender offer for 2,000,000 shares of Sunshine common stock.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The tender offer of a net price of $15.75 a share was offered Sunshine shareholders across the United States. Because the tender offer was national in scope and the means and facilities of interstate commerce and the mails were necessary tools in making the tender offer, Great Western was required to comply with the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governing corporate tender offers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-13\">The Williams Act includes disclosure requirements, substantive restrictions on tender offers, and a general antifraud provision. It also confers broad rule-making authority upon the SEC.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The disclosure provisions of \u00a7 14(d)(1), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n(d)(l), require specified information from any party making a tender offer which would result in that party\u2019s ownership of more than five percent of a class of equity securities registered under the 1934 Act. That information includes the purchaser\u2019s identity and background, the amount and source of the funds used for the purchase, the purpose of the purchase, any plans for liquidation, merger, or other significant changes in business or corporate structure of the target company, the number of shares the purchaser owns, and the details of any agreements with other parties concerning shares in the target corporation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-15\">On March 21,1977, Great Western filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC disclosing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>information specified in the Williams Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The same day, Great Western publicly announced its intention to make a tender offer for 2,000,000 shares of Sunshine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">Had only the Williams Act regulated Great Western\u2019s proposed tender offer, the offer would have commenced on March 21, 1977.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Idaho\u2019s takeover statute, however, also applied to Great Western\u2019s offer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In addition, the laws of New York and Maryland arguably applied to the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">Idaho\u2019s takeover law required Great Western, among other things, (1) to submit to the Director of the Idaho Department of Finance a preeffective filing disclosing Great Western\u2019s intention to make a tender offer and the terms of the offer;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (2) to transmit, at the same time, a copy of that filing to Sunshine;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (3) to publish an advertisement describing the intention to make an offer and the proposed material terms;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (4) to pay the. Idaho registration fee;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (5) to participate in a hearing, which would be mandatory if Sunshine requested one;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and (6) to delay its tender offer until the final determination of any administrative or injunctive proceeding brought by the Director of Finance for violation of the Idaho takeover law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> No time limitation is placed on whether, or when, the director must rule on the effectiveness of a registration statement.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The director may summarily delay the effectiveness of an offer if he determines that the registration statement is insufficient.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Great Western\u2019s offer would not have been subject to these requirements if the terms of the tender offer had been accepted by Sunshine\u2019s board of directors.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1357-11\">Idaho Code \u00a7 30-1503(1) states, in part, that \u201cIt is unlawful for any person to make a take-over offer involving a target company in this state, or to acquire any equity securities of a target company pursuant to the offer, unless the offer is effective under this chapter or is exempted by rule or order of the director\u201d. As interpreted by the Idaho Department of Finance, this provision would prevent Great Western from making a tender offer to anyone in the world if it did not comply with the Idaho statute. Violations of the Idaho takeover law can result in criminal penalties of up to $5000 in fines and three years imprisonment.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1357-12\">Great Western initially tried to comply with Idaho law. The company made informal inquiries about the Idaho requirements. On March 21, 1977, Great Western filed documents with the Idaho Commissioner of Finance in an attempt to satisfy Idaho\u2019s statute. This was the first filing ever made under the Idaho takeover law. On March 25 Melvin Baptie, then the Director of the Idaho Department of Finance, wrote Great Western raising numerous objections to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>disclosure Great Western had made and asking that amendments be made. He summarily ordered a delay of the effective date of the Idaho registration and the proposed tender offer. At about the same time, Great Western\u2019s counsel in New York were advised by the New York Attorney General\u2019s office that New York was \u201cleaning\u201d toward asserting jurisdiction over the offer for Sunshine. In Maryland, counsel for Great Western were informed that Maryland would not comment on the applicability of its takeover law without a hearing. At this point, therefore, Great Western was faced with the problem - of meeting the requirements of three state takeover statutes, each containing some provisions seemingly in conflict with the Williams Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">Compliance with the state statutes on tender offers would have required Great Western to wait for New York and Maryland to rule on the applicability of their laws, to attempt to add the amendments proposed by Baptie, and to wait for the Idaho hearing and judicial review procedures to take place. To avoid this delay and also to avoid conflicting requirements, Great Western filed suit in the Northern District of. Texas, on March 28, 1977, against the state officials responsible for enforcing the Idaho, New York, and Maryland takeover laws.\u2019 The suit sought an order declaring that the Idaho, New York, and Maryland -takeover acts were invalid insofar as they purport to apply to interstate cash tender offers for the purchase of securities traded on a national securities exchange. On April 1, 1977, the district judge issued a temporary restraining order directing the officials of the three states not to assert jurisdiction over the tender offer for Sunshine. The defendants sought emergency relief in this Court. On April 5, 1977, this Court stayed the TRO and directed the district court to make findings on personal jurisdiction and venue before deciding the merits of Great Western\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-6\">After a hearing, the district court ruled that it had personal jurisdiction over the New York and Idaho defendants and that venue was proper. The district court dismissed the claim against the Maryland defendants because it concluded that Maryland had never demonstrated an actual and present intention to enforce its statute \u25a0 against Great Western. The district judge refused to certify an interlocutory appeal from these rulings, and this Court denied a request by the defendants for a writ of mandamus. The case proceeded to a hearing on the merits in the district court. The trial judge issued his opinion, reported at 439 F.Supp. 420, on September 2, 1977. He dismissed the case against New York as moot because New York had informed Great Western in a letter dated May 20, 1977 that it would not assert jurisdiction over the Great Western tender offer for Sunshine. The district court held that the Idaho Takeover Act is preempted by the Williams Act and is in violation of the commerce clause of the United States Constitution. The court granted a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against the Idaho officials, but stayed the effect of the order to permit the defendants to file an application for a stay of the judgment. This Court denied that application on September 16, 1977, but expedited hearing of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-7\">The district court\u2019s order, and a settlement of other litigation concerning the Great Western offer for Sunshine, allowed Great Western to acquire the desired Sunshine shares in the Fall of 1977.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Idaho officials could take action if this Court were to reverse the district court. Idaho Code \u00a7 30-1509 would allow the officials to seek an appropriate injunction or to require rescission of the stock purchases. Despite its acquisition of 2,000,000 shares through its tender offer, Great Western does not have sufficient votes on the Sunshine Board to take advantage of the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>emption from the Idaho takeover law for offers approved by the target board of directors. Therefore, the issues before us are not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-6\">JURISDICTION OVER THE IDAHO STATE OFFICIALS</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-7\">\n<em>A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-8\">The district court held that subject matter jurisdiction over Great Western\u2019s challenge to the Idaho takeover law existed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (federal question cases), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (diversity cases), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337 (cases based on acts regulating commerce), and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa (Section 27 of the 1934 Act). On appeal, McEldowney explicitly protests only the lower court\u2019s conclusion that Great Western\u2019s complaint stated a claim under the 1934 Act and, implicitly, the conclusion that jurisdiction exists under \u00a7 1337. It is undisputed, therefore, that subject matter jurisdiction exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-9\">\n<em>B. The Effect of Ex Parte Young.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-10\">It is hotly disputed whether a court in the Northern District of Texas could assert personal jurisdiction over the Idaho officials who enforced the Idaho takeover law. Initially, McEldowney contends that his status as a state official means that even though he may be sued under <em>Ex Parte Young, </em>1908, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714, he may not be sued outside Idaho without his consent. He reads <em>Young </em>narrowly, to strip state officials of their \u201cstate\u201d status <em>only </em>to allow a suit under the Eleventh Amendment. For all other purposes, so he contends, this suit is against a state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-11\">McEldowney emphasizes that Young was sued in his own state and argues that <em>Young </em>offers no support for the proposition that a state official suable under <em>Young </em>is to be treated as any other individual litigant. Although not challenging the validity of <em>Ex Parte Young, </em>the appellant labels its result a \u201cfiction\u201d and suggests that the fiction should not be allowed to become fantasy. There is nothing new about characterizing <em>Young </em>as a fiction, but usually it is termed a \u201cnecessary\u201d fiction. L. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law, </em>146 (1978). <em>Ex Parte Young </em>has become one of the cornerstones of our legal system. The Supreme Court recently refused to overrule or restrict the decision. <em>Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>1978, 435 U.S. 151, 98 S.Ct. 988, 994 n. 6, 55 L.Ed.2d 179. We see no reason, in policy or in the language of Justice Peck-ham\u2019s opinion, to limit the effect of <em>Young </em>as Idaho\u2019s Director of Finance asks us to do. The argument that <em>Ex Parte Young </em>leaves a state official with all the prerogatives of a state other than eleventh amendment immunity is undercut by the crucial paragraph in the decision:</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-15\">If the act which the state attorney general seeks to enforce be a violation of the Federal Constitution, the officer, in proceeding under such enactment, comes into conflict with the superior authority of that Constitution, and he is in that case <em>stripped </em>of his official or representative character, and is <em>subjected in his person </em>to the consequences of his individual conduct. The state has <em>no power </em>to impart to him <em>any </em>immunity from responsibility to the Supreme authority of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-16\">209 U.S. at 159-60, 28 S.Ct. at 454 (emphasis added). <em>See also Caldwell v. Sioux Falls Stock Yards Co., </em>1917, 242 U.S. 559, 37 S.Ct. 224, 61 L.Ed. 463. In that case the Court held that a suit challenging the South Dakota Blue Sky Law \u201cmanifestly is not one against the state\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-17\">We read <em>Young </em>to say that a state official enforcing an unconstitutional statute is an individual defendant and nothing more. Under the reasoning of <em>Ex Parte Young, </em>the state has no interest in the lawsuit, for it is incapable of authorizing an unconstitutional act. 209 U.S. at 159, 28 S.Ct. 441; Scott, <em>The Increased Control of State Activities by the Federal Courts </em>reprinted in 3 <em>Selected Essays on Constitutional Law </em>1077, 1084 (1938).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> If so, the official gains no protection at all from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>connection with the state on other matters. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Sovereign Immunity in Suits to Enjoin the Enforcement of Unconstitutional Legislation, </em>50 Harv.L.Rev. 956 (1937). The dearth of previous cases where a state official has been sued outside his home state is probably attributable to the states having rarely, if ever, enacted statutes similar to the Idaho takeover law (and most other state takeover laws) that purport to extend a local official\u2019s regulatory jurisdiction to other states. If, as Idaho contends through McEldowney, the federal system is involved, then that system compels Idaho to yield to the supremacy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-4\">\n<em>C. Personal Jurisdiction Under the Texas Long Arm Statute.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-5\">Under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 4(d)(7) and 4(e), personal jurisdiction in diversity cases, federal question cases, and cases involving acts affecting commerce may, if necessary, be obtained through the long arm statute of the forum state. <em>Wilkerson v. Fortuna Corp., </em>5 Cir. 1977, 554 F.2d 745, 747; 4 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1112, 1114 (1969). The Texas long arm statute, Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 2031b (Vernon), applies to individual as well as to corporate nonresidents. It authorizes assertion of personal jurisdiction over nonresidents to the limits of due process. <em>Jetco Electronic Industries, Inc. v. Gardiner, </em>5 Cir. 1973, 473 F.2d 1228; <em>Product Promotions, Inc. v. Cousteau, </em>5 Cir. 1974, 495 F.2d 483; <em>U-Anchor Advertising, Inc. v. Burt, </em>Tex., 1977, 553 S.W.2d 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-6\">The question is whether due process permits a court in Texas to exercise jurisdiction over the Idaho official who has enforced the Idaho takeover law to prevent a Texas-based corporation from proceeding with a national tender offer. We hold that it does.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1360-7\">The framework for our due process analysis comes from seven Supreme Court cases: <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>1945, 326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95; <em>Travelers Health Ass\u2019n v. Virginia, </em>1950, 339 U.S. 643, 70 S.Ct. 927, 94 L.Ed. 1154; <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Benguet Consol. Mining Co., </em>1952, 342 U.S. 437, 72 S.Ct. 413, 96 L.Ed. 485; <em>McGee v. International Life Ins. Co., </em>1957, 355 U.S. 220, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223; <em>Hanson v. Denckla, </em>1958, 357 U.S. 235, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283; <em>Shaffer v. Heitner, </em>1977, 433 U.S. 186, 97 S.Ct. 2569, 53 L.Ed.2d 683; and <em>Kulko v. Superior Court, </em>1978, - U.S. -, 98 S.Ct. 1690, 56 L.Ed.2d 132. <em>See generally </em>2 J. Moore, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal </em>. <em>Practice </em>H 4.25[2]-[4] (2d ed. 1974);- 4 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, \u00a7\u00a7 1065-67. These cases establish that</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-15\">the governing principle is the fairness of subjecting a defendant to suit in a distant forum. Only if the nonresident defendant has such \u201cminimum contacts\u201d with the state \u201cthat the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and justice\u2019,\u201d <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945), or if the defendant has performed some act \u201cby which [it] purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws,\u201d <em>Hanson v. Denckla, </em>357 U.S. 235, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958); <em>McGee v. International Life Insurance Co., </em>355 U.S. 220, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223 (1957), may the forum, consistently with due process, extend its long arm to embrace it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-16\"><em>Jetco Electronic Industries, </em>473 F.2d at 1234; <em>See also Product Promotions, Inc., </em>495 F.2d at 494. Of necessity, inquiries into whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction is permissible in a particular case are sensitive to the facts of each case. 2 J. Moore, 14.25[5] at 1172.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-17\">The appellant argues that all his activity took place in Idaho. \u201cMinimum contacts\u201d, however, need not arise from actual physical activity in the forum state; activities in other forums with foreseeable ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>fects in the forum state will suffice. <em>See, e. g., Wilkerson v. Fortuna Corp., </em>554 F.2d at 748; <em>Product Promotions, Inc. v. Cousteau, </em>495 F.2d at 496; <em>Travis v. Anthes Imperial Ltd., </em>8 Cir. 1973, 473 F.2d 515; <em>Eyerly Aircraft Co. v. Killian, </em>5 Cir. 1969, 414 F.2d 591; <em>Hitt v. Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., </em>1975 S.D.Fla., 399 F.Supp. 838, <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 552 F.2d 1088; <em>Marico-pa County </em>v. <em>American Petrofina, Inc., </em>1971 S.D.Cal., 322 F.Supp. 467; 4 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller \u00a7 1069. Very little purposeful activity is necessary to satisfy the minimum contacts requirement. <em>Benjamin v. Western Boat Building Corp., </em>5 Cir. 1973, 472 F.2d 723, 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-5\">A corporation, of course, acts only through its directors and officers. When all of these directors and officers, as well as the major shareholders of the corporation, are located in Dallas at the time corporate decisions are made, the corporation is acting in Dallas. When the Idaho officials, through the Idaho takeover statute, asserted jurisdiction over the Great Western offer for Sunshine, they foreseeably caused efforts in Texas to comply with the Idaho state law. When the Idaho officials summarily delayed the effectiveness of Great Western\u2019s tender offer for Sunshine, they foreseeably restrained a corporation in Dallas from proceeding with its plans. In other words, the Idaho officials regulated a corporation that acts in the Northern District of Texas and through that regulation foreseeably changed the corporation\u2019s actions. These effects \u2014 effects with substantial consequences on important business plans \u2014 are more than sufficient to satisfy the minimum contacts requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-6\">In <em>Kulko v. Superior Court, </em>- U.S. -, 98 S.Ct. 1690, 56 L.Ed.2d 132, 1978, the Supreme Court rejected an effort by a California court to assert personal jurisdiction over a non-resident on the basis of the effects his out-of-state conduct had in California. <em>Kulko, </em>however, does not change the basic approach to personal jurisdiction enunciated in prior Supreme Court decisions. It continues to recognize that the existence of personal jurisdiction turns upon the facts of each case. - U.S. -, 98 S.Ct. at 1694. The facts in <em>Kulko </em>are not so similar to the facts of <em>Great Western </em>that they control the outcome in our case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-12\">The California court asserted personal jurisdiction (in a case concerning a separation agreement signed in New York) over a New York citizen solely because \u201cby consenting to his children\u2019s living in California [with his former wife], appellant had \u2018caused an effect in th[e] state\u2019 warranting the exercise of jurisdiction over him\u201d. - U.S. at-, 98 S.Ct. at 1695, <em>quoting </em>133 Cal.Rptr. 627, 628. The Supreme Court concluded that this effect was so insignificant that it was not reasonable for California to assert personal jurisdiction over the father. -U.S. at-, 98 S.Ct. at 1698-1699. It is not surprising that the Court found some effects are too insignificant to support personal jurisdiction; even physical contacts can be too insubstantial to establish personal jurisdiction. See-U.S. at -, 98 S.Ct. at 1698. That the subject matter of the underlying suit concerned domestic relations and child custody also influenced the Supreme Court\u2019s evaluation of the reasonableness of California\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction. The Court noted several times that Kulko\u2019s children expressed the wish to live with their mother and that Kulko acted in his children\u2019s best interest by honoring that preference. The Court expressed concern that a parent might hesitate to allow such moves if doing so would subject him to personal jurisdiction in a distant state. <em>See, e. </em>g.,-U.S. at-, -, 98 S.Ct. at 1698, 1699.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-22\"><em>Kulko </em>does not hold that a court considering an <em>International Shoe </em>question may not look to effects within the forum unless the defendant\u2019s effect-producing activity causes physical injury within the forum state or affects the defendant\u2019s commercial transactions within the forum state. Justice Marshall discussed those factors to support his conclusion that the effect in <em>Kulko </em>could not support personal jurisdiction in California. He did not establish new general restrictions on the use of the effects test in the application of <em>International Shoe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1361-23\">The effects felt in Texas as a result of Idaho\u2019s regulation of Great Western\u2019s tender offer were more substantial than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>those felt in California when Kulko allowed his children to join their mother. Idaho\u2019s out-of-state regulation had the <em>direct </em>effect \u25a0of stopping a substantial commercial venture based in Texas. hf\u00b0 other state had a greater connection with that venture than Texas. In contrast, New York had more extensive connections than California with the separation agreement at issue in <em>Kulko. </em>Idaho\u2019s \u201cbusiness\u201d is .to regulate. It was conducting that business in Texas. Our case, therefore, is more analogous to an insurer\u2019s sending an insurance contract and premium notices into a state to an insured resident of the state than to the domestic controversy between Kulko and his former wife. <em>Compare McGee v. International Life Insurance Co., </em>1957, 355 U.S. 220, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223 <em>with Kulko v. Superior </em>Court,-U.S. at-, 98 S.Ct. at 1699. One could also analogize the actions of Idaho\u2019s officials to the tort of intentional interference with a commercial relationship. <em>See </em>W. Prosser, <em>Handbook of the Law of Torts, </em>\u00a7 129 (4th ed. 1974). The absence in our case of the family consideration stressed by the <em>Kulko </em>Court also distinguishes the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-6\">McEldowney protests that Great Western came to him with its voluntary filing of March 21, 1977. It is true that unilateral activity by the plaintiff cannot produce the minimum contacts necessary to satisfy due process. <em>See Hanson </em>v. <em>Denckla, </em>357 U.S. at 250-53, 78 S.Ct. 1228; 4 J. Moore 14.25[5]. \u201c[W]e have, nevertheless, unequivocally required <em>some </em>activity by the defendant . . . \u201d <em>Benjamin v. Western Boat Building Corp., </em>472 F.2d at 726 (emphasis in original). In <em>Hanson v. Denckla, </em>a Florida court asserted jurisdiction over a Delaware Trust Company. The only connection asserted between the Company and Florida occurred because the trustee, who had created the trust in Delaware, moved to Florida where she received some trust income and engaged in various acts of trust administration. The Trust Company had nothing to do with the trustee\u2019s decision to move. The case before us is different. It may be true that Great Western came to Idaho with a filing. It is also true that Great Western had little choice; the alternative for its officers was to risk criminal penalties under Idaho Code 30-1510. The first step in the sequence came not from Texas, but from Idaho, where the filing requirement binding on Great Western was created. Furthermore, Idaho\u2019s regulatory activities after the filing, including the order delaying the effectiveness of the tender offer, constituted affirmative action by Idaho officials causing foreseeable effects in Texas. The decision to issue a regulatory order having inevitable extraterritorial effects cannot be compared with the routine remission of trust receipts to a trustee who has moved to another state.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1362-10\">McEldowney stresses language from <em>Hanson v. Denckla </em>that \u201cit is essential in each case that there be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws\u201d. 357 U.S. at 253, 78 S.Ct. at 1240. The Idaho official denies that he did such an act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-11\">Judge Goldberg, after a thorough study of the Supreme Court cases, concluded that this language \u201cshould not be read too literally\u201d and that essentially it reflects the Court\u2019s rule that unilateral action by the plaintiff cannot create the necessary relationship between the defendant and the forum state. <em>Product Promotions, Inc. v. Cousteau, </em>495 F.2d at 496.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Personal jurisdiction has been found to exist over price <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>fixing conspirators whose illegal activities in one state were designed to control prices in the forum state. <em>Hitt v. Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., </em>1975 S.D.Fla., 399 F.Supp. 838, <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 552 F.2d 1088; <em>Maricopa County v. American Petrofina, Inc., </em>1971 S.D.Cal., 322 F.Supp. 467. Those conspirators, of course, had not invoked the benefits and protections of the forum states\u2019 laws in a restrictive sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-5\">Even if we were to read the requirement of <em>Hanson v. Denckla </em>more literally, it would be satisfied in this case. The activities of the defendant officials were to regulate tender offers. The impact of their regulation was felt in Texas, as they intended it to be. Thus, they did conduct activities in Texas. If Great Western had failed to comply with the Idaho takeover law, and the Idaho officials had obtained criminal sanctions, no doubt the state officials would have expected Texas to honor those criminal judgments. Indeed, if the Texas courts did not, the sanctions might have little effect since none of Great Western\u2019s officers reside in Idaho. Idaho might also ask for Texan help if violators of the takeover residing in Texas refused to go to Idaho for trial. Idaho was depending, at least in part, upon Texan cooperation to make its enforcement mechanism effective.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1363-6\">The most fundamental difference between the dissenting and majority opinions in this case arises over the requirement of the Supreme Court cases that an assertion of personal jurisdiction not \u201coffend traditional notions of justice and fair play\u201d. Questions of reasonableness are invariably ones of judgment where \u201c[t]he greys are dominant and even among them the shades are innumerable\u201d. <em>Kulko v. Superior Court, </em>- U.S. at -, 98 S.Ct. 1695, 1697. In its evaluation, the dissent gives too little emphasis to the uniqueness of the state takeover laws. Idaho\u2019s statute seeks to regulate the sale of a security even when neither the buyer nor the seller nor the sale itself has <em>any </em>connection with Idaho. <em>See generally </em>Shipman, <em>Some Thoughts About the Role of State Takeover Legislation: The Ohio Takeover Act, 21 </em>Case Wes.Res.L. Rev. 722, 756 (1970). The Idaho officials deliberately cast their regulatory net across the United States. They knew those regulations would entangle transactions with no connection to Idaho. It is not unfair or unreasonable to require an Idaho official to travel from his home when one of the participants in a non-Idaho transaction challenges the constitutionality of Idaho\u2019s interference. Although the Idaho officials may have been inconvenienced by the need to appear in Texas, they had ample resources to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-12\">The state officials and the dissent argue that it is unreasonable for a court in Dallas to assert personal jurisdiction over the defendants in this case because doing so will lead to numerous other out-of-state suits against state officials who enforce other state regulations with interstate impact. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>One paragraph, in particular, of the district court\u2019s memorandum order disturbs McEl-downey:</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-4\">The practical effect of the Idaho defendants\u2019 actions is to regulate business activities of Great Western-and the investment opportunities of shareholders of . Sunshine in Texas and every other state. The court does not therefore find it unfair to make the Idaho defendants appear where the predictable, consequences of their purposeful actions are felt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-5\">439 F.Supp. at 433 (footnote omitted). McEldowney reads this paragraph to mean that personal jurisdiction over a state official is reasonable and proper whenever the statute he enforces has a \u201cpractical effect\u201d in a forum state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-6\">This would, indeed, be an expansive construction. We consider this to be an unfair reading of the district court\u2019s opinion; nor is such a holding necessary to justify personal jurisdiction in this case. In our view, the crucial conclusion in the quoted paragraph is not that the actions of the Idaho defendant under the Idaho takeover law had a \u201cpractical effect\u201d in Texas, but that they amounted to the regulation of Great Western\u2019s Texas-based business activities. Because we have concluded that this extraterritorial regulation provides the necessary contacts with Texas, we need not rely upon the district court\u2019s further and broader conclusion that impact on shareholders also provides the contacts necessary to satisfy due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-7\">The contention that our holding will permit countless other out-of-state lawsuits against state officials ignores the concededly unique characteristics of state takeover laws such as Idaho\u2019s. We do not share the dissent\u2019s difficulty distinguishing the Idaho takeover statute from other regulations. In none of the examples it cites is there a comparable lack of <em>any </em>connection between all parties to a transaction, as well as the transaction itself, and the regulating state. For instance, it is true that the California pollution law impacts out-of-state automobile manufacturers. But it is also true that almost all the customers who buy and drive those cars are California residents. Blue Sky laws \u2014 in notable contrast to the Idaho takeover law \u2014 regulate only sales of securities within the regulating state. Insurance laws\u2019 have a similarly limited scope. Business qualification regulations affect only companies that wish to operate within the regulating state. And food purity laws cover only sales of food to customers within the regulating state. When, as in these examples, the regulating state has a substantial connection with at least one side of a regulated transaction, it may be unreasonable to require state officials to defend their regulations in out-of-state forums even though there are foreseeable effects in a foreign state sufficient to satisfy the minimum contacts branch of <em>International Shoe\u2019s </em>requirements. That, however, is simply not the situation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-10\">\n<em>D. Section 27 of the 1934 Act.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-11\">Section 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa (1970), provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-12\">Any criminal proceeding [under the Act] may be brought in the district wherein any act or transaction constituting the violation occurred. Any suit or action to enforce any liability or duty created by this chapter or rules and regulations thereunder, or to enjoin any violation of such chapter or rules and regulations, may be brought in any such district or in the district wherein the defendant is found or is an inhabitant or transacts business, and process in such cases may be served in any other district of which the defendant is an inhabitant or wherever the defendant may be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-13\">Under the final clause, a federal court has jurisdiction over the person of a defendant in an action under the 1934 Act so long as the manner of service is proper and constitutional limits on extraterritorial service are respected. <em>A. L. Black v. Acme Markets, Inc., </em>5 Cir. 1977, 564 F.2d 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-14\">The manner of service is not contested on appeal; we have already held that any constitutional limits on extraterritorial service have been respected.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> If Great Western\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>complaint states a claim under the 1934 Act, \u00a7 27 provides another basis for personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-5\">Section 28 of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78bb (1970) is helpful to Great Western. That section provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-6\">Nothing in this chapter shall affect the jurisdiction of the securities commission (or any agency or officer performing like functions) of any State over any security or any person insofar as it does not conflict with the provisions of this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-7\">This language impliedly prohibits a state official from enforcing a statute that conflicts with the 1934 Act. Great Western\u2019s claim that the Idaho takeover law conflicts with the Williams Act, therefore, appears to state a claim under \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-8\">McEldowney responds that the only possible claims under the 1934 Act are those to prevent and punish fraud in the purchase and sale of securities. Section 28 prohibits no conduct; to the contrary, it preserves the right of states to regulate. Finally, he argues that Great Western\u2019s construction of \u00a7 28 would mean that by enforcing the Idaho takeover law the state officials \u201cviolated\u201d the 1934 Act and became subject to criminal penalties under \u00a7 32, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78ff(a) (1970).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Since Congress could not have intended to make such conduct criminal, McEldowney concludes that enforcement of a law that conflicts with the 1934 Act cannot be a violation of that Act, and that \u00a7 28 is not relevant to this proceeding. Great Western\u2019s contention, he argues, is one under the supremacy clause of the Constitution, not under the 1934 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-9\">The attempted distinction between \u00a7 28 and the supremacy clause is not persuasive. Section 28 essentially restates the supremacy clause, making it a statutory as well as a constitutional requirement. <em>See </em>Aranow, Einhorn &amp; Berlstein, <em>Developments in Tender Offers for Corporate Control </em>225 (1977). Thomas Corcoran, one of the principal draftsmen of the 1934 Act, pointed out to the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency that \u00a7 28 stated a rule that is true of any federal statute because of constitutional requirements. Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, <em>Stock Exchange Practices: Hearings on S. Res. 84 (72d Cong.) and S. Res. 56 and S. Res. 97 (73d Cong.), pt. 15, National Securities Exchange Act of 1934, </em>73d Cong., 1st Sess. 6577 (1934). Nor is the lack of prohibitory language in \u00a7 28 significant. The commerce clause, for instance, is written only as an affirmative grant of power to Congress. Without any difficulty, courts find that the language also imposes self-executing limitations on regulation by the states. <em>E. g., </em>P. Brest, <em>Processes of Constitutional Decisionmaking </em>206 (1975). Finally, the absence of previous cases relying upon \u00a7 28 to invalidate a state law is not controlling. As we have already noted, the state takeover laws pose highly unusual, if not unique, questions in the subject of securities regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-13\">To interpret \u00a7 28 to require states not to enact or enforce laws that conflict with the 1934 Act and to hold that \u00a7 27 applies to a suit to enforce that requirement is not to subject officials of states with offending statutes to the risk of imprisonment or fine. McEldowney argues that \u201cviolation\u201d is the key word in \u00a7 27, and that an act that is a \u201cviolation\u201d in \u00a7 27 terms is automatically within the scope of \u00a7 32(a) criminal liability. The SEC, in oral argument, suggested that a suit based on \u00a7 28 would be one to enforce a duty created by the 1934 Act and that the concept of a \u201cviolation\u201d would not be relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>It is not necessary to parse \u00a7 27 to determine if this distinction between a \u201cviolation\u201d of the 1934 Act and a failure to honor a \u201cduty\u201d created by the Act is valid.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Even if \u201cviolation\u201d is the key word in \u00a7 27, that word has not been interpreted in the manner urged by Idaho\u2019s Director of Finance. The most helpful authority comes from \u00a7 16(b) cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-4\">Section 16(b), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78p(b) (1970), allows a corporation to recover any profit realized by a corporate insider from short swing trading in the corporation\u2019s stock.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Nothing in the 1934 Act directly forbids short swing trading by insiders. Instead, such an obligation has been inferred from the profit recapture provision. <em>E. g., Gratz v. Claughton, 2 </em>Cir. 1951, 187 F.2d 46, 49 (L. Hand, J.), <em>cert. denied, </em>341 U.S. 920, 71 S.Ct. 741, 95 L.Ed. 1353. Short swing trades are not made unlawful by \u00a7 16(b) in the sense that they can result in an indictment. II L. Loss, <em>Securities Regulation </em>1044 (1961). Nevertheless, engaging in short swing trading is a \u201cviolation\u201d for \u00a7 27 purposes. <em>Gratz v. Claughton, </em>187 F.2d at 49; <em>Grossman v. Young, </em>1947 S.D.N.Y., 70 F.Supp. 970, <em>petition for prohibition and' mandamus denied sub nom. Young v. Rifkind, 2 </em>Cir., Oct. 13, 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-5\">Enforcement of a duty not to make short swing trades fulfills the purpose of \u00a7 16(b). <em>Gratz v. Claughton, </em>187 F.2d at 49. Similarly, recognition of a duty not to pass or enforce laws that conflict with the 1934 Act would fulfill the purposes of \u00a7 28. Like the duty not to make short swing trades, this duty would not be enforceable through criminal sanctions, but could be violated for purposes of \u00a7 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-7\">We conclude that the wording of \u00a7 28 and the legislative history of the 1934 Act show that \u00a7 28 was an attempt to incorporate the supremacy clause into the securities laws. Congress, of course, is free to do this. We hold that Great Western stated a claim based on the 1934 Act, and that \u00a7 27 is an independent source of personal jurisdiction over the Idaho officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-9\">VENUE</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-10\">\n<em>A. The 1934 Act.'</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-11\">Section 27 of the 1934 Act provides for venue as well as personal jurisdiction. Venue is proper in any district where acts constituting part of the alleged violation of the 1934 Act occurred. The alleged violation consists of enforcing an invalid statute. The regulatory activities by the Idaho officials had their restraining effect at the corporate headquarters of Great Western in Dallas. This was a sufficient act to make venue proper in the Northern District of Texas. <em>See Travis v. Anthes Imperial Limited, </em>8 Cir. 1973, 473 F.2d 515. In addition, Idaho officials sent at least one interstate letter into Texas as part of their regulatory efforts. The letter from Baptie outlining his objections to Great Western\u2019s filing and announcing that the effective date of the offer would be summarily delayed was more than a trivial part of the interference by Idaho officials with Great Western\u2019s securities transactions. Such interstate communication into the forum makes venue proper under \u00a7 27. <em>See, e. g., Hilgeman v. National Insurance Co., </em>5 Cir. 1977, 547 F.2d 298; <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Development Co., </em>1975 D.Del., 398 F.Supp. 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>\n<em>B. 28 U.S.C: \u00a7 1391(b).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-4\">Because subject matter jurisdiction in this case is not based solely upon diversity of citizenship, the applicable general venue statute is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-5\">A civil action wherein jurisdiction is not founded solely on diversity of citizenship may be brought only in the judicial district where all defendants reside, or in which the claim arose, except as otherwise provided by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-6\">The district court followed the rule that a claim can arise in only one district for \u00a7 1391 venue purposes. It held that for \u00a7 1391 purposes the claim arose in Idaho, and that venue was not proper under the general statute. 439 F.Supp. at 433. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-7\">The language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391 can be read to provide that a claim may arise, as a matter of law, in only one district. <em>See, e. g., </em>15 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Jurisdiction </em>\u00a7 3806 at 28-29 (1976). Commentators have recognized, however, that a preferable approach would be to equate the availability of compulsory process on a nonresident and proper venue under \u00a7 1391. <em>Id. </em>at 29; 1 J. Moore 10.142[5. \u2014 2] at 1430. Professor Moore\u2019s.view is that the current statute can be read to follow such an approach, although he admits this reading is not without difficulty. 1 J. Moore H 0.142[5. \u2014 2] at 1431-32. Some courts have moved toward an expansive reading of \u00a7 1391. <em>See, e. g., Gardner Engineering Corp. </em>v. <em>Page Engineering Co., </em>8 Cir. 1973, 484 F.2d 27, 33; <em>Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Ever-Dry Corp., </em>S.D.N.Y, 1968, 290 F.Supp. 735, 739; 15 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper \u00a7 3806 at 29 n. 18; 1 J. Moore 10.142[5. \u2014 2] at' 1433. Our conclusion that the Idaho officials had sufficient contacts with the Northern District of Texas to make compulsory process available means that venue would be proper under \u00a7 1391(b) if the expansive interpretation of the venue statute is adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-11\">We may leave that decision for another day, because even if Great Western\u2019s claim can arise in only one district, we conclude that the proper district is the Northern District of Texas, not the District of Idaho.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The core of Great Western\u2019s claim is that the Idaho officials invalidly prevented Great Western from initiating a tender offer for Sunshine. The offer was initiated in Dallas, Texas. If there is a single place where the allegedly invalid restraint occurred, that place is Dallas.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Although the result of Idaho\u2019s regulation was that Great Western could not make an offer to Sunshine shareholders who reside in districts throughout the country, the place of restraint, and thus the place where Idaho officials injured Great Western, was in Dal- \u2022 las.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1367-12\">That the Northern District of Texas is the district where the claim arose, if there can be only one such district, becomes clearer if one notes that New York and Maryland also might have asserted jurisdiction over Great Western\u2019s offer. In that event, there would have been no district where all the defendants resided. The apparent purpose of the amendments to \u00a7 1391, adding the \u201cin which the claim arose\u201d language, was \u201cto assure that at least one venue . . . will be proper as to <em>all </em>defendants . in a multi-party action\u201d. 1 J. Moore 1 0.142[5. \u2014 2] at 1434 (emphasis add<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>ed). There is no reason to conclude that the claim against New York or Maryland arose in Idaho. The district judge would have placed the claim in Idaho only because Idaho was the source of the power exerted extraterritorially. Idaho would not have been the source of New York\u2019s or Maryland\u2019s power. In contrast, if New York or Maryland officials had asserted jurisdiction, the reasons why we believe Great Western\u2019s claim against the Idaho officials arose in Dallas would equally apply to them, and a single suit would have been possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">In summary, on the questions whether the requirements of personal jurisdiction and venue are satisfied, we hold that both are met.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Personal jurisdiction existed under the Texas long arm statute, as made applicable by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the requirements of due process. Personal jurisdiction also existed by virtue of \u00a7 27 of the 1934 Act. Venue is proper under both \u00a7 27 of the 1934 Act and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1368-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-6\">PREEMPTION</p>\n<p id=\"A-9\">\n<em>A. The Legal Criteria.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-7\">We now proceed to the district court\u2019s substantive holding that federal securities regulation preempts the Idaho statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-8\">No simple, mechanical formula can summarize the analysis necessary to determine whether a state statute is void under the supremacy clause, U.S.Const. art. I, \u00a7 10. <em>See Goldstein v. California, </em>1973, 412 U.S. 546, 561, 93 S.Ct. 2303, 37 L.Ed.2d 163; <em>Hines v. Davidowitz, </em>1941, 312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S.Ct. 399, 85 L.Ed. 581, The nature of a court\u2019s inquiries as to this question has been established in earlier cases. The Supreme Court summarized these inquiries in <em>Jones v. Rath Packing Co., </em>1977, 430 U.S. 519, 525-26, 97 S.Ct. 1305, 1309, 51 L.Ed.2d 604:</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-13\">The first inquiry is whether Congress, pursuant to its power to regulate commerce, U.S.Const., Art. 1, \u00a7 8, has prohibited state regulation of the particular aspects of commerce involved in this case. [W]hen Congress has \u201cunmistakably . . . ordained,\u201d <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v.

We need not reach the question whether Congress implicitly ruled out all state legislation of tender offers when it amended the 1934 Act with the Williams Act. We rely instead on the principles in the second paragraph quoted from <em>Jones, </em>and hold that the particular takeover law before us cannot stand because it conflicts with the federal statute. In the words of <em>Hines, </em>\u201cit stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-8\">McEldowney relies heavily on the words of \u00a7 28 to argue that the Idaho statute is not preempted. This argument applies to both the supremacy clause and to \u00a7 28, in that \u00a7 28, according to McEldowney, is an express congressional instruction on how. to apply the supremacy clause. Appellant\u2019s brief at 29-30. This'analysis, like ours, focuses on the question whether the Idaho statute \u201cconflicts\u201d with the Williams Act. McEldowney argues further, however, that a \u201cconflict\u201d in this context exists only if it is impossible to meet both federal and state requirements. Because of this he argues flatly that \u201c[t]he test set out in <em>Hines </em>is not relevant\u201d. Appellant\u2019s brief at 30.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1369-9\">We do not accept this narrow definition of \u201cconflict\u201d, nor the dismissal of the <em>Hines </em>test. Therefore, although several provisions of the Idaho statute arguably contradict specific provisions of the federal law, we shall not focus on those inconsistencies nor decide whether they would be sufficient to preempt Idaho\u2019s law under McEldow-ney\u2019s suggested analysis.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>The appellant\u2019s definition of \u201cconflict\u201d is too narrow for the usual preemption test; <em>Jones </em>unambiguously reaffirms that in general the <em>Hines </em>test rather than a more limited examination for contradictions is the proper one. <em>Jones v. Rath Packing Co., </em>430 U.S. at 526, 97 S.Ct. 1305. Nor does any reason appear to give the term \u201cconflict\u201d a special limited meaning in \u00a7 28 of the 1934 Act. The language of the section does not compel such unusual interpretation. The cases and administrative authorities cited in the appellant\u2019s brief at best support the narrow definition obliquely, and all are in distinguishable contexts.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The SEC, in its role as an amicus curiae in the case, rejects such a narrow reading, SEC amicus brief at 45-47. This administrative interpretation is entitled to deference. <em>See Fawcus Machine Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>1931, 282 U.S. 375, 51 S.Ct. 144, 75 L.Ed. 397; Hart &amp; Sacks, <em>The Legal Process: Basic Problems in the Making and Application of Law </em>1340-47 (tent. ed. 1958); Note, <em>Preemption as a Preferential Ground: A New Canon of Construction, </em>12 Stan.L.Rev. 208, 216-17 (1959). Finally, the legislative materials discussed in Part III of this opinion show that the draftsmen of \u00a7 28 intended to restate the supremacy clause. That being so, there is no reason to substitute a narrow meaning of \u201cconflict\u201d for that enunciated by the Supreme Court in <em>Hines, Jones, </em>and other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-8\">\n<em>B. The Conflict Between the Idaho Takeover Statute and the Williams Act.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-9\">The underlying purpose of the Williams Act is to protect investors. <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., </em>1977, 430 U.S. 1, 97 S.Ct. 926, 51 L.Ed.2d 124. Congress chose this goal in the Williams Act and adopted a distinct means of achieving it. Essentially, Congress relied upon a \u201cmarket approach\u201d to investor protection. The function of federal regulation is to get information to the investor by allowing both the offeror and the incumbent managers of a target company to present fully their arguments and then to let the investor decide for himself.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> In identical language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>the Senate and House Reports explained, \u201cThis bill is designed to make the relevant facts known so that shareholders have a fair opportunity to make their decision\u201d.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> In <em>Rondeau v. Mosinee Paper Corp., </em>1975, 422 U.S. 49, 58, 95 S.Ct. 2069, 45 L.Ed.2d 12, the Supreme Court noted that Congress wanted to give each side an opportunity to express and explain its position without giving target management a weapon against takeover bids. <em>See also, Humana, Inc. v. American Medicorp., Inc., </em>S.D.N.Y.1978, 445 F.Supp. 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-5\">The reason for this approach was congressional recognition that tender offers often benefit an investor and that a statute preventing tender offers could harm, rather than protect, investors. <em>E. g., </em>S.Rep.No. 550, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. at 3 (1967) (Senate Report); H.R.Rep.No.1711, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. at 3 (1968) (House Report); U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1968, p. 2811. The original bill to amend the 1934 Act, S. 2731, introduced in 1965, sought to protect investors by making it difficult for tender offers to succeed. <em>See </em>111 Cong.Rec. 28257-28259 (1965).<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> This approach attracted considerable opposition, including that of the SEC.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">As a result, Congress amended the draft bill to make it less burdensome to offerors. A cornerstone of the revised approach to investor protection was the law\u2019s deliberate neutrality among the contestants in a tender offer. The Senate Report explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-7\">The committee has taken extreme care to avoid tipping the balance of regulation either in favor of management or in favor of the person making the takeover bid. The bill is designed to require full and fair disclosure for the benefit of investors while at the same time providing the offeror and management equal opportunity to fairly present their case. Senate Report at 3. Virtually identical language appears in the House Report at 3. The Supreme Court has already drawn attention to this language and to the intent of Congress not to take sides in tender offers. <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., </em>430 U.S. at 30-31, 97 S.Ct. 926; <em>Rondeau v. Mosinee Paper Corp., </em>422 U.S. at 58-59, 95 S.Ct. 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-12\">Of course, this language does not mean Great Western has a right under the Williams Act to complete its tender offer successfully. <em>See Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., </em>430 U.S. at 34-35, 97 S.Ct. 926. Instead, it creates the investor\u2019s right to hear a fair presentation of the offeror\u2019s proposal. This investor\u2019s right can be carried out, however, only by avoiding regulation that puts the offeror at a disadvantage to incumbent management. Congress recognized that delay can seriously impede a tender offer. Senate Report at 5. It rejected legal requirements, such as pre-commencement review by the SEC, that could delay offers unnecessarily. <em>Id. </em>Such delay could prevent the offeror from fairly presenting its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-13\">In its consideration of the Hart-Scott-Ro-dino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 18a (Supp.1977), Congress recently reaffirmed the choice of a market approach to investor protection in the tender offer area, as well as the importance of legal neutrality between offerors and incumbent management to carry out this protection. Congress also reaffirmed its view that regulatory provisions producing more than minimal delay could upset this neutrality. The House Report stated:</p>\n<p id=\"AKqI\">it is clear that this short waiting period [referring to the 10 days required by the Williams Act] was founded on congressional concern that a longer delay might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>unduly favor the target firm\u2019s incumbent management and permit them to frustrate many pro-competitive cash tenders. This 10-day waiting period, thus underscores the basic purpose of the Williams Act \u2014 to maintain a neutral policy toward cash.tender offers, by avoiding lengthy delay that might discourage their chances for success.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\">H.R.Rep.No.94-1373, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 12 (1976); U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, pp. 2572, 2644. Congressman Rodino explained to the House:</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-8\">Lengthy delays will give the target firm plenty of time to defeat the offer, by abolishing cumulative voting, arranging a speedy defensive merger, quickly incorpo-' rating in a State with an antitakeover statute, or negotiating costly lifetime employment contracts for incumbent management. And the longer the waiting period, the more the target\u2019s stock may be bid up in the market, making the offer more costly- \u2014 and less successful. Should this happen, it will mean that shareholders of the target firm will be effectively deprived of the choice that cash tender offers give to them. . . . <em>Generally, the courts have construed the Williams Act so as to maintain these two options for the target company\u2019s shareholders, and the House conferees contemplate that the courts will continue to do so. </em>122 Cong.Rec. 10293 (1976) (emphasis added). There is no real dispute that the Idaho statute \u2014 like most of the state takeover laws \u2014 increases a target company\u2019s ability to defeat a tender offer.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The Idaho law helps target companies primarily through provisions not found in the Williams Act that give them advance notice of a tender offer<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> and the ability to delay the commencement of an offer, by means such as insisting on a hearing.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Most observers of takeover battles agree that time is among the most effective weapons available to a company resisting a tender offer.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The Idaho statute favors the target in other ways, as well. Idaho\u2019s regulation of defensive efforts by a target is significantly weaker than Idaho\u2019s regulation of an offer- or\u2019s activities. <em>Compare </em>Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 30-1504 and 30-1505, <em>with </em>Idaho Code 30-1503-06. Finally, the Idaho statute gives the target corporation board the power to exclude an offer from state regulation by approving the offer. Idaho Code 30-1501(5X3).<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-15\">The district court concluded that these pro-management provisions evidenced a legislative purpose \u201cto inhibit tender offers for the benefit of management\u201d. 439 F.Supp. at 437. <em>Accord, </em>Moylan, <em>State Regulation of Tender Offers, </em>58 Marq.L.Rev. 687, 690 (1975). The district court further reasoned that this purpose conflicted with the Williams Act\u2019s purpose of protecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>investors, and that this conflict meant the Williams Act preempted Idaho\u2019s statute. 439 F.Supp. at 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">McEldowney strenuously objects to the district court\u2019s characterization of the purpose of the Idaho takeover law. He contends that Idaho, like Congress, legislated to protect investors. He explains the pro-management provisions not as an attempt to prevent tender offers, but as a.means of involving the directors and officers of the target in the evaluation of a tender offer. With the advance warning and additional time provided by the state law, so he argues, target directors have an opportunity to fulfill their fiduciary duties to shareholders by studying the offer and either negotiating better terms or making a recommendation based on the shareholders\u2019 interests. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 39-42. McEldowney also explains that management has the power to exclude an offer from Idaho regulation because presumably management will do so only when it already has had opportunity to study the offer thoroughly and to negotiate fully a takeover. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 41. /;</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-11\">We need not probe the minds of Idaho legislators to determine whether the (true purpose of the Idaho takeover law was. to protect investors or to protect incumbent management. Even if we accept the appelr lant\u2019s interpretation of the legislature\u2019s pur-\\ pose, it is still true that Idaho chose to \u2022 protect investors differently fram-the way Congress protected investors./instead of /relying upon <em>investors\u2019 </em>decisions after full disclosure, Idaho relies upon the business judgment of corporate directors with a fiduciary duty to their shareholders.) Idaho\u2019s \u201cfiduciary approach\u201d to investor protection may be one way to protect shareholders, but it is an approach Congress rejected.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1373-7\">Idaho\u2019s statute is preempted, because the market approach to investor protection adopted by Congress and the fiduciary approach adopted by Idaho are incompatible. The Senator for whom the Williams Act is named has written, \u201c[ajdvance notice provisions, and requirements concerning the duration of offers, the pro rata purchases of shares, and the withdrawal rights of shareholders either explicitly conflict with federal provisions on the same subjects or are obstacles to the accomplishment of objectives implicit in the federal statutes\u201d. H. Williams, <em>Introduction to Developments in Tender Offers for Corporate Control </em>xix (1977)./Congress intended for the investor to evaluate a tender offer; Idaho asks the target company manage-<em>rfiient </em>to make that decision on behalf of the /shareholders./ <em>See generally </em>Note, Corn-<em>merce Qausl Limitations upon State Regulation of Tender Offers, </em>47 S.Cal.L.Rev. 1133, 1150 (1974). That Congress rejected provisions very similar to some of those in the Idaho takeover statute does not mean the state law is automatically preempted. <em>See, e. g., DeCanas </em>v. <em>Bica, </em>1976, 424 U.S. 351, 96 S.Ct. 933, 47 L.Ed.2d 43. In this situation, however/Congress rejected those , provisions to preserve the neutral regula\\tory stance that gives each side of a tender offer an equal opportunity to persuade the investor. When Idaho enacted those reject-zed provisions it hampered an offeror\u2019s ability to express and explain its position directly to investors. In doing so, Idaho disrupted the neutrality indispensable for the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>er operation of the federal market approach to tender offers regulation.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> /he Idaho takeover statute \u201cstands as an Obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\u201d of the Williams Act.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1374-4\">The Idaho statute requires substantially more disclosure than the Williams Act. <em>Compare </em>Idaho Code \u00a7 30-1503(2) <em>with </em>Schedule 14D-1, 17 CFR 240 HD-100. In that respect, as the SEC points out, it also interferes with federal regulation. <em>See </em>SEC amicus brief at 41-42. McEldowney argues that Congress had the express desire to get information to investors. Idaho\u2019s more demanding disclosure requirements, he contends, only go further in the same direction, thereby carrying out rather than' frustrating the purposes and objectives of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-5\">Superficially Idaho\u2019s extensive disclosure requirements appear compatible with a market approach to tender offer investor protection. In reality, in the area of financial disclosure it can be true that \u201cless is more\u201d. Disclosure of a mass of irrelevant data can confuse the investor and obscure relevant disclosures. Hearings on S.510 Before Subcommittee on Banking and Commerce, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. at 205 (1967) (Senate Hearings) (statement of Mr. Cohen); <em>Corporate Takeovers, </em>Hearings Before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 90 (1976) <em>(Corporate </em>Takeovers) (statement of Mr. Loomis); Aranow, Ein-horn &amp; Berlstein, <em>Developments in Tender Offers for Corporate Control </em>219-20 (1977). Management may also be able to halt an offer because some immaterial information required by excessive disclosure standards is missing or inaccurate. <em>See </em>Idaho Code \u00a7 30-1503; Aranow, Einhorn &amp; Berlstein at 220. Those excessive requirements would cut off an offeror\u2019s opportunity to present the material information that investors need to make their decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-9\">In \u00a7 13(d) of the Williams Act Congress delegated to the SEC the task of specifying what data is material to an investor considering a tender offer. The SEC has attempted to write disclosure requirements that provide enough material information without producing reports so detailed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>complicated that few shareholders would want to read them. <em>See Corporate Takeovers </em>at 90 (statement of Mr. Loomis). That judgment is a legislative one. <em>See Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, </em>373 U.S. at 175, 83 S.Ct. 1210 (White, J., dissenting). Idaho\u2019s effort to second guess that judgment cannot stand. <em>Id. </em>This is particularly true because Idaho\u2019s additions to the federal disclosure requirements reduce the utility of federally required disclosure and produce an obstacle to the accomplishment of the federal objective to enable investors to make an informed choice about a tender offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-7\">THE VALIDITY OF THE IDAHO TAKEOVER STATUTE UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-8\">The commerce clause, U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8, grants to Congress the power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce. This affirmative grant also imposes limits upon state power to regulate commerce over which Congress has primary responsibility. <em>See, e. g., The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co. v. Cottrell, </em>1976, 424 U.S. 366, 370-71, 96 S.Ct. 923, 47 L.Ed.2d 55. Nevertheless, not every exercise of state power with some impact on interstate commerce is invalid. \u201cRather, in areas where activities of legitimate local concern overlap with the national interests expressed by the Commerce Clause \u2014 where local and national powers are concurrent\u2014 the Court in absence of congressional guidance is called upon to make \u2018delicate adjustment of the conflicting state and federal claims\u2019 \u201d. <em>Id., quoting H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. v. DuMond, </em>1949, 336 U.S. 525, 553, 69 S.Ct. 657, 93 L.Ed. 865 (Black, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-9\">\n<em>A. Congressional Permission</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-10\">McEldowney contends that no adjustment of state and federal claims is necessary here because Congress consented in the 1934 Act to state takeover laws that might otherwise contravene the commerce clause. Congress has the power to give such consent and thereby to waive usual commerce clause restrictions. <em>E. g., Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, </em>1944, 325 U.S. 761, 769, 65 S.Ct. 1515, 89 L.Ed. 1915. <em>See generally </em>P. Brest, <em>Processes of Constitutional Decisionmaking </em>219-22 (1975); G. Gunther, <em>Cases and Materials on Constitutional Law </em>367-71 (9th ed. 1975). To determine whether Congress has consented to state regulation of tender offers that interferes with interstate commerce we must examine again \u00a7 28 of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78bb (1970). This is the provision that the appellant reads to give such consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-12\">That examination convinces us that \u00a7 28 does not consent to otherwise invalid state laws. When Congress has exempted state laws from commerce clause restrictions it has used language specifically directing that certain interstate commerce may be regulated as though it were purely local. <em>See, e. g., </em>the Wilson Act of 1890, 26 Stat. 313. Congress has also stated that, in the absence of affirmative Congressional action, courts should impose no barriers on state regulation. <em>See </em>the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 59 Stat. 33,15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1011 <em>et seq. </em>The language in \u00a7 28 of the 1934' Act is notably different from these acknowledged examples of Congressional consent. Rather than allowing violations of the commerce clause, \u00a7 28 appears to direct only that federal securities law should not be interpreted as a wholesale displacement of state securities regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-13\">The legislative history of \u00a7 28 demonstrates that even if we were to interpret \u00a7 28 to remove some commerce clause restrictions, that consent would not be broad enough to settle the commerce clause issue raised by the Idaho takeover law. The jurisdiction preserved in \u00a7 28 is that \u201cof state security commissions to regulate transactions <em>within their own borders.\u201d </em>H.R.Rep.No.85, 73d Cong., 1st Sess. 10 (1933) (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>Langevoort, <em>State Tender Offer Legislation: Interests, Effects, and Political Competency, </em>62 Cornell L.Q. 213, 247 (1977). The Idaho takeover law, in contrast, controls transactions made throughout the world.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>\n<em>B. The Pike Test</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">Because Congress has not settled the commerce clause issues raised in this case, we must look to the numerous Supreme Court decisions on the commerce clause for guidance. Fortunately, the Court has recently undertaken a restatement and distillation of its cases. <em>See Dixie Dairy Co. v. City of Chicago, </em>7 Cir. 1976, 538 F.2d 1303, 1308. In <em>Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., </em>1970, 397 U.S. 137, 142, 90 S.Ct. 844, 847, 25 L.Ed.2d 174, a unanimous Court adopted the following statement of the law:</p>\n<p id=\"AFX\">Although the criteria for determining the validity of state statutes affecting interstate commerce have been variously stated, the general rule that emerges can be phrased as follows: where the statute regulates even-handedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. <em>Huron Cement Co. v. Detroit, </em>362 U.S. 440, 443, 4 L.Ed.2d 852, 856, 80 S.Ct. 813, 816 [78 A.L.R.2d 1294], If a legitimate local purpose is found, then the question becomes one of degree. And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local intent involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-6\"><em>Accord, Raymond Motor Transportation, Inc. v. Rice, </em>1978, 434 U.S. 429, 441, 98 S.Ct. 787, 794, 54 L.Ed.2d 664; <em>A &amp; P Tea Co. v. Cottrell, </em>424 U.S. at 371-72, 96 S.Ct. 923.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1376-9\">\n<em>1. Legitimate local purposes.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-10\">The district judge concluded that the immediate purpose of the Idaho takeover law is to protect incumbent management. The district judge further ruled that this purpose is not a legitimate one for state regulation and that no other legitimate local purpose for the Idaho law could be found. McEldowney strongly condemns these findings as a usurpation of the Idaho legislature\u2019s functions. We agree with him that at this stage of its analysis the district court too quickly dismissed possible legitimate local interests served by the Idaho takeover law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-11\">It is true that the Idaho law helps incumbent management. One purpose of this favoritism may be to prevent the removal of local business to other states. This purpose would be unacceptable. Indeed, statutes <em>requiring </em>business operations to be performed in the home state that could more efficiently be performed elsewhere impose a burden on commerce that is <em>per se </em>illegal. <em>Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., </em>397 U.S. at 145, 90 S.Ct. 844, 25 L.Ed.2d 174. Idaho\u2019s law does not require any business to remain in Idaho; at worst, it hinders relocation. Nevertheless, the purpose of preserving local industry cannot support the legislation. Nor can that effect be ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-12\">McEldowney advances a different state interest in helping incumbent management. He points out that a corporation can influence local lifestyle through such means as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>charitable contributions or civil involvement and the depth of its commitment to issues such as pollution control or job safety. He contends that this interest in benevolent management is a legitimate reason for Idaho to regulate the means by which outsiders can change management. We accept this as a legitimate local interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\">MeEldowney argues that the true purpose of the Idaho takeover statute is to protect investors. This is certainly a legitimate purpose. Since we are not concerned at this step of our analysis with the relationship between the legitimate purpose and the means of regulation, we also consider this interest. We note, however, that Idaho has little reason to protect shareholders of other states, if their securities transactions do not take place within that state or substantially affect Idaho shareholders. <em>See </em>Wilner &amp; Landy, <em>The Tender Trap: State Takeover Statutes and Their Constitutionality, </em>45 Ford.L.Rev. 1, 17 (1976); Note, <em>Commerce Clause Limitations upon State Regulation of Tender Offers, </em>47 S.Cal.L.Rev. 1133, 1153 (1974). <em>See also Hall v. Geiger-Jones Co., </em>1917, 242 U.S. 539, 557-58, 37 S.Ct. 217, 61 L.Ed. 480, where the Court turned back a commerce clause challenge to Blue Sky laws in part because the laws regulate only transactions within the state. <em>Cf. Federal Securities Code </em>\u00a7 1904(c) (Proposed Official Draft 1978) which would preempt state regulation of tender offers unless the target has its principal place of business in the regulatory state and more than 50 percent of the record or beneficial holders of the target\u2019s outstanding voting securities holding more than 50 percent of those securities are residents of the regulatory state. In this case, only about two percent of Sunshine\u2019s shareholders reside in Idaho. That there are even that many is by chance. Idaho\u2019s law would have applied even if no shareholders had resided in Idaho and no securities transactions had taken place within Idaho. Moreover, the business realities of tender offers make it unlikely that there will be many offers for corporations held predominately by Idahoans (or citizens of any other narrow geographic area). Investment bankers know that local owners are characteristically loyal to management. Therefore, corporations with widespread stock ownership are more promising tender offer targets. <em>See, e. g., </em>Trough, <em>Characteristics of Target Companies, </em>32 Bus.L. 1301, 1301-02 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-8\">\n<em>2. Impact on interstate commerce.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-9\">Rather than establishing interference with commerce that occurred in connection with the Great Western offer for Sunshine, much of the evidence in this case consisted of disputed expert opinions about the general impact Idaho\u2019s law would be likely to have on the making of interstate offers and the functioning of national securities markets. One of the effects mentioned at trial is the disruption of the normal securities markets that state-mandated advance notification or announcement of an offer can cause.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Another is a change in strategy by offerors. For instance, an offeror antici-patihg a battle during the delay caused by a state law might deliberately make a low initial offer so that it can raise its offer to meet that of a competitor. There was also testimony that state statutes such as Idaho\u2019s have a general effect of discouraging tender offers. These effects \u2014 and others\u2014 have been identified by several commentators. <em>See, e. g., </em>Aranow, Einhorn &amp; Berl-stein, <em>Developments in Tender Offers for Corporate Control </em>229-30 (1977); Moylan, <em>State Regulation of Tender Offers, </em>58 Marq.L.Rev. 687, 691-92; Subcommittee on Proxy Solicitations and Tender Offers, Federal Regulation of Securities Committee, American Bar Association, <em>State Takeover Statutes and the Williams Act </em>reprinted at 32 Bus.L. 187, 193 (1976); Wilner &amp; Landy, <em>The Tender Trap: State Takeover Statutes and Their Constitutionality, </em>45 Ford.L.Rev. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>1, 10-11, 14, 20 (1976); Note, 47 S.Cal.L. Rev. at 1149-52; [1969] Sec.Reg. &amp; L.Rep. (BNA), No. 1 at All.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-4\">To some extent this evidentiary situation was unavoidable. State takeover laws can have numerous effects on a tender offeror\u2019s plans. It would be unusual for each of those effects to be felt in a single offer. Nevertheless, we would hesitate to agree with the district court that the evidence shows a substantial effect on interstate commerce if the record contained only speculation about the effect of Idaho\u2019s statute and of state takeover laws in general. The record contains more. Baptie\u2019s letter of March 21,1977 delayed an interstate tender offer that would otherwise have gone forward.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> That action in itself not only had a substantial impact on interstate commerce, it <em>stopped </em>over 31 million dollars of interstate commerce. An executive of Great Western testified that after Baptie\u2019s letter the company doubted it could ever satisfy Idaho\u2019s requirements. Tr. at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-5\">In addition, except in the rare tender offer made entirely within Idaho, Idaho\u2019s extraterritorial approach to tender offer regulation has an inherent impact on interstate commerce. Idaho\u2019s law is designed to alter the disclosure made in securities transactions between Idaho and another state, two other states, and even entirely within another state. Idaho\u2019s law can also change the time when, if ever, those non-Idaho securities sales will occur. <em>Cf. Southern Pacific Co. </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>325 U.S. at 773-75, 65 S.Ct. 1515 (state restriction of train lengths that, in practical effect, regulated the length of out-of-state trains).</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-6\">Finally, Great Western introduced evidence that if New York had also asserted jurisdiction over the Sunshine offer its legal requirements would have contradicted Idaho\u2019s. According to George Boswell, Executive Vice-President of Great Western, Great Western was concerned that the advance publication of a tender offer required by Idaho law would violate New York\u2019s prohibition of publication. Tr. at 154. Another witness, Jeffrey B. Bartell, testified that it was \u201cconceivable\u201d that the advance publication required by Idaho could constitute an unregistered offering in another state. Tr. at 70. Mr. Bartell gave no specific examples.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-9\">This evidence is important because in cases where the rules of different states conflict, the Supreme Court has been severe in its scrutiny of state legislation. L. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law </em>339 (1978). Although the potential for such conflict was once enough to trigger such scrutiny, recently the Court has required a showing of actual conflict. <em>Id.; </em>G. Gunther at 317-18. The evidence in this case falls somewhere in between. There is evidence that states have already passed contradictory laws, but the evidence is not overwhelming. The sole example of an actual conflict rests on the plaintiff\u2019s own conclusion that a conflict exists between New York and Idaho law. That conclusion, to our knowledge, has never been litigated and may be incorrect.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Moreover, since New York ultimately did not assert jurisdiction Great Western was never subjected to conflicting legal requirements. Nor was there evidence of any other offer actually subjected to conflicting state requirements. On the other hand, several commentators have examined the state takeover statutes and expressed a concern that they may be contradictory. <em>See, e. g., </em>Aranow, Einhorn &amp; Berlstein, <em>Developments in Tender Offers for Corporation Control </em>228 (1977); ABA Subcommittee on Proxy Solicitations and Tender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>Offers, Federal Regulation of Securities Committee, <em>State Takeover Statutes and the Williams Act </em>reprinted at 32 Bus.L. 186, 189,193 (1976); <em>Corporate Takeovers, </em>Hearing before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 90 (1976) (statement of SEC Chairman Loomis).</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-5\">The record before us may not warrant the harsh commerce clause scrutiny that follows a demonstration of actual conflict between state rules. The demonstrated concern that state laws may conflict, however, supports other testimony that state statutes such as Idaho\u2019s deter tender offers. At any rate, we conclude that evidence other than that concerning conflicting state rules supports the view that the Idaho statute has a substantial impact on interstate commerce for purposes of the <em>Pike </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-6\">3. <em>The balance of the burden and the benefit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1379-7\">The final step under <em>Pike </em>is to determine whether the legitimate local purposes served by Idaho\u2019s takeover statute justify the law\u2019s substantial impact on interstate commerce. As with any balancing analysis, we must first determine what degree of judicial examination is appropriate. At one time the Supreme Court assumed a deferential stance in commerce clause cases. <em>See, e. g., South Carolina State Highway Department v. Barnwell Bros., </em>1938, 303 U.S. 177, 190-91, 58 S.Ct. 510, 82 L.Ed. 734. Since 1938, however, a more intensive inquiry into the reasonableness of state regulation has evolved. <em>See, e. g., Raymond Motor Transportation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>434 U.S. at 440-444, 98 S.Ct. at 794-795; <em>Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., </em>1959, 359 U.S. 520, 79 S.Ct. 962, 3 L.Ed.2d 1003; <em>Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, </em>1945, 325 U.S. 761, 65 S.Ct. 1515, 89 L.Ed. 1915; G. Gunther at 308-11, 315. The Court has scrutinized the fit between the state\u2019s purpose and its regulation. It has also asked whether alternative means of achieving the purpose would impose fewer burdens on interstate commerce, in a manner similar to \u201cleast restrictive alternative\u201d analysis. <em>See, e. g., Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., </em>397 U.S. at 142, 90 S.Ct. 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-11\">These more recent cases require greater justification for a law challenged on commerce clause grounds than for one challenged as a violation of due process.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> G. Gunther at 311. Thus, while we are far from eager to invalidate Idaho\u2019s takeover law, we are free to use a stricter standard than the \u201crational relationship\u201d test of due process analysis. We are interested in the substantiality of both the local interest itself and the link between the interest and the Idaho takeover law. Finally, we note that the challenged regulations are not examples of the kind of safety regulations the Court has been particularly reluctant to strike down. <em>See, e. g., Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., </em>397 U.S. at 143, 90 S.Ct. 844, quoting <em>Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, </em>325 U.S. at 796, 65 S.Ct. 1515 (Douglas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-12\">One state interest to consider is that of protecting investors. The strength of this interest is substantially diluted because Idaho has little reason to protect the large majority of the shareholders affected by the takeover act. In addition, as the district court pointed out, the benefits to investors from the Idaho takeover statute are not certain. 439 F.Supp. at 439. McEldow-ney asserts that during the state imposed delay of a tender offer, the original offeror may be forced to raise the offer, or another more advantageous competing offer may be made. Nothing in the Idaho statute guarantees those benefits. Indeed, shareholders could be <em>harmed </em>by the delay if during the waiting period the offeror reduces the offer or abandons altogether a bid shareholders would want to accept if they had a chance. <em>See generally, </em>Langevoort, 62 Cornell L.Q. at 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-13\">The additional disclosure required by Idaho\u2019s statute may assist some shareholders. It may confuse others. Moreover, addition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>al disclosure from the offeror is not likely to be of great use to a shareholder making economic judgments about the desirability of a tender offer. The key relationship is that between the price offered and the value of the target under current management. <em>See </em>Brudney, <em>A Note on Chilling Tender Solicitations, </em>21 Rutgers L.Rev. 609, 616-20 (1967). Incumbent management is \u2022more likely to possess information about the current value of the target than is the offeror. Langevoort, 62 Cornell L.Q. at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">Another interest asserted by the appellant is that of encouraging civic responsibility by the management of local corporations. No doubt this can be a substantial interest. We question, however, whether it is advanced more than incidentally by the statute challenged in this lawsuit. Surely it cannot be true that all incumbent managers are model corporate citizens or that all tender offerors are vandals. The record certainly contains no support for such a conclusion. Yet, the Idaho takeover statute imposes the same handicaps on all offerors and the same advantages on all incumbent managers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-5\">There is, of course, some relation between the Idaho takeover law and the interest in responsible management. The increased disclosure required by state law might help interested shareholders to determine whether a tender offeror is civically responsible. But that information would be of no help if it is never disclosed because the burdensome state requirements discourage a responsible offeror from ever making an offer for an Idaho corporation. Nor would the state law help if civically irresponsible incumbents are able to force an offeror to abandon his bid by invoking time consuming hearing processes or litigating the adequacy of the immaterial disclosures required by the Idaho statute. Moreover, disclosure will not be an effective means of encouraging corporate civic responsibility if the shareholders concentrate more on the economics of an offer than the civic attitudes of the offeror. This economic bias seems particularly likely when, as here, most of the shareholders are not Idahoans. <em>See generally, </em>Senate Hearings at 157 (statement of Mr. Schanch).</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-10\">Idaho could encourage good corporate citizenship with legislation more focused on that purpose. Health and safety regulations can be enacted. Tax incentives can encourage charitable contributions. Programs to involve local businessmen in civic problems can be created. These approaches would be likely to have a more direct impact on corporate behavior than increased disclosure in tender offers. They would also impose a substantially smaller burden on interstate commerce than the Idaho takeover law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-11\">Against this uncertain protection for the small percentage of Sunshine shareholders in whom Idaho has a substantial legitimate local interest, and the, at best, indirect and incidental preservation of corporate civic responsibility provided by fuller disclosure, we must weigh our conclusions about the impact of Idaho\u2019s takeover statute on interstate commerce. Idaho\u2019s extraterritorial regulation of tender offers interferes with securities transactions all over the country. In this case, Idaho\u2019s law halted over 31 million dollars of interstate commerce. In addition, Idaho\u2019s statute would have compelled a non-Idaho offeror to make burdensome disclosures beyond those required by federal law to Sunshine shareholders all over the world.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1380-12\">We conclude that these burdens are disproportionate to the legitimate benefits the Idaho takeover law provides. This conclusion is strengthened because another effect \u2014 perhaps unintended \u2014 of the Idaho statute is to hinder the movement of local businesses to other states. As a result, we agree with the district court that the Idaho takeover law is invalid under the commerce clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-5\">THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT</p>\n<p id=\"amo-dedup-2\">Great Western\u2019s final attack on the Idaho takeover law is that it violates due process because it delegates the legislative power to invoke the state regulatory provisions to private parties \u2014 the target\u2019s board of directors \u2014 without setting sufficient standards for the exercise of that authority. Although this theory is included in Great Western\u2019s original complaint, it was not addressed in the district court\u2019s opinion and was not pressed during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-6\">The anti-delegation doctrine reached its height in <em>Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, </em>1935, 295 U.S. 495, 55 S.Ct. 837, 79 L.Ed. 1570. Since <em>Schechter </em>delegations to private parties may have been viewed with some suspicion but <em>Schechter </em>has spawned few progeny. <em>See </em>K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 2.17 (1970 &amp; 1976 Supp.); L. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law </em>\u00a7 5.17 (1978). The delegation of authority in Idaho\u2019s takeover law does not contravene what remains of the principle. The fiduciary duties owed by corporate directors to their shareholders provide sufficient standards for the exercise of delegated power. The fiduciary duties imposed on Sunshine\u2019s directors came from Washington, rather than Idaho. Basie fiduciary duties are similar, however, in all the states and the Idaho legislature could legitimately rely upon those duties to guide target corporation directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-7\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-9\">The states have an important role in our system of securities regulation. We do not invalidate Idaho\u2019s attempt to supplement the Williams Act without careful consideration of all the arguments raised by the appellant and the amici. Nor are we unmindful that state experiments with regulation can be as useful in the subject of securities as in other areas. <em>See New State Ice Co. v. Liebman, </em>1932, 285 U.S. 262, 280, 52 S.Ct. 371, 76 L.Ed. 747 (Brandeis, J., dissenting). But, as Justice Brandeis pointed out, such experimentation should be \u201cwithout risk to the rest of the country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311, 52 S.Ct. at 387. The Idaho legislature, through its extraterritorial law, made the entire country its laboratory. The takeover statute had extensive, deliberate, and foreseeable effects on transactions having only a minimal connection with Idaho.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-12\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">.

To induce the shareholders to sell, the price usually includes a premium over the current market price of the target company\u2019s shares. Cash or other securities may be offered to the shareholders as consideration. An offer is made for a limited period of time only. An offeror may offer to buy all tendered shares, or it may offer to buy only a stated number. In general, the offeror also sets a minimum number of shares that must be tendered before he will buy any shares. The Williams Act regulates transactions other than orthodox tender offers. <em>See, e. g., </em>Aranow, Einhorn &amp; Berlstein, <em>Developments in Tender Offers for Corporate Control </em>1-34 (1977). Indeed, neither Congress nor the SEC has attempted to define the term \u201ctender offer\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-12\">A tender offer may be used either to acquire control of a company or for nontakeover purposes. Recently, most tender offers have been for the purpose of gaining control over the target.

This discussion is to satisfy those who insist that the <em>Hanson v.

It is possible to envision a role for Texas in the enforcement of Idaho\u2019s statute. As the dissent points out, this role becomes an active one only if Idaho tries to enforce its law in certain circumstances, such as against Texas defendants who refuse to leave Texas and return to Idaho. The dissent\u2019s major objection to this discussion is that it makes the <em>Hanson v. Denckla </em>requirement too easy to satisfy, not that it is impossible to envision a role for Texas in the enforcement of Idaho\u2019s law. The dissent fears that governors, state prosecutors, and other state regulatory officials will be subject to countless out-of-state civil suits simply because they might at one time rely upon another state\u2019s extradition procedures for the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution. Governors, state prosecutors and other state regulatory officials need fear no such outcome from the majority opinion. That a defendant in some manner benefits from a state\u2019s laws does not <em>automatically </em>mean that <em>International Shoe\u2019s </em>due process requirements are satisfied. That benefit is only one factor for a court to consider, and it is a factor to discount if the benefit is attenuated or speculative.

One difficulty with the SEC\u2019s construction of the statute is that the sentence of \u00a7 27 establishing jurisdiction and venue over suits to enforce a duty created by the 1934 Act refers back to the preceding sentence that is cast in terms of \u201cviolations\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1366-13\">.

The district court erred, in our opinion, by-analyzing the alleged violation as a restraint upon Sunshine shareholders who would have tendered rather than as interference with Great Western\u2019s plans.

We disagree with the appellant that \u00a7 28 sets forth a different test from the test required by the supremacy clause. Nevertheless, we should point out that <em>Jones v.

In <em>Jones, </em>the Court interpreted a provision of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461 (1970), to explicitly pre-empt state law only when compliance with state law would automatically trigger federal enforcement action. 430' U.S. at 540, 97 S.Ct. 1305. The California statute challenged in the <em>Jones </em>litigation was not preempted under that standard. <em>Id. </em>The Court went on, however, to apply <em>Hines </em>to the California law, and ruled that under <em>Hines </em>the state law was invalid. 430 U.S. at 543, 97 S.Ct. 1305. <em>See also </em>Note, <em>Pre-emption as a Preferential Ground: A New Canon of Construction, </em>12 Stan.L.Rev. 208, 212-15 (1959) where the author discusses how the courts have paid slight attention to general savings clauses in pre-emption cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-11\">In addition, \u00a7 28 arguably does not apply to state takeover statutes. Section 28 was part of the original 1934 Act. It was designed to preserve state Blue Sky laws, which were well established before 1934. In contrast, when Congress enacted the Williams Act only Virginia had a takeover law, and it was enacted just before Congress passed the bill. There is no mention of state legislation in the Senate or House hearings. When subsequent state legislation is not of substantially the same character as the laws Congress intended to save, the savings clause may not save the subsequent state laws. <em>See </em>Langevoort, <em>State Tender-Offer Legislation: Interests, Effects, and Political Competence, </em>62 Cornell L.Q. 213, 247 (1977) and sources cited therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b1369-12\">.

If so, the ten day period of \u00a7 14(d)(6), the provision requiring an officer to purchase on a pro rata basis the shares tendered during the first ten days of an offer if too many shares are tendered, would begin. Idaho has a similar provision, Idaho Code 30-1506(3), but its ten day period begins only after the offer is effective under Idaho law. As a result, the Williams Act rights of a shareholder tendering during the first ten days of the federal counting period might be diluted. <em>See </em>Ara-now, Einhorn &amp; Berlstein, <em>Developments in Tender Offers for Corporate Control </em>227 (1977). A similar argument can be made about withdrawal privileges. Section 14(d)(5) and Idaho Code 30-1506(2) both make tenders irrevocable between the eighth and sixtieth day of an offer.

Congress could have relied upon state created fiduciary duties. Indeed, in this case Idaho would be relying upon fiduciary duties not created by her law, but by the law of the State of Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-19\">In general, a state legislature may be entitled to assume that the directors and officials of a target company will honor their fiduciary obligations. It would not be surprising, however, if another legislative body declined to make the same assumption. To establish a claim under state law, a shareholder usually must overcome a presumption that directors act properly, and prove that they acted in self interest. Few plaintiffs have successfully met this burden. <em>See, e. g., Cheff v. Mathes, </em>Del., 1964, 41 Del.Ch. 494, 199 A.2d 548; <em>Kors v. Carey, </em>Del., 1960, 39 Del.Ch. 47, 158 A.2d 295.

Changing economic conditions may have disrupted the balance that Congress struck in the Williams Act. But, it is for Congress \u2014 not Idaho \u2014 to determine if adjustments in the federal balance are necessary, and if so, what adjustments should be made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b1374-7\">. We are not persuaded by the appellant\u2019s argument that Idaho\u2019s takeover statute is analogous to the state laws governing internal corporate matters and fundamental corporate changes such as mergers, that traditionally have co-existed with federal securities regulation. First, the law of Washington governs the internal affairs of Sunshine, so even if this argument had validity it would not justify Idaho\u2019s regulation of the Great Western tender offer. See, e. g., Langevoort, 62 Cornell L.Q. at 222-23. <em>Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Sobieski, </em>1961, 191 Cal.App.2d 399, 12 Cal.Rptr. 719, does not strengthen Idaho\u2019s position. In <em>Western Air Lines </em>the court allowed California to assert some control over the internal affairs of a Delaware corporation. California had an unusually strong interest in the corporation, however, because over fifty percent of its shareholders were California citizens. <em>See </em>Reese &amp; Kaufman, <em>The Law Governing Corporate Affairs: Choice of Law and the Scope of Full Faith and Credit, </em>58 Colum.L.Rev. 1118, 1119-20 (1958). In contrast, only about two percent of Sunshine\u2019s shareholders live in Idaho.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-11\">Second, a tender offer involves the sale of securities from one shareholder to another, not a change in the corporation itself. The voting rights of shares and the legal relationship between a corporation and its shareholders does not change because of a tender offer. Although a tender offer can be a substitute for a proxy contest, there are important distinctions between the two. In a proxy contest the existing shareholder transfers only his vote; the other aspects of his existing relationship with the corporation remain. A tendering shareholder severs the existing relationship completely. Note, <em>Commerce Clause Limitations upon State Regulation of Tender Offers, </em>47 S.Cal.L.Rev. 1133, 1154 (1974). <em>See also </em>Senate Hearings at 118 (statements of Prof. Mund-heim and Prof. Kaplan). Statutes regulating the internal affairs of a corporation concern the existing relationship between a corporation and its shareholders. Since at the beginning of a tender offer the offeror may be a potential shareholder only, laws governing the offeror\u2019s conduct are not logically based on control of internal corporate affairs.

Part of this argument is linked to the appellant\u2019s contention that in \u00a7 28 Congress consented to the Idaho statute. We have already rejected that contention. The appellant also argues against applying <em>Pike </em>because the analysis adopted in <em>Brotherhood </em>is more deferential to state law than the analysis enunciated in <em>Pike. Pike, </em>however, refines <em>Brotherhood, </em>not vice versa. <em>See Dixie Dairy Co. v. City of Chicago, </em>7 Cir. 1976, 538 F.2d 1303, 1308. Moreover, commentators have pointed out that <em>Brotherhood </em>is, at least in part, inconsistent with other recent commerce clause decisions. <em>E. g., </em>G. Gunther at 311. <em>Brotherhood </em>may still stand for the proposition that <em>Pike </em>balancing is inappropriate when the benefit of state legislation and the burden on interstate commerce are non-comparable. <em>See American Can Co. v. Oregon Liquor Control Commission, </em>Or.App. 1973, 517 P.2d 691; <em>Procter and Gamble Co. v. City of Chicago, </em>7 Cir. 1975, 509 F.2d 69. <em>But see Dixie Dairy Co. v. City of Chicago, </em>538 F.2d at 1308 (explaining <em>Procter and Gamble). </em>Any such principle is not relevant in this case because both the benefits of the regulation and the burden on commerce are economic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b1377-6\">.

Fed. R.Civ.P. 4(e); <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(d)(7). The Texas long-arm statute provides for service on a nonresident natural person doing business in Texas in any action arising out of such business. Tex.Civ.Stat. art. 2031b \u00a7 2. \u201cDoing business\u201d is defined to include entering into a contract to be performed in whole or part in Texas or the commission of a tort in whole or part in Texas. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4. Courts have often characterized this statute as an effort by the Texas lawmakers to provide personal jurisdiction to the full extent due process allows. <em>E. g., Jetco Electronic Industries, Inc. v. Gardiner, </em>473 F.2d 1228, 1234 (C.A.5, 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-5\">The due process inquiry into personal jurisdiction is centrally concerned with the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation. <em>Shaffer v. Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186, 204, 97 S.Ct. 2569, 2580, 53 L.Ed.2d 683, 698 (1977). The interests of the forum state and of the plaintiff in the action\u2019s proceeding in that forum should be considered. <em>Kulko v. Superior </em>Court,-U.S. -, 98 S.Ct. 1690, 56 L.Ed.2d 132, 141 (1978). But due process essentially requires that the defendant have such contacts with the forum state as make it reasonable, in the context of our federal system of government, to require the defendant to defend the particular suit brought there. Whether it is reasonable depends upon the nature and quality of the defendant\u2019s activity. <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 319, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95, 104 (1945). The activity must show that the defendant has purposefully availed himself of the benefits and protection of the forum state\u2019s laws. <em>Hanson v. Denckla, </em>357 U.S. 235, 253, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 1239, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283, 1298 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-11\">In this case due process would not allow a Texas court to exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendant. First, the defendant has not purposefully availed himself of the benefits and protection of Texas law. Second, the defendant\u2019s only contacts with Texas are the effects of its regulation that were felt in Texas, and these effects are of a different nature and more attenuated quality than will support personal jurisdiction. Third, the State of Texas lacks any interest in this action\u2019s proceeding in a Texas forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-12\">1. Benefits and protection of the forum state\u2019s laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-13\">Due process requires that the defendant have purposefully availed himself of the benefits and protection of Texas law. The majority speculate that this requirement should not be understood literally but assert that in any event the requirement has been met. I believe the requirement means what it says. And the majority\u2019s assertion that in any event the requirement has been met lacks substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-14\">Recent cases affirm the vitality of the requirement that the defendant have purposefully availed himself of the benefits and protection of the forum state\u2019s laws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The majority argue the requirement means only that the plaintiff\u2019s unilateral activity is insufficient to support personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Certainly the requirement expresses this notion, <em>see Hanson v. Denckla, </em>357 U.S. at 253, 78 S.Ct. at 1239, 2 L.Ed.2d at 1298, but the language of benefits and protection is not surplusage. Rather it embodies the idea that it is in part the defendant\u2019s enjoyment of the benefits and protection of a state\u2019s laws that makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>it fair to require the defendant to appear in the state\u2019s courts. <em>See International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>326 U.S. at 319, 66 S.Ct. at 159, 90 L.Ed. at 103. The Supreme Court has treated the language of benefits and protection as a literal requirement. For example, in <em>Kulko </em>the Court specifically examined whether the defendant had enjoyed the benefits and protection of the forum state\u2019s laws and found he had not. -U.S.-, 98 S.Ct. at 1698 &amp; n. 7, 56 L.Ed.2d at 132 &amp; n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-7\">The majority say that even if the requirement means what it says it has been met. In part they speculate:</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-8\">If Great Western had failed to comply with the Idaho takeover law, and the Idaho officials had obtained criminal sanctions, no doubt the state officials would have expected Texas to honor those criminal judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-9\">But Idaho could not obtain criminal judgments without first obtaining personal jurisdiction over the criminal defendants, and once it had personal jurisdiction Idaho could enforce the judgments without Texas having to honor anything. At most Texas\u2019s cooperation would be limited to Idaho\u2019s seeking extradition of the criminal defendants under the United States Constitution, art. 4, \u00a7 2, cl. 2, on the ground they are \u201cfugitives,\u201d or under the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act on the ground that, though not fugitives, the defendants are charged with committing an act \u201cintentionally resulting in crime\u201d i.n Idaho. Tex.Code Crim. Proc. art. 51.13, \u00a7 6. Perhaps this provision would apply to the hypothetical prosecution by Idaho. Nevertheless the possibility that sometime in the future a state may seek extradition of criminal defendants does not cause officials of the putative demanding state to be at the present time purposefully availing themselves of the benefits and protection of the other state\u2019s laws.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1383-11\">2. Nature and quality of defendant\u2019s contacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-12\">Due process requires that the nature and quality of defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum state be such that it is reasonable to require the defendant to defend the particular suit brought there. Because defendant has conducted no activities in Texas, defendant\u2019s only possible contacts are the effects of Idaho\u2019s regulation felt by Great Western in Texas. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Kulko </em>is instructive. The state court had justified its exercise of jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant in an action for child support by relying on the defendant\u2019s having caused an \"effect in the state. This is similar to the majority\u2019s reliance upon the defendant\u2019s having caused an effect in Texas. In <em>Kulko </em>the Supreme Court concluded that jurisdiction based solely on causing an effect in the state was unreasonable where the cause of action arose from neither the defendant\u2019s causing physical injury in the state nor his commercial transactions in interstate commerce.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The effect alone was an insufficient contact. Although <em>Kulko </em>itself dealt with a different factual setting, the reasoning in the opinion leads to the conclusion that in this case jurisdiction based solely on causing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>an effect is also unreasonable. As in <em>Kul-ko, </em>today\u2019s case concerns neither tortious conduct nor commercial transactions on the defendant\u2019s part.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Of course, the defendant\u2019s activity, whatever its situs, ultimately impacted on the plaintiff\u2019s commercial activity. Idaho\u2019s regulation affected Great Western\u2019s tender offer. But the due process issue turns on the nature and quality of the defendant\u2019s contacts in the forum, not the plaintiff\u2019s activity in the forum and elsewhere. Idaho\u2019s contacts in Texas have a different nature and a more attenuated quality than support jurisdiction under the minimum-contacts case law<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-4\">3. The state\u2019s interest. \u201c</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-5\">The due process analysis should also consider the interest of the forum state. In this case -Texas lacks any interest that would justify the exercise, of. its jurisdiction. The nature of defendant\u2019s conduct points to this problem. The Texas long-arm statute explicitly covers only tortious conduct and commercial transactions, and almost all the Fifth Circuit cases cited by the majority concern either tortious co nduct or commercial transactions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The state has a definite interest in tortious conduct because state law deems such conduct wrongful. The state also has an interest in commercial transactions because state law governs the transactions. But the state\u2019s interest in other nontortious conduct varies, <em>see </em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7\u00a7 36-37 (Comments), so it is necessary to find a particular basis in state law for the state\u2019s interest in exercising jurisdiction. <em>Compare Kulko, Part III. </em>In today\u2019s case there is no basis in state law that would give the state an interest in exercising jurisdiction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>4. The majority\u2019s effects test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-4\">Additionally I have difficulty with the majority\u2019s effects test. This test, as the majority articulate it, could apply broadly to many types of state regulation. I suggest this difficulty points to the i\u2019nappropri-ateness of premising personal jurisdiction on the effects caused by state regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-5\">The broad possible application of the majority\u2019s effects test is evident from an examination of other state regulation of corporate activities, such as qualification to do business, insurance regulation and Blue Sky laws. When a state engages in such regulation, another state will not have judicial jurisdiction over the regulating state\u2019s officials merely because the regulation causes, or can be expected to cause, extraterritorial effects. Yet these are examples of state regulations that require sometimes extensive or burdensome compliance and apply to corporations that are often incorporated by other states, headquartered out of state, and owned by nonresidents. There are also abundant examples of state regulations that less directly regulate corporate activities yet have great extraterritorial effects. For example, California\u2019s strict requirements for automobile pollution devices have an immense (and foreseeable) impact on auto makers. But GM cannot sue the California regulators in Michigan simply because the California law has its effect there. Similarly, state laws regulating many phases of commerce will often be directed primarily at out-of-state corporations and thus have extraterritorial effects. Food purity laws are one example. Yet the extraterritorial effects are insufficient to support personal jurisdiction over those state officials charged with enforcing the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-6\">The majority leave unclear what is the exact effects test that they use. They stress that Idaho\u2019s regulation foreseeably caused effects in Texas.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The effects they specify were Great Western\u2019s efforts to comply with the regulation and the restraint of Great Western from its plan. But the majority recede from a test of foreseeably causing effects. They emphasize that \u201cthe crucial conclusion . is not that the actions of the Idaho defendant under the Idaho takeover law had a \u2018practical effect\u2019 in Texas, but that they amounted to the regulation of Great Western\u2019s Texas-based business activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-10\">If this is the majority\u2019s test, then the examples I have given above could also be said to amount to the regulation of business activities based out of state. The majority suggest the examples can be distinguished away because of what they term \u201cthe con-cededly unique characteristics of state takeover laws such as Idaho\u2019s.\u201d They say, \u201cIn none of the examples ... is there a comparable lack of <em>any </em>connection between all parties to a transaction, as well as the transaction itself, and the regulating state.\u201d To the contrary, Idaho\u2019s statute \u2014 and state takeover laws such as Idaho\u2019s \u2014 do indeed have <em>some </em>connection, possibly very substantial connection, with what they seek to regulate. First, the state will have a connection with some of the offerees, and not as a fortuity. It is reasonable to expect that many possible target companies covered by state takeover laws are held partially or largely by in-state shareholders. Second, the state has a connection to the transaction itself because the transaction in securities is ultimately one involving the target company\u2019s business and properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-11\">It is difficult to separate the majority\u2019s jurisdictional test from a substantive inquiry into the reasonableness of the statute. The only tenable distinction between state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>takeover laws such as Idaho\u2019s and the examples of other state regulations having extraterritorial effects depends entirely on an anticipation of the majority\u2019s Commerce Clause holding, namely, that these statutes are invalid under the Commerce Clause. <em>See </em>note 37 to the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-4\">C. <em>Subject-matter jurisdiction under the Securities Exchange Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1386-5\">Subject-matter jurisdiction under the Securities Exchange Act requires that a plaintiff\u2019s action be brought either to enforce a liability or duty created by the Act or to enjoin a violation of the Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In this case subject-matter jurisdiction is lacking because plaintiff\u2019s action concerns none of these things.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-6\">The majority conclude that \u00a7 28(a) impliedly prohibits a state official from enforcing a statute that conflicts with the 1934 Act. This is a dubious reading of \u00a7 28(a), which simply says,</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-7\">Nothing in this chapter shall affect the jurisdiction of the securities commission (or any agency or officer performing like functions) of any State over any security or any person insofar as it does not conflict with the provisions of this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-11\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78bb(a) (1970). Section 28(a) immediately follows \u00a7 27\u2019s grant of exclusive jurisdiction. On its face \u00a7 28(a) provides that a state securities commission\u2019s jurisdiction is unaffected by the grant of exclusive jurisdiction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The proviso guards against the section\u2019s being read too broadly \u2014 federal law will still preempt conflicting state law. But this proviso does not impose a liability for the enactment or enforcement of preempted state law, it does not create a duty to refrain from such conduct, and it does not make such conduct a violation of the Act. Certainly it does not do so expressly, and the majority recognize as much.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-12\">Section 28(a) also does not impliedly impose a liability, create duty or define a violation, at least not in any sense that \u00a7 27 comprehends. Section 28(a), like the sections with which it is grouped, does not effect any positive regulation. It creates neither rights nor remedies. State legislation and regulation can of course be invalidated on Supremacy Clause grounds, but \u00a7 27\u2019s conferral of subject-matter jurisdiction simply does not encompass Supremacy Clause cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>The majority point to \u00a7 16(b) cases to show that a violation for the purposes of \u00a7 27 need not be a criminal violation. I agree that \u00a7 27 may include civil violations. <em>See </em>note 10 <em>supra. </em>The majority\u2019s example also provides a useful counterpoint to this case to show what is an implied violation in the sense that \u00a7 27 comprehends. As the majority note, the Securities Exchange Act does not directly forbid short-swing trading by insiders. But the Act expressly creates a right in a corporation to recover any profit realized by an insider\u2019s short-swing trading in the corporation\u2019s stock. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78p(b) (1970). The implied violation is derived from this positive regulation. The insider\u2019s liability is simply the other side of the right created in the corporation by the profit recapture provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-5\">D. <em>Personal jurisdiction under \u00a7 27.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1387-6\">Section 27 provides for nationwide service: \u201c[Pjrocess in such cases may be served in any other district of which the defendant is an inhabitant or wherever the defendant may be found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-7\">I agree with the majority that if service were proper under the Texas long-arm statute, personal jurisdiction was of course obtained for the purposes of \u00a7 27. But if, as I have concluded,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the reach of the long-arm statute does not extend to grasp the defendant in this case, two unresolved questions would have to be reached: First, was the manner of service proper under the federal rules?<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Second, was the extradis-trict service consistent with due process?<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because I conclude that in today\u2019s case \u00a7 27 does not confer subject-matter jurisdiction,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> I see no need to answer these controversial questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-12\">II. Venue</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-13\">A. <em>Venue under \u00a7 27.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1387-14\">Section 27 provides for venue in any district wherein any act or transaction constituting the violation occurred or in the district wherein the defendant is found or is an inhabitant or transacts business.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because the Northern District of Texas is not a district where the defendant is found, is an inhabitant or does business, venue will be proper only if an act or transaction constituting the violation occurred in the district.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The majority conclude that the \u201crestraining effect\u201d of Idaho\u2019s regulatory activities was a venue-conferring act. This hasty equation of effect with act deserves greater scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-15\">The only case I find which directly supports the theory that an effect may be an act under \u00a7 27\u2019s language is <em>Travis v. Anthes Imperial Limited, </em>473 F.2d 515, 528-29 (C.A.8, 1973). One claim in that case dealt with conduct occurring in Canada that the court said had a foreseeable effect in the United States. The court first determined that the foreseeable effect was sufficient to make the exercise of jurisdiction reasonable. The court then determined that venue for this claim \u201clies in the [forum] district because [there] is where the consequences of the Canadian action were felt and where some acts and transactions constituting the violation occurred.\u201d Because the court found not only effects but acts and transactions in the forum district,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>its reference to effects was an unnecessary makeweight. The case is at best weak authority for the majority\u2019s theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">Many cases have held venue proper in situations where the defendant had never physically been in the forum district. Because the possibility of venue under such circumstances is broadly supportive of the majority\u2019s conclusion, the cases warrant investigation. In <em>Hooper v. Mountain States Securities Corp., supra </em>note 10, we held that defendant\u2019s telephone call, which plaintiff received in the forum district, followed by plaintiff\u2019s transfer of funds from the same district, made venue proper. Similarly, in <em>Hilgeman v. National Insurance Co. of America, supra </em>note 13, we held that venue was proper in the forum district when the defendant sent a premium notice by mail to the district and plaintiff paid by a check drawn in the district. Decisions by other courts are similar. For example, venue has been held proper in the district where a fraudulent press release was transmitted, <em>Texas Gulf Sulphur Co. v. Ritter, </em>371 F.2d 145 (C.A.10, 1967) (when followed by plaintiff\u2019s sale of stock through a broker in the district), and the district where allegedly false proxy material was mailed to a shareholder, <em>Mayer v. Development Co. of America, </em>396 F.Supp. 917 (D.Del.1975).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Though these cases at first blush seem helpful to the majority\u2019s position, closer examination shows that they do not support a construction of \u00a7 27 that reads act to mean effect. All the cases can be confined to the rule they purport to apply \u2014 namely, the transmission or reception of any interstate communication supports venue in the forum district. The majority\u2019s view of today\u2019s case falls outside the rule these cases have applied. The effect felt because of regulatory activities is entirely different from the reception of an interstate transmission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-5\">Another case finding venue proper when the defendant had never physically been in the forum district involved a failure to timely file a report required by federal law. <em>Investors Funding Corp. of New York </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>161 U.S.App.D.C. 420, 495 F.2d 1000 (1974). The court, relying on analogous cases outside securities law, held that venue was properly laid in the district where the report was required to be filed. The rationale developed by the court was closely tied to the mechanics of filing, so this case also \u2022 offers no effective support for the majority\u2019s theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-12\">In sum, though venue under \u00a7 27 has in some circumstances been held proper even when the defendant had never physically been in the forum district, the cases construing \u00a7 27 do not support the majority\u2019s approach of regarding conduct elsewhere as occurring where it has an effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-13\">The majority alternatively note that \u201cIdaho officials sent at least one interstate letter into Texas as part of their regulatory efforts.\u201d The letter was signed by Melvin Baptie, Deputy Administrator-Securities of the State of Idaho\u2019s Department of Finance and an assistant of defendant McEldowney, Director of the Department of Finance. The letter was a nontrivial part of Idaho\u2019s enforcement of its statute. Thus, if \u00a7 27 were to confer subject-matter jurisdiction, I would agree that venue is proper under the rule we have followed in <em>Hooper </em>and <em>Hilge-man.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1388-14\">B. <em>Venue under the general venue statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1388-15\">The applicable general venue statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b), provides that venue is proper \u201conly in the judicial district where all defendants reside, or in which the claim arose, except as otherwise provided by law.\u201d I agree with the majority that the claim arose in the Northern District of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>The provision for venue where the claim arose serves two possible purposes. The provision ensures that in multiple-defendant actions venue will always be proper in at least one district. <em>See Brunette Machine Works, Ltd. v. Kockum Industries, Inc., </em>406 U.S. 706, 710 n. 8, 92 S.Ct. 1936, 1939, 32 L.Ed.2d 428, 431 n. 8 (1972). Also the provision will sometimes provide a forum that is more convenient for litigants and witnesses. <em>See </em>1966 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News p. 3694.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-5\">The place where the claim arose need not be the same as the place of the defendant\u2019s conduct. The venue provision replaced an earlier provision allowing a civil action for many automobile-related tort claims to be brought where \u201cthe act or omission complained of occurred.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(f) (repealed 1966). The new provision\u2019s different language evidences a congressional understanding that the place\u2019 where the claim arose may be different than the place of the conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-12\">There is room for disagreement whether it is better to apply a place-of-injury test, such as courts have tended to use with tort claims<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and the majority apparently use in today\u2019s case,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> or a weight-of-the-contacts test, such as courts have preferred in more complex cases.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Because the alleged injury was felt in several places \u2014 both by the of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>feror and the many offerees \u2014 the place-of-injury test is inexact. I would prefer the weight-of-the-contacts test, but either test, when applied in light of the statutory purposes of facilitating multiple-defendant suits and promoting ' litigational convenience, establishes that venue was proper in the Northern District of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-4\">III. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-5\">Should jurisdiction exist and venue be proper, I would agree with the majority that Idaho\u2019s takeover statute is preempted by federal law. Although the Williams Act does not expressly preempt state law, the Act regulates tender offers through a policy of deliberate neutrality .among takeover contestants. The Idaho statute increases the target company\u2019s ability to resist an undesired takeover and thus upsets the careful balance struck by Congress. I would agree also that the statute is invalid under the Commerce Clause because the burden on interstate commerce exceeds the legitimate local interest served by the statute.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1390-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-7\">Whether the Williams Act preempts state law and whether state takeover statutes may be invalid under the Commerce Clause are important national issues not previously-decided by a court of appeals. But the sweep of federal jurisdiction and venue are also important, in the long haul perhaps more important. Jurisdiction and venue in the- Northern District of Texas have been dubious, and fought over, in this case from the beginning. These threshold issues should not be submerged in this court in a rush to the merits, by the confecting of new and strained theories of jurisdiction and venue that will create new and vexing national and state problems and diminish the strength of the merits decision. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1381-10\">. As I read the majority\u2019s opinion they do not reach the question whether 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337 would also confer subject-matter jurisdiction, and of course it is unnecessary to answer that question in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1382-8\">. We recently found no personal jurisdiction under the Texas long-arm statute in <em>Barnstone v. Congregation Am Echad, </em>574 F.2d 286, p. 289 (C.A.5, 1978), because \u201cthe defendant has neither transacted any purposeful activity within the State of Texas nor has it invoked the benefits and protection of the laws of Texas , . . .\u201d The Supreme Court, when it found no minimum contacts in <em>Shaffer </em>v. <em>Heitner, </em>433 U.S. at 216, 97 S.Ct. at 2587, 53 L.Ed.2d at 705, specifically said that the defendants in that case had not availed themselves of the privilege of conducting activities in Delaware in a way that would justify bringing them before a Delaware tribunal. Even more recently the Supreme Court concluded that the defendant in <em>Kulko </em>had not purposefully derived any benefit from any activities relating to the State of California which would justify that state\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1383-13\">. Moreover it seems incorrect to treat this wispy possibility as a jurisdictional factor. I think the majority recognize the insubstantiality of what they call a benefit. They suggest the benefit factor should be discounted when the \u201cbenefit\u201d is attenuated and speculative (but without actually discounting the factor in this case). <em>See </em>note 28 to majority opinion. It is true the presence of a benefit alone does not satisfy the minimum-contacts test. Other criteria must be met as well. All the same, the \u201cbenefit\u201d the majority see suggests that governors, state prosecutors, and state regulatory officials charged with enforcing state laws concerning a multitude of corporate activities are daily subjecting themselves to the reach of civil suits with long-arm service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-15\"><em>But cf. Maney v. Ratcliff, </em>399 F.Supp. 760 (E.D.Wis.1975) (solicitation of arrest and representation that extradition would be sought held purposeful availing of the benefits of state law in \u00a7 1983 civil rights action).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1383-16\">. The Supreme Court recognized that the effects test the state court used was derived from the ALI\u2019s Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 37 (1971), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-17\">\u201cA state has power to exercise judicial jurisdiction over an individual who causes effects in the state by an act done elsewhere with respect to any cause of action arising from these effects unless the nature of the effects and of the individual\u2019s relationship to the state make the exercise of such jurisdiction unreasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1384-6\">. The majority\u2019s argument that \u201cIdaho\u2019s \u2018business\u2019 is to regulate\u201d confuses a pun with analysis. It is true that a state government may at times engage in commercial activities, but the regulatory activities involved in this case do not present such an instance and cannot be made such by a semantical device.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1384-7\">. To support the effects test they use the majority refer to two district court opinions, saying, \u201cPersonal jurisdiction has been found to exist over price fixing conspirators whose illegal activities in one state were designed to control prices in the forum state.\u201d <em>Hitt v. Nissan Motor Co., </em>399 F.Supp. 838 (S.D.Fla. 1975), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>552 F.2d 1088 (C.A.5, 1977), may not even hold what the majority read it to hold. Although the court noted that the defendant \u201csurely must have contemplated that any price-fixing it might have engaged in would have consequences extending into the forums,\u201d 399 F.Supp. at 848, the court also analogized price fixing to products liability and placed great weight on the defendant\u2019s causing products to be shipped to or sold by wholly owned subsidiaries in the forums. The court suggested that causing products to enter the stream of commerce might have been sufficient. In <em>Maricopa County v. American Petrofina, Inc., </em>322 F.Supp. 467 (N.D.Cal.1971), the court said, without much analysis, that the price-fixing conspiracy created a destructive force which caused events and effects in the forum state. In both <em>Hitt </em>and <em>Maricopa </em>the courts explicitly or implicitly justified jurisdiction by the similarity they perceived between price fixing and tortious conduct. This justification does not extend to today\u2019s case: a suit to enjoin the enforcement of state regulation bears little resemblance to a damages action sounding in tort.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1384-12\">. <em>See Wilkerson v.

For example, several decisions have held that Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(e) is available even in cases exclusively within federal question jurisdiction, <em>see </em>4 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00a7 1115 at 470 &amp; n.9, even though the state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>long-arm statute logically would not apply \u201cunder the circumstances\u201d because the state would lack an interest to justify its exercise of jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1385-8\">. A good exposition of a general effects test is Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws \u00a7 37. Although \u00a7 37 as formulated does not contain a foreseeability element, the official caveat notes that a state can seldom exercise judicial jurisdiction over an individual who causes effects in a state by an act done elsewhere when those effects were not foreseeable. Section 37, however, does not support the majority\u2019s position. Rather, \u00a7 37 notes the constitutional requirement that the nature of the individual\u2019s contacts with the state must be such that the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable, a requirement that is not met in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1386-8\">. Subject-matter jurisdiction and venue under . the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are both controlled by \u00a7 27, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa (1970), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-9\">\u201cThe district courts of the United States, and the United States courts of any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction of violations of this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder, and of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder.

They find personal jurisdiction under the Texas long-arm statute because of foreseeable effects on business activities in Texas. They find venue under \u00a7 27 because they regard the restraining effect of Idaho\u2019s regulation as an act in Texas. And they, find venue under \u00a7 1391(b) because they view the restraining effect as giving rise to the claim. It may be helpful to sort out the differences among these various effects tests. The personal jurisdiction effects test of course has an element of foreseeability and is limited to the regulation of business in Texas. The other effects tests lack similar qualifications. The \u00a7 1391(b) effects test requires Texas to be where the effects were primarily felt, because the majority follow the orthodox position that a claim arises in only one district (despite their criticism of this position). For the personal jurisdiction effects test and the \u00a7 27 effects test, it matters not whether the effects were primarily in Texas or the Northern District of Texas. It is enough that some effects were felt there.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1389-13\">. Antitrust cases applying this test include <em>Philadelphia Housing Authority v.

To touch the rest of the bases, I agree with the majority that the issues presented by this case are not moot. And at first glance I would agree that <em>Ex parte Young </em>does not preclude the suit\u2019s being brought outside Idaho. That landmark decision established simply that a state officer can be sued to enjoin his enforcement of state law and did not speak at all to the forum in which he can be sued. Indeed, the opinion suggests that the officer can be sued in any court \u201chaving jurisdiction, Federal or state,\u201d 209 U.S. at 165, 28 S.Ct. 441, 456, 52 L.Ed. at 731, and the logic of the opinion implies as much. On closer examination the problem is less simple. The majority premise jurisdiction in the federal district court on their conclusion that the action could have been brought in a Texas state court. The possibility of one state court passing judgment on another state\u2019s laws may reach the boundary where the doctrine of <em>Ex parte Young </em>is overshadowed by the policies of the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
