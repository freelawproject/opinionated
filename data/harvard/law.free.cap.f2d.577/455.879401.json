Cotton, Jr., appeals from three orders of the district court denying relief on his claims brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C.^ 1983. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Cotton is a state prisoner currently incarcerated in the Cummins Unit of the Arkansas Department of Corrections pursuant to a 1973 conviction for armed robbery. The three \u00a7 1983 petitions at issue here were filed in 1973 and 1974. The processing of these cases was held in abeyance pending decision in the <em>Finney v. Hutto, </em>410 F.Supp. 251 (E.D.Ark.1976), <em>affd, </em>548 F.2d 740 (8th Cir. 1977), class action litigation regarding the constitutionality of conditions of confinement in Arkansas Department of Correction penal institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">After the district court\u2019s opinion in <em>Fin-ney</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and this court\u2019s affirmance, the district court began deciding the numerous individual petitions. In three separate opinions, the district court determined that petitioner here was not entitled to any relief other than the injunctive relief already granted to him as a member of the <em>Finney </em>class. Petitioner timely filed notices of appeal from these orders, and the appeals have been consolidated for decision in this court. The primary issue on this appeal is whether the orders entered in the <em>Finney </em>class action litigation effectively dispose of all of petitioner\u2019s individual claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-17\">A judgment in a class action suit brought under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) is binding on all class members unless they can show that their interests were not adequately represented by the class representatives.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See generally </em>7A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1789 (1972).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-18\">We have carefully examined the many pleadings filed by petitioner. The majority of his claims seek injunctive and declaratory relief for a number of allegedly unconstitutional conditions and practices. Without delving into his claims in unnecessary factual detail, they relate to racial discrimination, inadequate food and overcrowding in the punitive isolation cells, inadequate medical care and facilities, interference with mail, religious and racial discrimination against Black Muslim inmates, brutality by prison employees, inadequate law library and access thereto, and failure to hire and promote blacks in the Department of Corrections.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Each of these claims was discussed in either <em>Finney </em>v. <em>Hutto, supra, </em>or <em>Holt v. Hutto, </em>363 F.Supp. 194 (E.D.Ark.1973). The district court found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>many of these practices and conditions to be unconstitutional and enjoined them. Other practices and conditions were held not to violate constitutional rights. In any event, the district court\u2019s decisions disposed of all of petitioner\u2019s claims for injunctive and declaratory relief and, as a member of the <em>Finney </em>and <em>Holt </em>classes, petitioner is bound by those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In addition to his claims for injunctive and declaratory relief, two of petitioner\u2019s pleadings sought money damages. In one action he sought $50,000 in damages from the warden, Terrell Don Hutto. This claim was based on petitioner allegedly being subjected to a disciplinary proceeding for failure to cut a \u201ctop knot,\u201d a hair style claimed to be part of a religious purification ritual. Assuming, without deciding, that this allegation states a claim for denial of First Amendment rights, his pleading fails to state a claim for relief against Hutto; his allegation is that the disciplinary action was instituted by one Birt Brogan, a prison guard, who is not named as a party. Hutto is not alleged to have had any knowledge of, or connection with, this incident. Thus, any attempt to obtain damages from Hutto is predicated on a respondeat superior theory which does not apply in \u00a7 1983 suits. <em>See, e. g., Rizzo v. Goode, </em>423 U.S. 362, 370-71, 96 S.Ct. 598, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976); <em>Duchesne v. Sugarman, </em>566 F.2d 817, 830 (2d Cir. 1977); <em>Hampton v. Holmesburg Prison Officials, </em>546 F.2d 1077, 1082 (3d Cir. 1976); <em>Sebastian v. United States, </em>531 F.2d 900, 904 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 856, 97 S.Ct. 153, 50 L.Ed.2d 133 (1976); <em>Williams v. Vincent, </em>508 F.2d 541, 546 (2d Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Petitioner\u2019s second claim for damages is against A. L. Lockhart, another prison official. This claim is based on two beatings which allegedly occurred in July 1974. The pleading alleges that Lockhart had personally beaten him on one of these occasions. However, in answer to interrogatories propounded by Lockhart petitioner stated that he was beaten by correctional officers \u201cwho are the subordinates of Respondent Lockhart[,] Said Respondent being responsible for the actions of his officers. .\u201d Thus, it is clear that his claim for damages against Lockhart, the only named defendant, is predicated solely on a respondeat superior theory, which, as we have noted, does not apply in \u00a7 1983 suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Accordingly, the orders of the district court are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-11\">. The Honorable J. Smith Henley, United States Circuit Judge, sitting by designation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b548-12\">. Petitioner\u2019s brief is largely directed to showing that practices enjoined in the <em>Finney v. Hutto, </em>410 F.Supp. 251 (E.D.Ark.1976), <em>affd, </em>548 F.2d 740 (8th Cir. 1977), litigation are continuing at Cummins. If these practices are indeed continuing, the proper remedy would be initiation of contempt proceedings in the district court. The record indicates that no such proceedings have been commenced in the district court and, accordingly, we do not consider petitioner\u2019s claims on these matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b548-19\">. Petitioner makes no allegation of inadequate representation in the <em>Finney </em>litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b548-20\">. Where a prisoner seeks damages for allegedly unconstitutional conditions of confinement, it has been held that he is not precluded by an earlier class action where only declaratory and injunctive relief were sought. <em>See Jones-Bey v. Caso, </em>535 F.2d 1360 (2d Cir. 1976). <em>But see International Prisoners\u2019 Union v. Rizzo, </em>356 F.Supp. 806 (E.D.Pa.1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b548-21\">. In No. 77-1851, a co-plaintiff, James 23X Brown, alleged that he was subjected to mistreatment at the Arkansas State Hospital. Brown has not appealed and we do not consider his claims for relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
