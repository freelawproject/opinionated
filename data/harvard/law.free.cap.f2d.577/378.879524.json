We reaffirm this circuit\u2019s position requiring strict adherence to Rule 11 and allowing deviation therefrom to be challenged in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. We reverse the district court\u2019s denial of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-25\">Charles Timmreck entered a plea of guilty to conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, on May 24, 1974, pursuant to a plea bargain which resulted in the dismissal of other charges pending against him. The district court inquired as to the voluntariness of the plea and informed Timmreck that he could be sentenced to as much as fifteen years confinement and a $25,000 fine, which he acknowledged understanding. The record does not reflect, however, that the court informed Timmreck, or that he otherwise knew, about the three year minimum mandatory special parole term that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) requires to be added to any other sentence meted out for the offense charged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court accepted the guilty plea and, on September 19, 1974, sentenced Timmreck to ten years in prison, a $5000 fine, and an additional special parole term of five years. No appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-26\">On August 11, 1976, Timmreck moved pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>vacate the sentence entered upon his guilty plea. \"The sole ground for the motion was that his plea had been accepted in violation of Rule 11 since he was not informed of the three year minimum mandatory special parole term that had to be added to whatever sentence he otherwise received. The district court agreed that such advice had not been given. It noted, however, that Timmreck had been sentenced to ten years confinement plus five years special parole, the total of which was within the fifteen years he had been told was possible, and that the $5000 fine was within the $25,000 limit explained to him. Because Timmreck\u2019s total actual sentence did not exceed the maximum outlined to him at the plea hearing, the district court found no fundamental unfairness and denied \u00a7 2255 relief on that basis. 423 F.Supp. 537 (E.D. Mich.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The holding of the district court is squarely contrary to <em>United States v. Wo-lak, </em>510 F.2d 164 (6th Cir. 1975). <em>See also United States v. Cunningham, </em>529 F.2d 884, 888 n. 2 (6th Cir. 1976). <em>Wolak, </em>legally indistinguishable from this cause, also involved a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate a sentence after a plea of guilty to a violation of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The district court in <em>Wolak </em>failed to explain to the defendant that a consequence of his guilty plea would be the imposition of at least a three year special parole term in addition to any custodial sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We held that the district court erred both in not explaining the mandatory nature of the special parole and in misstating the required three year minimum term. 510 F.2d at 166. It was \u201cour determination that, in order to comply with Rule 11, the district judge must inform a defendant of the minimum sentence, either custodial or parole where there is a mandatory minimum, and of any special limitations on parole or probation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We reversed the denial of the \u00a7 2255 motion and instructed the district court to vacate the sentence and permit the defendant to plead anew. The same result must obtain here.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">The district court was aware of our decision in <em>Wolak </em>but did not deem it controlling.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead, the court relied heavily upon several recent cases from other circuits, discussed <em>infra, </em>which have held that Rule 11 violations do riot entitle one to \u00a7 2255 relief unless the error was a \u201cfundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We decline to follow these cases which we consider contrary both to <em>Wolak </em>and relevant Supreme Court authority.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>The starting point for any Rule 11 case must be <em>McCarthy v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969). In <em>McCarthy, </em>the Supreme Court mandated strict compliance with Rule 11 before a district court can accept a guilty plea. The Court held \u201cthat prejudice inheres in a failure to comply with Rule 11, for noncompliance deprives the defendant of the Rule\u2019s procedural safeguards that are designed to facilitate a more accurate determination of the voluntariness of his plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471-72, 89 S.Ct. at 1173. The remedy required for a Rule 11 violation was allowing the defendant to plead anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In the wake of <em>McCarthy\u2019s </em>strict language, every circuit to address the issue through 1974 held that the very factual pattern presented here (/. e., failure to inform the defendant of the mandatory special parole term of \u00a7 841(b)) was a violation of Rule 11 which required vacation of the sentence entered upon the guilty plea. The cases also held this issue could be raised in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>Michel v. United States, </em>507 F.2d 461 (2d Cir. 1974);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Roberts v. United States, </em>491 F.2d 1236 (3d Cir. 1974); <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>483 F.2d 516 (8th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">After 1974, however, the results began to diverge. All circuits addressing the issue presented here continued to hold that failure to inform a defendant of the special parole term constitutes a violation of Rule 11, making vacation of sentence necessary if challenged on direct appeal. But the circuits have split on whether such a Rule 11 violation can be successfully challenged in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. Three circuits still allow a \u00a7 2255 movant to vacate his sentence and plead anew. <em>Bunker v. Wise, </em>550 F.2d 1155 (9th Cir. 1977);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Yazbeck, </em>524 F.2d 641 (1st Cir. 1975);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Wolak, </em>510 F.2d 164 (6th Cir. 1975). Five other circuits, including the second and eighth which had ruled otherwise before 1974, have opted for a different result. These courts have held that a \u00a7 2255 movant is entitled to vacation of his sentence only if he can demonstrate prejudice from the Rule 11 violation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Del Vec-chio v. United States, </em>556 F.2d 106 (2d Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>553 F.2d 63 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. den. </em>434 U.S. 834, 98 S.Ct. 122, 54 L.Ed.2d 96 (1977);<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>McRae v. United States, </em>540 F.2d 943 (8th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. den. </em>429 U.S. 1045, 97 S.Ct. 750, 50 L.Ed.2d 759 (1977);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Bell v. United States, </em>521 F.2d 713 (4th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. den. </em>424 U.S. 918, 96 S.Ct. 1121, 47 L.Ed.2d 324 (1976); <em>Bachner v. United States, </em>517 F.2d 589 (7th Cir. 1975). Section 2255 relief was denied in each of these cases since no prejudice was thought to exist when, like here, the defendant\u2019s actual sentence, including the special parole term, was within the maximum possible sentence specified at his plea hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">The reason for this sudden shift after 1974 was the decision that year of <em>Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 94 S.Ct. 2298, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974). <em>Davis </em>did not involve a guilty plea but rather dealt with \u00a7 2255 relief after a jury conviction. The Supreme Court held that a change in the law after conviction, and not just constitutional errors at trial, could serve as the basis for a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. The Court added a paragraph of dicta, however, which we reproduce here in full:</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">This is not to say, however, that every asserted error of law can be raised on a \u00a7 2255 motion. In <em>Hill v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 424, 429, 82 S.Ct. 468, 472, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962), for example, we held that \u201ccollateral relief is not available when all that is shown is a failure to comply with the formal requirements\u201d of a rule of criminal procedure in the absence of any indication that the defendant was prejudiced by the asserted technical error. We suggested that the appropriate inquiry was whether the claimed error of law was \u201ca fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice,\u201d and whether \u201c[i]t . . . presents] exceptional circumstances where the need for the remedy afforded by the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>is apparent.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 428, 82 S.Ct. [468] at 471 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court did not suggest that any line could be drawn on the basis of whether the claim had its source in the Constitution or in the \u201claws of the United States.\u201d 417 U.S. at 346, 94 S.Ct. at 2305.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">This paragraph has been seized upon by four of the five circuits requiring a \u00a7 2255 movant to show prejudice in order to vacate a sentence entered upon a plea of guilty taken in violation of Rule ll.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Del Vec-chio, </em>556 F.2d at 110; <em>Hamilton, </em>553 F.2d at 65; <em>McRae, </em>540 F.2d at 945; <em>Bachner, </em>517 F.2d at 591. It was also relied upon by the district court here. 423 F.Supp. at 539. These courts have held that the conceded Rule 11 error is not cognizable in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding when the defendant\u2019s total actual sentence is within that specified at the plea hearing. This is justified by reference to <em>Davis, </em>concluding that \u201cthe claimed error of law was [not] \u2018a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Del Vecchio, </em>556 F.2d at 110-11; <em>Hamilton, </em>553 F.2d at 66; <em>McRae, </em>540 F.2d at 945; <em>Bachner, </em>517 F.2d at 592-93. <em>See also Bell, </em>521 F.2d at 714-15 (harmless error analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">We are thus faced with the difficult task of reconciling the somewhat contradictory language of the Supreme Court in <em>McCarthy </em>and <em>Davis. </em>On the one hand, the Court said in its unanimous <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> decision in <em>McCarthy </em>that \u201cprejudice inheres in a failure to comply with Rule 11.\u201d 394 U.S. at 471, 89 S.Ct. at 1173. On the other hand, at first blush the Rule 11 violation at issue here does not seem to rise to the level of a \u201cfundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice.\u201d 417 U.S. at 346, 94 S.Ct. at 2305.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">Our decision is controlled, however, by our prior post-Davis decision in <em>Wolak.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Moreover, between <em>McCarthy </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number><em>Davis </em>we consider <em>McCarthy </em>more apposite to this cause. <em>McCarthy </em>was, as this, a Rule 11 case and the Supreme Court hinted at no exceptions to its policy of strict enforcement of Rule 11. The relevant paragraph in <em>Davis </em>was dicta which relied on <em>Hill </em>v. <em>United States, </em>368 U.S. 424, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962), which involved a violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(a) allowing a defendant to speak on his behalf before imposition of sentence. Admittedly <em>McCarthy </em>involved a direct appeal but if \u201cprejudice inheres in a failure to comply with Rule 11,\u201d then it must be cognizable in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. We reconcile <em>McCarthy </em>and <em>Davis </em>by holding that a Rule 11 violation is per se prejudicial and thus must be a \u201cfundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice.\u201d We feel that any other reconciling of the two cases which emphasizes <em>Davis </em>over <em>McCarthy </em>should come only from the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">We recognize that our decision \u201cerodes the principle of finality in criminal cases and may allow an obviously guilty defendant to go free because it is impossible, as a practical matter, to retry him,\u201d <em>Del Vecchio, </em>556 F.2d at 109 (footnote omitted), since memories fade and witnesses become unavailable over time. Finality is a salutary principle which should be furthered by the courts. <em>Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 71-72 &amp; 83-84, (Powell, J., concurring) 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977); <em>Henderson v. Kibbe, </em>431 U.S. 145, 154 n. 13, 97 S.Ct. 1730, 52 L.Ed.2d 203 (1977). Finality is best served, however, by insisting that guilty pleas be accepted properly initially rather than by narrowing the scope of collateral relief. The failure to preserve finality in this and similar cases must be laid squarely at the feet of the United States Attorneys and their assistants who fail to exercise the rather small degree of care necessary to comply with Rule ll.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Supreme Court said in <em>McCarthy </em>that one purpose of requiring strict adherence to Rule 11 was to \u201creduce the great waste of judicial resources required to process the frivolous attacks on guilty plea convictions that are encouraged, and are more difficult to dispose of, when the record is inadequate.\u201d 394 U.S. at 472, 89 S.Ct. at 1174. The large number of Rule 11 errors in the reported cases suggests that this admonition is not being heeded.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We hope that our ruling herein will motivate strict compliance with Rule 11 in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the cause is remanded with instructions to vacate the sentence entered upon the guilty plea and to allow Timmreck to plead anew.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-17\">. The three year minimum mandatory special parole term mandated by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) is unlike ordinary parole in that it must be tacked onto the end of any other sentence and does not take effect until the expiration of the primary sentence, including ordinary parole. See <em>Roberts v. United States, </em>491 F.2d 1236, 1237-38 (3d Cir. 1974); <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>483 F.2d 516, 518 (8th Cir. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b468-5\">. <em>Wolak </em>also involved the pre-1975 amendment version of Rule 11, which required only that the defendant plead \u201cvoluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.\u201d The result we reach here and that reached in <em>Wolak </em>are compelled a <em>fortiori </em>by new Rule 11, which specifically requires that the defendant understand \u201cthe nature of the charge to which the plea is offered, the mandatory minimum penalty provided by law, if any, and the maximum possible penalty provided by law.\u201d The three year minimum mandatory special parole term would affect both the mandatory minimum and maximum possible penalties. <em>See United States v. Yazbeck, </em>524 F.2d 641, 643 n. 1 (1st Cir. 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b468-6\">. As noted by the district court here, the district court in <em>Wolak </em>did mention the special parole term to the defendant at the plea hearing but incorrectly explained it when the defendant indicated he did not understand it. There can be no reasoned distinction, however, between an affirmative misstatement of the provisions of the special parole term and failure to disclose that it exists at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b468-12\">. The district court apparently felt <em>Wolak </em>was distinguishable from this cause. The district court gave no explanation, however, for ignoring similar language found in <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>529 F.2d 884, 888 n. 2 (6th Cir. 1976), even while quoting the relevant language in its entirety, 423 F.Supp. at 539 n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b468-13\">.

Given the frequency with which this issue arises and the severe split among the circuits, hopefully the Supreme Court will resolve this issue in the near future.

The district courts, of course, are also responsible for Rule 11 errors since Rule 11 is directly addressed to the court accepting the guilty plea. If the district court does not fully comply with Rule 11, the government attorney should realize this and take steps to insure the necessary colloquy is placed in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b471-13\">. \u201cThis case is another of the many we have had that attack a conviction on a guilty plea because the district judge allegedly failed to follow the directions of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11.\u201d <em>Del Vecchio, </em>556 F.2d at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">\u201cThese appeals challenging two guilty pleas and sentences thereon arise, like many others, from omissions by trial judges to advise a defendant at a hearing on a plea of guilty of special provisions of the federal narcotics laws relating to sentencing . . . .\u201d <em>Bachner, </em>517 F.2d at 590-91 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-16\">The above quoted sentences are the very first sentences in each of the above cases, suggesting the courts\u2019 frustration with this problem.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
