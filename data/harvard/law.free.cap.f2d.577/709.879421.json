We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-19\">Appellant D. H. Baldwin Co. (\u201cBaldwin\u201d) acquired the assets of Ormston Burns, Limited, a British manufacturer of guitars and amplifiers, in October 1965, changing the name of the British corporation to Baldwin-Burns, Limited (\u201cBurns\u201d). During 1967 and 1968, the managing director of Burns was Eugene G. Luken, a longtime employee of Baldwin, whose salary continued to be paid by Baldwin. Additionally, both the president and chairman of Baldwin served as directors of Burns. Baldwin was Burns\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>sole customer in the United States,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, at the time of the exportations, there were no other manufacturers in the United Kingdom producing guitars of comparable price or quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Luken testified that the prices at which the guitars were sold included production costs, overhead, and allowance for profit; that the prices charged to Baldwin were \u201cnegotiated\u201d and were not \u201cset\u201d by Baldwin; and that the difference' in prices charged to others, as opposed to Baldwin, was due to Burns\u2019 incurring no advertising or sales commission expenses for those sales.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Despite efforts to set its prices to reflect an allowance for profits, Burns realized losses on its United Kingdom and other foreign country sales, and profits were realized for only a short time on its sales to Baldwin. According to Luken, this was because the anticipated market for guitars never developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Before the Customs Court, Baldwin attempted to prove that export value,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as reflected by the invoice prices of the merchandise, was the correct value; also that the prices it paid fairly reflected the market value because those prices exceeded production costs, generated a profit for Burns, and resulted from \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d negotiations. The Customs Court recognized that the mere fact that export sales are made to a selected purchaser does not preclude a showing that the merchandise was \u201cfreely sold\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> within the statutory meaning of \u201cexport value.\u201d However, it said that export value must be determined from the market for export to the United States and that Baldwin\u2019s attempted use of third country sales and Burns\u2019 production costs had \u201cno bearing\u201d on export value, citing this court\u2019s decision in <em>J. L. Wood v. United States, </em>505 F.2d 1400, 62 CCPA 25, C.A.D. 1139 (1974). The court\u2019s crucial determination was that Baldwin had failed to prove that the invoice price of the goods fairly reflected market value because it failed to prove that the negotiations were at \u201carm\u2019s length.\u201d It said that the fact that the manager of the manufacturing subsidiary remained an employee of the importing parent was \u201cinconsistent with the degree of independence which must exist between two companies whose conduct in price negotiations is to serve as the sole justification for concluding the price agreed upon fairly reflects the market value of the merchandise.\u201d It particularly noted the absence of sales to unrelated purchasers in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">In our opinion in <em>J. L. Wood, supra, </em>505 F.2d at 1405, 62 CCPA at 32, we concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>that \u201cCongress clearly intended that export value be determined by considering only the exporting country\u2019s market for exportation to the United States and that sales at wholesale to exclusive or selected agents be used in determining export value if the prices fairly reflect the market value.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Citations omitted.) Baldwin urges that <em>J. L. Wood </em>should not be interpreted to preclude reference to cost data, home market sales, and third country sales in arriving at export value in the absence of sales for export to unrelated U.S. purchasers. It points to T.D. 76-118, 10 Cust.Bull. 206 (1976), as support for its argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">In T.D. 76-118, the Customs Service stated its interpretation of <em>J. L. Wood </em>as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">[WJhere there are sales to a related selected purchaser and to several unrelated selected purchasers, or merely sales to several unrelated selected purchasers at the same price, then it [the Customs Service] is bound to look only to the exporting country\u2019s market for exportation to the United States. .</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">The more difficult question is the position which should be taken when the \u201cnecessary market evidence\u201d is not available; <em>i. </em>e., when there are sales only to related selected purchasers,[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] or sales only to one unrelated selected purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">. Therefore, in those instances where the \u201cnecessary market evidence\u201d does not exist, the Customs Service is required to look to whatever other evidence might be available for comparison purposes. Such evidence might include, but is not necessarily limited to, any of the following: (1) circumstances of sales, e. <em>g., </em>the manner in which the price was determined; (2) the relative mark-ups of the exporter and the importer; (3) quantities and level of trade; (4) home market sales; (5) sales to third countries; or (6) cost of producing the merchandise. This evidence would be used only for comparison purposes, and if it does not lead to the acceptance of the price at which the goods are invoiced, it would not be used to establish a substitute export value. [10 Cust.Bull. 207-08.]</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">The brief for the Government offers the following explanation of the reason that the Customs Service issued T.D. 76-118:</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">What the Customs Service has done in T.D. 76-118 is in effect only to announce that administratively it will apply the <em>J. L. Wood </em>decision within the strict confines of <em>stare decisis </em>and decline to assume that this Court would bring the same analysis to bear upon distinctly different fact situations. Concretely, it assumes only that this Court, if presented with a situation in which sales are made only to \u201crelated\u201d selected purchasers or only to one unrelated selected purchaser, might still find evidence extrinsic to those sales prices (e. <em>g., </em>even the <em>bona fides </em>of the price negotiations) relevant to determining whether they \u201cfairly reflect the market value\u201d of that merchandise.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">We disagree with the position of the Customs Service set forth in T.D. 76-118 that, when the necessary market evidence is not available, it may look to evidence of home market sales, sales to third countries, or cost of producing the merchandise.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Our analysis in <em>J. L. Wood </em>of the legislative history of the Tariff Act of 1930 (\u201cAct\u201d) applies here. As we there pointed out (505 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>F.2d at 1405 n. 13, 62 CCPA at 32 n. 13), export value requires that the price of the merchandise \u201cfairly reflects the market value\u201d \u2014 not that it reflect a <em>\u201cfair </em>market value.\u201d Thus, costs of production (factor 6 in T.D. 76-118) are irrelevant. It matters not, for purposes of determining export value, what the intrinsic value of the goods may be; what does matter is the price they can command in the market for export to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Similarly, reference to home market sales (factor 4 in T.D. 76-118) would result in a determination of foreign value which, as pointed out in <em>J. L. Wood, </em>Congress eliminated as a basis for valuation. (505 F.2d at 1405, 62 CCPA at 32.) Reference to third country sales (factor 5 in T.D. 76-118) is improper, because a proposal that export value be determined by considering exports to all countries, and not just the United States, was specifically rejected by Congress. (505 F.2d at 1405 n. 12, 62 CCPA at 32 n. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Our attention has not been directed to anything in the legislative history of the Tariff Act indicating Congressional intent that an exception to the manner of determining export value be made in the instance of sales to only a single related selected purchaser. Therefore, we conclude that reference to costs of production, home market sales, and third country sales would be improper<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that the Customs Court correctly refused to consider Baldwin\u2019s evidence on these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Nevertheless, the prohibition against the above evidence does not necessarily preclude establishing an export value. The language of section 402(f)(1)(B)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> indicates that Congress contemplated that an export value can be established for merchandise based on sales to a single selected purchaser if the price \u201cfairly reflects the market value of the merchandise.\u201d As we said recently in <em>Spanexico, Inc. v. United States, </em>542 F.2d 568, 571, 64 CCPA -, - C.A.D. 1176 (1976)\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">Appellant does not deny that, as a selected purchaser of . [the manufacturing exporter], it was obliged to show that the price it paid for the imported merchandise fairly reflected market value. In deciding whether such a showing has been made, we consider whether the sales were at arm\u2019s length and the evidence showing the relationship between appellant and [the manufacturing exporter]. .</p>\n<p id=\"b802-14\"><em>Accord, American Greiner Electronic, Inc. v. United States, </em>441 F.Supp. 915, 79 Cust.Ct. -, C.D. 4718 (1977); <em>National Carloading Corp. v. United States, </em>57 Cust.Ct. 758, 759, A.R.D. 215 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-17\">The relationship between Baldwin and Burns, its wholly owned subsidiary, was close. Burns\u2019 managing director was a longtime Baldwin employee, and his salary was paid by Baldwin. Directors of Burns included the president and the chairman of Baldwin. Baldwin initially advanced Burns \u00a390,000 and paid in advance for all the merchandise ordered from Burns.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Baldwin\u2019s witness, Eugene Luken, admitted that none of Burns\u2019 other customers paid in advance, but, rather, made payments on \u201cnormal receipt of merchandise terms.\u201d He also testified, in response to a question concerning any financial aid Baldwin gave to Burns, that these advance payments were a form of financial aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-18\">Mere testimony that the prices to Baldwin were \u201cnegotiated\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>managing director of Burns \u201cwas interested in making a go of the operation\u201d is not sufficient, considering such strong evidence of a close relationship, to establish that the prices fairly reflected market value. <em>See American Greiner Corp., supra, </em>441 F.Supp. at 920, 79 Cust.Ct. at -. Nor are we persuaded by the argument that the prices to Baldwin fairly reflected market value because such prices were all that the merchandise was \u201crealistically able to command.\u201d Absent such evidence as arm\u2019s length dealings between the parties, the invoice prices cannot establish the price a willing purchaser and seller would agree to in the market for exportation to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">In view of the foregoing, we hold that Baldwin failed to prove that use by the Government of constructed value as the basis for appraisement was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">The judgment of the Customs Court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-10\">.

Since the evidence showed that the price to selected purchasers \u2014 both related and unrelated to the seller \u2014 was the same, we agreed with the Customs Court that the price fairly reflected the market value.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b801-14\">. The case before us involves sales to only a single selected purchaser, one related to the seller.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b801-17\">. In seeming contradiction to T.D. 76-118, the Government\u2019s brief argues that \u201c [appellants\u2019 proof in this case\u201d with respect to manufacturing costs, home market prices, and third country prices (factors 4-6 in T.D. 76-118) \u201cis exactly of the type considered improper or irrelevant for purposes of determining export value in <em>J.

We note that the Customs Service, in T.D. 76-118, indicated that reference to such evidence would be used \u201conly for comparison purposes.\u201d However, we see no practical distinction between using such evidence to establish an export value and using it to verify an export value. The Customs Service should not be able to do indirectly what Congress has forbidden it to do directly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b802-8\">.
