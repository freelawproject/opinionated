Edelstein, <em>Chief Judge, </em>after a three-week trial on 11 counts of a 40-count indictment charging him with conspiring in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 to violate certain provisions of the federal securities laws and regulations, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77q(a), 77x, 78j(b), 78ff, Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. 240.-10b-5, and the federal mail and wire fraud statutes, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341,1343, and with substantive violations of these securities and mail fraud statutes. Chief Judge Edelstein sentenced him to a term of three years imprisonment and to pay fines of $55,000. We affirmed his conviction in <em>United States v. Dioguardi, </em>492 F.2d 70 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 829, 95 S.Ct. 49, 42 L.Ed.2d 53 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-18\">After pursuing other post-conviction relief without success <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ostrer, who has now been free on bail for more than five years, was scheduled to commence service of his sentence on April 15, 1977. However, on April 14, 1977, he filed in the district court a petition to vacate his conviction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 on the ground that the Government had not disclosed at Ostrer\u2019s trial certain information required by <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, and that additional evidence had been acquired concerning the mental instability of a person who had served on his trial jury. After an evidentiary hearing, the petition was denied. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-19\">The evidence at Ostrer\u2019s trial showed that he and several others, including his co-defendant John Dioguardi, were involved in a scheme to raise artificially the price of the stock of the Belmont Franchising Corporation (Belmont). The cornerstone of the Government\u2019s case against Ostrer was the testimony of Michael Hellerman, a partici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>pant with Ostrer and Dioguardi in the Belmont fraud. Ostrer\u2019s defense at trial consisted primarily of an attempt to impeach Hellerman\u2019s credibility. See <em>United States v. Dioguardi, supra, </em>492 F.2d at 73-74 (2d Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The present appeal is concerned principally with evidence of two incidents known to the Government prior to Ostrer\u2019s trial, but which were not discovered by Ostrer until recently. He contends that this evidence should have been made available to him as <em>Brady </em>material before trial because it amounted to benefits given to Hellerman by the Government in return for his cooperation and testimony, which Ostrer\u2019s counsel could have exploited in his cross-examination of Hellerman to show a further motive for Hellerman to lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The first of these incidents is the so-called \u201cNatco Episode.\u201d While Hellerman was cooperating secretly as a Government informant in 1970-71 he advised the United States Attorney\u2019s Office that he and several other individuals were involved in a fraud designed to drive Natco, Inc. (\u201cNatco\u201d), and Merchandise Plus, Inc., two Long Island-based companies, into bankruptcy. As the companies went bankrupt, Hellerman and others, including Steven Schustek, the president of Natco, planned to steal the companies\u2019 assets and leave the creditors empty-handed.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Hellerman informed the Government that part of this fraud involved the cashing of an $80,000 check through a casino in the Bahamas. Acting on Hellerman\u2019s information, FBI agents were able to thwart this aspect of the fraud by preventing the check from being cashed. As a result, however, the Government found itself in possession of corporate funds belonging to Natco.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">Robert Morvillo, formerly chief of the Criminal Division of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York, testified at the hearing on appellant\u2019s \u00a7 2255 petition that the Government did not feel that it could maintain control over this money for fear of accelerating Natco\u2019s decline into bankruptcy and of possibly becoming entangled in litigation with Natco or its creditors. The situation was complicated by Hellerman, who was deeply in debt to several loansharks and had suggested to Morvillo that the Government give him the money to pay his debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">Morvillo rejected this suggestion but told Hellerman that the Government would release the money to a lawyer representing Natco on the assurance that the funds would be placed in the corporation\u2019s account. Both Morvillo and Hellerman testified that Morvillo warned Hellerman and Schustek that they would be prosecuted if the money was later diverted by them to non-corporate purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">On February 1, 1971, Edward Kurland, a lawyer retained by Schustek for the sole purpose of retrieving the $80,000, presented to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office a written demand on behalf of Natco for the funds, which were then released to him and deposited in a corporate account, according to Morvillo\u2019s instructions. Within a few weeks, however, the money was transferred to another account, and Schustek then withdrew all but a few dollars of the full amount, at least a portion of which was used by Hellerman to pay his debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">Morvillo could not recall whether he learned prior to Ostrer\u2019s trial that Heller-man had been able to pay his debts from the $80,000; and Hellerman did not recall ever so informing Morvillo. The record contains an uncontradicted affidavit, which the district court credited, from the Assistant U.S. Attorney who prosecuted Ostrer in 1973 to the effect that prior to Ostrer\u2019s trial he knew nothing of Natco or of the $80,000 transaction. However, the record also contains a memorandum dated April 26, 1971 (less than three months after Morvillo gave the Natco check to Kurland) sent to Morvil-lo from the Assistant U.S. Attorney directly responsible for Hellerman-related investigations in 1971, which describes Schustek\u2019s transfer of the money from the corporate account and his withdrawal of \u201call but $23 of the $80,000 in cash \u2014 $100 bills.\u201d On the basis of this memorandum the district court found that the Government knew, or should have known, as early as April, 1971, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Schustek and Hellerman had not heeded Morvillo\u2019s instructions concerning the proper disposition of the Natco funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Although Judge Brieant found that Ostrer had failed to establish that the $80,000 was \u201cintentionally released to Hellerman so he could pay loansharks,\u201d he also concluded that the Government\u2019s decision had in effect made it possible for Hellerman to gain a benefit and that it should have advised counsel of these facts prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">The second undisclosed incident was the Government\u2019s decision not to oppose Heller-man\u2019s motion for enlargement of his bail limits. During the summer of 1972, nearly two years after Hellerman had begun cooperating with the Government, he had been named as a defendant in several different indictments and was expected to testify at Ostrer\u2019s trial. This testimony would destroy Hellerman\u2019s effectiveness as a confidential informant, and it was anticipated that he would have to be relocated and given a new identity when the trial was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">In August, 1972, several months prior to Ostrer\u2019s trial, Hellerman\u2019s counsel filed a motion to enlarge Hellerman\u2019s bail limits so that he could travel to Europe for a few weeks. The purpose of the trip was partly recreational, and partly to give Hellerman and his family an opportunity to consider possible relocation sites. After obtaining assurances from defense counsel (now Judge) Vincent Broderick and Thomas Edwards to the effect that Hellerman would neither flee nor secrete money in European banks while on this trip, the Government decided to take no position with respect to this motion. The motion was granted by Judge Lasker. Hellerman travelled to Europe and returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">The district court held that the Government\u2019s nonopposition to the Hellerman bail motion \u201cwas certainly a reward for his cooperation.\u201d Judge Brieant concluded that the facts concerning the motion should have been disclosed to defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">Although Judge Brieant concluded that the information regarding the two incidents should have been turned over to the defense, he denied Ostrer\u2019s petition on the ground that the evidence was not material, in view of the extensive impeachment data with respect to Hellerman that had been fully exploited on cross-examination. The additional evidence, Judge Brieant concluded, did not \u201craise a reasonable doubt.\u201d Similarly, the district court rejected Ostrer\u2019s contention that the Government\u2019s failure to make available evidence with respect to various other matters (described below) violated <em>Brady. </em>From this decision Ostrer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">DISCUSSION \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">In <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), the Supreme Court held that the Government\u2019s failure to make available exculpatory evidence specifically requested by the defendant (in that case, a co-defendant\u2019s statement corroborating the accused\u2019s version of a homicide) constituted a denial of due process. The principle has since been extended to apply to material evidence that would impeach a Government witness whose \u201creliability . . . may well be determinative of guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Gig-lio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 154, 92 S.Ct. 763, 766, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1977) (knowing use by Government of perjured testimony regarding promises by the prosecutor to the witness), quoting <em>Napue v. Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">These decisions left open the question of what standards were to be applied in determining whether evidence would be deemed \u201cmaterial\u201d for <em>Brady </em>purposes. In most cases the issue can be resolved without difficulty. Certain proof is so clearly exculpatory or valuable for impeachment purposes that any reasonable prosecutor will immediately recognize its utility to the defense. But the possible value of other proof, even with the aid of hindsight (which is not available when the prosecutor must decide whether to disclose) may be speculative, extremely doubtful, or not apparent. Since materiality is a rather broad concept, apt to be elusive at times, it might be interpreted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>by some as requiring the Government to turn over to the accused virtually everything in its files that could by any stretch of the imagination be useful to the defense, whether or not foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">It was therefore essential to establish some standards or guidelines for compliance with <em>Brady\u2019s </em>requirements. This the Supreme Court undertook to do in <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976). There the Court described the types of cases in which the <em>Brady </em>rule applies: (1) where the undisclosed evidence shows that the Government\u2019s case includes perjured testimony and that the prosecutor knetv, or should have known, of the perjury, (2) where the defendant made a specific request for particular undisclosed information, and (3) where the defendant made no request, or made only a general request. The Court held that when the Government\u2019s nondisclosure falls within either of the first two categories a strict standard of materiality should apply, with the defendant being entitled to a new trial if there is any reasonable likelihood that the evidence could have affected the outcome of the trial. <em>Agurs, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 103-04, 96 S.Ct. 2392. On the other hand, if the defendant makes no request or only a general request for evidence that is then not disclosed (e. g., \u201call <em>Brady </em>material,\u201d \u201call exculpatory material\u201d), he is entitled to a new trial only if the undisclosed evidence, viewed in the context of the entire record, creates a reasonable doubt that otherwise would not exist. <em>Id. </em>at 112-13, 96 S.Ct. 2392.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Ostrer has argued, both below and here, that this case falls within either the first or second of these categories described in <em>Agurs. </em>Clearly it does not meet the requirements of the first, since Judge Brieant could \u201cnot find on the evidence submitted here that Hellerman committed any specific perjury at trial. It follows that the Government did not knowingly rely on perjured testimony at Ostrer\u2019s trial.\u201d Nothing in the record on appeal leads us to disturb this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">Nor does this case come within the second <em>Agurs </em>category, since there was no specific request for the particular undisclosed information. Indeed, Ostrer himself made no request at all. His co-defendant Dioguardi, however, did make a pretrial non-specific <em>Brady </em>request, and Ostrer now contends that he should be deemed to have joined in his co-defendant\u2019s request.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even if Ostrer is deemed to have joined in the Dioguardi request, the latter was not sufficiently specific to come within the second <em>Agurs </em>category. Approximately one month prior to the trial, Dioguardi\u2019s counsel asked for</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">\u201c4) any other material in the possession of the Government bearing adversely on the credibility, character and reputation of Michael Hellerman; and 5) any other . material relating to any matter which defense counsel could properly use in cross-examination to inquire into Heller-man\u2019s motive and bias in favor of the Government or expectation of favor from the Government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">This request amounted to nothing more than a boilerplate demand for \u201call <em>Brady </em>material\u201d or for \u201canything exculpatory,\u201d which the Supreme Court described in <em>Agurs </em>as a request that gives \u201cthe prosecutor no better notice than if no request is made.\u201d 427 U.S. at 106-07, 96 S.Ct. at 2399. A specific request, said the court in <em>Agurs, </em>is one similar to the request made in <em>Brady </em>itself \u2014 a request for \u201cspecific information\u201d that gives the prosecutor \u201cnotice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>exactly what the defense desire[s].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 427 U.S. at 106, 96 S.Ct. at 2398. See <em>United States v. Lasky, </em>548 F.2d 835, 839 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Since only a general request was made in this case, appellant\u2019s burden under <em>Agurs </em>is to show that the undisclosed evidence, when \u201cevaluated in the context of the entire record,\u201d 427 U.S. at 112, 96 S.Ct. at 2402, creates a reasonable doubt about his guilt. This he has failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Ostrer\u2019s defense at trial consisted primarily of an attack on Hellerman\u2019s credibility; thus the only conceivable way in which the undisclosed evidence could create a reasonable doubt about Ostrer\u2019s guilt would be if the knowledge of those two impeaching incidents, in addition to the numerous others used on cross-examination, would persuade a fact-finder to disbelieve Hellerman\u2019s testimony against Ostrer. We are satisfied that the additional evidence would not have had such an effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">The undisclosed evidence fell far short of a Government benefit in exchange for the witness\u2019 cooperation. It remains undisputed that Morvillo refused to turn over the $80,000 to Hellerman and that, upon deciding to turn it over to Natco, had warned him and Schustek that they would be prosecuted if they diverted the money to noncor-porate purposes. At most the Government\u2019s role, in view of Schustek\u2019s disregard of this warning, became ambiguous. The suggestion that the Government\u2019s non-opposition to the court-approved enlargement of bail would have been useful impeachment evidence borders on the frivolous. However, even accepting Ostrer\u2019s contention that these two incidents could have been used effectively to attack Hellerman\u2019s credibility as a witness, they represented a mere drop in the bucket when viewed in the context of the wealth of other impeaching material used upon cross-examination of Hellerman.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">\u201cDuring the trial the jury heard Heller-man repeatedly acknowledge his participation in numerous criminal activities. Hellerman testified that during the pre-ceeding [sic] five years he was involved in approximately eight to twelve criminal acts for which he was not prosecuted, and three cases in which he pleaded guilty. (Belmont tr. 390-91, 602). Hellerman acknowledged his role in frauds involving the securities of Belmont Franchising Corporation, Globus, Automated Information, Minute Approval Credit, and At Your Service Leasing. (Belmont tr. 690-91; 716-17). He admitted that he was involved in having someone pay bribes to New York City policemen, and he testified to his well founded belief that the United States Attorney\u2019s Office would convince the local authorities not to prosecute him. (Belmont tr. 806-07). Heller-man acknowledged that he purchased stocks, dresses, and jewelry which he knew to have been stolen (Belmont tr. 808), and that he paid money to others for the purpose of bribing state court judges, a state liquor authority investigator, and a union delegate. (Belmont tr. 811). In addition, Hellerman testified that he had been involved in criminal activity in connection with Natco and Merchandise Plus (Belmont tr. 741), that he had been barred by the SEC from activities in the securities industry since 1961 (Belmont tr. 606), that he told Jack Kelsey to file false papers with the SEC hiding Hellerman\u2019s interest in a brokerage firm (Belmont tr. 612), and that he participated in a scheme to submit a fraudulent check to a Bahamian bank. (Belmont tr. 619). He also acknowledged disobeying court orders. (Belmont tr. at 731).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">\u201cThe jury also heard Hellerman testify that after he had begun to cooperate with the Government and had agreed not to engage in any additional criminal activity, he broke that promise, and continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>his illegal conduct. (Belmont tr. 822-23; 938-39; 948). Hellerman testified that after he broke his promise he engaged in swindles which earned him over $250,-000.00 and for which he was not prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">\u201cFinally, the summations for both Ostrer and Dioguardi were replete with references to Hellerman\u2019s corrupt and criminal activity and the \u2018extraordinary\u2019 agreement he entered into with the Government immunizing him from prosecution for most of his crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">\u201cTrial counsel emphasized clearly to the jury that the Government had \u2018bought\u2019 the testimony of a man who, having promised the United States Attorney\u2019s Office once before that he would not commit any more crimes, then went out and continued his corrupt and sordid activities. (Belmont tr. 1721-24; 1731-32; 1754; 1783; 1793-94).\u201d <em>Findings and Conclusions of Judge Brieant, </em>8/12/77, pp. 39-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">In light of this evidence, as well as the direct incriminating evidence against Ostrer (the sufficiency of which was not even challenged on direct appeal, 492 F.2d 70), we agree with the district court that the Natco episode and the Hellerman bail motion were not material.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Disclosure of this information would not have created a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jurors who found Ostrer guilty; nor does the disclosure now raise a reasonable doubt about Ostrer\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently a new trial is not warranted. Accord, <em>United States v. Stassi, </em>544 F.2d 579, 584 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Erb, </em>543 F.2d 438, 443 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 981, 97 S.Ct. 493, 50 L.Ed.2d 590 (1976); <em>Brack v. United States, </em>542 F.2d 4 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Corr, </em>434 F.Supp. 408, 414 (S.D.N. Y.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">Ostrer also contends that the Government violated its <em>Brady </em>obligation by not disclosing evidence concerning (1) a motion by Hellerman to reduce his sentence, (2) the selection of the location where Hellerman served his sentence, (3) a reduction in Hel-lerman\u2019s legal fees, and (4) the non-prosecution of Hellerman\u2019s family. The district court rejected these contentions, and after a careful review of the record, we affirm this aspect of the decision below, as well as the district court\u2019s finding that the Government complied with its obligations under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500. None of these claims merits discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">We also affirm the district court\u2019s decision to deny the claim for a new trial based on purportedly new information concerning the mental state of a trial juror. On similar facts, the denial without hearing of a virtually identical motion was affirmed by this court in <em>United States v. Dioguardi, </em>492 F.2d 70, 78-81 (2d Cir. 1974). We fully agree with the district court\u2019s characterization of this aspect of Ostrer\u2019s petition as \u201ccumulative, repetitious, and untimely.\u201d The new information concerning the juror\u2019s mental state proffered by Ostrer in the affidavit of Junius Rush was substantially undermined by the affidavit later obtained from Mr. Rush and filed by the Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>in which the affiant modified, if not repudiated, much of his first sworn statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">The order of the district court is affirmed with the direction that the mandate issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-15\">. Shortly after his conviction, Ostrer moved for a new trial on the basis of a juror\u2019s alleged mental incompetence. Judge Edelstein denied this motion at the time of sentencing. We affirmed the denial of the motion in <em>United States v. Dioguardi, </em>492 F.2d 70 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 829, 95 S.Ct. 49, 42 L.Ed.2d 53 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-16\">On December 11, 1974, Ostrer filed another motion for a new trial, which alleged that during his trial the Government had been privy to conversations between Ostrer and his counsel. After a hearing this motion was denied, <em>United States v. Ostrer, </em>422 F.Supp. 93 (S.D.N.Y. 1976), and the denial of the motion was affirmed in <em>United States v. Ostrer, </em>551 F.2d 303 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 946, 97 S.Ct. 1581, 51 L.Ed.2d 793 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b880-6\">. The district court\u2019s opinion states that \u201cOstrer\u2019s trial counsel specifically requested that the Government make available any material bearing adversely on the credibility, character or reputation of Hellerman.\u201d Prior to oral argument we were unable to discover in the record any support for this finding. Nor was Ostrer\u2019s counsel at oral argument able to point to Ostrer\u2019s request for <em>Brady </em>material in the record. Following argument, we received a letter from Ostrer\u2019s counsel directing our attention to certain documents in the record. After reviewing these materials, we are still convinced that Ostrer never made a <em>Brady </em>request, and that the district court\u2019s finding refers to the Dio-guardi request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b881-8\">. In <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), defense counsel made the specific request prior to trial to examine the out-of-court statements made by Brady\u2019s co-defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b882-7\">. Technically, the district court erred in holding that it was a violation of <em>Brady </em>not to disclose the Government\u2019s role in the Natco episode and the enlargement of Hellerman\u2019s bail limits but that since this evidence was not material relief should be denied. <em>Brady </em>requires only the disclosure of material information, not all evidence that might conceivably be of use to the defense. Since the undisclosed evidence here was not material there was no failure to comply with <em>Brady.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b882-12\">. The <em>Agurs </em>opinion suggests that the district court\u2019s task in a case such as this is to determine for itself whether the undisclosed evidence creates a reasonable doubt concerning the defendant\u2019s guilt, rather than whether the evidence would have created a reasonable doubt in the minds of the trial jurors. See 427 U.S. 112-14, 96 S.Ct. 2392, see also 427 U.S. 115-16, 96 S.Ct. 2392 (Marshall, <em>J\u201e </em>dissenting). Under either approach, we are satisfied that the denial of the petition should be affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b883-6\">MOORE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Aj5\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">I concur in affirming the order denying appellant\u2019s petition to vacate his conviction but differ in my reasons in one, to me, important respect. I do not agree that the Government\u2019s role with respect to the $80,-000 was \u201cambiguous\u201d or that this incident and the enlargement of bail incident represented \u201ca mere drop in the bucket\u201d. However, whether they would have caused the bucket to overflow is quite another matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">I believe that Judge Brieant\u2019s finding, as follows, is clearly supported by the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-9\">\u201c(1) the Government prevented Sammy Feet [Hellerman\u2019s co-conspirator in the Natco fraud] from stealing the $80,000 in Natco funds by freezing the proceeds of the check which Schustek and Feet had caused to be deposited in the Bahamas casino . . .; (2) Hellerman and Schustek did reveal the full story of the Natco swindle, including their own participation, to the Government, thereby making the Government fully aware of the intended goal of Natco\u2019s bankruptcy, before it released the $80,000 to Kurland [the lawyer who presented a handwritten retainer signed by Schustek to the Government in order to obtain the funds \u201con behalf of Natco\u201d]; (3) the Government was aware before it reached its decision to release the funds to an attorney authorized by Schustek, that Heller-man desperately needed this money to pay off loansharks who were threatening his life. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-12\">\u201cIn the face of all of this, the Government released the funds [the $80,000] to . Kurland . . . without investigating either Kurland or his intentions, or those of Schustek with respect to the $80,000.00. In addition, the Government made no effort to ascertain whether Natco was actually then bankrupt (which it was as of January 26, 1971 . . .) or whether the intended fraud was sufficiently advanced so that the seized money could be held in the Government\u2019s possession as evidence, or to prevent its theft by Hellerman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-15\">\u201cHellerman expressed his own belief, at the evidentiary hearing and in <em>[Wall Street </em>Swindler], that the Government intentionally allowed him to retrieve the $80,000.00 thus conferring a substantial benefit on him. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-16\">\u201c. . . The Court finds, as it must based on the record before it, that it should have been readily apparent to the Government, when it did release these funds, that the money inevitably would end up in Hellerman\u2019s pocket. In effect, the Government chose to look the other way. While denying Hellerman\u2019s direct request for the money, the Government accorded him the opportunity to gain possession of it indirectly by the charade of having the corporation\u2019s \u2018attorney\u2019 demand and receive it for deposit in a corporate bank account. By conscious avoidance the Government thus intentionally eased the way for Hellerman to benefit from its decision to release the $80,000.00 in stolen funds. . . . \u201d (District Court\u2019s Findings, Appendix at 318-19) (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-19\">I also believe that the <em>Brady </em>request was \u2018specific\u201d,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that these disclosures were em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>braced within the <em>Brady </em>doctrine, were material, and should have been disclosed. Had there been no other evidence reflecting on Hellerman\u2019s credibility, these governmental favors would, in my opinion, have been admissible and material to that important issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">However, Hellerman\u2019s credibility had been subjected to a devastating barrage, set forth in detail by Judge Brieant and incorporated in Judge Mansfield\u2019s opinion. Since we are faced, in reality, with the speculation of what the jury \u2014 or even one juror \u2014 would have done had this information been presented, we cannot, under the law, speculate, but must substitute well-reasoned judgment therefor. Searching retroactively into the composite mind of the jury, I, too, come to the conclusion that the addition of these withheld facts would not have created a reasonable doubt, in view of all the evidence before them, of Ostrer\u2019s guilt \u2014 hence, I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-11\">. That the request was made by Ostrer\u2019s co-defendant and not Ostrer himself, is, in my view, immaterial, given the function of the request\u2014 <em>i. </em>e., to ease the prosecutor\u2019s task of determining the \u201cmateriality\u201d of exculpatory evidence in the context of the case, <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. at 106-07, 96 S.Ct. 2392 \u2014 and given the fact that copies of the motion papers were sent to Ostrer\u2019s counsel as well as to the court and the prosecutor. The motion, moreover, had requested a pretrial conference for the purpose of obtaining a <em>Brady </em>order. Ostrer\u2019s counsel and the court might well have believed that the co-defendant\u2019s request in this multi-defendant proceeding would be sufficient to protect the <em>Brady </em>rights which were shared by Ostrer and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>co-defendant Dioguardi, both of whose convictions would be dependent, in large part, on the jury\u2019s assessment of Hellerman\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Sound policy would seem to require that no hypertechnical lines be drawn in this area. To require identical requests in multi-defendant trials would inundate the courts and the prosecutor\u2019s office with requests which would serve no useful purpose. Once the prosecutor is on notice that certain materials are deemed sufficiently \u201cmaterial\u201d to one co-defendant to require their production, his legal duty to provide those materials has crystallized, regardless of who the movant may have been. \u201cPretrial discovery,\u201d we have said in the past, \u201cshould be approached with a spirit of cooperation among court and counsel in order to prevent burdensome recesses and also, we should emphasize, to protect the government against . claims of suppression of material and favorable evidence . . . <em>United States v. Percevault, </em>490 F.2d 126, 132 (2d Cir. 1974). I would not limit a prosecutor\u2019s constitutional duty to disclose when his duty is brought home to him by any one defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
