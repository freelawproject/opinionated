SMITH, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1452-14\">Defendants Arnold Price, Charles R. Mitchell, William P. Mitchell, and Bobbi Mitchell were convicted of a conspiracy to transport two women, Shelly and Debbie,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in interstate commerce for purposes of prostitution, and Charles R. Mitchell was convicted of transporting Debbie from Washington to Oregon for purposes of prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-15\">Because of the confrontation problem arising as to Charles Mitchell, we set out the evidence supporting the conviction in more detail than ordinarily would be necessary. The detail is necessary to disclose, as to Charles Mitchell, the overwhelming nature of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-16\">William P. Mitchell and his wife, Bobbi Mitchell, owned and operated Daisy Mae\u2019s Massage Parlor in Anchorage, Alaska. William Mitchell told a police officer of his ownership. It was stipulated that checks drawn on the account of Bobbi Mitchell and William Mitchell, signed by William Mitchell, were issued in payment of the earnings of female employees of the massage parlor. Bobbi Mitchell, in a taped conversation with Shelly and Debbie, implicated William Mitchell in the operation of the business. In the same taped conversation she revealed that the parlor was operated for purposes of prostitution. The conversation was lengthy and explicit in sexual detail. William Mitchell and Charles Mitchell were brothers, and telephone records show that there was communication over the telephones listed to Daisy Mae\u2019s Massage Parlor and Bobbi Mitchell in Anchorage and the telephone listed to Charles Mitchell in Vancouver, Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-17\">In June 1976 Charles R. Mitchell told his friend Arnold Price of Daisy Mae\u2019s Massage Parlor and stated that anyone working there could make good money. He asked Price to let him know if he found anyone who would be interested in working in the massage parlor. This is proven not only by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>the statements of coconspirator Price, but by Price\u2019s testimony, given when he took the stand in his own behalf, and that testimony is corroborated by all of the subsequent happenings. Price, while employed by CETA, learned from Shelly, a fellow worker at CETA, that she had at one time been a prostitute. On July 26, 1976, while Shelly was visiting the CETA offices, Price advised her of the Alaskan massage parlor and told her that she could make $1,000 to $2,000 a month working there. Shelly said that she was interested and asked Price if he would arrange a meeting with his friend. Shelly advised her friend Debbie of the proposal, and then Debbie called Price and asked if she also could meet his friend. Price said \u201cyes.\u201d These facts were proved by the testimony of Shelly, Debbie, and Price. Price\u2019s testimony as to his conversation with Shelly was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1453-4\">A I don\u2019t remember exactly what was said but then I suggested to her that if she was interested in working in a sauna in Alaska, that she might want to check with a friend of mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1453-5\">Q And what was her response?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1453-6\">A She sort of raised her eyebrows and said, \u201cThat sounds interesting,\u201d and that was about all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1453-7\">Q Now at that time did you say anything regarding the amount one could earn or whether prostitution was part of it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1453-8\">A I believe I said she could make, maybe, $1,000 or $2,000 a month, or something like that. I don\u2019t remember exact figures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1453-9\">Q Did you say anything about prostitution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1453-10\">A I said, when I mentioned working in the sauna, she said, \u201cDoing what?\u201d and I said, \u201cWhatever,\u201d or \u201cTricks,\u201d you know, \u201cTurning tricks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1453-18\">Q What did you mean when you said \u201cturning tricks\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1453-19\">A I meant prostitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1453-20\">Unbeknownst to Price, Shelly, who had been in marijuana trouble, was cooperating with the county drug enforcement officers. She advised the sheriff\u2019s office of Price\u2019s proposal. The sheriff\u2019s office in turn advised the FBI, and ultimately Shelly was asked to pursue the matter. Shelly called Price to arrange a meeting to discuss his offer. Price took Shelly and Debbie to Mitchell\u2019s house on August 5, 1976. The fact of this meeting at Charles Mitchell\u2019s house was proved by the testimony of Shelly, Debbie, and Price, and surveilling officer Smith. Smith took pictures of the women, Price, Price\u2019s car, and the Charles Mitchell house. That the meeting took place and that the conversation (not taped) related to Alaska is corroborated by a note shown to be in Charles Mitchell\u2019s handwriting and given by him to Shelly. The note bears Charles Mitchell\u2019s name, address, phone number, and the word \u201cAlaska.\u201d After the meeting, Shelly delivered the note to the officers, who initialed it and dated it August 5th, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-21\">On August 9th, in a taped telephone call to Price, Shelly made arrangements with Price to have him take her back to Charles Mitchell\u2019s house. A meeting at Charles Mitchell\u2019s house, attended by Debbie, Shelly, and Mitchell, occurred on August 11th. The conversation at that meeting, which revolved about the trip to Alaska, was taped.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On August 12th, Debbie, in a taped telephone conversation with Charles Mitchell, discussed the trip to Alaska and ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>ranged a meeting at Charles Mitchell\u2019s house on that evening.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The meeting was held, and the entire conversation was taped.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trip to Alaska was discussed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>detail, and arrangements were made for the women to meet at Charles\u2019 house the next morning. That same evening, and after the meeting, there was another taped telephone conversation<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> between Debbie and Charles Mitchell in which the final arrangements for the transportation to Portland were made. Charles Mitchell took both women from Vancouver, Washington, to the Portland airport on August 13th. The fact of the trip is proved by Shelly and Debbie and corroborated by the testimony of a surveil-ling officer. Debbie testified that Charles Mitchell gave Shelly three hundred-dollar bills. By airlines personnel it was proved that two girls and a man approached the airlines counter, that one of the girls bought two tickets to Anchorage, Alaska, with three hundred-dollar bills. At the request of an officer, the airlines personnel segregated the ticket coupon and the bills. They were admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-5\">Shelly and Debbie boarded the aircraft and met an FBI agent in Seattle who made reservations for them in Anchorage. In Anchorage, on August 13th, they called Bobbi Mitchell, who came to their hotel room. The business of the massage parlor was thoroughly discussed, and the taped conversation shows unequivocally that Bobbi Mitchell expected Shelly and Debbie to report for work as prostitutes on the morning of the 14th. They did not report, but rather returned to Vancouver the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-15\">It is against this background that we discuss the assigned errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-16\">\u25a0 <em>CROSS-EXAMINATION AND CON</em>FRONTATION:</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-17\">Charles Mitchell argues that the judgment should be reversed as to him because his cross-examination of Shelly was improperly limited and his constitutional right to confront her was thereby denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-18\">After Shelly\u2019s first conversation with Price, she called Vic Calzaretta, the chief criminal deputy in the sheriff\u2019s office. Later she met with Calzaretta and John Dush, an officer in the narcotics unit. The cross-examination of Shelly was limited as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>Q Had you ever worked in any capacity providing information such as that to Mr. Dush or to the individuals in the narcotics unit? .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-4\">MR. MOORE: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-5\">THE COURT: Read the question. (Preceding question read by the reporter.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-6\">THE COURT: What is the purpose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-7\">MR. KANEV: Your Honor, for some reason, as the witness pointed out, she was met not by MR. Calzaretta whom she telephoned, but by individuals of the narcotic unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-8\">THE COURT: So?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-9\">MR. KANEV: This line of questioning would go to her interest in the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-10\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1456-11\">The defendant Charles Mitchell had the right to explore the relationship between the witness and the law enforcement officers <em>(Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974); <em>United States v. Callahan, </em>551 F.2d 733 (6th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Garrett, </em>542 F.2d 23 (6th Cir. 1976; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Croucher, </em>532 F.2d 1042 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>501 F.2d 1 (9th Cir. 1974); <em>United States v. DeLeon, </em>498 F.2d 1327 (7th Cir. 1974)), and the cross-examination was limited improperly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-12\">Charles Mitchell\u2019s cross-examination of Shelly was limited, but the fact is that Shelly\u2019s relationship with the police was explored fully. On cross-examination by counsel for William and Bobbi Mitchell, Shelly testified that she had been arrested for possession of marijuana on May 20, 1976; that following a hearing the charge was dropped; that she was friendly with John Dush, the narcotics officer, had worked for him, and had received expense reimbursement in the amount of $34.00. It also appeared that, at the time of the events in this case, she was under a subpoena to testify before a court but that she had never had to appear. Officer Dush testified that Shelly had been a confidential informant for the narcotics division of the sheriff\u2019s office for about three months prior to events in this case and had worked on seven to nine heroin cases. Dush was fully cross-examined as to the relationship between Shelly and the narcotics division. We also note that Debbie, whose background was similar to Shelly\u2019s, was fully cross-examined as .to her relationship with the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-15\">The evidence against Charles Mitchell, consisting of documentary evidence, several taped conversations, and the testimony of many witnesses who corroborated each other on most of the facts in the case, was overwhelming. Considering this and the ultimate disclosure of Shelly\u2019s relationship to the police, we believe the limitation of her cross-examination was harmless error beyond any reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-16\">The harmless error rule may apply even when the error stems from a violation of the Constitution. For many years the harmless error rule has been stated by statute<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and by court rule.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In 1967, in the case of <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, the Supreme Court, after noting the statute and the court rule, consciously and deliberately examined the harmless error rule in its relationship to violations of constitutional rights and established the applicable law. The rule was stated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-17\">[BJefore a federal constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-18\">In 1968, in <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476, the Supreme Court ruled that admission of extrajudicial confessions of codefendants violated the right of cross-examination secured by the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment, and then in 1969, in <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284, the Court reaffirmed <em>Chapman </em>and held that the harmless error rule was applicable in sixth amendment cases of the <em>Bruton </em>type. In affirming the conviction, the Court said at 254, 89 S.Ct. at 1728:</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-6\">We do not depart from <em>Chapman </em>; nor do we dilute it by inference. We reaffirm it. We do not suggest that, if evidence bearing on all the ingredients of the crime is tendered, the use of cumulative evidence, though tainted, is harmless error. Our decision is based on the evidence in this record. The case against Harrington was not woven from circumstantial evidence. It is so overwhelming that unless we say that no violation of <em>Bruton </em>can constitute harmless error, we must leave this state conviction undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-7\">Now the problem arises \u2014 is the harmless error rule announced in <em>Chapman </em>inapplicable where the sixth amendment comes into play by reason of a limitation of cross-examination rather than by the reception in evidence of an extrajudicial confession of eodefendant?</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-8\">In 1974, in <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 318, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 1111, 39 L.Ed.2d 347, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-9\">On these facts it seems clear to us that to make any such inquiry effective, defense counsel should have been permitted to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness. Petitioner was thus denied the right of effective cross-examination which \u201c <em>\u2018would be constitutional error of the first magnitude and no amount of showing of want of prejudice would cure it.\u2019 Brookhart </em>v. <em>Janis, </em>384 U.S. 1, 3, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314.\u201d <em>Smith v. Illinois, </em>390 U.S. 129, 131, 88 S.Ct. 748, 19 L.Ed.2d 956 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-10\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-11\">The precise question is whether the emphasized language was intended to make the rule of <em>Chapman </em>inapplicable in all cases where there has been an erroneous limitation of cross-examination, or whether the Court was referring to the specific limitation in <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974), and holding that that limitation could not be harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-13\">It is noted that the emphasized language in the quotation was taken from <em>Brookhart v. Janis, </em>384 U.S. 1, 3, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1966). The issue in <em>Brookhart </em>was one of waiver. The emphasized language was not a holding by the Court in <em>Brookhart </em>that any limitation of the right of cross-examination was reversible error. It was nothing more than a quotation from an admission by the respondent in <em>Brook-hart </em>that, absent a valid waiver, the error, <em>i. e., </em>a denial of all right of cross-examination, was one of great magnitude. Obviously, the denial of all right of cross-examination cannot be harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-14\">There was no need for the Court in <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974), to modify the rule of <em>Chapman </em>and establish a <em>per se </em>rule to achieve the result obtained. The case against the defendants in <em>Davis </em>depended almost entirely on the testimony of a juvenile delinquent named Green. He was, as the Court said, a \u201ccrucial witness,\u201d and it is evident from the opinion that without his testimony there could not have been a conviction. The cross-examination would have explored his relationship to the law officers and may have revealed some bias resulting from that relationship. In addition, it may have resulted in his impeachment. When the Court found that the right of \u201ceffective cross-examination\u201d had been denied and that this error was clearly prejudicial, the harmless error rule of <em>Chapman </em>could not be applied. We think the same may be said of the language used in <em>United States v. Harris, </em>501 F.2d 1, 9 (9th Cir. 1974), and <em>United States v. Alvarez-Lopez, </em>559 F.2d 1155, 1160 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-15\">The result we reach could not be reached by holding that there was not here, as in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Harris, </em>a denial of \u201ceffective\u201d cross-examination. The fact that Shelly\u2019s police relationships were explored by a co-defendant does not really relate to the effectiveness of the right afforded Charles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>Mitchell to cross-examine. Nor does the fact that the evidence against Charles Mitchell was overwhelming bear upon the effectiveness of the right to cross-examine afforded to Charles Mitchell. These facts do, however, bear upon whether any damage was done to him and may be considered if the harmless error rule is applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-4\">In most cases where there is a denial of effective cross-examination, it would be impossible to find the denial harmless, but in this case we think it is, and in the absence of any ease expressly renouncing the harmless error rule or any case mentioning it where a renunciation of it was necessary to the result,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we reach our result on the basis of <em>Chapman. </em>We agree with the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit in <em>United States v. Mayer, </em>556 F.2d 245, 252 n. 10 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-5\">\n<em>MARITAL PRIVILEGE:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-6\">The taped conversations of Bobbi Mitchell were received in evidence over the objection of her husband, William Mitchell, that his marital privilege<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was being violated. The taped conversations of Bobbi Mitchell were extremely damaging, and if the privilege applies, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-12\">In the federal courts, the husband has a privilege to prevent his wife from testifying against him. <em>Hawkins v. United States, </em>358 U.S. 74, 79 S.Ct. 136, 3 L.Ed.2d 125 (1958); <em>Bisno v. United States, </em>299 F.2d 711 (9th Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-13\">In the Ninth Circuit, as distinguished from others,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> extrajudicial statements made by the wife are considered within the rule.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Notwithstanding, it is our view that the Bobbie Mitchell tapes were admissible against William Mitchell. Statements made by an agent in the course of his employment are the vicarious admissions of the principal. A conspirator is an agent in a criminal venture, and his admissions are likewise received against his co-conspirators. Where one spouse is shown to be an agent of the other, the vicarious admissions rule has been applied in both civil and criminal cases. 8 Wigmore on Evidence, McNaughton Revision \u00a7 2232, n. 3. The rule was specifically applied to a husband and wife venture in <em>United States v. Pugliese, </em>153 F.2d 497 (2d Cir. 1945).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>Even if we conceive of the privilege as one based on the \u201cpersistent instincts of several centuries\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> rather than a \u201csentimental relic,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we doubt that much instinctive support could be found for the proposition that a man may engage in a civil or criminal venture with his spouse, and then, after she had said things which had to be said in the operation of the venture,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> avoid responsibility for them on the basis of privilege which was initially rooted in the \u201clegal fiction that [a] husband and wife were one person.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The language of the Supreme Court in <em>Hawkins </em>clearly indicates that the privilege was respected because of the belief that it does foster \u201cfamily peace.\u201d In this sort of a ease, where the wife is not the witness and the wife\u2019s words which are introduced are those which the husband authorized her to speak, it is difficult to see how the reception of the evidence could impair the relationship between the husband and the wife. We conclude that the rule should be that, where a husband and wife are engaged in a criminal conspiracy, the extrajudicial statements of either made in furtherance of the conspiracy may be admitted against the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-5\"><em>SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE </em>\u2014 WIL<em>LIAM MITCHELL:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1459-6\">William Mitchell, urges that the statements of Charles Mitchell, Arnold Price, and Bobbi Mitchell should not have been admitted against him because there was not sufficient independent evidence to connect him with the conspiracy. As previously indicated, it was proved that William Mitchell had said that he was Bobbi Mitchell\u2019s husband, that he had purchased Daisy Mae\u2019s Massage Parlor and was in the massage parlor business. Bank records showing the account of William and Bobbi Mitchell were admitted as exhibits, as were checks signed by William Mitchell payable to four of the female employees of Daisy Mae\u2019s Massage Parlor. This was sufficient to connect William Mitchell to the conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Perry, </em>550 F.2d 524, 528 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Turner, </em>528 F.2d 143, 161-62 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 996, 96 S.Ct. 426, 46 L.Ed.2d 371 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-10\">\n<em>SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE-PRICE:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-11\">Price urges that the evidence was insufficient to prove Count 1 because there is no evidence that he intentionally entered into an agreement to cause women to be transported for purposes of prostitution. On the record here, the contention borders on the frivolous. The common purpose was to recruit girls for purposes of prostitution. He furthered that purpose. A common purpose and plan could be inferred from the circumstances.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1460-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>\n<em>VOIR DIRE OF JURY:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-4\">Charles Mitchell requested the court on voir dire to instruct the jury on the presumption of innocence and burden of proof and to ask them whether they thought of such laws as being unfair. The trial court refused, and this refusal is assigned as error. The trial court did ask the jurors if they would follow his instructions as to the law. The jurors nodded in affirmation. At the close of the evidence, the jury was fully instructed as to the burden of proof, the presumption of innocence, and the defendants\u2019 right to remain silent. The jurors were sworn to follow the law. The scope of the voir dire is directed to the sound discretion of the trial court,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and it is assumed that a jury will, in accordance with the oath they take, follow the judge\u2019s instructions. <em>Vitello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>425 F.2d 416 (9th Cir. 1970). On the specific questions here raised, the Sixth Circuit, in a divided opinion, held it error to refuse a request to voir dire the jury as to the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof. <em>United States v. Blount, </em>479 F.2d 650 (6th Cir. 1973). The decision in <em>Blount, </em>a minority view, was specifically rejected by the Third Circuit in <em>United States v. Wooton, </em>518 F.2d 943 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 895, 96 S.Ct. 196, 46 L.Ed.2d 128 (1975).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We adopt the rule stated in <em>Woo-ton </em>as the rule in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-5\">\n<em>PROSECUTORIAL UNFAIRNESS CONSTITUTING A DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-6\">Defendants Price and Mitchell were charged in Count 1 of the indictment with conspiracy and in Counts 2 and 3 with inducing Shelly and Debbie respectively to be transported in interstate commerce for the purposes of prostitution. At the close of the Government\u2019s case, and at the close of the evidence, Price and Mitchell moved for a directed verdict as to all counts. The motion was denied, and the court did instruct on Counts 2 and 3. The United States Attorney did not request the jury to convict on Counts 2 and 3, but did make perfunctory argument in support of Counts 2 and 3. At the conclusion of all the arguments, the United States moved to dismiss those counts. The motion was granted, and only Counts 1 and 4<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> were submitted. Price and Mitchell now urge that the United States deliberately confused and distracted the defendants by mentioning Counts 2 and 3 in the argument, but not asking for a conviction as to them; that the Government, for all practical purposes, sought a compromise verdict; that the Government improperly supported its own integrity by being candid as to Counts 2 and 3, and made its conspiracy ease stronger by arguing Counts 2 and 3. On a review of the record, we do not find the unfairness of which Price complains. As indicated, Counts 2 and 3 charged that defendants persuaded, induced, and enticed Shelly and Debbie to travel in interstate commerce for purposes of prostitution. The weakness, if any, in Counts 2 and 3 was not in a failure to prove defendants\u2019 conduct. That was proved beyond any reasonable doubt, but the women testified that they had no intention of prostituting themselves in Alaska and that they were not persuaded by defendants to go there, but rather went because the law enforcement officers asked them to. Without passing on the question of whether the evidence was sufficient to warrant a conviction on Counts 2 and 3, we note that had Counts 2 and 3 been erroneously submitted to the jury that error would not, under the circumstances here, have warranted a reversal as to Count 1. All facts tending to support Counts 2 and 3 were admissible to prove Count 1<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>Counts 2 and 3 been submitted, defendants would have been required to argue them, and the jury would have had the opportunity to compromise, which they did not have when Counts 2 and 3 were dismissed. It may be that the United States Attorneys did improve their image of integrity by their candor in indicating the difficulties with Counts 2 and 3 and ultimately moving to dismiss them, but we are of the opinion that the United States Attorney owes a duty of candor, and the prosecution cannot be faulted here for fulfilling that duty. In short, there simply was not unfairness of the type condemned in <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-4\">\n<em>DUE PROCESS:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-5\">Defendants Price and Mitchell assert error in the court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on the \u201cdue process\u201d defense.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This contention also borders on the frivolous.

CARTER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AC5\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-13\">I concur in the result reached by the majority in this case and in most of the reasoning in support thereof. My only disagreement concerns the treatment of Charles Mitchell\u2019s claim that his constitutional right to cross-examine was abridged. I understand the majority to hold that restricted cross-examination claims are tested by the following procedure: (1) the reviewing court determines whether the constitutional right to effective cross-examination has been abridged. If so, then (2) the court reviews the entire record to determine whether the error in restricting cross-examination was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. I also understand the majority to explain recent cases such as <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>501 F.2d 1 (9 Cir. 1974); and <em>United States v. Alvarez-Lopez, </em>559 F.2d 1155 (9 Cir. 1977), which contain language hinting at a <em>per se </em>rule, to be cases which in fact did apply the test described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-15\">My difference of opinion concerns the proper application of the test to the facts of this case. The majority concludes it was error to limit Mitchell\u2019s cross-examination but that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. I would hold, as shown below, that although initially it may have been wrong to limit Mitchell\u2019s cross-examination, this mistake was corrected before trial ended, resulting in no error on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>and no occasion to resort to the harmless error standard. In any event, I am in complete agreement that there is no rule that erroneous limitation of cross-examination constitutes <em>per se </em>a violation of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation. If error does exist, it is tested, as the majority states, by the harmless error standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-4\">Limitation of cross-examination cannot be shown to be error if the material sought to be introduced by cross-examination is otherwise adequately presented to the trier of fact during the trial. Recently this same issue arose in <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Cardwell, </em>564 F.2d 1381 (9 Cir. 1977), when a defendant was denied the opportunity to have his attorney cross-examine a prosecution witness about information which was relevant and material to potential impeachment of another prosecution witness. In <em>Skinner </em>we upheld the district judge and held:</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-5\">\u201cThe test, for whether cross-examination about a relevant topic was effective, i. e., whether the trial court has abused its discretion, is <em>whether the jury is otherwise in possession of sufficient information upon which to make a discriminating appraisal of the subject matter at issue.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) <em>Skinner v. Card-well, supra, </em>at 2973.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-6\">Under this test effective cross-examination was not denied to Charles Mitchell. Judge Smith\u2019s opinion explains in detail how the material about which Charles Mitchell sought to cross-examine \u2014 Shelly\u2019s relationship with the police \u2014 was fully explored before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-7\">The fact that this information was brought in by co-defendants\u2019 counsel subsequent to Mitchell\u2019s attempt to introduce it is not determinative. Neither the order of proof at trial nor the identity of the party presenting it is so critical that a mistake of <em>potential </em>constitutional magnitude cannot be corrected if the trial judge notes it and takes corrective action. Of course, in each case we must be sure that the corrective action taken satisfies the standards of the Constitution, but the central problem is not the technical concern of who brought the information before the court or how it was presented. It is whether the relevant subject matter was fully explored before the factfinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-9\">Substantively there is not a great deal of difference in the position taken by Judge Smith and the one I would take. Not mentioned in Judge Smith\u2019s opinion, but I think inherently encompassed in his holding concerning the harmless error, is the concept that if the disputed material is permitted to go before the jury in one way or another either before or after denial of cross-examination to a defendant who seeks to produce that material, the defendant should not be permitted to complain about it. A holding to the effect that there was <em>per se </em>error and that it was immaterial that the evidence got into the record at some other time would wreak havoc in the trial of multi-defendants in major criminal cases.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
