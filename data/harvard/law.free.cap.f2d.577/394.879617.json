(\u201cDean Witter\u201d), a broker and dealer in securities registered with the SEC and a member of the NYSE, employed in Dean Witter\u2019s Chicago office. He had been in the securities business as a salesman for some twenty-six years and had been a vice president of Dean Witter for about seven years. In January of 1975, appellant was assigned responsibility for the account of Mrs. Lillian Park, an 80-year old patient in a nursing home, whose nephew, Harold Burwick, represented her. Due to a clerical error, $10,000 in school district bearer bonds purchased by another customer were posted to Mrs. Park\u2019s account, and the January account statement sent by Dean Witter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Burwick so disclosed. Burwick called appellant about this, and appellant said he would take care of it. However, the bonds continued to show up in Mrs. Park\u2019s monthly account statements. Finally, in June, appellant requested Dean Witter\u2019s New York office to deliver the bonds to the Chicago office. When they arrived near the end of June, appellant, without authority, put them in his safety deposit box. He also requested the firm\u2019s cashier to issue a check to Mrs. Park\u2019s order for $162.50, representing six months\u2019 interest on the bonds which had been erroneously posted to her account. He endorsed Mrs. Park\u2019s name on the check without her knowledge or that of Burwick. He then gave the check to his brother-in-law as a gift for his nephews. The brother-in-law added his endorsement to the check and cashed it. The bonds remained in appellant\u2019s safety deposit box until December 3, 1975, when he presented them for payment at a Chicago bank and received a check for $10,162.50, which he endorsed and deposited to his personal brokerage account at Dean Witter.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">During the annual audit of Dean Witter in December of 1975, the double endorsement on the $162.50 check was routinely questioned, and Burwick advised that the endorsement (which appellant had made) was not that of Mrs. Park. This was brought to the attention of the vice president for operations of Dean Witter\u2019s Chicago office, who then discovered that appellant had requested delivery of the bearer bonds and had signed the delivery ticket. Appellant was contacted in Florida, where he was vacationing, and he flew back to Chicago the following day \u201cto straighten up the matter.\u201d He borrowed some money from his bank and repaid the misappropriated sums to Dean Witter officials. At first he denied that he was solely responsible, alleging that he \u201cwas taken in\u201d by Burwick, who forged Mrs. Park\u2019s name on the $162.50 check and who had agreed to split the proceeds from the bonds. However, he eventually admitted his personal wrongdoing. On January 8, 1976, he was formally discharged by Dean Witter. He then contacted a longtime friend who was the president of Loewi and Co., Inc. (a registered broker and dealer in securities registered with SEC and a member of the NYSE), which hired him on January 16, 1976. His application for qualification as a registered representative with Loewi and Co., Inc. was \u201cconditionally approved\u201d on January 26, 1976, thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">This approval is given subject to the outcome of the Exchange\u2019s investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mr. Allen\u2019s [sic] termination from Dean Witter &amp; Co., Inc. This may result in disciplinary action being taken against him under Rule 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Upon being advised by Dean Witter that appellant had been discharged, the NYSE undertook an investigation. Approximately a year later, on January 28, 1977, after its investigation had been completed, formal proceedings were held before a NYSE hearing panel, which found that appellant had misappropriated bonds from a customer\u2019s account, misappropriated funds from a customer\u2019s account, and endorsed a customer\u2019s name on a check issued to the customer\u2014 without the knowledge or permission of the customer. By a 2-1 majority, the panel voted that appellant \u201cbe permanently barred from employment in any capacity with any member or member organization.\u201d (The minority panelist felt that a $15,000 fine and six months\u2019 suspension was the proper sanction.) The panel\u2019s decision was appealed to the NYSE board of directors which, on November 3, after a hearing, upheld both the findings and sanction. On November 11, the NYSE sent a certified copy of its record to the SEC. On November 9 (obviously in anticipation of that action), appellant appealed the NYSE decision and also sought a stay of the sanction pending the results of his appeal. The stay was denied by the SEC on November 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">\n<em>Jurisdiction of district court (Appeal No. 77-2208)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">Appellant argues that the district court erred in holding that it was precluded from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a) by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78y(a)(l).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He asserts that the \u201cduty of the SEC was to preserve the status quo and grant a stay\u201d pending its decision on the merits; that its failure to do so was an abuse of discretion which has resulted in loss of his \u201cright to earn his livelihood working at the occupation in which he has spent his entire working life\u201d; and that he is being deprived of this right \u201csolely by the action of the private corporation, the NYSE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The Government points out that prior to the 1975 amendments to the Act there was no SEC review of NYSE disciplinary proceedings; that, by enacting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78s(d)(2),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Congress provided for such review, but \u201cconcluded that initiation of such review . . . should not operate as a stay of the exchange\u2019s action unless the Commission expressly orders otherwise\u201d; and that for appellant to \u201csuccessfully invoke the jurisdiction of a district court to interfere in a Commission administrative proceeding, he must demonstrate that the Commission has \u2018so grossly exceeded its powers as to have, in effect, flouted the will of Congress.\u2019 <em>M. G. Davis &amp; Co. v. Cohen, </em>369 F.2d 360, 363 (C.A. 2, 1966).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">We are persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument. Authority for the SEC to \u201csummarily\u201d determine the question of a stay demonstrates the breadth of discretion granted by Congress, and we are unable here to detect any flouting of the will of Congress or other abuse of discretion \u2014 particularly in view of expedited action (within two weeks) by the SEC on appellant\u2019s petition for a stay and (within three and a half weeks) on appellant\u2019s renewed petition, along with no showing of inordinate delay by the SEC in considering the merits of the case. At oral hearing, counsel for the Government stated that a decision was expected around May 15, 1978. <em>Compare Arthur C. Lipper Corp. v. SEC, </em>547 F.2d 171, 184 (2d Cir. 1976). The sanction of which appellant complains, although understandably a hardship, is one to which he voluntarily subjected himself (in the event he violated NYSE rules) when he signed his application and received conditional approval for employment with Loewi and Co., Inc. Finally, rather than placing the blame for loss of his job as a securities salesman on an alleged abuse of discretion by the SEC, appellant should look to his own admitted misappropriation of a customer\u2019s funds and securities and his admitted forgery of a customer\u2019s name on an interest check. Although in his defense before the hearing panel of the NYSE appellant stressed the \u201cFull Disclosure Volunteered By Him,\u201d the record indicates that the \u201chot breath\u201d of an in-house investigation is what prompted the disclosure. <em>United States v. Lustig, </em>163 F.2d 85 (2d Cir. 1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">Appellant\u2019s argument that the SEC has abused its discretion in failing to maintain the status quo by granting a stay appears to rest on his assertion that he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>been left \u201cdangling in suspension\u201d and that this is not required for protection of the investing public. He also complains that the sanction (permanent bar from employment in any capacity with any member firm) imposed by the NYSE rests on the determination of a stockbroker hearing panel that he engaged in conduct \u201cinconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade\u201d in violation of NYSE Rule 345(c)(1), \u201cwith no provision for a stay pending application for review to the Commission.\u201d However, as noted above, the hearing panel\u2019s decision was appealed to the board of directors of the NYSE which upheld both the findings of the panel and the sanction imposed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We are satisfied that the procedural safeguards covering national securities exchanges and.the opportunity for review by the SEC under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78f(d), subject to its discretionary stay of sanctions, satisfy the requirements of due process under the Fifth Amendment. <em>See Todd &amp; Co. v. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, </em>557 F.2d 1008, 1014 (3d Cir. 1977). Also, we do not believe a court should try to outguess the expertise of the administrative agency in determining when protection of the investing public requires that a stay of sanctions be denied. As to protection of the investing public here, we are persuaded by the Government\u2019s response that (1) the SEC had before it, at the time of its consideration of the petitions for stay, the certified NYSE record, which disclosed that appellant had misappropriated a customer\u2019s funds and securities and had forged a customer\u2019s name, and (2) appellant\u2019s \u201cfacile excuse\u201d (note 5, <em>supra) </em>\u201cprovided more than a sufficient basis for the Commission\u2019s determination that the public interest required the NYSE sanction to remain in place.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In view of specific legislation (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78y(a)(l)) covering appeals from SEC actions, we do not believe the Administrative Procedure Act can be relied upon for subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Caiifano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 105, 97 S.Ct. 980, 984,. 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977) (\u201cthe better view is that the APA is not to be interpreted as an implied grant of subject matter jurisdiction to review agency actions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of appellant\u2019s action was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">\n<em>Reviewability of SEC order denying petition for stay of sanction pending SEC review of disciplinary action by NYSE (Appeal No. 78-1022)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">Appellant argues that 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78y(c)(2)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cexpressly makes denial of a stay [by the SEC] an independent grant of appellate jurisdiction to this Court.\u201d Citing <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 149-54, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1515-18, 18 L.Ed.2d 681, 692-94 (1967), he states that the Supreme Court has endorsed interlocutory action under the Administrative Procedure Act in a case such as this, where (1) the issues are overwhelmingly legal, (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>agency action has an immediate and substantial impact on the complaining party, and (3) action by the court will not delay or impede effective enforcement of the Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78y(c)(2) relates to stay of a <em>final </em>order or rule, based on a petition filed under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78y(a)(l), <em>supra </em>note 3. Obviously, the SEC\u2019s order of November 23,1977, is not a final order; nor is the SEC order of March 6, 1978, denying a renewed petition for stay filed February 10, 1978. Appellant vigorously maintains that the SEC order denying a stay is \u201cripe\u201d for judicial review. Perhaps so, but, Congress has not seen fit to grant this court jurisdiction to review an interlocutory order of the SEC denying a request for a stay pending its consideration of a case on the merits. <em>Cf. United States v. Georgia Pacific Corp., </em>562 F.2d 294, 296 (4th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Accordingly, we hold that the SEC order denying appellant\u2019s petition for stay of sanction is not, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances not here present, reviewable by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The Government maintains that even if the SEC\u2019s denial order were reviewable, the principal grounds<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> cited by appellant were not raised before the SEC and therefore, may not be considered by this court (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78y(c)(l)). <em>Stead v. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, </em>444 F.2d 713, 716 (10th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 1059, 92 S.Ct. 739, 30 L.Ed.2d 746 (1972); <em>Pennalunna &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, </em>410 F.2d 861, 870 (9th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 1007, 90 S.Ct. 562, 24 L.Ed.2d 499 (1970). This is asserted to be the case even if the ground involves an alleged infringement of the right of due process under the Fifth Amendment. <em>Gilligan, Will &amp; Co. v. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, </em>267 F.2d 461, 468 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>361 U.S. 896, 80 S.Ct. 200, 4 L.Ed.2d 152 (1959). However, appellant quotes a dictum from the opinion in <em>Califano </em>v. <em>Sanders, supra, </em>at 109, 97 S.Ct. at 986, in arguing to the contrary:</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">Constitutional questions obviously are unsuited to resolution in administrative hearing procedures and, therefore, access to the courts is essential to the decision of such questions. . . . [Wjhen constitutional questions are in issue, the availability of judicial review is presumed, and we will not read a statutory scheme to take the \u201cextraordinary\u201d step of foreclosing jurisdiction unless Congress\u2019 intent to do so is manifested by \u201c \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 \u201d evidence. [Citing <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 762, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2465, 45 L.Ed.2d 522, 536, 537 (1975).]</p>\n<p id=\"Azy\">Even if we were to accept appellant\u2019s premise that extraordinary circumstances demand consideration of his constitutional argument by this court, we have already concluded that there was more than a sufficient basis for the SEC\u2019s determination that the public interest required the NYSE sanction to remain in effect. <em>See Berdahl v. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, </em>572 F.2d 643 (8th Cir. 1978). Grounds other than constitutional ones are, of course, clearly barred from our consideration if not raised below.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">In No. 77-2208, the order of the district court dismissing appellant\u2019s action is affirmed. In No. 78-1022, appellant\u2019s petition to this court is dismissed. '</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-13\">.

Each appropriate regulatory agency shall establish for appropriate cases an expedited procedure for consideration and determination of the question of a stay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b486-4\">. It is noted that appellant\u2019s defense before the hearing panel of the NYSE was based, in part, on his argument that \u201cineptitude and gross negligence\u201d and \u201cmismanagement and sloppy practice\u201d of Dean Witter, his employer at the time of the violations, brought about the conditions that tempted him to engage in illegal conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b486-5\">. Appellant argues that, at the time of his petition for stay, he had been \u201cback selling securities to the investing public for 21 months\u201d and that the SEC \u201cknew that not a single complaint had been made\u201d during that period. However, the Government observes that appellant\u2019s accounts during that 21-month period were scrutinized by the vice chairman of the board of directors of Loewi and Co., Inc., and that with this and the pending investigation, appellant would have been foolish to attempt further defalcations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b486-11\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78y(c)(2), which is section 25(c)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">The filing of a petition under this section does not operate as a stay of the Commission\u2019s order or rule. Until the court\u2019s jurisdiction becomes exclusive, the Commission may stay its order or rule pending judicial review if it finds that justice so requires. After the filing of a petition under this section, the court, on whatever conditions may be required and to the extent necessary to prevent irreparable injury, may issue all necessary and appropriate process to stay the order or rule or to preserve status or rights pending its review; but ... no such process may be issued by the court before the filing of the record . . . unless: (A) the Commission has denied a stay or failed to grant requested relief. .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\">. Appellant also cites <em>Aquavella v. Richardson, </em>437 F.2d 397, 404-05 (2d Cir. 1971) (\u201cWhether an agency action is final for purposes of the APA should not depend on semantic characterizations but rather on a careful evaluation of the separate but coordinate functions of courts and administrative agencies and of the impact of the challenged action on the parties.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b487-9\">. These are: that there is a conflict between Rule 345 of the NYSE and the 1975 amendments; that 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78s(d)(2), supra note 4, as applied here deprives appellant of liberty and property in violation of the Fifth Amendment; and that the NYSE panels failed to apply the standard prescribed by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78f(c)(3)(B) \u2014 practices inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade <em>and </em>a reasonable likelihood that the person involved will again engage in such practices.
