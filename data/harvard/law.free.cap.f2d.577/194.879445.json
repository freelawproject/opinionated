Goettel in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This appeal primarily involves nuances regarding the admissibility of other crimes evidence that were not dealt with in our recent companion decisions in <em>United States v. Benedetto, </em>571 F.2d 1246 (2d Cir. 1978), and <em>United States v. Gubelman, </em>571 F.2d 1252 (2d Cir. 1978). We affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b284-15\">Appellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence against him. The Government\u2019s case was principally based on the testimony of a co-conspirator named Theodore Simmons, who was a bank teller at a branch office of the Bank of New York. From the evidence, the jury could have found the following: On April 14, 1975, appellant, Simmons and the other co-conspirators <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> met to formulate plans for \u201crobbing\u201d the bank at which Simmons worked.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When Simmons indicated his reluctance to act as the \u201cinside\u201d man, appellant reassured Simmons by saying \u201cYou know, the FBI are dumb and, you know, I did bank jobs before.\u201d Appellant also actively participated in discussing the details of the larceny, which, at appellant\u2019s suggestion, was carried out the following day. At that time, one of the conspirators approached the teller window where Simmons worked, handed him a note which read \u201cMoney Insured \u2014 Life Isn\u2019t \u2014 All Big Bills,\u201d and quickly left the bank with money handed over by Simmons. While none of the witnesses testified that they had seen Williams at the scene of the crime, Simmons stated that another co-conspirator had said that he and appellant had been outside the bank with a shotgun during the commission of the larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-16\">The Government attempted in several ways to bolster its case against appellant, which was based principally on Simmons\u2019 testimony. First, the prosecution introduced Simmons\u2019 telephone book, which contained the number of appellant\u2019s brother-in-law, who had previously testified that appellant had resided with him during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>time period of the conspiracy. Such evidence corroborated Simmons\u2019 story and also incriminated appellant further, since an FBI agent testified that Williams had falsely denied knowing Simmons at the time of his arrest. Next, Simmons testified to an arguably incriminating conversation with Williams several months after the larceny and after Simmons had been arrested. Finally, the Government produced evidence of appellant\u2019s conviction in 1972 for receipt of the proceeds of a bank robbery.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Appellant most strenuously challenges the admission of his prior conviction. In <em>United States v. Benedetto, </em>supra, and <em>United States v. Gubelman, </em>supra, we set forth at some length the analysis to be applied by the district courts in deciding whether to admit other crimes evidence. Under both our prior precedents and the Federal Rules of Evidence, the trial judge must first find that the proffered evidence is relevant to some issue at trial other than to show that the defendant is a bad man.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Then, if the judge finds the evidence is relevant, he must also determine that the probative worth of, and the Government\u2019s need for, the evidence is not substantially outweighed by its prejudice to the defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See id. at 1254; <em>United States v. Benedetto, </em>supra, 571 F.2d at 1248-49. Only when both of these tests have been affirmatively satisfied is the evidence properly admitted. However, when the trial tourt has carefully made the requisite analysis, the exercise of his broad discretion will not be lightly overturned. See <em>United States v. Deaton, </em>381 F.2d 114, 118 n. 3 (2d Cir. 1967). And we note at the outset that this consideration is especially pertinent here, since Judge Goettel was presiding over appellant\u2019s retrial and was therefore uniquely well situated to pass on the admissibility of the prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">The district court ruled that the pri- or conviction was relevant to corroborate Simmons\u2019 testimony that appellant had previously robbed banks and also to demonstrate appellant\u2019s intent in participating in the planning of the larceny. As to the latter ground, appellant claims that intent was not genuinely contested and that therefore the prior conviction should not have been admitted under this theory. In the past, we have indicated that other crimes evidence is inadmissible to prove intent when that issue is not really in dispute. See <em>United States v. DeCicco, </em>435 F.2d 478, 483-84 (2d Cir. 1970); accord, <em>United States v. Ring, </em>513 F.2d 1001, 1006-10 (6th Cir. 1975). Thus, the question of intent will usually not be in issue if the defendant takes the stand and, as his sole defense, claims that he did not commit the alleged acts at all. See <em>United States v. Benedetto, </em>supra, 571 F.2d at 1249; <em>United States v. Gubelman, </em>supra, 571 F.2d at 1254 n. 8. However, in this case, the testimony linking appellant to the conspiracy was subject to an innocent interpretation and appellant, who presented no evidence, did not affirmatively take the issue of intent out of the case. Accordingly, the district judge did not err in allowing the Government to introduce evidence on that point. See <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>382 F.2d 280, 281 (2d Cir. 1967); see also <em>United States v. Freedman, </em>445 F.2d 1220, 1224 (2d Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">Indeed, a review of the trial record shows that the question of appellant\u2019s in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>tent was in contention, since the Government\u2019s inability to produce direct evidence of appellant\u2019s presence at the scene of the crime focused attention on Simmons\u2019 recollection of the conspirators\u2019 meeting of April 14, 1975. In summation, appellant\u2019s counsel was able to suggest that, contrary to Simmons\u2019 allegedly unreliable testimony, Williams had not attended the crucial meeting, and moreover, that even if he had, such attendance did not constitute intentional participation in a conspiracy to commit bank larceny.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We agree with Judge Goet-tel that the evidence of appellant\u2019s prior conviction was probative of his intent because it tended to \u201cshow that [appellant was] not just sitting around talking wild stories, that [he] really did intend to carry out a robbery . . . .\u201d See <em>United States v. Cavallaro, </em>553 F.2d 300, 305 (2d Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Miranda, </em>526 F.2d 1319, 1331 (2d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 821, 97 S.Ct. 69, 50 L.Ed.2d 82 (1976) ; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kirk, </em>528 F.2d 1057, 1060-61 (5th Cir. 1976); 2 Wein-stein\u2019s Evidence 11404[09], at 404-50 to -51 (1977) .</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The district court also regarded the other crimes evidence as relevant to corroborate crucial accomplice testimony. As stated above, Simmons averred that his doubts concerning the feasibility of robbing his bank were allayed by appellant\u2019s assurance of expertise based upon prior experience, and appellant\u2019s prior conviction obviously corroborated that portion of Simmons\u2019 story. While Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), see note 5 supra, does not specifically refer to corroboration as an example of the use of other crimes evidence, this is not controlling. The categories listed in Rule 404(b) are not exhaustive, see 2 Weinstein\u2019s Evidence 1404[08], at 404 \u2014 42 (1977), and we have long been committed to the inclusory form of the rule, so \u201cthat evidence of other crimes is admissible, if relevant, except when offered solely to prove criminal character.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Papadakis, </em>510 F.2d 287, 294 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 950, 95 S.Ct. 1682, 44 L.Ed.2d 104 (1975). Nonetheless, appellant claims that the other crimes evidence was inadmissible under the rubric of corroboration because it failed to prove a \u201cconsequential fact.\u201d However, the prior conviction strongly bolstered a key portion of Simmons\u2019 inculpatory testimony and thereby tended through a series of direct inferences to prove appellant\u2019s participation in the conspiracy \u2014 the ultimate fact to be proved by the Government. The admission of such other crimes evidence has been repeatedly approved in this circuit. See, e. g., <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>562 F.2d 1345, 1358 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, <em>Salley v. United States, </em>432 U.S. 909, 97 S.Ct. 2958, 53 L.Ed.2d 1083 and <em>Ramsey v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 853, 98 S.Ct. 170, 54 L.Ed.2d 124; <em>Green v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 853, 98 S.Ct. 170, 54 L.Ed.2d 124 (1977); <em>United States v. Bermudez, </em>526 F.2d 89, 96 (2d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 970, 96 S.Ct. 2166, 48 L.Ed.2d 793 (1976); <em>United States v. Eliano, </em>522 F.2d 201 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Stolzenberg, </em>493 F.2d 53, 54 (2d Cir. 1974); <em>United States v. Bozza, </em>365 F.2d 206, 213-14 (2d Cir. 1966). We recognize that the other crimes evidence in many of these cases was admissible on grounds additional to corroboration. Nevertheless, logic and the inclusory form of Rule 404(b) do not suggest exclusion of similar acts even if the trial court finds that such evidence is relevant only for corroboration purposes, provided that the corroboration is direct and the matter cdrroborated is significant. Therefore, even if we had not already found that the prior conviction was probative of intent, we would still affirm the district judge\u2019s exercise of discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">Appellant further contends that even if the prior conviction was relevant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the district court erred in not excluding it because of its prejudicial effect. However, the trial judge has broad discretion under Rule 403, see note 6 supra, to admit relevant other crimes evidence. See, e. g., <em>United States v. Gubelman, </em>supra, 571 F.2d at 1255-56; accord, <em>United States v. Fair-child, </em>526 F.2d 185, 189 (7th Cir. 1975) (Stevens, <em>J.), </em>cert. denied, 425 U.S. 942, 96 S.Ct. 1682, 48 L.Ed.2d 186 (1976). Judge Goettel waited until the close of the Government\u2019s case before admitting the prior conviction. We find no error in this exercise of discretion, since the probative value of the evidence was not \u201csubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice\u201d to appellant. Fed.R.Evid. 403, Simmons\u2019 revelation of appellant\u2019s self-proclaimed experience in robbing banks, to which appellant did not object at trial, minimized the prejudicial impact of actually proving the prior conviction. By comparison, evidence of the latter was both probative of appellant\u2019s intentional participation in the April 14 meeting of the conspirators and corroborative of an important detail in the testimony of the key witness against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Appellant\u2019s last contention concerning other crimes evidence focuses upon the allegedly erroneous jury instructions given by the district court regarding the prior conviction. However, Judge Goettel specifically charged the jury that they could not consider Williams\u2019s prior conviction as bearing upon his intent unless they first found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant had actually participated in the planning of the bank robbery. The district judge also indicated that the prior conviction had been admitted to substantiate Simmons\u2019 testimony. Viewed as a whole, the jury instructions and charge sufficiently explained the proper limited purposes of the other crimes evidence, while repeatedly warning the jurors not to consider it as indicating appellant\u2019s propensity to commit the crimes for which he had been indicted. These instructions were substantially correct. While it is true that following them required considerable mental agility, courts assume that jurors possess that ability. In this instance\u2014 as elsewhere in the law \u2014 we will not presume that the jury was either unwilling or unable to follow Judge Goettel\u2019s charge. In sum, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-18\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b287-19\">Finally, appellant claims that the district court erroneously admitted a post-conspiracy conversation between Simmons and appellant. Simmons testified that, after appellant had acknowledged hearing about Simmons\u2019 arrest, appellant had remained silent when Simmons stated that \u201cyou [Williams] don\u2019t have to worry, because I haven\u2019t told anyone about you or Carson, so you are in the clear.\u201d Appellant urges that this conversation was inadmissible hearsay, since the statements offered into evidence were not made \u201cduring the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy,\u201d as required by Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E). The Government concedes that this Rule is inapplicable, but argues that the conversation was properly allowed into evidence as (a) non-hearsay statements under Rule 801(c) because they were not \u201coffered to prove the truth of the matter asserted,\u201d and (b) an adoptive admission under Rule 801(d)(2)(B).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>. Since we agree with the latter proposition, we do not reach the merits of the former.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>In <em>United States v. Flecha, </em>supra, 539 F.2d at 876-77, this court addressed a situation in which one of several co-defendants under arrest apparently turned to another and said in Spanish, \u201cWhy so much excitement? If we are caught, we are caught.\u201d We there concluded that in light of the custodial circumstances it was not likely that the appellant would have responded to such a vaguely phrased comment and that, therefore, Rule 801(d)(2)(B) was inapplicable. Here, however, Williams and Simmons met in the street. If appellant had truly been an innocent bystander, it is more probable than not that he would have vigorously asserted his non-involvement in the conspiracy when told that, unlike those already arrested, he was in the clear because his larcenous participation had not been betrayed to the authorities. Since this natural reply was not forthcoming, we hold that the conversation constituted an adoptive admission within the circumscribed purview of Rule 801(d)(2)(B). See <em>United States v. Flecha, </em>supra; <em>United States v. King, </em>560 F.2d 122, 134 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 925, 98 S.Ct. 404, 54 L.Ed.2d 283 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">We have carefully considered all of appellant\u2019s contentions and find them to be without merit. The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-11\">. Appellant\u2019s prior trial, also before Judge Goettel, resulted in a hung jury. In his second trial, appellant was acquitted of the substantive offense of bank larceny, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b). The judge imposed a 4\u2018A year prison sentence for the conspiracy conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-17\">. Simmons and two other conspirators, Carson Corley and Fred Attaway, pleaded guilty. Before appellant\u2019s first trial, however, Attaway died of gunshot wounds. The Government entered nolle prosequi orders as to two other alleged conspirators.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b284-18\">. Since the bank funds were handed over by a conspirator (Simmons), the crime was bank larceny and not bank robbery. Compare 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) with id. \u00a7 2113(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\">. Appellant rested without presenting any evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b285-8\">. See Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b285-14\">. See Fed.R.Evid. 403, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-15\">Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b286-8\">. Counsel argued as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">I want to suggest to you, ladies and gentlemen, that mere presence, assuming you believe Earl Williams was present on April 14, 1975, that mere presence at a place where a conversation is taking place concerning a bank robbery, mere presence is not a crime; nor is association with people who may have committed crimes in the past a crime . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b287-7\">. That Rule provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">(d) A statement is not hearsay if\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">(2) The statement is offered against a party and is . (B)\u2019 a statement of which he has manifested his adoption or belief in its truth .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b287-13\">. The Government contends that the statements were introduced to show appellant\u2019s state of mind at the time of his arrest over a year later, which in turn explains why he presumably felt safe at that time in falsely denying to the FBI that he knew Simmons. Under this theory, the truth or falsity of Simmons\u2019 statement that appellant was \u201cin the clear\u201d is immaterial. We do not pass on this contention, although we note that, assuming that Simmons\u2019 comment was admissible to show appellant\u2019s later state of mind, it is not readily apparent why his failure to respond to Simmons\u2019 statement would also be admissible on this theory. See <em>United States v. Flecha, </em>539 F.2d 874, 878 (2d Cir. 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
