For the reasons stated below, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">Plaintiff was born on May 13, 1910, and has a sixth grade education. He worked in the nation\u2019s underground coal mines for forty-two years. The cause of his retirement from mining in 1970 was a severe back injury which he received in an accident on the job. On account of this back injury, he and his wife had been receiving Social Security total disability benefits since 1970, under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423, 402(b), and Gastineau individually has also been receiving Workmen\u2019s Compensation benefits since 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">In 1970 plaintiff also filed applications for black lung benefits pursuant to the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>His claim was denied initially and was again denied after the review required by the 1972 amendments to the Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 941. He requested a hearing, which was granted, and an Administrative Law Judge determined, apparently on the basis of positive X-rays, that Gastineau was entitled to black lung benefits. On its own motion, the Appeals Council submitted Gastineau\u2019s X-rays to Dr. W. P. Montgomery, a Dipl\u00f3mate in Internal Medicine and a consulting certified reader, who reread the X-rays as negative for pneumoconiosis. On this basis, the Appeals Council reversed the decision of the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">In seeking review in the District Court, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(b), <em>incorporating </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), Gastineau claimed, first, that he was entitled to an irrebuttable presumption of disability under 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(3),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and second, that he was entitled to a rebut-table presumption of disability under 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment from which judgment Gasti-neau now appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Plaintiff Gastineau\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that he was entitled to the rebuttable presumption of 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(4), which provides that (1) if a miner has been employed for fifteen years or more in the nation\u2019s underground coal mines, and (2) if the X-rays submitted in connection with his claim have been read as negative, but (3) \u201cif other evidence demonstrates the existence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment,\u201d then there is a rebuttable presumption that the miner is totally disabled by pneumoconiosis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">It is undisputed that plaintiff satisfies the first two elements of the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">First, he was employed underground for forty-two years. Second, all of the X-rays submitted by Gastineau were reread as negative by Dr. W. P. Montgomery, a certified reader and consultant to the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals. On the basis of this negative X-ray evidence, Gasti-neau\u2019s application under 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(3) was properly denied. It is not the function of this Court to resolve conflicts in the medical evidence, but rather it is the function of the Secretary, whose expertise is given great deference. <em>E. g., Seacrist </em>v. <em>Weinberger, </em>538 F.2d 1054, 1056-57 (4th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">A substantial questipn exists however, whether \u201cother evidence demonstrates the existence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment,\u201d the third criterion of \u00a7 921(c)(4). The regulation implementing this section, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.-414(b)(1), incorporates by reference \u00a7 410.-422(b) and \u00a7 410.426(a), which require that in order to be within the scope of the Act, a chronic respiratory or pulmonary impairment must be shown by the claimant to be the <em>primary cause </em>of the claimant\u2019s total disability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Ansel v. Weinberger, </em>529 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>F.2d 304, 308-09 (6th Cir. 1976); <em>Cope v. Mathews, </em>415 F.Supp. 467, 469 (E.D.Tenn. 1976); <em>Arbonaise v. Weinberger, </em>401 F.Supp. 983, 990 (N.D.W.Va.1975); <em>Baker v. Secretary of HEW, </em>383 F.Supp. 1095, 1100-01 (W.D.Va.1974). <em>Cf. Koski v. Weinber-ger, </em>401 F.Supp. 990, 994 (N.D.W.Va.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">This burden has not been carried by plaintiff in the present case. Plaintiff has not shown the existence of a totally disabling chronic respiratory or pulmonary impairment, lacking both (A) medical evidence of the existence of such impairment, \u00a7 410.-424, and (B) medical evidence with respect to the requirement that the impairment be the primary cause of the disability, \u00a7 410.-426.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">First, the physical examinations performed on August 3, 1973 by Dr. Allen and on January 13, 1974 by Dr. Odom, both found plaintiff\u2019s lungs \u201cclear to ascultation and percussion.\u201d Neither found cyanosis or clubbing or any other significant impairment. Dr. Odom\u2019s pulmonary function study showed only a \u201cmild\u201d impairment, and the result of the study by Dr. Van Lith on July 30, 1972, was \u201cnormal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">We note that Dr. Odom did state that plaintiff was \u201ctotally and permanently disabled for coal mining and work in a dusty environment.\u201d This statement however, was based at least in part on X-rays that were later reread as negative. Dr. Clarke on December 10, 1973, and Dr. Martin on November 7, 1973, also found total disability on the basis of X-rays later reread as negative; and Dr. Clarke\u2019s pulmonary function studies were rejected as not meeting the standards of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.430. Furthermore, such statements by physicians are not determinative of the ultimate question whether plaintiff is disabled, the decision of which is the function and responsibility of the Secretary. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.471.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">We also note the lay testimony of plaintiff and his wife that Gastineau has a serious breathing problem which interferes with his sleep and has curtailed his physical activities. Further, we note Gastineau\u2019s testimony that his breathing problems had begun to interfere with his mining work as early as a year before his back injury forced him to leave the mines.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">This lay evidence, coupled with the \u201cmild\u201d impairment found by Dr. Odom, and the diagnosis by Dr. Snyder dated January 24, 1973, of \u201cchronic bronchitis,\u201d might together establish a compensable impairment were it not for the substantial contrary medical evidence credited by the Secretary. The Appeals Council found:</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">The credible evidence, including X-ray interpretations, pulmonary function study results and other relevant evidence of record, does not demonstrate significantly impaired lung function as a result of chronic respiratory or pulmonary condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">We hold that this finding was supported by substantial evidence on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b453-16\">Second, plaintiff has not carried his burden under \u00a7\u00a7 410.414(b)(1) and 410.426(a) of proving that his respiratory impairment was \u201ctotally disabling\u201d in the sense that it was the primary cause of his total disability. Gastineau\u2019s departure from the mines was the result of an injury to his back incurred in a mining accident, causing a herniated lumbar disc which required surgery. He did not leave the mines because of any black lung ailment. At the time of the hearing of this case, plaintiff and his wife were receiving a total of $505.30 per month in Social Security and Workmen\u2019s Compensation disability benefits for this injury. In his Application for Benefits Under The Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Act of 1969, Gastineau described his disability as \u201cback injury \u2014 disc problems\u201d and indicated that he was at that time receiving Social Security Disability benefits. Since that time he has also been receiving Workmen\u2019s Compensation benefits. The record is not clear whether those benefits of $505.30 monthly have been increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Although a finding of a disability by another agency is not determinative, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.470, it can nevertheless lend some support to the Secretary\u2019s determination. <em>Cope v. Mathews, supra </em>at 470 n. 2.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">A determination of whether a miner is totally disabled should be made from all of the facts of the case. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.-422(c). Considering the fact that the evidence was in conflict with respect to whether the plaintiff was totally disabled within the meaning of the Act, from any black lung ailment, and considering the strong evidence that plaintiff was totally disabled by his back injuries, we affirm the finding of the District Court that the evidence \u201cadequately supports the Appeals Council\u2019s implicit conclusion that the primary reason for plaintiff\u2019s [disability] is not his lung condition,\u201d and its conclusion that therefore, plaintiff Gastineau has not demonstrated the existence of a totally disabling condition within the scope of 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(4) and 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.426(a). We do not know how a claimant can be totally and permanently disabled more than once.</p>\n<p id=\"ajy-dedup-1\">For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-11\">. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(3) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">(3) if a miner is suffering or suffered from a chronic dust disease of the lung which (A) when diagnosed by chest roentgenogram, yields one or more large opacities (greater than one centimeter in diameter) and would be classified in category A, B, or C in the International Classification of Radiographs of the Pneumoconioses by the International Labor Organization, (B) when diagnosed by biopsy or autopsy, yields massive lesions in the lung, or (C) when diagnosis is made by other means, would be a condition which could reasonably be expected to yield results described in clause (A) or (B) if diagnosis had been made in the manner prescribed in clause (A) or (B), then there shall be an irrebuttable presumption that he is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis or that his death was due to pneumoconiosis, or that at the time of his death he was totally disabled by pneumoconiosis, as the case may be. .</p>\n<p id=\"b451-16\">This section is implemented by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.414(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b451-18\">. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(4) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b451-19\">(4) If a miner was employed for fifteen years or more in one or more underground coal mines, and if there is a chest roentgeno-gram submitted in connection with such miner\u2019s, his widow\u2019s, his child\u2019s, his parent\u2019s, his brother\u2019s, his sister\u2019s, or his dependent\u2019s claim under this subchapter and it is interpreted as negative with respect to the requirements of paragraph (3) of this subsection, and if other evidence demonstrates the existence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment, then there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis, that his death was due to pneumoconiosis or that at the time of his death he was totally disabled by pneumoconiosis. In the case of a living miner, a wife\u2019s affidavit may not be used by itself to establish the presumption. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>The Secretary shall not apply all or a portion of the requirement of this paragraph that the miner work in an underground mine where he determines that conditions of a miner\u2019s employment in a coal mine other than an underground mine were substantially similar to conditions in an underground mine.

The preponderance of the medical and other relevant evidence does not demonstrate that the claimant is totally disabled as a result of pneumoconiosis. Neither does such evidence demonstrate a totally disabling chronic respiratory or pulmonary impairment which could give rise to the presumption of total disability due to pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-18\">DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b452-19\">It is the decision of the Appeals Council that, based on his application filed on April 14, 1970, the claimant is not entitled to black lung benefits based on total disability under title IV, section 411 (30 USC \u00a7 921) of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as amended. The decision of the administrative law judge is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-20\">We hold that these findings are supported by substantial evidence and that the statutory presumption, if it had been raised, would therefore have been rebutted. <em>See Prokes v.

He is now 67 years old. He is receiving Social Security disability benefits based on a back injury. Nonetheless, the black lung statute does not exclude benefits for one who is receiving other types of assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">In this case there was sufficient evidence at the hearing to convince the Administrative Law Judge that he had pneumoconiosis and was entitled to black lung benefits. There was testimony that he had begun to have breathing problems before the back injury which occasioned his leaving the job. Three doctors who examined him and read X-rays diagnosed second stage silicosis; a fourth found chronic bronchitis. Four doctors conducted pulmonary function studies. Two found that his breathing capacity was impaired under HEW regulations. Two found it was not. The two who found impairment conducted their examinations later than the two who found no impairment. After the Administrative Law Judge found total disability and awarded benefits, the Appeals Council asked its own consultant, described to us as a Board certified X-ray reader, to review the X-rays <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>relied upon by the three doctors below. Reporting on the same X-rays, this reader found that two showed no pneumoconiosis and held that the third X-ray was not readable.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Appellant contends that he is entitled to an irrebuttable presumption because there was evidence presented by him in this record that he had complicated pneumoconio-sis. He argues that that fact alone, disregarding all other evidence to the contrary, requires the application of the irrebuttable presumption and, hence, the award of benefits. <em>(See </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(3) (Supp. V 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">I find no need to pass on the question of whether the statute should be given this reading (although as it is written, it is amenable to appellant\u2019s construction). On the facts in this record and this court\u2019s holding in <em>Ansel v. Weinberger, </em>529 F.2d 304 (6th Cir. 1976), appellant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption, based on 15 years of work in the coal mines (appellant had 42), that he had pneumoconiosis and that he was totally disabled thereby. <em>See </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(4) (Supp. V1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">In the <em>Ansel </em>case we held:</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">The court further concludes that there is no substantial basis for the finding that Claude Ansel did not establish that he was totally disabled within the definition of the Black Lung Act. His treating physician stated unequivocally that Ansel was totally disabled for work in a coal mine. No other medical witness contradicted this statement, and the lay testimony supported Dr. Bope\u2019s opinion. The witness Otto White testified that he began working in the mines with Claude Ansel in 1933 and that Ansel was one of the best workers. Mr. White had continued to see Ansel \u201ca couple of times a month\u201d after they left the mine. He testified that even while walking downhill it was necessary for Mr. Ansel to stop and rest after 50 feet or so, and that his condition had gotten \u201ca lot worse\u201d in the last five years. The administrative law judge received this testimony as competent \u201cother evidence\u201d and considered it along with the medical evidence and the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Ansel. He did not construe amended 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(b) as permitting lay testimony of persons other than the miner\u2019s wife only in cases where the miner is deceased. This is a reasonable construction. Since disability of a living miner may not be established by the wife\u2019s testimony alone under Section 921(c)(4), other lay evidence must have been contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">There is no evidence in the record from which it could be concluded that at the time of his hearing Claude Ansel could engage \u201c . . . in gainful employment requiring the skills and abilities comparable to those of any employment in a mine or mines in which he previously engaged with some regularity and over a substantial period of time.\u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(f). Though fluoroscopy disclosed an early stage of silicosis, a condition included within the definition of pneumo-coniosis in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.110(o), the applicant\u2019s chest X-rays were interpreted as negative with respect to the requirements of 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(3) for an irrebuttable presumption of pneumoconi-osis. Thus he relied on the rebuttable presumption of Section 921(c)(4). Giving primary consideration to the medical evidence and considering the lay testimony concerning the limitations on Mr. Ansel\u2019s physical activities, all in light of Ansel\u2019s age, education and work experience, we hold that this record \u201cdemonstrates the existence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment. . . . \u201d Section 921(c)(4). Since the Act provides that when these conditions are met \u201cthere shall be a rebuttable presumption that such miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis ...\u201d <em>Id., </em>the contrary finding of the administrative law judge affirmed by the district court was clearly erroneous unless the Secretary may be held to have rebutted the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">The Secretary contends that the presumption was rebutted by evidence which established that Claude Ansel did not have pneumoconiosis. He relies on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>negative findings of three radiologists who examined X-rays and the pulmonary studies. It is obvious that the negative X-rays may not be relied upon to rebut the presumption of Section 921(c)(4). If he had been able to produce a positive X-ray, there would have been no need to invoke the presumption. The very existence of a negative X-ray is a prerequisite to reliance upon the presumption of pneu-moconiosis as established by other evidence. Furthermore, under the 1972 amendment, negative X-ray evidence may not be the sole basis for a denial of benefits. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(b). Nor do we believe the presumption of Section 921(c)(4) can be rebutted by showing that pneumoconiosis was not established by pulmonary function studies. The regulation which establishes the levels required for a finding of disabling pneumoconiosis on the basis of a ventilatory study does not purport to provide proof of the nonexistence of pneumoconiosis. Once Claude Ansel produced evidence which entitled him to the presumption of Section 921(c)(4), that presumption could be rebutted only by establishing that he did not have pneumoconiosis, there being no contention that his impairment did not arise out of employment in the mines. In view of the unequivocal testimony of Dr. Bope, it appears that the Secretary would have been required at least to produce a medical opinion that Mr. Ansel did not have pneumoconiosis in order to rebut the presumption. No such testimony appears in this record. <em>See Whitson v. Finch, </em>437 F.2d 728, 732 (6th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><em>Ansel </em>v. <em>Weinberger, supra </em>at 309-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">What was said in <em>Ansel </em>is dispositive of this case and requires our reversal of the District Court and remand for award of benefits. I would vacate the judgment and remand to the District Court for remand to the Secretary to award benefits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
