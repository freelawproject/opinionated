The defendant/appellant United States (hereinafter referred to as \u201cdefendant\u201d) owned certain water towers on that installation which were to be repainted. A contract for the repainting was awarded to Royal Painting Company. Plaintiffs employer, Rumsey Steeplejacks, subcontracted with Royal Painting Company to perform the necessary sandblasting.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Plaintiff was allegedly injured while sandblasting on a catwalk of one of the water towers about one hundred feet above the ground when he came in contact with bare electric wires protruding from the open end of a piece of conduit pipe and was rendered unconscious by electric shock from the wires. Plaintiff, it is alleged, was further injured during the ensuing rescue attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Pursuant to government regulations, 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 1-10.502-1 both the general contractor, Royal Painting Company, and the subcontractor, Rumsey Steeplejacks, were required to maintain adequate workmen\u2019s compensation insurance which could not be cancelled without prior notice to defendant United States. Such insurance was in effect at the time plaintiff was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Plaintiff filed an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346, 2671 <em>et seq., </em>alleging negligence on the part of defendant in the maintaining of an unreasonably dangerous condition and further negligence in the conduct of plaintiff\u2019s rescue after he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">The defendant United States filed a motion to dismiss alleging that it was entitled to immunity from third-party tortfeasor suits as a \u201cstatutory employer\u201d under Florida workmen\u2019s compensation law, citing <em>Roelofs </em>v. <em>United States, </em>501 F.2d 87 (5th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied </em>423 U.S. 830, 96 S.Ct. 49, 46 L.Ed.2d 47 (1975). The motion to dismiss was granted by the District Court, and that Order is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">Because the accident in question occurred in Florida, the Florida law of workmen\u2019s compensation controls this action. Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674, the United States is liable \u201cin the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\u201d Further, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 290 mandates that the workmen\u2019s compensation provisions of the State in which a federal installation is located shall apply within that installation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">Two Florida statutes are applicable. F.S.A. \u00a7 440.10 requires that every employer within the provisions of the law must provide workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. In a construction situation, a general contractor and all subcontractors are deemed to be engaged in the same enterprise, and the general contractor is liable for compensation payments for all the employees, including those of subcontractors which the general contractor has not required to maintain workmen\u2019s compensation coverage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the general contractor may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>referred to as a \u201cstatutory employer\u201d or a \u201ccommon employer\u201d. F.S.A. \u00a7 440.11 provides that the workmen\u2019s compensation coverage required by \u00a7 440.10 shall constitute the exclusive liability of the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">The decision of the lower court upholding the \u201cstatutory employer\u201d defense proffered by defendant cannot stand because: (1) the exclusivity defense of \u00a7 440.11 is available only to one who has a <em>duty </em>to provide workmen\u2019s compensation coverage; and (2) the United States in this case had no such duty for it was neither an employer nor a \u201ccontractor\u201d within the meaning of F.S.A. \u00a7 440.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Under Florida law, the fact that the defendant voluntarily required the contractor and subcontractor to maintain workmen\u2019s compensation insurance is \u201ccommendable\u201d, but does not entitle the United States to the exclusivity defense of \u00a7 440.11. In Florida, an employer is entitled to the exclusivity defense only to the extent that such employer has a <em>duty </em>to provide workmen\u2019s compensation coverage. In <em>Jones v. Florida Power Corp., </em>72 So.2d 285, 287 (Fla. 1954), the Supreme Court of Florida wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"A4j\">The fact that the Corporation [owner] in its contracts with Grinnell and Burns [general contractors] required them to provide workmen\u2019s compensation for their employees is indeed commendable but is irrelevant to a determination of the question here presented. The question is whether the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act imposed upon the Corporation the <em>duty, </em>as an \u201cemployer\u201d and \u201ccontractor\u201d, to secure compensation for such employees. It is the <em>liability </em>to secure compensation which gives the employer immunity from suit as a third party tort-feasor. His immunity from suit is commensurate with his liability for securing compensation \u2014 no more and no less.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">See <em>also Conklin v. Cohen, </em>287 So.2d 56, 59 (Fla.1973),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <em>Smith v. Ussery, </em>261 So.2d 164, 165 (Fla.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The United States was not plaintiff\u2019s direct employer. The defendant argues that it was a \u201ccontractor\u201d within the meaning of the statute, and therefore had a <em>duty </em>to provide workmen\u2019s compensation benefits and may avail itself of the exclusivity defense. However, it appears clear that the United States was not a \u201ccontractor\u201d because it had no contractual relationship with plaintiff\u2019s employer, subcontractor Rumsey Steeplejacks. <em>Smith v. Ussery, supra, </em>261 So.2d at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Further, the United States did not maintain any control over the completion of the work and therefore was not a \u201ccontractor\u201d, but was only an \u201cowner\". An owner can be sued by an injured workman if the owner is alleged to be a third-party tortfeasor. <em>State v. Luckie, </em>145 So.2d 239, 242 (Fla.App. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">Defendant relies upon two cases which assertedly stand for the proposition that an \u201cowner\u201d can also be a \u201ccontractor\u201d: <em>Allison Developments, Inc. v. Rudasill, </em>202 So.2d 752 (Fla.1967), and <em>Miami Roofing &amp; Sheet Metal Co. v. Kindt, </em>48 So.2d 840 (Fla.1950). Defendant overlooks the fact that an \u201cowner\u201d is not a \u201ccontractor\u201d, even though it deals directly with construction companies, unless the owner itself has a contractual obligation which it passes on or sublets to the party with whom it contracts. In an oft-cited passage, the Florida Supreme Court in <em>Jones v. Florida Power Corp., supra, </em>72 So.2d at 289 wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">Nor can the Corporation [owner] be considered a \u201ccontractor,\u201d (and thus the \u201cstatutory\u201d employer of Burns\u2019 and Grin-nell\u2019s [general contractors] employees) within the meaning of Section 440.10 quoted supra, since the clear implication in this part of the Act is that there must be a contractual obligation on the part of the contractor, a portion of which he <em>sublets </em>to another. To \u201csublet\u201d means to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>\u201cunderlet\u201d, Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary; in the context in which it is here used, the effect of subletting is to pass on to another an obligation under a contract for which the person so \u201csubletting\u201d is primarily obligated. The Corporation, under the facts here present, had no primary obligation under a contract which it was passing on to another. It was not, then, a \u201ccontractor\u201d within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><em>See also Cork v. Gable, </em>340 So.2d 487, 489 (Fla.App.1977); <em>Conklin v. Cohen, supra, </em>287 So.2d at 59; <em>Smith v. Ussery, supra, </em>261 So.2d at 165; <em>Street v. Safway Steel Scaffold Company, </em>148 So.2d 38, 42 (Fla.App. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The nature of the contractual obligation which must be present in order for \u00a7 440.10 to apply was explicated in <em>State v. Luckie, supra, </em>145 So.2d at 242. In that case the defendant owned land . arid contracted to build an office building on the land which it would rent to a lessee. Defendant hired plaintiff\u2019s employer to do some of the construction work. The Court held that the contract which the defendant had with the potential lessee was not the type of contract contemplated by the statute, and that the defendant was merely an owner and the plaintiff\u2019s employer was an independent contractor rather than a subcontractor. The Court wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">. the type of contractual obligation by which one must be bound in order to be held a contractor within the meaning of the statute is the <em>conventional type of contract entered into between a general contractor and an owner of property </em>for whose benefit improvements are to be constructed or specified work is to be performed, by which the contractor agrees for a stated consideration to construct an improvement or perform the work in accordance with agreed plans and specifications, (emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\"><em>See also Cork v. Gable, supra, </em>340 So.2d at 489; <em>Florida Power and Light Co. v. Brown, </em>274 So.2d 558, 560 (Fla.App.1973); and <em>West v. Sampson, </em>142 So.2d 74, 78-79 (Fla. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">In this case there is no indication that the United States was bound by any contractual obligation to undertake the duty to repaint the water towers. Thus, no such obligation was \u201csublet\u201d to Royal Painting Company or to Rumsey Steeplejacks by the defendant. Certainly, the United States was not bound by the type of contractual obligation that is contemplated by Florida case law as requisite to application of the \u201ccontractor\u201d concept of \u00a7 440.10. By every reasonable definition, the United States in this case was an \u201cowner\u201d, not a \u201ccontractor\u201d. Therefore, the cases applying the \u201ccommon employer\u201d doctrine which has grown out of \u00a7 440.10 and which are cited in defendant\u2019s brief are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">In granting the dismissal, the court below apparently relied upon the only case cited in the brief in support of the motion, <em>Roelofs v. United States, supra. Roelofs </em>is a Fifth Circuit case arising under Louisiana law. The Louisiana workmen\u2019s compensation statute is broader than the Florida workmen\u2019s compensation statute, providing that if a \u201cprincipal\u201d contracts with a \u201ccontractor\u201d to help do work which is part of the principal\u2019s trade, business, or occupation, or which the principal has contracted to do, then the principal must provide workmen\u2019s compensation coverage to the contractor\u2019s employees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">In <em>Roelofs, </em>the United States was sued by employees of a government contractor who were injured while working in an army ammunition plant. Because the United States had required the contractor to carry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>workmen\u2019s compensation insurance, it raised the exclusivity defense. The plaintiffs argued that due to preeminent sovereign immunity, the United States could not be <em>required </em>to comply with any State workmen\u2019s compensation statute. Therefore, plaintiffs argued, the United States had no <em>duty </em>to provide workmen\u2019s compensation (even though it had voluntarily done so), and thus was not entitled to the exclusivity defense against third-party tortfeasor actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 argument, the Fifth Circuit was merely holding that the doctrine of sovereign immunity did not require that the United States be treated differently than a private employer would be treated. In <em>Roeiofs, </em>it was assumed that the United States, <em>had it been a private employer, </em>would have been liable for workmen\u2019s compensation under the Louisiana statute. We need not decide whether to adopt the position of the <em>Roeiofs </em>case on the sovereign immunity argument, for even if we followed it all this would mean is that the United States, despite its sovereign immunity, must be treated like a private employer in Florida. While the United States in <em>Roeiofs </em>would assumedly have been immune from a third-party tortfeasor action in Louisiana had it been a private person, for the reasons explained above the United States in this case would <em>not </em>have been immune from such an action had it been a private person. <em>Roeiofs, </em>therefore, is completely inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">We conclude that because the United States is not a \u201ccontractor\u201d under F.S.A. \u00a7 440.10, it is not entitled to the defense which it has claimed. Therefore, the lower Court acted erroneously in dismissing this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">We reverse and remand consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-8\">.
