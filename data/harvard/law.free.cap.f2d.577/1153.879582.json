All the indicted were convicted, the appellant Baker after a trial on an agreed statement of facts before the judge and the appellant Weinstein after a jury trial. Only the appellants Baker and Wein-stein appeal their convictions. The appellant Baker challenges the validity of his warrantless arrest in front of his house and the search of his house after his arrest. Weinstein asserts error in the limitations placed by the trial court on his cross-examination of a critical Government witness and on the closing jury argument of his counsel. We find all claims of error without merit and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">The appellant Baker relies primarily on the claim that the District Court erred in finding that the arrests of Baker and Miranda in the early hours of the morning of July 2, 1976, as the two were transporting from Baker\u2019s home to the car of Miranda\u2019s wife two large plastic bags containing Phencyclidine, were based on probable cause. In support of this claim of error, he would isolate certain circumstances, which he argues may not support the finding of probable cause. First, he would find the use, however slight, of an informer\u2019s tip by the arresting authorities in determining probable cause violative of the requirements established by Aguilar<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>Spinelli.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\"><em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>are generally considered as establishing a two-pronged test for acceptance of an informer\u2019s tip as a basis for a finding of probable cause. These two requisites are (1) sufficient information with reference to the reliability of the informer so as \u201cto negate the possibility that the informer \u2018fabricat[ed] his report out of the whole cloth\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) sufficient information with reference to the dependability of the informer\u2019s information to enable the arresting officers or magistrate to \u201c \u2018know that [they are] relying on something more substantial than a casual rumor.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dicta in a number of recent cases, however, would confine the first requirement of the rule to cases involving the tip of the professional informer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, a commentator, reviewing <em>Spinelli </em>shortly after its issuance, seems to have construed this requirement as owing its basis to the feeling that there was a \u201csubstantial risk that a <em>paid </em>informant\u2019s story is inaccurate.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Emphasis added) Accordingly, several decisions have suggested that a showing of an informer\u2019s prior reliability is not required for the disinterested informer, without a previous record as such and without any criminal involvement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>there is authority for the view that the rule in <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>is a relevant requirement only in cases where the finding of probable cause rests entirely on the informer\u2019s tip.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">Under all the authorities, however, if the information detailed in the tip is verified or corroborated by other facts developed or acquired in the course of the arresting officer\u2019s investigation prior to arrest, which may be said to have \u201cnot only attested to the reliability of the informant but [also to have] supported the conclusion that his information had a reasonably substantial basis in fact,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the information supplied by the tip may be a proper basis for a finding of probable cause.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>trict Court found that there was such verification in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-4\">The corroboration of the disinterested citizen\u2019s tip was considerable and to the point. Thus, the informant had said that Miranda was manufacturing Phencyclidine with one \u201cAl.\u201d He did not know, it is true, \u201cAl\u2019s\u201d last name but he did identify \u201cAl\u201d as a person who drove a gray Corvette, model 1976, and who lived in Westminster, Maryland. Already the investigating officers knew that Miranda was a known manufacturer and vendor of Phencyclidine and had within the last few days received a shipment of materials required for the manufacture of Phencyclidine under suspicious circumstances. While trying to locate a 1976 gray Corvette in Westminster, Maryland, the officers had come upon the wife of Miranda in the Westminster area, had followed her, and had seen her stop at a house in an area adjacent to Westminster. Significantly, there was a 1976 gray Corvette parked in the driveway of the house. Investigation revealed that the appellant Allen Ray Baker owned the Corvette and lived at the residence. Inquiry of neighbors developed that Miranda had been a frequent visitor at the Baker house recently. These confirming facts were sufficient to support the determination of the District Court in favor of the credibility of the informer and of the dependability of his information against any claim of clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">But even if it be assumed that the informer\u2019s tip was not properly corroborated, it still would not follow that the tip could not be considered in resolving probable cause to arrest. The existence of probable cause to arrest is not to be determined by isolating, as the appellant has sought to do, the several factors known to the arresting officers but by a careful analysis of all the facts known at the time by them. As Chief Justice (then Judge) Burger stated in <em>Smith v. United States </em>(1966) 123 U.S.App.D.C. 202, 206, 358 F.2d 833, 837, <em>cert. denied </em>386 U.S. 1008, 87 S.Ct. 1350, 18 L.Ed.2d 448:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a8s-dedup-0\">\u201c* * * As we have often observed, probable cause is the sum total of layers of information and the synthesis of what the police have heard, what they know, and what they observe as trained officers. We weigh not individual layers but the \u2018laminated\u2019 total.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1245-8\">In line with this language, the court in <em>United States v. Prince </em>(6th Cir. 1977) 548 F.2d 164, 165-6 upheld consideration of an informer\u2019s tip on the determination of probable cause to arrest, although \u201cthe unreliable informer\u2019s tip received was neither corroborated nor possible of corroboration,\u201d saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>\u201c* * * However, although the tip by itself was insufficient to establish probable cause, the tip was not so insubstantial that it could not properly have been considered as one factor in a determination of probable cause.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">While, as we have said, we do not think the District Court erred in finding that the tip was sufficiently corroborated, still, if it did, the other evidence in the possession of the arresting officers, taken along with the informer\u2019s tip, could have been considered by the District Court in its ruling and was sufficient to withstand a challenge of clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">Neither is there merit in the second claim of Baker which was that the search of his house, in front of which he and Miranda were arrested, was invalid. The officers were in possession of information received from the appellant\u2019s neighbors that Miranda had been seen at the house the day before armed. Moreover, they had knowledge of a confederate of Miranda in the narcotics business. This confederate had been seen either by the officers or by an informer with Miranda on the day before the arrest. The officers feared, according to their claim, that there might be an armed accomplice in the house who, observing the arrest of the appellant and Miranda, would fire on them. Under the circumstances, that was a reasonable fear justifying a \u201cprotective sweep\u201d of the house. <em>United States v. Sellers </em>(4th Cir. 1975) 520 F.2d 1281, 1284, <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>424 U.S. 961, 96 S.Ct. 1453, 47 L.Ed.2d 728, <em>cert. denied </em>and <em>reh. denied </em>425 U.S. 955, 96 S.Ct. 1734, 48 L.Ed.2d 200; <em>United States v. Bowdach </em>(S.D.Fla.1976) 414 F.Supp. 1346, 1352-1353, <em>aff\u2019d </em>(5th Cir.) 561 F.2d 1160.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the course of that \u201cprotective sweep\u201d the officers had the right to seize any evidence of crime in plain view. <em>United States v. Sellars, supra, </em>520 F.2d at 1284-1285; <em>United States v. Zapata </em>(7th Cir. 1976) 535 F.2d 358, 359; <em>United States v. Looney </em>(5th Cir. 1973) 481 F.2d 31, 34, <em>cert. denied </em>414 U.S. 1070, 94 S.Ct. 581, 38 L.Ed.2d 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-10\">The appellant Weinstein bases his objections to the trial below on two rulings by the trial court, one of which related to the cross-examination by Weinstein of his co-defendant Miranda, and the other to a ruling by the Court made during the course of the jury argument of Weinstein\u2019s counsel. Both rulings fell within the discretionary power of the trial court and were not clearly erroneous. Even if the rulings had been unduly restrictive of either the cross-examination or the closing argument, any error in them would have been harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the convictions of the appellants are</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">. <em>Aguilar v.

In contrast to <em>Draper,* </em>the cor- * <em>Draper v. United States </em>(1959) 358 U.S. 307. roborated part should justify an inference not simply that the informant is not a total liar but also that criminal activity may actually be present. Thus a hired informant\u2019s tip would never be allowed to constitute the sole item establishing probable cause to arrest or search.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1243-17\">. <em>See, United States v. Banks </em>(9th Cir. 1976) 539 F.2d 14, 17, n. 5, <em>cert. denied </em>429 U.S. 1024, 97 S.Ct. 644, 50 L.Ed.2d 626; <em>United States v.

Burke </em>(2d Cir. 1975) 517 F.2d 377, 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-18\">For a statement of the reasons supporting this view, <em>see. </em>Note, <em>The Supreme Court, 1970 Term, </em>85 <em>Harv.L.Rev. </em>3 at 63, n. 55:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-19\">\u201cThe <em>Harris </em>plurality\u2019s willingness to modify the <em>Aguilar-Spineili </em>requirement of proof of the informer\u2019s credibility may be a tacit response to the government\u2019s argument that the requirement imposes too great a burden on the police where the information has been provided by first-time informers, who allegedly are often required to solve many crimes. * * * In such cases, evidence of the informer\u2019s prior reliability would be nonexistent and the police might well be reluctant to provide a general background sketch of the informant as suggested by Justice Harlan in dissent, 403 U.S. at 600, for fear that subsequent disclosure in a suppression hearing might jeopardize his life by providing leads to his identity. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-20\">\u201cNonetheless, requiring some information about a first-time informant seems workable if he is a typical law-abiding citizen who inadvertently discovers criminal activity, but is reluctant to become personally identified with the subsequent investigation. Since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>such informants are less likely to be known to defendants and since their background is more conducive to a finding that they are credible, the quantum of information required might be small enough so as not to risk disclosure. For example, in cases where the informant is employed, lacks a police history, and appears to have no prior relationship with the suspects which might give a motive to lie or exaggerate, such information might be given to the magistrate without much danger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-6\">\u201cThis problem is, of course, more severe when first-time informers with criminal associations are involved. Yet the government\u2019s admission that such informers are often unreliable provides the answer to its argument. Such tips must be viewed skeptically and, without independent corroboration by the police, should be insufficient to justify issuance of a warrant. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">. <em>United States v.

In speaking for the Court in that case, Judge Friendly said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-8\">\u201cThe lesson we draw from all this is that <em>Aguilar </em>applies with full rigor only when the search warrant or the arrest depends solely on the informer\u2019s tip. When a tip not meeting the <em>Aguilar </em>test has generated police investigation and this has developed significant corroboration or other <em>\u2018probative indications of criminal activity </em>along the lines suggested by the informant,\u2019 see Rebell, The Undisclosed Informant and the Fourth Amendment: A Search for Meaningful Standards, 81 Yale L.J. 703, 715 (1972), the tip, even though not qualifying under <em>Aguilar, </em>may be used to give such additional color as is needed to elevate the information acquired by police observation above the floor required for probable cause.\u201d (Emphasis in text)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1244-9\">. <em>United States v.

There is some contrariety in the decisions on whether the corroborating facts may be \u201cinnocent facts\u201d conforming to the information in the tip or must be facts which \u201crelate directly to the criminal activity.\u201d <em>See United States v. Brennan </em>(5th Cir. 1976) 538 F.2d 711, 720, n. 11, <em>cert. denied </em>429 U.S. 1092, 97 S.Ct. 1104, 51 L.Ed.2d 538. In a long line of cases, the Second Circuit has repeatedly upheld a finding of probable cause based on an untested informer\u2019s tip when corroborated by \u201cinnocent details.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson </em>(2d Cir. 1977) 560 F.2d 112, 121, <em>cert. denied </em>434 U.S. 941, 98 S.Ct. 434, 54 L.Ed.2d 301; <em>United States v. Gonzalez </em>(2d Cir. 1977) 555 F.2d 308, 313 (\u201ccorroboration of even innocent elements is enough\u201d); <em>United States v.

Sultan </em>(2d Cir. 1972) 463 F.2d 1066, 1069 (\u201can untested informant\u2019s story may be corroborated by other facts that become known to the affiant, even if they corroborate only innocent aspects of the story\u201d). Moreover, as the Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Edmond </em>(6th Cir. 1977) 548 F.2d 1256, 1258-9, <em>cert. denied </em>433 U.S. 912, 97 S.Ct. 2983, 53 L.Ed.2d 1097, suggests, the corroborating details in <em>Draper v. United States </em>(1959) 358 U.S. 307, 313, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327, were not facts which directly linked the suspect to the crime. The same was, also, true of <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1960) 362 U.S. 257, 271, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697. Other cases in which \u201cinnocent details\u201d were found to be sufficient corroboration are <em>United States v. Edmond, supra, </em>548 F.2d 1256; <em>United States v. Prueitt </em>(9th Cir. 1976) 540 F.2d 995, 1005, <em>cert. denied </em>429 U.S. 1063, 97 S.Ct. 790, 50 L.Ed.2d 780; <em>Weeks v.

Larkin </em>(9th Cir. 1974) 510 F.2d 13 at 15. It has been followed in a number of cases in the Sixth Circuit, of which the latest is <em>United States v. Craemer </em>(6th Cir. 1977) 555 F.2d 594, 597. However, it has been suggested that these cases really go off on the extent of the corroboration more than on the nature of the corroboration. United <em>States </em>v. <em>Montgomery </em>(5th Cir. 1977) 554 F.2d 754, 757-8, c<em>ert. denied </em>434 U.S. 941, 98 S.Ct. 409, 54 L.Ed.2d 285. And this seems confirmed by the opinion in <em>Larkin. </em>In distinguishing <em>United States v. Archuleta </em>(9th Cir. 1971) 446 F.2d 518 and <em>Draper </em>(both of which found corroboration on \u201cinnocent details\u201d in the tip sufficient), the opinion in <em>Larkin </em>states that in such cases the informer \u201csupplied such a wealth of detail that a magistrate would have been justified in concluding that the informant was \u2018relying on something more substantial than a casual rumor\u2019 * * *This is little more than the rule as stated in <em>United States v. Tuley </em>(5th Cir. 1977) 546 F.2d 1264, 1268, where reliance on the tip was found proper because corroborated by \u201c \u2018an accumulation of innocent detail conforming to the original tip.\u2019 \u201d [Quoting from <em>United States v. Brennan, supra, </em>538 F.2d at 720.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-10\">In any event, the corroboration in this case could meet either test. As we later point out, the information that Miranda was manufacturing Phencyclidine at Al\u2019s [Baker\u2019s] house in Westminster, Maryland was supported by proof that within the last day or two Miranda, a well known manufacturer of illicit Phencycli-dine, had obtained under a fictitious name and from a planted address, material for such manufacture, and that Miranda had been seen frequenting Al\u2019s house near Westminster during the same time frame.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">. <em>See, also, United States v.
