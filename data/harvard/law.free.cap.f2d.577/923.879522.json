Despite Second Circuit authority to the contrary, we believe that the district court overstepped its authority in extending the surety\u2019s obligation to the appellate process without first obtaining express consent for such an extension. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND:</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">On April 28, 1966, defendant Stephen J. Dinneen was indicted for securities fraud. Bail was set at $10,000 and an arrest warrant was issued. On May 6, defendant was arrested. Dinneen posted an appearance bond, written by Resolute Insurance Company, the appellant herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-12\">The original indictment was displaced by a superseding indictment to which the trial court made the original bond applicable. At his arraignment, February 2, 1968, defendant Dinneen pleaded not guilty and he was released on the same bond that had been set with reference to the superseding indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-14\">Later in 1968, Dinneen was found guilty. He was released on the same, surety bond pending resolution of post-trial motions. After denying these post-trial motions, the court sentenced defendant to five years on each count of the indictment. At this time, defendant orally moved for the enlargement of the existing bond until the filing of his notice of appeal. The court granted this request, despite the absence of appellant surety from this proceeding. In fact, the minute entry and judgment/commitment order signed by the trial judge do not reflect that Resolute Insurance Company, or an authorized representative, was present in court or was ever notified as to the trial court\u2019s actions with respect to the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-15\">In October of 1970, defendant\u2019s appeal was denied and a mandate was returned. His failure to surrender himself for the execution of sentence initiated a series of procedures Which culminated in an order requiring the forfeiture of bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-16\">The bond which was established at the time of indictment and which was extended through the period of appeal is recited in full in the appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-17\">II. LEGAL DISCUSSION:</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-18\">In 1976, this circuit faced a similar question as to the limits of a surety\u2019s liability under a bond comparable to that before this court in the case <em>sub judice. See, United States v. Miller, </em>539 F.2d 445 (5th Cir. 1976). <em>Miller </em>is at the crux of the issue of the extension of liability under a bond contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-19\">In <em>Miller, </em>the trial court sentenced defendant after trial to three months in prison. At the request of the defendant, the trial court permitted a brief stay of sentence prior to the date of execution, specifically continuing in effect the bond set pretrial. Significantly, the surety was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>present at this proceeding. Defendant failed to report for sentence and the bond was forfeited by judicial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">This circuit affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision. However, the decision is most significant for the express limits placed upon a surety\u2019s potential liability under the bond agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">\u201cAs a general rule the terms of a bail contract are to be construed strictly in favor of the surety, who may not be held liable for any greater undertaking than he has agreed to.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 447. At the same time, the <em>Miller </em>court noted, and we agree, that in interpreting the bond contract, the reasonable intentions of the parties must be given effect. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">In applying these principles of construction to the present case, we note, as did this circuit in <em>Miller, </em>that the surety bond expressly binds Resolute Insurance Company to insure that the defendant \u201cwill abide any judgment entered in such matter by surrendering himself to serve any sentence imposed. . . .\u201d App. 130. At the same time, we cannot overlook the fact that the very premise of the bond, stated in its opening sentences, is that</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">[t]he conditions of this bond are that the defendant, Stephen J. Dinneen, is to appear in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida at Miami, Florida, and at such other places as the defendant may be required to appear, in accordance with any and all orders and directions <em>relating to the defendant\u2019s appearance in the above entitled matter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">The above entitled matter, to which the entire bond alludes, is <em>United States of America v. Stephen J. Dinneen, </em>United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. This is a bond intended as a guarantee of the defendant\u2019s appearance in relation to the proceedings of the trial court for the Southern District of Florida\u2014 not in relation to the proceedings of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-12\">Indeed, it is this very proposition to which this circuit subscribed, albeit <em>sub silentio, </em>in <em>Miller. </em>The decision of that court to extend the surety\u2019s liability to that period of time embodied in a brief stay of sentence post-trial \u2014 a stay ordered to permit defendant to organize his affairs \u2014 can only be read as a clear indication that the typical surety bond terminates once sentencing has been completed post trial, allowing for <em>brief stays </em>attendant thereto. As the <em>Miller </em>court noted, \u201can appearance bond may be extended to cover <em>reasonably brief </em>postponements of the execution of sentence.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>539 F.2d at 449 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-13\">Yet, despite the clear mandate of <em>Miller, </em>the Second Circuit, in <em>United States v. Cati-no, </em>562 F.2d 1 (2nd Cir. 1977) utilized it as a springboard for open-ended surety liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-14\"><em>Catino </em>involved the archetypical factual situation. However, there was one significant addition. In <em>Catino, </em>defendant, like defendant in the case <em>sub judice, </em>did not report to commence his sentence after his appeal had been denied and the mandate returned. Despite the fact that the failure to report occurred after his appeal had been determined \u2014 unlike the reasonably brief stay of execution of sentence permitted the defendant in <em>Miller </em>for the purpose of organizing his affairs \u2014 the Second Circuit held the surety liable. While it would ordinarily be sufficient for this court simply to indicate that it was following a different path from that charted by the Second Circuit in <em>Catino, </em>we cannot do-so here because <em>Miller </em>was utilized by the <em>Catino </em>court as the primary justification for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-15\">Thus, we are bound to discuss <em>Catino </em>and indicate why the Second Circuit was incorrect in its reliance on <em>Miller </em>and in its ultimate disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-16\">Simply stated, the <em>Catino </em>court interpreted selective portions of <em>Miller </em>out of context. Judge Pollack, in the trial court\u2019s decision in this matter, was not literally incorrect in citing <em>Miller </em>for the proposition that there is \u201cno per se federal rule that the pronouncement of a sentence exonerates a surety.\u201d <em>United States v. Catino, </em>427 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>F.Supp. 1009 (S.D.N.Y.1977). But the Second Circuit was incorrect when it stated that it was following <em>Miller </em>by holding that the \u201crelevant issue is whether [the surety] agreed to be liable during appeal \u2018by the language of their undertaking.\u2019 \u201d 562 F.2d at 4. The <em>Miller </em>court never indicated that the typical bond contract which guaranteed surrender for sentence could be extended, by some reading of the language, to cover the period of appeal. <em>Miller </em>was emphatic in confining its extension of liability to brief periods reasonably necessary and subsequent to the trial itself. It was crucial to the court in <em>Miller </em>that the granting of a short stay to organize one\u2019s affairs was not the type of extension for which a surety could reasonably expect a defendant to secure additional bonding. 539 F.2d at 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">III. CONCLUSION:</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">In sum, we decline to extend <em>Miller </em>to cover the period of time in which a defendant is at liberty on bond pending the resolution of his appeal. Although trial courts may attempt to obtain the express agreement of surety to such an extension of liability, the terms of the ordinary bond contract, as is involved herein, may be extended only to encompass <em>brief, reasonable </em>stays of execution of sentence without first securing the type of express agreement alluded to throughout this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">Because the extension of Resolute\u2019s liability in the case <em>sub judice </em>far exceeded the category of \u201cbrief, reasonable stays,\u201d we have no choice but to reverse the holding of the trial court in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">REVERSE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-9\">UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">United States of America )</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-12\">) APPEARANCE BOND</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-13\">v. ) _ FOR</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-14\">) No.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-15\">STEPHEN J.
