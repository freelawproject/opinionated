Our work, however, is published whether or not the finale is suspenseful. This is fortunate in the instant case, because the questions presented on this last appeal are for the most\u2019 part controlled by our decisions in <em>Sprouse v. General Finance Corp., </em>577 F.2d 989, (5th Cir. 1978), and <em>Flournoy v. Century Finance, </em>577 F.2d 997, (5th Cir. 1978), also decided today. Indeed, the only similarity between this last section of our trilogy and a novel is that one of defendant Henderson\u2019s contentions may be charitably characterized as fanciful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-18\">The six cases consolidated on this last appeal are all similar to the two appeals previously considered today. Each case involves wage earner bankruptcy proceedings in which the lenders\u2019 claims were disallowed by the trustee because of an alleged violation of the Georgia Industrial Loan Act (\u201cGILA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-19\">In the cases of <em>In re: Walton </em>(Century Finance Co.), <em>In re: Henderson </em>(Swift Loan and Finance of Columbus, Inc.), <em>In re: Sims </em>(Swift Loan), <em>In re: DeBlase </em>(General Finance Corp.), and <em>In re: Clayton </em>(General Finance Corp.), the bankruptcy court held that the contracts at issue were void because acceleration clauses contained in the contracts provided for the acceleration of unearned interest in the event of a default by the debtor. District Judge J. Robert Elliott reversed the bankruptcy court, holding that the contracts were valid under Georgia law. Subsequent to Judge Elliott\u2019s decision in those cases, the bankruptcy court held that the contract in <em>In re: Williams </em>(General Finance Corp.) was valid under GILA and the district court affirmed. The six causes were then consolidated, and the trustee now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-20\">We hold that the loan contract in each of these actions is invalid under the Georgia Industrial Loan Act. We further conclude that the trustee was not barred in any of the six causes under the equitable defenses asserted below. The judgments of the district court are therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-21\">A. <em>In re: Walton</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-22\">The loan contract between the debtor Walton and Century Finance Company consists of a promissory note and a security agreement. The only acceleration clause in the contract is contained in the security agreement. The acceleration clause provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-23\">Should the undersigned fail to pay any obligation hereby secured or the interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>thereon when the same becomes due, or default in any of the undersigned\u2019s obligations hereunder . . the entire indebtedness hereby secured shall at the option of said Company or assigns become immediately due and payable .</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">We have already held in <em>Sprouse </em>v. <em>General Finance Corp., supra, </em>that such a clause, even when contained in the security agreement, invalidates the entire loan contract. The only difference between this case and <em>Sprouse </em>is that the promissory note in the instant case contains <em>no </em>acceleration clause while the promissory note at issue in <em>Sprouse </em>contained a valid acceleration clause. This distinction actually weakens the creditor\u2019s position since the contract nowhere provides for the rebate of unac-crued interest and defendant cannot argue that the acceleration clause found in the promissory note evidences an intent to comply with GILA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">We concluded in <em>Sprouse </em>that a security agreement can authorize the collection of interest upon default even when the promissory note is silent on the question and that the Georgia Industrial Loan Act applied to acceleration clauses contained in security agreements. The acceleration clause quoted above clearly authorizes the collection of all outstanding installments, including unearned interest. <em>Sprouse </em>therefore controls the instant case and the district court\u2019s judgment must be reversed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">B. <em>In re: DeBlase; In re: Clayton; In re: Williams; In re: Sims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-8\"><em>In re: Sims </em>involves a loan contract between Sims and Swift Loan and Finance of Columbus, Inc. <em>In re: DeBlase; In re: Clayton </em>; and <em>In re: Williams </em>involve loan contracts between the debtors and General Finance Corp. which are in all relevant respects identical to the contract at issue in <em>Sprouse v. General Finance Corp., supra. </em>The contract at issue in each of these four actions contains a valid acceleration clause in the promissory note and an invalid clause in the security agreement. Based on our opinion in <em>Sprouse, supra, </em>we hold that these contracts are void under the Georgia Industrial Loan Act. The judgments below \u2022are reversed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-12\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-13\">C. <em>In re: Henderson</em></p>\n<p id=\"aoq-dedup-0\">The contract at issue in this final case on appeal contains acceleration clauses in both the promissory note and the security agreement which are proscribed by the Georgia Industrial Loan Act. Defendant Swift Loan &amp; Finance of Columbus, Inc. argues that this action is nonetheless distinguishable from <em>Sprouse, supra, </em>because Swift Loan merely sold a repossessed vehicle to the debtor for a flat principal sum of money and did not charge any interest. Where payments do not contain any interest charges, defendant notes, there can be no acceleration of unaccrued interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-14\">While we may agree that as a logical matter no unaccrued interest can be accelerated where the lender does not charge interest, the defendant\u2019s factual assertion that no interest was charged to the debtor here is simply untenable. The defendant repossessed the automobile in question from a prior debtor and sold the vehicle to Henderson. The contract between Hen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>derson and Swift Loan provided that Henderson would pay off Swift\u2019s $1672 loan in twenty-two equal monthly installments of $76 each. The contract specifies a total interest charge of \u201czero\u201d dollars. The contract also states, however, that Henderson shall \u201cTake over payments\u201d from the original debtor\u2019s loan contract and incorporates by reference that prior account. Defendant admits that this prior loan contract contained interest charges, and it is plain that these interest charges were assumed by Henderson when she took over the prior debtor\u2019s payments. Defendant\u2019s position that Henderson was not charged interest is thus without foundation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, the acceleration clauses in the Henderson contract provide for the acceleration of unaccrued interest. Based on our holding in <em>Sprouse, supra, </em>we conclude that such a contract is void under the Georgia Industrial Loan Act. The judgment of the district court is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1090-9\">. In the proceedings before the bankruptcy judge, Century Finance Co. argued that the trustee was barred from asserting his objection to defendant\u2019s claim by the equitable doctrines of estoppel and laches. Although defendant-appellee has not raised this issue on appeal, appellant requests that we address the question in the interests of judicial economy and efficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-10\">This question is controlled by our decision in <em>Flournoy v. Century Finance Co., supra, </em>and finding no relevant distinctions between the facts in the instant case and the cases considered in the Century Finance Co. appeal, we hold that the creditor here did not, as a matter of law, make out its defense of laches or estop-pel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1090-16\">. Likewise, the equitable defenses raised by appellees are governed by our decision in <em>Flournoy v. Century Finance Co., supra. </em>We find that the facts in the instant causes of action are indistinguishable from those considered in <em>Flournoy v. Century Finance Co., </em>and therefore reject the equitable defenses offered by appellees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1091-15\">. Our finding that interest was charged in the contract at issue is not solely dependent on Henderson\u2019s assumption of the original debt- or\u2019s loan contract. The equal monthly payments in the loan contract necessarily consist \u25a0 in part of interest charges. No Georgia lending institution would loan money to an unrelated individual without charging interest. The payments specified in the contract before us obviously reflect such imputed interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
