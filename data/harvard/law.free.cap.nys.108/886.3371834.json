The motion was made upon affidavits to set aside the attachment which had been granted. The court therefore had the right to consider the additional affidavits offered and received upon the return of the order to show cause in support of the attachment, wherein the fact is positively sworn to that the defendant is a foreign corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of New Jersey; a telegram from the Secretary of State of New Jersey to that effect being incorporated therein. This, in view of the argumentative affidavit of defendant\u2019s counsel, and the fact that, although the president of the defendant makes an affidavit, he does not deny that the defendant is a foreign corporation, satisfies us that upon these papers the attachment ought not to have been vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-17\">The order appealed from should therefore be reversed and the attachment reinstated, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant, and the motion to vacate the attachment denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
