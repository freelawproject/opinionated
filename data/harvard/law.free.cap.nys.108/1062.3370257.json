The order appealed from denied a motion to change the place of trial from the county of New York to the county of Greene for the convenience of witnesses. We are satisfied, from an inspection of the record, that the great majority of the witnesses of the transactions complained of reside in the county where the cause of action arose. We therefore think that the motion should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">The order appealed from is therefore reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for a change of venue to Greene county granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
