Defendant obtained judgment, and the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-14\">One of the items in dispute was a check of $15, which defendant asserted was deposited by the plaintiff and turned out to be \u201cno good,\u201d and the amount deducted from plaintiff\u2019s account. Plaintiff denied the deposit of the check in question. He was the only witness in support of his case. Two employ\u00e9s of the defendant were called by the defendant and gave testimony tending to sustain the defendant\u2019s contention. The following is the conclusion of the record of the trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-15\">\u201cThe Court: Has your bank got the deposit slips made by this plaintiff on September 28th, September 24th, or even as far back as September 11th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-16\">\u201cWitness: I believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-17\">\u201cBoth sides rest, with the right to the defendant, with the plaintiff\u2019s consent, to submit to the court any deposit slips of the defendant made in September, by next Monday, September 30, 1907.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-18\">Pursuant to this stipulation, on October 1,1907, the defendant submitted, and the court received, as appears by the record, an affidavit of one Harry Morgan, in the employ of defendant as note teller, explaining the inability to produce the deposit slips referred to in the stipulation, and giving important and material additional testimony in defendant\u2019s behalf. Morgan had not been called upon the trial. The contents of the affidavit went far beyond the scope contemplated by the stipulation, and its receipt and consideration constituted error that demands a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-19\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
