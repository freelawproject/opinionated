KELLOGG, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB\">Defendant was entitled to an order canceling the notice of pendency of action if the time of the appellant had expired for appealing from the judgment of nonsuit. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1674. The notice served for the purpose of limiting the time for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>appeal purported to have attached to it a copy of the judgment which was not signed by the clerk. Mason v. Corbin, 29 App. Div. 602, 51 N. Y. Supp. 178, and Good v. Daland, 119 N. Y. 153, 23 N. E. 474, show that such notice was not effectual to limit the time in which to appeal. The court should not cancel the notice of pendency in a case like this until after final judgment and until the plaintiff\u2019s right to appeal from the judgment has expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The order appealed from should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs, and the motion to cancel the lis pendens denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
