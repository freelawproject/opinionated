The original complaint was not read on the motion, and is not in the present record. There is no such action known as that described in the said affidavit. Section 1798 of the Code of Civil Procedure only authorizes an action \u201cto procure a judgment vacating the charter or annulling the existence of a corporation,\u201d and not to forfeit or take away from it any of its rights or property; and even if its life be taken away, its rights and property are not confiscated, but become vested in its trustees in office at the time of its death.
