The matter was thereupon remitted to the surrogate\u2019s court for a hearing upon the law and the merits. 113 App. Div. 468, 99 N. Y. Supp. 213. The learned surrogate upon that hearing ordered that the said executor deliver up a certain check, dated June 22, 1894, for $606.66, made by the executor\u2019s testator as administrator, but denied the application in all other respects, without costs. That order was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">On reargument, I think that we should hold that the order of affirmance was a mistake, in that its effect was to discharge the executor in the premises, not upon payment of the $606.66 as property received by her as aforesaid, but upon delivery of a mere specific order or draft, now 15 years old, for the payment of that sum. If the executor had the money on hand, the applicant was entitled to it forthwith, and not to a stale order therefor. His right to money was not affected by the fact that this check was once tendered in open court, with a consent to an adjournment until it should be honored, and that he refused it. The check was not legal tender. It was but a direction to a bank to pay the payee. The money represented did not thereby become the property of the payee; nor was it put beyond the control of the maker of the. check; nor did the check, before presentation, work an assignment of the moneys thereby ordered to be paid. O\u2019Connor v. Mechanics\u2019 Bank, 124 N. Y. 324, 26 N. E. 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">If this executor came into possession of any interest received by the said administrator upon this $606.66, she could also be compelled to pay it over as assets received. If, after receipt of the assets, she was chargeable with interest, either actually received by her thereon, or which she should have collected but did not, then she might be compelled to pay it over as an asset. This executor cannot administer the assets of an estate of which her testator was administrator. Matter of Moehring, 154 N. Y. 423, 48 N. E. 818. If the legatee is entitled to interest, in addition to his legacy, whether by the misconduct of the administrator or by operation of law, it constitutes a claim against the estate of this executor\u2019s testator, and must be enforced as such claim ; and the same is true of the individual check of that testator for $62.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The order is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the matter remitted to the surrogate, in so far as he has jurisdiction. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
