The demurrers are to the first further defense in alleged justification, the second further defense in alleged justification and to the third and separate defense. The ground as to all is insufficiency in law upon the face. The alleged libel was the writing and publishing of the following letter, sent to Charles Oechl\u00e9r, Esq., an attorney at law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-16\">\u201cTour kind letter received. I am obliged write to you in this manner. If I have sent Mr. Knowles last evening in your office the reason was that I have know after the Hackensack\u2019s case Lapetina. Lapetina now is for me a dishonest man. I have received from you two receipts one of five dollars and other of ten dollars. When I came in your respectable office Lapetina asked me ten dollars, I had in my pocket eight dollars only, Lapetina told me all right Mr. Santangelo, this evening I will see you in your drug store, I will bring the receipt and you shall give me ten dollars. The evening he came I gave him the money. Now Lapetina refuce five dollars. After your letter I am ready to brace Sicilian to break him the face to this ignorant stupid meddler man, I will cite him in the court to this quack.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-17\">The complaint shows that this letter referred to two transactions. The plea challenged by the first demurrer is thus introduced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-18\">\u201cDefendant, further answering the complaint, and in justification, states.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-19\">The matter thereof is in justification of the charge that the plaintiff was not honest in the Hackensack transaction. 'While the plea may pass as in justification, it is not broad enough to be a complete defense; indeed, it does not purport to be one. When the facts are not expressly pleaded as a partial defense, the plaintiff and the court upon demurrer must test the plea as if given in complete defense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>Thompson v. Halbert, 109 N. Y. 329, 16 N. E. 675. Hence the plea is bad. For like reasons the plea attacked by the second demurrer is bad.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">The third demurrer attacks a plea thus introduced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-6\">\u201cDefendant for a further and separate defense alleges:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-7\">\u201cTwenty-Sixth. That heretofore, and in the Municipal Court of the City of New York, Borough of Brooklyn, the defendant herein and one John De Da Tergo brought an action against Isabella Jaffe and Fannie Zatulove, in which said action the said Charles Oechler, the person to whom the letter attached to the complaint was written, appeared as attorney for this defendant, and in which said action the professional obligation referred to in the complaint was incurred by defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-8\">\u201cTwenty-Seventh. That this defendant communicated and wrote said letter to said Charles Oechler as attorney for this defendant and in connection with his professional services rendered to defendant in said action, and not otherwise ; and the defendant claims that said communication to said Charles Oechler was privileged as between attorney and client, and related to matters wherein said Charles Oechler appeared as attorney for this defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">Referring to this plea, as we may do upon demurrer (Fry v. Bennett, 5 Sandf. 72), it is quite clear that it is one of qualified privilege \u2014\u201cprima facie\u201d privilege, as it is often termed. Odger\u2019s Libel and Slander, c. 14; Newell\u2019s Slander and Libel, \u00a7\u00a7 63 et seq. 92, 96, 106; Byam v. Collins, 111 N. Y. 143, 19 N. E. 75, 2 L. R. A. 129, 7 Am. St. Rep. 726; Hill v. Durham House Drainage Co., 79 Hun, 335, 29 N. Y. Supp. 427. It falls within the condition well expressed by Baron Fitzpatrick, in Waring v. McCaldin, 7 Ir. R. C. L. 288, cited in Newell\u2019s Slander and Libel, \u00a7 106. It appears that the letter was elicited by a letter from the addressee. We cannot infer that it was directly responsive thereto; but we may infer that it was in explanation of the reason why the defendant had sent one lawyer to another, and that the reason was that the plaintiff, a lawyer, when in Mr. Oechler\u2019s office\u2014associated with him, or in his employ\u2014had not treated the writer honestly in certain business dealings. Even though the occasion should be held one of qualified or prima facie privilege, the questions of bona fides, belief, and of actual malice survive it. Klinck v. Colby, 46 N. Y. 427, 430, 7 Am. Rep. 360. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint expressly avers that the libel was false and malicious, and I think, then, that the defendant should have pleaded so as to meet these specific allegations and thus put in plea of qualified privilege in proper form. O\u2019Donaghue v. McGovern, 23 Wend. 26; Buddington v. Davis, 6 How. Prac. 401. If the letter were absolutely privileged, then the plea might be sustained, for the reason that the law would not permit the plaintiff\u2019s plea of falsity and malice. Garr v. Selden, 4 N. Y. 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">The interlocutory judgment is reversed, with costs, and the demurrer' sustained, with costs, with leave to the defendant to plead over on payment of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
