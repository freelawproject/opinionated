Plaintiff\u2019s horse and wagon were in charge of one Curren, who testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-15\">\u201cQ. And what took place then? A. He (the motorman) says, T can\u2019t wait for you all day,\u2019 and he gave his brake, and started on, and threw me out of the way. Q. Where did the car hit you then? A. The car hit the side of the fender, and crushed the wheel, a front wheel; yes, the front left-hand wheel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-16\">He afterwards testified that the motorman said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait for you all day,\u201d and released his brake. The court, in overruling the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-17\">\u201cHe (Curren) has testified that he (the motorman) struck twice. He does not say how much he was hurt the first time; but after the second blow he says his wagon was injured, as shown by Mr. Benjamin and others. As I take it, he is suing for that second blow, when the motorman told him, as he claimed, T haven\u2019t time to wait for you,\u2019 and struck him again. If he was on the track, and the motorman could have avoided the accident, he should have done so. That is the point in the case. I will overrule your motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-18\">In his charge to the jury, the learned judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-19\">\u201cHe (plaintiff) contends that the car ran into him, and the motorman said something like, T can\u2019t wait all day for you,\u2019 and struck him the second time. There is a strong conflict of testimony here. If you believe the plaintiff\u2019s story, he is entitled to a verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-20\">The judge further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-21\">\u201cIf you believe the plaintiff\u2019s statement that the car ran into him the second time, as he said it did, with those words uttered by the motorman, he is entitled to recover.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Defendant duly excepted to these charges. It was strictly within the province of the jury to determine as a question of fact whether the intentional trespass of the motorman was committed by him within the scope of his employment, and it was error for the trial court to take this question from the jury and instruct them that, if the motorman acted- as plaintiff testified he did, plaintiff was entitled to recover. See Barry v. Union Railway Co., 105 App. Div. 520, 94 N. Y. Supp. 449. Furthermore, the judge seems to have taken the question of negligence entirely from the jury, and told them to find a verdict for plaintiff, if plaintiff\u2019s version of the accident was believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event., ' \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
