The answer puts in issue the material allegations of the complaint, and alleges that the defendant was not in existence at the time the alleged contract was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">The plaintiff is a resident of the county of New York and the defendant has its principal office and place of business in the county of Monroe, where the alleged contract was made and to be performed. This fact is to be considered in determining the place of trial. Rule 48 of the General Rules of Practice. The moving papers show that the witnesses on the part of the defendant reside in Monroe county; and, while it is possible that all of those mentioned may not be necessary at the trial, it is quite apparent whatever witnesses are necessary to enable the defendant to properly defend the action reside in that county. The plaintiff has only one witness, besides himself, who resides in the county of New York. Taking into consideration the place where the contract was made and to be performed, and that a majority of the witnesses reside in the county where it is sought to have the action tried, I am of the- opinion the motion should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">The order appealed from therefore must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
