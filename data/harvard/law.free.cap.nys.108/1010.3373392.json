As we read the contract, the intention of the parties was that title to the enumerated chattels was warranted; otherwise, the clause would be made to contain words of apparently solemn import, but with absolutely no meaning. The \u201cwarranty\u201d which was to cover these chattels was a warranty of title, and nothing else, as appears from the preceding provisions of the contract; yet, if the written words are to characterize the whole clause, the parties only warranted title to specified things upon the condition that they had title. Such a construction leads to some absurdity, and the reasonable meaning of the clause, giving effect to all of its provisions, is, as we take it, that the words \u201call personal property belonging to the parties\u201d related to chattels not directly classified, and as to the ownership of which there might be some question of doubt. It may be observed that the clause was for a mutual warranty and that the language was chosen by both parties. The words were written in upon a space left apparently for the addition of further property; and, since harmony of meaning is reached only by a construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>of the contract which limits these words to this purpose, such must properly be taken to have been the intention of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
