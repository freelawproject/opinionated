Stock Corp. Law, Laws 1893, p. 1436, c. 638, \u00a7 33. In this case the stockholders\u2019 meeting was held on April 27, 1907. On June 20th following the respondent served on the appellant an eight days notice of such application. This notice named for the return or hearing day June 28th. The application was heard and granted on that day against the objection of the appellant that the respondent had not applied to the court within 60 days from the said stockholders\u2019 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">The notice of application was served within the said 60 days, but the hearing day named therein was 62 days after such meeting. Did the respondent \u201capply\u201d to the court within the 60 days in the meaning of the statute ? To answer in the negative would be to give a strict meaning to the statute which the draughtsman did not think of. \u201e He did not have in mind that the actual hearing in court should be had within the 60 days, but only to limit the time of the stockholder\u2019s right to ask for an appraisement to that time. And the statute will easily bear this interpretation, viz., the meaning of the draughtsman. The proceeding for an appraisement is a special proceeding (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3434), and the making of the application may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>be said to be begun when the proceeding is begun. In legal sense it is begun then and ends at the hearing in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The cases cited in respect of the interpretation of section 254 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1563, c. 580) are not binding on us, nor do they apply. The provision there may require a different construction to the provision before us, but that it does we do not decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur, except HIRSOHBERG, P. J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
