It appears from the evidence that the plaintiff had arranged to have the work done by subcontractors, and over the objection and exception of the defendant he was allowed to prove the amount of those subcontracts. This was error, for which the judgment must be reversed. Profits as shown by subcontracts do not constitute the proper measure of damages in an action to recover damages for preventing the plaintiff from performing his contract with the defendant. Story v. New York &amp; Harlem R. R. Co., 6 N. Y. 85. There can be no doubt that this improper measure of damages was adopted, for the justice refused to allow the defendant to prove the reasonable value of the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
