KELLOGG, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9u\">Plaintiff, while a member of the Pennsylvania Voluntary Relief Fund, so called, which is administered by the defendants, lost his arm by accident while in the service of the Northern Central Railway Company. The Pennsylvania Voluntary Relief Department maintains a fund which is contributed by its members for the relief of members sustaining injury while in the service of the Pennsylvania Railroad or its subsidiary companies. The regulations governing the relief fund provide, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-14\">\u201c42. Members will be entitled to the following benefits: First, payments-while disabled by accident in the company\u2019s service for each day during a period not longer than fifty-two weeks, at the rate of fifty cents a day for a member of the first class, and of a greater amount for members of the other classes, in proportion to their contributions, and at half these rates after fifty-two weeks and during the continuance of the disability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-15\">Regulation 45 provides that, in order to be entitled to benefits, \u201cthere must be exterior or other positive evidence of injury, and satisfactory evidence that it renders the person wholly disabled to labor, or when of a permanent character to earn a livelihood in an employment suited to his capacity. Disablement from accident occurring otherwise than as aforesaid will be classed with sickness.\u201d The accident to plaintiff occurred March 7, 1904, and he was paid out of the relief fund $1 per day, the amount applicable to his membership, up to February 1, 1905. On January 3, 1905, the medical examiner notified him that under regulation 45, as to permanent disablement, his benefit would cease February 1, 1905. After this, correspondence was had by the plaintiff and his counsel with the officers of the relief fund, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>superintendent of that department approved the action of the medical examiner, and further correspondence resulted in the plaintiff\u2019s appealing the matter to the advisory committee, which appeal was authorized by the regulations governing the department. Plaintiff, after said appeal was brought and before its determination, withdrew the appeal, and the action of the medical examiner, affirmed by the superintendent, stands unappealed from and unreversed. This action was begun July <em>21, </em>1905, and thereafter the defendant Northern Central Railway Company notified the plaintiff that his furlough had terminated, and, unless he returned to work at a time stated, he would cease to be an employ\u00e9 of the company. If he ceased to be an employ\u00e9 of the company, he would cease to be a member of the relief fund, except so far as the liabilities were fixed with reference to his accident. Thereafter, and, as we assume, under the advice of counsel, the plaintiff returned to work, and was given employment as a carrier of despatches or messages from one place to another at a salary of $40 per month. Before the injury he earned $75 per month as flagman. A member of the relief fund may retire upon giving written notice, but until such retirement the company deducts five cents a day from his wages, and pays it into the relief fund. Plaintiff continued in such employment for a little over two months, and upon the monthly settlements the five cents per day was deducted from his wages for the relief fund, and he signed vouchers for the payments in which was recited the amount deducted and paid to the relief fund. Thereafter he demanded repayment to him of the moneys so deducted and paid to the relief fund, which being refused he left the defendant\u2019s employ. At the time he became a member of the relief fund section 45 of the regulations provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-3\">\u201cQuestions as to the permanent character of disability and the continued payment of benefits on account of the same shall be determined by the advisory committee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Before -the plaintiff\u2019s injury, this regulation was amended so as to provide that, in case of a disablement \u201cof a permanent character, benefits will cease when a member shall be declared by the medical examiner as able to earn a livelihood in an employment suited to his capacity.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s contention is that this case must be governed by section 45 of the regulations as it existed when he became a member, and that the words, \u201cto earn a livelihood in an employment suited to his capacity,\u201d refers to his capacity as it existed prior to the time of the injury, and not at the time when he is claiming benefits on account of his disablement. This voluntary relief fund is not an indemnity or accident insurance company, but is the administration of a fund created by the members themselves to relieve an unfortunate member during the time when by accident he is prevented from earning a livelihood. The provision of section 43 that the payments are \u201cwhile disabled by accident,\u201d together with the provisions of section 45, show that the payments are to a person wholly unable to labor on account of a temporary injury, or who is unable to earn a livelihood in an employment suited to his disabled conditions where his 'injury is permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s right to the benefits then depend upon the question whether upon February 1, 1905, he was able to earn a livelihood in an employment suitable to his capacity as it then was. The medical examiner determined that he was, the superintendent approved of the determination, and, if the plaintiff was dissatisfied with that determination, he had the right to appeal .to the advisory committee. In his application for membership he expressly agreed \u201cto be.especially bound by regulation No. 65, providing for final and conclusive settlements of all disputes by reference to the superintendent of the relief department and an appeal from his decision to the\u2019 advisory committee.\u201d After having brought the appeal to the advisory committee, he waived its benefits. The fact that later he entered the employ of the company at $40 per month shows that he was not entirely disabled, and that a calling suitable, to his capacity was offered to and accepted by him, and was afterwards rejected without reasonable cause. The evidence discloses no fact tending to show that the plaintiff was disabled from earning a livelihood, except the fact that he was a one-armed man. The burden at least rested upon him to show that the decision of the medical examiner approved by the superintendent was not justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">So far we have not considered the amendment to the by-laws made after the plaintiff became a member of the association, for the reason that the amendment does not substantially change the plaintiff\u2019s rights. In the original by-law the advisory committee was to determine as to the continuance of benefit. Under the amended by-law the medical examiner was to make such determination,' with a right to appeal to the superintendent and the advisory committee. These were matters as to the internal management of the fund or association of' which the plaintiff was a member, and by his application for membership he agreed to be bound by the regulations of the fund as it then existed and by any other regulations thereafter adopted, and the regulations of the fund also provides that he is especially bound by proper amendments and by-laws. The amendments were reasonable, and violated no rights of the plaintiff. Wright v. Knights of Maccabees (decided at the November term of this court) 106 N. Y. Supp. 1150. As stated before, the record is without evidence that the plaintiff is unable to earn a livelihood in an employment suited to his capacity, and therefore he has failed to establish a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The judgment should therefore be reversed upon the law and the. facts, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur; COCHRANE, J., in result, on the ground that plaintiff should have exhausted his remedy within the organization before resorting to the courts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
