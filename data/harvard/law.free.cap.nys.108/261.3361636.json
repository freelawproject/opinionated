Being made by the president in the name of the corporation, and one which the corporation had the power to authorize him to make, or to ratify after he had made it, the presumption was that he had the power to make it, and the burden, was on the corporation (the defendant) to show that it had not done so. That sufficed to admit it in evidence. Patterson v. Robinson, 116 N. Y. 193, <em>22 </em>N. E. 372; Davies v. Harvey Steel Co., 6 App. Div. 166, 39 N. Y. Supp. 791; Nat\u2019l State Bank v. Vigo Co. Nat. Bank, 141 Ind. 352, 40 N. E. 799, 50 Am. St. Rep. 330; Eureka Iron &amp; Steel Works v. Bresnahan, 60 Mich. 332, 27 N. W. 524. The case of Camacho v. Hamilton Bank Note Company, 2 App. Div. 369, 37 N. Y. Supp. 725, did not have to do with a contract made by an officer but by an employ\u00e9 or agent of a corporation. Inasmuch as the defendant introduced no evidence, the charge of the learned trial Judge that the written contract was the contract between the, parties was not error. There was nothing to rebut the presumption in its favor. The contract was that the commission was to be on the \u201cnet sales.\u201d The offer to prove the salaries and other expenses of the business to arrive at the net sales was properly not entertained. Only the discounts were to be regarded in arriving at the net sales. The extracts from the books ho show the sales were properly received. They were furnished to the plaintiff at his request at the defendant\u2019s office by the manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
