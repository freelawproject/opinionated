Plaintiff duly objected to the amendment, and excepted to its allowance by the referee. The referee has found for defendant and against the plaintiff the full amount of the counterclaim, and the result of the action was materially changed thereby. The referee had no power to grant this amendment, and plaintiff\u2019s exception thereto presents reversible error. Mitchell v.
