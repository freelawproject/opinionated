Williamson and the codicil thereto. If the testatrix\u2019s husband took an absolute fee under the will, the judgment must be affirmed; otherwise, not. Those parts of the will and the codicil in question read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">\u201cThird. * * * Ail the rest, residue and remainder of my personal estate, and all my real estate, I give, devise and bequeath to my beloved husband, William K. Williamson, for and during his natural life, and it is my will and I do hereby order and direct that he shall be at liberty to use as much of the principal of my said residuary personal estate as he may need for any purpose whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">\u2018\u2018Fourth. I do hereby authorize and empower my said executor at any time is his discretion and whenever he may deem it for the best interest of my estate to sell and dispose of all or any part of my real estate, and in case of such sale I do hereby authorize and empower my said husband to use as much of the proceeds of such sale as he may desire and for any purpose whatsoever, and I do hereby order and direct that my said husband shall not in any way whatever be accountable or responsible to my heirs for any such use of my said estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">By her codicil she provided for an additional legacy of $1,000, and, referring to the third clause of her will, she added, after providing for the legacy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">\u201cI do hereby give and bequeath the remainder of my said residuary estate to my said husband for and during his natural life, and I do hereby order and direct that my said husband be at liberty to use as much of the principal of said residuary personal estate as he may desire or need for any purpose whatsoever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">Section 133 of the real property law (Laws 1896, p. 580, c. 547) provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">\u201cEvery power of disposition by means of which the grantee is enabled, in his lifetime, to dispose of the entire fee for his own benefit, is deemed absolute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">This and the other related sections of the real property law have been passed upon repeatedly by the Court of Appeals, and it seems to be well settled that, because of the statutory provision, the beneficiary under a will like the one in question takes an absolute fee, and especially where, as in' this case, \u201cno remainder is limited on the estate of the grantee of the power.\u201d Section 131, Real Property Law (Laws 1896, p. 580, c. 547). The terms of the statute are plain and have been given full effect. Cutting v. Cutting, 86 N. Y. 534; In re Moehring, 154 N. Y. 428, 48 N. E. 818; Deegan v. Wade, 144 N. Y. 578, 39 N. E. 692; Hume v. Randall, 141 N. Y. 499, 36 N. E. 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">There can hardly 'be serious doubt that the husband took the absolute fee, and the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.- All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
