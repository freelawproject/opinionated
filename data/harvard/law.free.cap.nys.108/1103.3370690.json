Such allegation is essential as a condition precedent (Wood &amp; Selick v. Ball, 190 N. Y. 217, 83 N. E. 21) and, being denied, an issue in the case. The motion to dismiss for failure of proof therefor at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case should have been granted, and, though not specifically moved at the close of the whole case, the defendants were entitled to the direction of a verdict pursuant to motion, the plaintiff failing to prove its compliance with section 15 of the general corporation law (Laws 1892, p. 1805, c. 687), which \u201cshould be alleged and proved by a foreign corporation such as the plaintiff, in order to establish a cause of action in the courts of this state\u201d (Wood &amp; Selick v. Ball, at page 225 of 190 N. Y., and page 23 of 83 N. E.); the record disclosing no admission thereof. The judgment should therefore be reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-9\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-10\">GILDERSLEEVE, P.

(concurring).</author>\n<p id=\"AZRM\">The motion for dismissal of the complaint, made upon the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, for failure of proof of compliance with the provisions of section 15 of the general corporation law (Laws 1892, p. 1805, c. 687), should have been granted, and the error of its denial was curable only by proof of such compliance subsequently introduced by either party, of which there was none. Obviously, the mere statement of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that counsel for the defendant had agreed to admit the fact of such compliance and to waive proof of it, made against the latter\u2019s insistence upon a ruling, did not have the effect of such proof or a waiver of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-12\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
