The justice gave him judgment for that sum, with interest and costs. Defendant appeals, and urges as the sole ground for reversal that the market price was $198, and not $220.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-14\">The only witness as to the market value was one Weislcer, who testified thus: \u201cQ. What was the market value of such an instrument on March 16, 1907? A. $220.\u201d It appears on cross-examination, however, that defendant, at the time plaintiff made the purchase of the tripod, in order to deliver same to defendant, could have purchased the same in the market for $198. Had the city occasion, at this time, to replace a lost tripod of the kind in question, it could have bought the same in the market for $198.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-15\">The judgment should be reduced by $22, and, as thus modified, affirmed, without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
