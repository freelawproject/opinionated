The latter testified that he was knocked down, and that, raising the defendant\u2019s disguise or mask, he recognized the defendant while the latter was assaulting him. Money and a watch were taken from him. The defendant offered evidence tending to show that the assault was committed by his three companions in spite of his efforts, physical and verbal, to prevent it. The defendant\u2019s companion, Fuchs, already convicted of this robbery, was called by the people, and testified that the watch was given him by Nestlin on October 10th, and that he did not see the defendant on that day. The crime was committed between 13 and 1\" o\u2019clock.on the night of October 9th. Fuchs was permitted to testify on direct examination that when he obtained the watch from Nestlin the latter said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">\u201cHere is the watch Martin [the defendant] gave me. Go back and give it to the man, and just say Martin gave it to me.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">A motion to strike out the answer was denied, and the defendant excepted. We think this ruling was prejudicial error. That the evidence was important as bearing upon the guilt of the defendant is clear, for it tended to show that the defendant\u2019s participation in th\u00e9 occurrence was that of criminal, rather than that of good Samaritan. That error was committed in allowing the evidence to remain in the case is clear, for it was in the nature of a narrative or subsequent confession by one of the accomplices. Nestlin\u2019s statement to the witness Fuchs was made the next day after the commission of the crime, and at a time when the purpose of the conspiracy, if any, had been attained. The proof in .the case tended to show a conspiracy between the defendant and his three companions to commit the robbery, but fell short of establishing any conspiracy to dispose of the booty or to do any illegal act subsequent to the time of the commission of the actual robbery. The ruling upon the trial was therefore error. People v. Quinn (decided January 10, 1908) 107 N. Y. Supp. 1101, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">The judgment of conviction should be reversed, and a new trial ordered. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
