Instead of stopping at the crossing, it went beyond. There was a trench alongside the track five or six feet deep and about three feet wide. It had been dug about a week before. At the crossing the trench was boarded over. It was a dark place. The plaintiff stepped from the car step right into the trench and fell to the bottom of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">The principal point of the appellant is that it was error to perm.it the plaintiff to prove derangement of and blood clots in the uterus and dizziness as caused by the accident, on the ground that they were not embraced in the complaint. But the complaint not only specifies several parts of the body in which the plaintiff was injured, but adds the general and comprehensive phrase, \u201cand other parts of her body.\u201d Where a complaint specifically enumerates certain injuries only, it excludes all other injuries, but when instead of so limiting it alleges injuries in general terms it includes all injuries. The complaint here by its general allegation embraced all of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, and hence all of the consequences that would naturally ensue from them. The plaintiff had a hemorrhage of the womb from her injuries the night of her hurt, and it was proper to trace the injury to her womb through all of its subsequent course. And it is difficult to see why it. is objected that evidence of dizziness from the injury to the head was not relevant and material. It was not error to exclude as immaterial evidence that the trench was not dug by the defendant but by a gas company, for without dispute the defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s knew it was there, and therefore their duty of care in respect of it was the same as though the defendant had dug it.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
