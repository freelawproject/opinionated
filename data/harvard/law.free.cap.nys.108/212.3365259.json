Ginn, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b233-7\">D. B. Lucey, for the People.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b233-8\">SEWELL, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A36\">By section 9, c. 20, p. 24, Laws 1900, as amended by chapter 545, p. 1341, Laws 1901, it is provided, among other things, that \u201cdeer shall not be hunted, pursued or killed with any dog or bitch,\u201d and section 16 of that act, as amended by chapter 319, p. 590, Laws 1905, provides that a person who violates this provision is guilty of a misdemeanor, and, in addition thereto, is liable to a penalty of $100 for each violation, and to an additional penalty of $100 for each deer so taken or possessed. This appeal presents the question whether only one penalty is imposed when two or more persons concur in the act of hunting, pursuing, or killing \u00e1 deer with a dog, and whether only one penalty attaches for each deer so taken or possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">It was said in Palmer v. Conly, 4 Denio, 378:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">\u201cThe rule at common law is universal that every crime, as far as respects the guilt and punishment of the parties engaged in the perpetration of it, is several; and that, if two or more persons concur in the commission of an offense, each offender is liable to a several punishment. This principle extends to statute offenses as well as to those which are punishable by the common law; and in general there is no distinction in the application of it between the higher kinds of punishment and fines or mere pecuniary penalties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">The doctrine of that case applied to the questions under consideration leads to the conclusion that every person concerned is separately liable to the penalty, for it is obvious that the Legislature did not intend the penalties imposed by this statute as a satisfaction for a loss, but as a punishment of the offenders. The statute itself has made the offense several and every offender separately liable. It, in terms, imposes a penalty not on an offense which several may do jointly, but upon \u201ca person who violates,\u201d meaning any and every person who violates, and for each and every violation. Subdivision 8 of section 140 of the statute, as amended by Laws 1904, p. 1407, c. 580, \u00a7 13, confirms this interpretation. It declares that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-12\">\u201cA person who counsels, aids or assists in the violation of any of the provisions of the forest, fish and game law, or knowingly shares in any of the proceeds of said violation by receiving or possessing either fish, birds, game or timber, shall be deemed to have incurred the penalties provided in this act against the person guilty of such violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">From the language of this section it is apparent that the Legislature intended to make each offender separately liable, whether he actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>engages in the prohibited acts or only counsels, aids, or assists in a violation, or knowingly shares in the proceeds. People v. Girard, 73 Hun, 457, 26 N. Y. Supp. 272, affirmed 145 N. Y. 105, 39 N. E. 823, 45 Am. St. Rep. 595. It follows that the interlocutory judgment should be affirmed, with costs, and with leave to the defendant to amend upon payment of costs of demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Interlocutory judgment affirmed, with costs, with leave to defendant on payment, within 20 days, .of such costs and of the costs in the court below, to serve an amended answer. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
