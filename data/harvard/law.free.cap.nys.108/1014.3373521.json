The action was to recover $400 loaned by the plaintiff to the defendant. The proof showed that the money was procured by the plaintiff upon his indorsement of the defendant\u2019s note, which he caused to be discounted, that he deposited the amount in his bank and paid it over to meet certain expenses of a business, which, at the' time, he and the defendant were conducting as partners. All the circumstances of the case, agreeably to the plaintiff\u2019s own letters, indicate that the transaction involved no loan or payment to the defendant individually, but was an incident merely to the partnership affairs. There was no loan, in form, to the defendant, and the evidence offered in his behalf that the loan was not made to him was admissible under the general denial, since no element of confession and avoidance was involved. The suggestion contained in the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that the defendant had promised to pay him this $400, and that it was not a partnership matter, would certainly appear to be contrary to the weight of the evidence, in view of the plaintiff\u2019s own writings, and, indeed, his very liability upon the note\u2014the basis of his claim of a loan by him\u2014has been assumed by a corporation which took over the partnership business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
