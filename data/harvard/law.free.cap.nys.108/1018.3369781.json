It was claimed by plaintiff that defendants promised to pay for the lumber at the time the same was purchased by the contractor. An issue of fact was presented upon the trial as to whether defendants made such a promise. The learned justice has decided in favor of defendants, and there is sufficient evidence in the case to sustain his finding. We are not clear, however, that he decided the case upon the facts. He evidently believed that the agreement claimed by plaintiff to have been made was an agreement to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of the Shea-Ellis Construction Company, and therefore within the statute of frauds. No opinion was written, and we are unable to say upon what ground the case was finally decided. The decision must be sustained, and it makes no difference whether it was decided upon the facts or the law. Plaintiff\u2019s president testified that he had a conversation with one of the defendants at the time the order was received over the telephone as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1039-11\">\u201cI said: \u2018We have here an order from the Shea-Ellis Construction Company for lumber, and we don\u2019t know anything about them.\u2019 Q. For what building? A. Creation Building. He said: \u2018That is all right. I will see you paid.\u2019 I said: \u2018That will hardly go in a transaction like that. We will have to deal with you direct.\u2019 He said: \u2018That is all right. Any lumber shipped to the Creation Building we will pay for.\u2019 I said: \u2018Who is we? He said: \u2018Mr. Ryan, and myself.\u2019 I said: \u2018How does Mr. R.van come in this?' He said: \u2018Anything I say will go.\u2019 * * * He said they were both interested in this Creation Building.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1039-12\">Subsequently the lumber was delivered and bill therefor rendered to the Shea-Ellis Construction Company, the principal debtor. The case at bar is distinguishable from the case of Almond v. Hart and Others, 46 App. Div. 431, 61 N. Y. Supp. 849. There the promisors were the owners of the building and the promise was an original undertaking, while in the case at bar defendants were merely the officers of a corporation which had an interest in the building. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>undertook by a collateral promise to answer for -the debt of a third person. It was not their debt, and the same would have been true if the indebtedness had been that of the corporation of which they were officers. Mechanics\u2019 &amp; Traders\u2019 Bank v. Stettheimer, 116 App. Div. 198, 101 N. Y. Supp. 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">The promise, assuming one to have been made, was void; and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
