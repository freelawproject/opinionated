The plaintiff, a little boy eight years of age, was sitting on the step by the side of the cellarway, when one of the defendants kicked him and caused him to fall into the cellarway, sustaining injuries for which he has recovered. The plaintiff\u2019s theory is that the open cellarway was one of the proximate causes of the injuries; that that and the assault were concurrent causes. We do not think so. The plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, if any, is for assault against the person who \u00e9ommitted the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-21\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial ordered ; costs to abide the event. All concur, except HOOKER-, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
