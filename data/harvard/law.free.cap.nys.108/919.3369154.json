There was evidence that the defendant was at the same time carrying out of the store to his, wagon heavy iron sheets and that the jar from one of them on the sidewalk caused the bundle of rods to fall over. Be this as it may, the nonsuit at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence was error. The mere fall of the bundle sufficed to make out a case for the plaintiff for the jury. The maxim that the thing speaks for itself applied. It is a fair inference that the bundle would not have fallen if carefully placed. One who invites the public to his place of business is under the duty, of reasonable care to make his place safe to those who come (Davis v. Ferris, 29 App. Div. 623, 53 N. Y. Supp. 571; Schnizer v.
