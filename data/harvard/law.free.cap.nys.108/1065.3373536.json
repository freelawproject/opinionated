Necessarily the use of reasonable care in the performance of the work was an element involved in the claim for the value of the services, and the judgment could not have been rendered consistently with the state of facts upon which the plaintiffs\u2019present cause of action is based. That under such circumstances the judgment for the value of the services is a bar to a suit for negligence, and that the effect is the same although the earlier recovery was upon default, has been settled by authority.
