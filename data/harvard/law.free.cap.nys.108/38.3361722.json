Plaintiff\u2019s employment was shown by a postal card sent by the defendant to the plaintiff, reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-14\">\u201cDear Sir: Will y\u00f3u do me a favor and remove dirt in front of 4 story Buildings on 51 St bet 3 and 4 Ave at once and sent Bill to me. Mr. Bauer of Myrtle Ave &amp; Broadway recommended you. Your attention will oblige.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-15\">\u201cYours truly, Andrew Ruegamer, Jr., Trustee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-16\">The defense is that the defendant was acting as trustee for creditors, and hence not liable, because he was a mere agent; but it is undisputed that the plaintiff was not advised and did not know whom the defendant represented. Under the evidence as it stands the plaintiff was entitled to recover. Argersinger et al. v. MacNaughton, 114 N. Y. 535, <em>21 </em>N. E. <em>1022, 11 </em>Am.
