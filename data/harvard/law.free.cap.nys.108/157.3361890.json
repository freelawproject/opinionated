The base of such wall was one foot over on the appellants\u2019 land, and this proceeding was begun to acquire the strip encroached upon. After appearing, the appellants allowed judgment to be taken by default. A motion was afterwards made by the respondent while the commissioners were still sitting to correct the description in the petition and judgment. The introductory words of such description, and the map referred to in it, which exhibited the wall, showed the strip one foot wide to be taken, but in the description by metes and bounds the lines were not run correctly. The correction asked for was only of a clerical error, and the court was authorized to make it.- Code Civ.
