It brings this action on a bond given by the defendant to indemnify it against acts of Theodore F. Lake amounting to embezzlement or larceny. Lake was .the agency director of the plaintiff for the state of Michigan, with headquarters at the city of Detroit, in said state. His transactions as such- agency director covered by said bond extended from June to December in the year 1904, when he made default in payments of premiums collected on policies delivered by him and absconded. The books and records at the home office of course disclosed what policies had been sent to Hake. Equipped with a transcript of such policies, plaintiff\u2019s auditor, Mr. Jacobs, proceeded to Detroit to make an investigation. He found there no books in the office of the company, except what has been termed a \u201ccash book,\u201d and which was prepared by one Williams, a cashier in the employ of Lake, from check stubs and such data as he was able to find. No regular accounts were kept. The situation was confused and chaotic. Jacobs as a witness for plaintiff at the trial detailed the situation and his conversations with Williams con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>cerning the same. He was there about a week conferring with Williams, with the various subagents of Lake, and with different policy holders. On his return, he prepared, verified, and delivered to the defendant, in accordance with the requirements of the bond, a written statement of the alleged embezzlements or larcenies of Lake, which statement constituted what is characterized in said bond as a \u201cproof of loss.\u201d He testified on direct examination that the statement was based on the books and accounts of the company \u201cand data secured in Michigan, in Detroit.\u201d Such statement was then received in evidence under a provision in said bond as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\">\u201cIt being understood that a written statement of such loss certified by a duly authorized representative of the employer and based upon the accounts of the employer shall be prima facie evidence thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Jacobs further testified that the information which enabled him to make up such statement came from Williams and agents who had paid money to Lake and from policy holders; that he \u201cmerely had Mr. Williams\u2019 word and Mr. Williams\u2019 written statement for the fact that these premiums had been paid\u201d; that he did not know how Williams prepared the statement, or what his information was when he prepared it, but that .he knew there were no records and that it was not prepared from records kept by Lake. That a statement of loss properly prepared and \u201cbased upon the accounts of the employer\u201d is prima facie evidence under a provision in a bond like the one above quoted was decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in American Surety Company v. Pauly, 170 U. S. 160, 18 Sup. Ct. 563, <em>42 </em>L. Ed. 987. This statement in question to the extent that it reflected information contained in the books and records of plaintiff kept in the regular and ordinary course of-its business was doubtless based on \u201cthe accounts of the company\u201d within the meaning of the bond and prima facie evidence in plaintiff\u2019s favor. Whether there is comprehended in the phrase \u201caccounts of the employer\u201d information gleaned as in this case by Jacobs from hearsay declarations of third parties interested to have it appear that they had paid their obligations to Lake is a question which was not raised at the trial by an appropriate exception, and need not now be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">But, when plaintiff rested his case, defendant called Williams as a witness, and sought to give his version of his conversations with Jacobs. He testified, as did Jacobs, that they had several conversations. He was then asked to give the first one. This had been specifically detailed by Jacobs on his direct examination, and was the source of his information as to the condition of affairs in Lake\u2019s office. An objection to the question was sustained over defendant\u2019s exception. Defendant\u2019s counsel stated, among other things, that he wished to prove how Jacobs made up his statement. After the first conversation had been excluded, it would have been futile for counsel to persist in offering evidence of the subsequent conversations. That this ruling constituted an error of such a far reaching and vital nature as to demand a new trial cannot be gainsaid. By the method adopted by plaintiff, it had succeeded in getting before the jury Jacobs\u2019 version of his conversations and transactions with Williams, and a statement based partly on \u201cdata secured\u201d from him. Confessedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>the statement of loss introduced in evidence was fortified and corroborated by information which Jacobs claimed to have procured from Williams, and it was manifestly erroneous to receive in evidence Jacobs\u2019 version of his conversations with Williams, and exclude Williams\u2019 version of the same conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">There are other rulings of a doubtful nature in the exclusion of evidence and in the charge of the court to the jury; but, as they probably will not occur again, we refrain from discussing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The judgment and order must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
