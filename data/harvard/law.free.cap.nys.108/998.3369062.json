Such a condition could be no more self-executing, at the tenant\u2019s election, than would a provision terminating the lease for nonpayment of rent (see Rede v. Farr, 6 Maule &amp; Sel. 121; Roehner v. Insurance Co., 63 N. Y. 160, 166); and, since no actual termination was proven in the present case, the fact of the filing of process did not amount to a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s recovery is unassailable, and the judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs. .
