This chain was part of the equipment of an elevator, leased by and under the exclusive control and management of defendant, and being part of the place, machinery, and tools used by the defendant and his employ\u00e9s in defendant\u2019s business. The case was tried before the court and a jury, and the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>plaint was dismissed upon plaintiff\u2019s evidence alone; so that this evidence is entitled, not only to belief, but to all favorable inferences that can reasonably be drawn therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">It appears that the chain had broken once before, about four months before the accident, and had been mended by an employ\u00e9 of defendant. The plaintiff is concededly free from all contributory negligence. Why the chain fell from its fastening is not shown. The elevator was run by an electric battery belonging to defendant. No one used the elevator, or had anything to d\u00f3 with keeping it in repair, except defendant. Under ordinary circumstances the chain should not have broken away from its fastening, and it seems to us that plaintiff made out a prima facie case, which called upon defendant for some explanation. The character of the occurrence and the attendant circumstances established by the testimony, in the absence of explanation, were sufficient to warrant the jury in finding the defendant guilty of negligence. Griffen v. Manice, 166 N. Y. 188, 59 N. E. 925, 52 L. R. A. 922, 82 Am. St. Rep. 630. The fact that the relation of master and servant existed between the parties does not relieve the defendant from liability. We think, under the evidence, that the learned court below fell into error in dismissing the complaint, and should have submitted the question of defendant\u2019s negligence to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
