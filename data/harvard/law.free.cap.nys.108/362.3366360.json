The driver was called as a witness for the plaintiff, and during his examination the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>\u201cQ. How\" far was the car bam. from where the accident happened? A. About a mile; maybe a little more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Counsel: He settled his case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa9x\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: I object to that as improper, that remark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">\u201cThe Court: I think it is improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: And I\" ask your honor to tell this jury that they must disregard that remark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Counsel: That remark was not made to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-10\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: I move for the withdrawal of a juror.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-11\">\u201cThe Court: Motion denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-12\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s-Counsel: Exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-13\">\u201cThe Court: Something has been said about this man being injured, and his counsel says that his claim was settled. That has nothing to do with this case, and should not have been mentioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-15\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Counsel: I am not his counsel, and never was his counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-16\">\u201cThe Court: Well, the lawyer who is trying the case said so, and he should not have said so, and you must keep it out ,of your mind that he did say so, or that that fact happened.\u201d \u2022 ' \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-17\">We think it evident that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney deliberately made .the statement for the purpose of informing the jury that the defendant had settled with the driver. Such conduct must not be suffered to -pass unnoticed. The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-18\">' Judgment and order of the County Court of Queens county reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
