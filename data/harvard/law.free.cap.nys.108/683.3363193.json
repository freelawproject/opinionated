This to refer to rehearsals, as well as any performance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-16\">The employment was for the theatrical season of 1906-07. On November 10, 1906, defendant sent plaintiff a notice stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-17\">\u201cAccording to the terms of the contract now existing between you and the Shubert Theatrical Company, this will serve as your two weeks\u2019 notice, ending Saturday night, November 24, 1906.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-18\">Plaintiff was paid a salary of $100 a week, the price stipulated in -the contract, down to November 24, 1906. He received a second notice from the defendant, which he admitted he received on or prior to November 24th, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-19\">\u201cDear Sir: Pursuant to the terms of paragraph second of the contract \u2022made with you, dated July 18, 1906, we hereby desire to notify you that your \u2022services are not satisfactorily rendered, and we hereby cancel the contract between you and ourselves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-20\">\u201cYours truly, Shubert Theatrical Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-21\">The contract in question did not contain any clause providing for a -two weeks\u2019 notice. Where a contract contains a clause that the services are to be satisfactory to the employer, the right to discharge if the services are not satisfactory to him, if the employment is of the \u2022class involving taste, fancy, interest, and personal satisfaction or judgment, and if the employer discharges the employe, the question whether not the services of the employ\u00e9 are satisfactory is to be determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>solely by the employer, and not by the court or jury. But where the employment is not of that class, and where the master has the power to discharge the employ\u00e9, if satisfied in good faith that he is incompetent, there the good faith is one of fact, which must be submitted to the jury. This distinction is clearly laid down by the Appellate Division in the case of Fuller v. Downing, 120 App. Div. 39, 104 N. Y. Supp. 991, and Parker v. Hyde &amp; Behman Amusement Co., 53 Misc. Rep. 549, 103 N. Y. Supp. 731. The plaintiff in this case was employed as an actor, an employment of the class involving taste, fancy, and personal satisfaction or judgment, and his contract therefore falls within the rule laid down in Crawford v. Mail &amp; Express Publishing Company, 163 N. Y. 404, 57 N. E. 616, and the question of good faith of the defendant in discharging plaintiff is not material. In that case plaintiff, a newspaper writer, was employed at a fixed rate of compensation per week, so long as his services \u201cshall be satisfactory to the publishers.\u201d The letter discharging the plaintiff in the Crawford Case contained no expression, or even suggestion, of dissatisfaction of his services. The defendant in the case at bar had the absolute right to discharge the plaintiff at any time when his services ceased to be satisfactory to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">GIEDERSEEEVE, P.
