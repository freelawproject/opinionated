The plaintiff, as a compliance with these requirements, presented to the court an affidavit which alleged that the action was brought to procure the cancellation of plaintiff\u2019s request for an allotment of shares in the defendant corporation, and for the return of the sum of \u00bf2,000 paid on account thereof; that in the month of December, 1906, or early in the year 1907, plaintiff requested the directors of the defendant corporation to allot to him 10,000 shares of the said defendant company of the par value of \u00bf1 each; that the plaintiff has no knowledge as to whether such allotment was ever formally made and the number of shares set apart to and for him; that this request was based upon certain representations made to him as to the affairs of the company; and that by reason of these statements and representations, and in reliance thereon, the plaintiff was induced to make his request for the allotment of said .-shares. The affidavit then alleges upon information and belief that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-12\">\u201cThe statements and representations by which plaintiff was induced to make the request for the allotment of the said shares, and the terms and con-ditions on which said request was in fact made by him, have not been kept, performed, and observed by the defendant, but the same have been violated, broken, and disregarded in various important and essential particulars; but neither plaintiff nor deponent has sufficient knowledge or information in regard thereto to set up in the complaint herein the facts touching the said 'breach, violation, and disregard of the said terms, conditions, statements, .and representations as fully and definitely as it is necessary should be done -in order to properly and adequately state plaintiff\u2019s cause of action herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-13\">The affidavit is not made by the plaintiff, but by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and this is the only- allegation as to the falsity of the rep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>resentations by which the plaintiff was induced to make the request for an allotment of shares of stock of the defendant corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">We think this is insufficient t\u00f3 justify the court to require the defendant to be examined to enable the plaintiff to prepare the complaint. There is a general allegation on information and belief without stating the source of the information or the grounds of the belief, and without stating which of the representations were not complied with. Upon this affidavit, as it stands, there is no proof that the plaintiff has any cause of action, nor is any fact stated from which the court can ascertain that the examination would be material and necessary for the plaintiff in the prosecution of the action. To justify an order for the examination of a party before the service of the complaint, the essential requirements are that the facts which appear by the affidavits show that plaintiff has a cause of action, and that the examination of the adverse party is necessary to enable the plaintiff to prepare the complaint. A mere conclusion or allegation upon information and 'belief without stating the sources of the information or the grounds of the belief is not sufficient, and, as the plaintiff in this case fails to state the facts upon which he bases his allegation that these statements and representations that were made\u2019 to induce him to request an allotment of the stock were untrue, he was not entitled to an order for, the examination of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">It follows that the order appealed from must be reversed with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate the order for the examination of the defendant granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
