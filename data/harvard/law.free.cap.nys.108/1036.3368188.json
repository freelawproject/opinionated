And the party of the first part further agrees, on termination of this lease by reason of sale of the property as referred to prior to the termination of the term named, to reimburse the said second party for all outlays as follows: All repairs made by said party, approved in writing by the said first party, and paid for by said second party, are to be refunded to second party pro rata; that is to say: Should the expenditures amount to two hundred dollars, and lease was terminated in two years by reason of sale of property, the rebate would be at rate of forty dollars per annum for the unexpired term. And it is further understood and agreed that the covenants and agreements contained in the within lease are binding on the parties and their legal representatives.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1057-16\">The word \u201cimprovements,\u201d when read with its associated word \u201crepairs,\u201d and with the context, and considered with reference to the subject-matter, means changes or betterments in the existing building or structure demised. Ames v. Trenton Brewing Co., 56 N. J. Eq. 309-317, 38 Atl. 858, 861; Wimberly v. Mayberry, 94 Ala. 240, 10 South. 157, 14 L. R. A. 308. In the latter case the court say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-17\">\u201cAn improvement may be an independent structure or addition, and it may be an addition to or mere betterment of a building or improvement already made, and not included in \u2018repairs thereto.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1057-18\">The covenant for surrender before the expiry of the term provided only that the tenant should give up possession on receiving six months\u2019 notice of a bona fide sale at the end of six months; but it also provided, \u201cand on payment of the pro rata amount of expenditures by her in repairs and improvements on th\u00e9 property\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>to be paid by the lessor. I think that the case falls within the rule applied to the second lease in Van Rensselaer\u2019s Heirs v. Penniman, 6 Wend. 569, as stated and approved in Matter of Coatsworth, 160 N. Y. 122, 54 N. E. 665, and that therefore the tenant was not bound to surrender the premises before the expiry of the term of the lease until notice was both given and perfected and the expenditures were paid or'tendered to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">I think that the covenant ran with the land; for it related to repairs, and so to something in esse. Lametti v. Anderson, 6 Cow. 302, affirmed 6 Wend. 326; Thompson v. Rose, 8 Cow. 266; Verplanck v. Wright, 23 Wend. 510; Belden v. Union Warehouse Co., 11 App. Div. 163, 42 N. Y. Supp. 650, and authorities cited. It is not essential that such a covenant should name the assigns of the covenantors. Thus in Thompson v. Rose, supra, the court say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-6\">\u201cSuch a covenant to repair extends to the support of the things-demised, and is, quo ad modo, .annexed and appurtenant to it, and shall bind the assignee, though he be not named.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1058-7\">See, too, Denman v. Prince, 40 Barb. 213-217, and authorities cited; Winfield v. Henning, 21 N. J. Eq. 188; Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law (2d Ed.) vol. 8, p. 137, and authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-8\">Moreover, it is provided that the covenants and agreements shall be binding on the parties and their \u201clegal representatives,\u201d which may- in this case include the assigns. N. Y. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Armstrong, 117 U. S. 597, 6 Sup. Ct. 877, 29 L. Ed. 997. The parties could have made a new agreement as lessor and lessee, which would have worked a surrender of the unexpired term (Smith v. Kerr, 108 N. Y. 31, 15 N. E. 70, <em>2 </em>Am. St. Rep. 362); but the evidence does not satisfy me that this was done. Moreover, the landlord invoked this covenant in the original lease (whose term was then outstanding) in order to end the tenancy. I think, however, that it is still in the power of the landlord to demand and to compel a performance of the covenant in question. Holsman v. Abrams, 2 Duer, 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-9\">The final order must be reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
