J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHXr\">This is an appeal from a final order made in a summary proceeding, entered upon a verdict of a jury in favor of the landlords. The landlords based their right to dispossess the tenant upon the ground that the tenant was holding over after the expiration of the term. The notice of election to terminate the tenancy was dated and served November <em>22, </em>1907, and required the tenant to move on December 1, 1907, nine days thereafter. Edward C. Rybicki, the agent of the landlords, and the person who arranged the terms of the lease with the tenant, testified that the tenant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>occupied the premises (basement floor), for about three years; that on April 24, 1907, he said to the tenant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-4\">\u201cI am informed by the tenement house department * * * that it is serving notices on all landlords who have basements in the houses and in the rear in which people occupy rooms; * * * that owing to the largeness of his family * * . * and the lack of ventilation in the store, the agent warned me that I would in time be served with a notice compelling said tenant to vacate those rooms. * * * Hereafter, from the 1st of May, you will be recognized, as you always have been, as a monthly tenant, and you can live here as long as the tenement house department does not bother us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Again on cross-examination the same witness said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-7\">\u201cI told the tenant that he could remain in those premises until I received notice from the tenement house department.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">' At fh\u00e9 close of the landlords\u2019 case, and also at the close of the entire case, the counsel for the tenant moved to dismiss the petition upon several grounds, among which was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-9\">\u201cThat it appears from the evidence of the landlords\u2019 agent that the hiring, or alleged agreement which was made on April 24th, was' not an agreement for the term of one month, as set forth in the petition, but is an agreement for an indefinite hiring.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">The motions were denied and exceptions duly taken. Tenant\u2019s counsel requested the court to charge the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-11\">\u201cIf the jury believe that on April 24th the landlords\u2019 agent said: \u2018You can remain in those premises for one month, or until such time that I receive a notice from the tenement house department, and that you are then to vacate,\u2019\u2014that this is an agreement for an indefinite term, and that the jury should render a verdict.in favor of the tenant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-12\">And again:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-13\">\u201cThat under the law of this state, if the agreement was made for any indefinite term, or until the occurrence of a certain event, that there must be a verdict for the tenant.\u201d ,,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-14\">Each of these requests were refused, and exception taken. The foregoing propositions, urged upon the learned court by the tenant\u2019s counsel, correctly stated the law applicable to the case, and the rulings constitute error requiring reversal. The testimony offered by the landlords in support of the petition showed a letting for an indefinite term, and therefore a question of law was presented for the determination of the court; and under the well-settled law of this state the court should have dismissed the petition. Upon the facts established, the notice to terminate the tenancy was not a sufficient notice. The tenant was entitled to a month\u2019s notice. Hoffman v. Van Allen, 3 Misc. Rep. 99, 22 N. Y. Supp. 369; Hungerford v. Wagoner, 5 App. Div. 599, 39 N. Y. Supp. 369; Klingenstein v. Goldwasser, 27 Misc. Rep. 536, 58 N. Y. Supp. 342; McAdam on Landlord &amp; Tenant (3d Ed.) 96. In the Klingenstein Case, Mr. Justice Freedman, writing for this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-15\">\u201cHe testifies that his mother would rent the premises in no other way than from- month to month, and that she said the tenant could have the premises \u2018as long as he paid the rent or until we sell out.\u2019 * * * All the testimony, therefore, substantially agrees that the tenancy in the case at bar was for an indefinite term. That being the case, the tenant was entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>retain possession as long as he paid his rent, or until he received one month\u2019s notice to quit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-3\">The final order should be reversed, with costs to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
