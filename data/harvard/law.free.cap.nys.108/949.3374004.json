The papers before the court below left no doubt of the fact that these attorneys were retained by and performed their services for the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, whose solvency was undisputed and against whom their actual claim for compensation existed and still exists. It may well be that this assignor, Fusco, was hardly treated, and, of course, if there was a collusive settlement in actual fraud of his rights, he has his remedy against the defendant ; but the attorneys are in no position to insist upon the protection of their lien by summary order, since the fact of prejudice of their rights in the matter of collecting payment for their services, an element essential to the application (Poole v. Belcha, 131 N. Y. 200, 30 N. E. 53) does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
