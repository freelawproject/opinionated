On the 1st of April, 1907, plaintiff served a notice of appeal to the Appellate Division, and on the 16th of April, 1907, the defendant made a motion for an order requiring the plaintiff to give security for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-19\">The plaintiff executrix is a nonresident of the state, residing in Ottawa, Canada. There was nothing upon the face of the papers to show such nonresidence, and it was not until the trial, when the plaintiff testified to the fact, that the defendant became aware that she was a nonresident. We do not think, therefore, that the defendant lost its right to move for security by mere lapse of time. The judgment having been entered dismissing the complaint, with costs against the plaintiff, as soon as it became evident by the service of the notice of appeal from the judgment that further proceedings were to be taken, the defendant moved. It seems to us, as it now appears that the plaintiff is a nonresident, and as it does not appear that the estate has \u2019any property within the state subject to execution, it is proper, the court having entered judgment in its favor, that the defendant should be secured for its future costs before further proceedings are had.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>The order appealed from, therefore, should be reversed, and the motion granted, so far as to provide for the payment into court of the sum of $250, or an undertaking in the like sum, as security for costs upon any appeal which may be taken from said judgment, with $10 costs and disbursements upon this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
