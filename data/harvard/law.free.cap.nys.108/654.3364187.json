There is no authority for granting such an order in this form. It is not made in any action or recognized form of special proceeding, and is-neither a mandatory injunction, nor a mandamus, nor an order for a mandamus. The papers are entitled \"People of the State of New York, upon the Relation of Michael Brennan, v. Louis F. Haffen, President of the Borough of the Bronx,\u201d which seems to indicate that the so-called relator intended to apply for a mandamus. He asked, however, only for a peremptory order, and that is what was granted. If the proceeding had been treated as an application for a mandamus, the affidavit of the defendant should have been accepted as a return, and it would have been irregular and improper to receive, as was done, an affidavit from the so-called relator replying to the defendant\u2019s affidavit. The proceeding was wholly irregular, and the order unauthorized. Furthermore, it was erroneous. . The question involved and sought to be raised was expressly decided by this court, adversely to the relator\u2019s contention, in Matter of Ewing, 119 App. Div. 889, 105 N. Y. Supp. 1137, affirming an order of Mr. Justice O\u2019Gorman refusing a similar application, although in that case the relator adopted a proper form of procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-15\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
