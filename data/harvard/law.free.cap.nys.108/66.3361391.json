The defendant appeals from an order denying a motion for a bill of particulars respecting the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The- complaint contains a general allegation that the plaintiff was permanently injured, followed by a statement that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">\u201cHis left liip was bruised and injured, his nervous system was shocked and injured, and he was otherwise bruised and injured about the head, body, and limbs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">It is well settled that in such case the defendant is entitled to a bill of particulars specifying the injuries claimed to be permanent. The physical examination authorized by the Code of Civil Procedure (section 872) does not serve the purpose of a bill of particulars. Baker v. New York City Railway Co., 116 App. Div. 858, 102 N. Y. Supp. 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The order should be reversed, and the motion granted, requiring the plaintiff to serve a bill of particulars specifying the injuries claimed to be permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Order reversed, with \u00a710 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, requiring the plaintiff to serve a bill of particulars specifying the injuries claimed to be permanent, with costs. All concur, except HIRSCHBERG, P. J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
