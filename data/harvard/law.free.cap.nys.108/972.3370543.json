He testified that on May <em>22, </em>1905, he took passage on one of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company\u2019s cars from New York to Philadelphia, and also bought a ticket entitling him to occupy a parlor car seat in one of defendant\u2019s cars attached to the Pennsylvania Railroad train, which train left Jersey City at 7:14 p. m. Just before entering the car he gave his overcoat to defendant\u2019s porter, and told the porter to put it on the- seat plaintiff had engaged in defendant\u2019s said car. He followed the porter into the car, and saw him place the overcoat on the said seat. Plaintiff then went into another car, and remained about an hour and a half, when he returned to the seat in. defendant\u2019s said car and found that his overcoat was gone. What became of the overcoat does not appear. Plaintiff sued for the loss of the same, stating its value to be $50, and the court below gave him judgment for $50 damages and $14.41 costs. Defendant appeals..</p>\n<p id=\"b992-16\">The car in question was used as a day coach, not as a sleeping car,, and the coat was not left in the care or custody of defendant\u2019s servant, but was placed by plaintiff\u2019s own order on the chair which plaintiff had engaged in said car. Under these circumstances the mere unexplained disappearance of the coat did not establish defendant\u2019s liability; but it was incumbent on plaintiff to show negligence on. the part of defendant. .In the case at bar no evidence of such negligence was given. Whicher v. Railroad Co., 176 Mass. <em>275, </em>57 N. E. 601, 79 Am. St. Rep. 314; Carpenter v. N. Y., N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., 124 N. Y. 53, 26 N. E. 277, 11 L. R. A. 759, 21 Am. St. Rep. 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-17\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
