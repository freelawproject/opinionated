The action was-for commissions. The proof offered tended to show the employment of plaintiff to furnish a purchaser for defendant\u2019s premises;, that the plaintiff procured a purchaser in the person of one Kleng, who was introduced to the defendant as a prospective purchaser of the premises for $36,000, $8,000 cash and the balance to be secured by a mortgage upon the property; that afterwards the defendant changed the terms of the sale, and insisted on a larger cash payment, equal to $10,000; that the proposed purchaser, Kleng, refused to make the cash payment of $10,000, and abandoned negotiations with -the defendant; that the said proposed purchaser, Kleng,. had funds with which to make the $8,000 payment; that afterwardsthe plaintiff procured another purchaser, in the person of one Siegel, who was ready and willing -to take the property on defendant\u2019s-terms of $36,000, with a cash payment of $10,000. The rate of commission was to be 1 per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">These facts established a cause of action, and plaintiff was entitled\" to recover at -the close of his case as the evidence then stood. The trial justice erred in dismissing the complaint, and for this error the judgment of the Municipal Court must be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">Judgment of the Municipal Court reversed, and new trial ordered; costs-to abide the event. All concur. '</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
