Y. Supp. 221), on the ground that the verdict of the jury in plaintiff\u2019s favor was against the weight of evidence. On the new trial, granted by such reversal, the defendants obtained a verdict in their favor, and the plaintiff now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-16\">While there is some change in the evidence, the facts, as well as the credibility of the witnesses, were for the jury to determine. There is no such preponderance of evidence in favor of the plaintiff as authorizes us to interfere with the present verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-17\">The judgment and order must therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur, except PATTERSON, P. J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
