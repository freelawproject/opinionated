Proc., \u00a7 1094.5) to compel defendant Board of Retirement of the San Diego City Employees\u2019 Retirement System (the Board) to set aside its decision denying him industrial disability retirement benefits. Alesi applied for a disability retirement after he became incapacitated by a knee injury. The Board denied Alesi\u2019s application based on an adjudicator\u2019s findings that Alesi\u2019s employment with the City of San Diego (the City) \u201cwas not the substantial and significant factor in bringing out the permanent physical incapacities.\u201d Alesi contends (1) the San Diego City Charter (Charter) mandates that a disability retirement be granted if the employee\u2019s disability is a substantial result of employment; and (2) the Charter controls over a conflicting ordinance that Alesi interprets as allowing a disability retirement only if the employee\u2019s disability was caused solely by an employment-related injury. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">Alesi concedes that the court\u2019s factual findings are supported by substantial evidence and therefore controlling. Accordingly, the relevant facts are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">Alesi injured his left knee several times before beginning his employment with the City. He dislocated it in 1986, reinjured it while jet skiing in 1988, and injured it again in a beach football game in 1989. As a result of the 1989 injury he underwent ligament reconstruction surgery and was off work for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">In October 1990 the City hired Alesi as a \u201cUtility I Worker.\u201d His duties included cleaning storm drains and performing street maintenance. In March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>1994 Alesi reinjured his left knee at work when he slipped and fell as he was stepping out of a truck. He returned to work on light duty after undergoing surgery for that injury. In June 1995 he suffered additional knee problems as the result of operating a jack hammer at work and attempting to jet ski. He returned to work after undergoing another surgery and in August 1995 reinjured the knee getting into a truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">In April 1996 Alesi applied for an industrial disability retirement based on knee injury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board referred the application to an adjudicator who conducted an evidentiary hearing and found that Alesi was permanently incapacitated from performing the activities required by his job with the City. The adjudicator further found, however, that Alesi failed to sustain his burden of proving his disability arose out of or in the course of his employment. In his proposed findings and decision, the adjudicator stated: \u201cThis finding is based on the fact that Government Code \u00a7 31720 [and San Diego Municipal Code section] 24.0501 requires [sic] the incapacity to be \u2018the\u2019 result rather than \u2018a\u2019 result of the workplace. In short, [Alesi\u2019s] employment was not the substantial and significant factor in bringing out the permanent physical incapacities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The Board adopted the adjudicator\u2019s proposed decision and denied Alesi\u2019s application for a disability retirement. Alesi filed a petition for writ of mandate in superior court seeking review of the Board\u2019s decision. Applying the independent judgment standard of review, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">\u201cThe weight of the evidence supports the finding that Mr. Alesi\u2019s permanent incapacity was not \u2018the\u2019 result of injury arising out of employment as required under San Diego Municipal Code \u00a7 [24.0501]. There is evidence to show that the employment may have aggravated the injury. However, mere aggravation is not compensable under the retirement scheme in place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">\u201cThe court finds the weight of the evidence supports the findings of the [adjudicator] as approved by [the Board] and thus denies the peremptory writ of mandate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Charter section 141 authorizes the San Diego City Council to enact an ordinance establishing a retirement system for city employees. In relevant part Charter section 141 provides: \u201cThe Council may also in said ordinance provide: [\u00b6]] (a) For the retirement with benefits of an employee who has become physically or mentally disabled by reason of bodily injuries received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>in or by reason of sickness caused by the discharge of duty or as a result thereof to such an extent as to render necessary retirement from active service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">San Diego Municipal Code section 24.0501,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which sets forth the disability retirement requirements for city employees, provides, in relevant part: \u201c(b) Any member of the Retirement System enrolled on or after September 3, 1982, permanently incapacitated from the performance of duty as the result of injury or disease arising out of or in the course of his or her employment and; [H] (1) not arising from a preexisting medical condition . - \u2022 [H] \u2022 . . shall be retired for disability with retirement allowance, regardless of age or amount of . service. For purposes of this section, a preexisting medical condition is defined as any condition which occurred or existed prior to membership in the Retirement System.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Alesi relies on <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Board of Admin., etc. </em>(1939) 34 Cal.App.2d 514 [93 P.2d 1046] for the proposition that the city council may not pass any ordinance that conflicts with the provisions of the Charter. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 521.) Alesi contends section 24.0501 impermissibly conflicts with Charter section 141 with respect to disability retirement because section 24.0501 requires that the qualifying disability be <em>\u201cthe </em>result\u201d of an injury arising out of employment whereas Charter section 141 authorizes the City to provide disability retirement for a disability that is <em>\u201ca </em>result\u201d of an employee\u2019s \u201cdischarge of duty.\u201d He argues that if an employee\u2019s disability need only be <em>\u201ca </em>result\u201d of employment-related injury for the employee to qualify for disability retirement, the disability retirement is available where employment-related injury is one of several causes of the disability, whereas if the disability must be <em>\u201cthe </em>result\u201d of employment-related injury, such injury must be the <em>sole </em>cause of the disability for the employee to qualify for disability retirement. Thus, Alesi argues, the Charter authorizes the City to provide disability retirement benefits if an employee\u2019s disability was caused <em>in part </em>by an employment-related injury, while section 24.0501 inconsistently and impermissibly provides retirement benefits only if the disability was caused <em>solely </em>by an employment-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">\u201cIssues of statutory construction present questions of law, calling for an independent review by an appellate court. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Botello </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1130, 1134 [280 Cal.Rptr. 535].) The canons of statutory construction apply equally to the construction of ordinances and charters. <em>(Swift v. County of Placer </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 209, 213 [200 Cal.Rptr. 181] [ordinances]; <em>Currieri v. City of Roseville </em>(1970) 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Cal.App.3d 997, 1001 [84 Cal.Rptr. 615] [charters].) Words of a statute are to be given a plain and commonsense meaning. When they are clear and unambiguous, there is no need for judicial construction of the statute, <em>(Quarterman v. Kefauver </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1371 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 741]; <em>Hughes v. Board of Architectural Examiners </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 763, 775 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 624, 952 P.2d 641].)</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">We conclude the phrase \u201cthe result\u201d in section 24.0501 does not create a conflict between that ordinance and Charter section 141. Alesi\u2019s construction of the phrases <em>\u201cthe </em>result\u201d and <em>\u201ca </em>result\u201d in the context of section 24.0501 and Charter section 141 is derived from the interpretation of Government Code section 31720 in <em>Heaton v. Marin County Employees Retirement Bd. </em>(1976) 63 Cal.App.3d 421 [133 Cal.Rptr. 809] <em>(Heaton). </em>Government Code section 31720 sets forth the requirements for disability retirement of county employees. At the time <em>Heaton </em>was decided the statute provided: \u201c \u2018Any member permanently incapacitated for the performance of duty shall be retired for disability regardless of age if, and only if: ft[] (a) His incapacity is a result of injury or disease arising out of and in the course of his employment . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Heaton, supra, </em>63 Cal.App.3d at p. 426.) The main issue <em>in. Heaton </em>was whether an employee qualified for a disability retirement under Government Code section 31720 where employment was one of a variety of causes of the employee\u2019s disability or whether employment had to be the sole or at least substantial cause of the disability. <em>(Heaton, supra, </em>63 Cal.App.3d at pp. 425-426.) Interpreting the phrase \u201cas a result\u201d in Government Code section 31720, <em>Heaton </em>concluded that \u201c[h]ad the Legislature determined that the incapacity had to be completely service-connected the Legislature would have stated that [the employee\u2019s] incapacity must be <em>the </em>result of his employment [instead of <em>a </em>result].\u201d <em>(Heaton, supra, </em>63 Cal.App.3d at p. 428.) <em>Heaton\u2019s </em>interpretation of the phrase \u201ca result\u201d was followed without further analysis in <em>Gelman v. Board of Retirement </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 92, 96-97 [149 Cal.Rptr. 225] and noted in passing in <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Board of Retirement </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 572, 575-576 [229 Cal.Rptr. 814, 724 P.2d 500].</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\"><em>Heaton\u2019s </em>analysis confuses the distinct concepts of cause and effect. Because a \u201cresult\u201d clearly falls into the latter category, <em>Heaton\u2019s </em>view that significant information about <em>causation </em>is communicated by the article modifying the word \u201cresult\u201d is puzzling. When the phrases <em>\u201ca </em>result\u201d and <em>\u201cthe </em>result\u201d are interpreted in accordance with their plain and commonsense meaning, the only distinction between them is that the former suggests one of two or more <em>results </em>whereas the latter suggests a sole result. Even that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>distinction is not very meaningful, however, as either phrase can be used to refer to one of several results.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">In any event, whether something is referred to as <em>\u201ca </em>result\u201d of X or <em>\u201cthe </em>result\u201d of X, the reference communicates nothing about whether X was the sole <em>cause </em>or one of several causes of the result. Notwithstanding that linguistic fact, <em>Heaton </em>interpreted the articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d in the phrases \u201ca result\u201d and \u201cthe result\u201d as referring to the <em>cause </em>or <em>causes </em>of the injury rather than the noun they modify, namely, <em>\u201cresult.\u201d </em>I.e., <em>Heaton, </em>construed the phrase \u201cincapacity is <em>a </em>result of injury . . . arising out of . . . employment\u201d to mean the injury arising out of employment is a <em>cause </em>(i.e., one of more than one cause) of the incapacity, and construed the phrase \u201cincapacity is <em>the </em>result of injury arising out of employment\u201d (had the Legislature chosen to use it) to mean the injury arising out of employment was the sole cause of the disability. <em>(Heaton, supra, </em>63 Cal.App.3d at p. 428.)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\"><em>Heaton\u2019s </em>interpretation is not consistent with the plain meaning of the phrases \u201ca result\u201d and \u201cthe result\u201d as both phrases refer to <em>effect </em>rather than <em>cause. </em>Thus, in the context of Charter section 141 and section 24.0501, neither phrase is determinative of whether an employment-related injury must be the <em>sole </em>cause, a <em>substantial </em>cause, or merely <em>a </em>cause of an employee\u2019s disability to entitle the employee to a disability retirement. It follows that Alesi\u2019s perceived conflict between Charter section 141 and section 24.0501 does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Although the phrase \u201cas the result of injury\u201d in section 24.0501 provides no real guidance as to whether an employment-related injury must be the <em>sole </em>cause of an employee\u2019s disability to entitle the employee to a disability retirement, section 24.0501 expressly limits disability retirement to employees whose disabling injuries do not arise from a preexisting medical condition. That limitation is permissible because it is not expressly prohibited by the charter.  As this court noted in <em>Grimm v. City of San Diego </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 33, 38 [156 Cal.Rptr. 240]: \u201cA city council\u2019s decision regarding a pension system must be upheld unless expressly prohibited by the city charter. [Citation.] \u2018The charter operates not as a grant of power, but as an instrument of limitation and restriction on the exercise of power over all municipal affairs which the city is assumed to possess; and the enumeration of powers does not constitute an exclusion or limitation. [Citations.] . . . All rules of statutory construction as applied to charter provisions [citations] are subordinate to this controlling principle. ... A construction in favor of the exercise of the power and against the existence of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>limitation or restriction thereon which is not expressly stated in the charter is clearly indicated. . . . Thus in construing the city\u2019s charter a restriction on the exercise of municipal power may not be implied.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d  Because the Charter does not expressly restrict the City from requiring an applicant for disability retirement to show that an employment-related injury was the substantial cause of his or her disability<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the disability did not arise from a preexisting medical condition, the limitations on disability retirement imposed by section 24.0501 are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The court found that Alesi\u2019s disability arose from a preexisting medical condition and was merely aggravated by his employment-related injury. In its statement of decision the court noted: \u201cThe City is not obligated to pay disability pension for all injuries merely when they are triggered by a work-related accident. This is further bolstered by . . . subsection (b)(1) [of section 24.0501], which provides that the injury cannot \u2018arise\u2019 from a preexisting medical condition.\u201d In concluding the evidence supported the adjudicator\u2019s findings and decision that Alesi failed to show his injuries arose from his employment, the court cited medical evidence that Alesi\u2019s disability was primarily caused by the knee injury he suffered before his employment with the City. As noted, Alesi does not dispute the court\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Although the court did not expressly deem Alesi\u2019s original knee injury a \u201cpreexisting medical condition,\u201d it clearly falls within section 24.0501\u2019s definition of that term\u2014i.e., \u201cany condition which occurred or existed prior to membership in the Retirement System.\u201d Based on the finding that his disability arose from his original knee injury and was merely aggravated by his employment-related injuries, the court properly denied Alesi\u2019s petition for a writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The judgment is affirmed. Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"A5f\">Benke, Acting P. J., and McIntyre, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 21, 2000, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied February 14, 2001.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-10\"> Alesi also claimed a shoulder injury but withdrew that claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\">A11 further section references are to the San Diego Municipal Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b557-7\">For example, the statement \u201cBob missed the meeting as the result of a flat tire\u201d does not necessarily communicate that Bob\u2019s missing the meeting was the <em>only </em>result of his flat tire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b558-9\">The Board represents that as a matter of long-standing practice it has interpreted section 24.0501 as requiring an applicant for disability retirement to show that an employment-related injury was the <em>substantial cause </em>of his or her disability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
