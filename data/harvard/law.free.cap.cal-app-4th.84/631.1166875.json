J.</author>\n<p id=\"Apy\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hanson </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 355 [97 Cal.Rpfr.2d 58, 1 P.3d 650], our Supreme Court held that the double jeopardy provisions of the California Constitution prohibited a trial court from increasing a statutorily mandated restitution fine following retrial after appeal. The issue presented here is whether the same result applies to direct restitution to victims of crime. We conclude that court-ordered victim restitution imposed for the first time at a resentencing following appeal is not punishment and is therefore not constitutionally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Defendant Joshua Harvest was convicted of the first degree murder of Joel Vigil and the second degree murder of Michael Gialouris. The jury found true a multiple-murder special-circumstance allegation. There was no provision for victim restitution made at his sentencing because the court reserved the issue. On defendant\u2019s appeal, this court affirmed the first degree murder conviction; the second degree murder conviction and the special circumstance finding were reversed, and the prosecution was given the choice between a retrial or consenting to a reduction of the charge to voluntary manslaughter. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harvest </em>(June 5, 1998, A068802) [nonpub. opn.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">After the prosecution elected not to retry defendant for second degree murder, the trial court set a date for resentencing. In addition to the standard sentencing statement, the prosecution also submitted a memorandum of points and authorities \u201cin support of restitution\u201d to the Vigil and Gialouris families. Defendant made a number of written objections to ordering restitution at resentencing. He believed the prosecution\u2019s \u201crequest for restitution\u201d was untimely and exceeded the scope of the remand from this court. He urged that the prosecution was estopped to seek restitution at this time, not having done so at the first sentencing. Finally, he argued that any order for restitution would constitute double jeopardy under the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">At the sentencing hearing the trial court overruled defendant\u2019s jurisdictional objections and ordered defendant to make restitution as follows: (1) $7,641 to Vigil\u2019s parents for funeral and burial expenses; (2) $5,500 to Gialouris\u2019s mother for funeral and burial expenses; and (3) $23,160 to Vigil\u2019s former wife for child support. The court denied additional claims by Vigil\u2019s parents for property damage, legal expenses for a civil suit against defendant, and the loss of anticipated income Vigil might have provided. It sentenced defendant to 11 years for the manslaughter of Gialouris and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>consecutive term of 25 years to life for the murder of Vigil. Defendant thereafter filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">\u201cPersons may not twice be put in jeopardy\u201d (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15; see <em>id., </em>\u00a7 24). Defendant invoked this principle in the trial court and renews it here, arguing that it must prevail in light of <em>People </em>v. Hanson, <em>supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The doctrinal basis of <em>Hanson, </em>initially developed in the context of capital sentencing and subsequently extended, is that a defendant should not face increased punishment for having successfully appealed the initial conviction. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hanson, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 355, 358-360 and decisions cited.) As the Supreme Court framed the principle in an earlier decision, \u201ca defendant should not be required to risk being given greater punishment on a retrial for the privilege of exercising his right to appeal.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ali </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 277, 281 [57 Cal.Rptr. 348, 424 P.2d 932].)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The <em>Hanson </em>court then considered whether, as a matter of statutory construction, the Legislature intended restitution fines to constitute punishment. Its analysis, with copious references to the Penal Code, proceeded as follows: \u201cTo begin, restitution fines are imposed only upon conviction of a criminal offense. (See \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (a).) Although originally enacted as part of the Government Code, the operative statute is now contained in the Penal Code (\u00a7 1202.4 . . .), which expressly denominates \u2018fines\u2019 as \u2018punishments.\u2019 (\u00a7 15; see \u00a7\u00a7 17, subd. (b), 18, 19, 19.6, 19.8 . . . .) Section 1202.4, subdivision (a)(3), provides that restitution fines are distinct from restitution orders and are \u2018in addition to any other penalty . . . .\u2019 [Citation.] [H] Several other features of the statute compare with the imposition of criminal punishment generally. Except for \u2018compelling and extraordinary reasons,\u2019 which the trial court must state on the record (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (c)), a restitution fine is mandatory even in the absence of a crime victim (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (a)(3)(A)) and must be made a condition of probation, if granted (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (m)). As with other types of fines, the money is deposited into the state treasury; it is earmarked for the Restitution Fund, which enables the state to compensate victims of crimes. (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (e) . . . .) The amount varies in the trial court\u2019s discretion\u2014ranging from a minimum of $200 to a maximum of $10,000 (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b)(1))\u2014and may be calculated by multiplying $200 by the years of imprisonment imposed and then multiplying by the number of counts. (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>(b)(2).) In addition, the court \u2018shall consider any relevant factors including ... the seriousness and gravity of the offense and the circumstances of its commission, . . . and the number of victims involved in the crime.\u2019 (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (d).) \u2018A defendant\u2019s inability to pay shall not be considered a compelling and extraordinary reason not to impose a restitution fine.\u2019 (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (c).)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hanson, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 355, 361-362.) The court\u2019s conclusion was that \u201cthe Legislature intended restitution fines as a criminal penalty rather than as a civil remedy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 362.)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Using this analysis as a template, we conclude that victim restitution (what the <em>Hanson </em>court termed \u201crestitution orders\u201d) is qualitatively different from a restitution fine. It is true that both forms of restitution share an identical statutory basis. (Former Gov. Code, \u00a7 13967; Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4.) But whereas \u201crestitution fines are imposed only upon conviction of a criminal offense\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hanson, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 355, 361), victim restitution is a civil remedy which does not require a criminal forum. (E.g., Rest., Restitution (1937) \u00a7\u00a7 4-5; <em>Dinosaur Development, Inc. </em>v. <em>White </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1310, 1314-1315 [265 Cal.Rptr. 525].) The governing statutes specify that an order for victim restitution may originate from criminal court, but expressly recognize that such an order \u201cshall be enforceable as a civil judgment.\u201d (Former Gov. Code, \u00a7 13967, subd. (c); Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subds. (a)(3)(B) &amp; (i).) It therefore contemplates that subsequent enforcement efforts may occur outside the context of the criminal law. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (h).) Moreover, unlike a fine, victim restitution is not expressly and statutorily defined as punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">\u201c[A] restitution fine is mandatory even in the absence of a crime victim\u201d <em>(People v. Hanson, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 355, 362), but victim restitution obviously requires a victim. If there is no victim, or no survivors of a victim, there can be no restitution order. Unlike a restitution fine, victim restitution is therefore not an inevitable product of a criminal sentencing. All restitution fines go to the state <em>(ibid.), </em>but victim restitution orders shall be paid \u201cto the victim.\u201d (Former Gov. Code, \u00a7 13967, subd. (c); Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f).) The restitution fine is limited to a maximum of $10,000 (former Gov. Code, \u00a7 13967, subd. (a); Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b)(1)), but there is no limit for a victim restitution order. The statutory command is that \u201cfull restitution\u201d is to be ordered for a victim in \u201ca dollar amount that is sufficient to fully reimburse the victim, or victims, for all determined economic losses incurred as the result of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct.\u201d (Former Gov. Code, \u00a7 13967, subd. (c); Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subds. (f)(3) &amp; (g).) Victims have \u201ca right to restitution based on the <em>full amount </em>of their losses, without regard to full or partial recoupments from other sources except the Restitution Fund.\u201d <em>(People v. Birkett </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 226, 229 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>205, 980 P.2d 912]; see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f)(2).) Victim restitution has been ordered in excess of $1 million, more than 100 times the maximum restitution fine possible. <em>(People v. Draut </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 577 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 469].)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">In fixing the amount of a restitution fine a sentencing court may consider \u201cthe seriousness and gravity of the offense and the circumstances of its commission,\u201d as well \u201cpsychological harm caused by the crime.\u201d (Former Gov. Code, \u00a7 13967, subd. (a); Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (d).) A restitution order, however, is confined to \u201ceconomic loss\u201d suffered by a victim. (Former Gov. Code, \u00a7 13967, subd. (c); Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f).) Unlike a fine, the sentencing court is not provided with a statutory formula for computing victim restitution that allows for the length of the defendant\u2019s imprisonment or \u201cthe number of felony counts of which the defendant is convicted.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b)(2).) This language immediately suggests the calculus of actual sentencing choices. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170.1; Cal. Rules of Court, rules 414, 421, 425.)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The purposes of the criminal law are protecting society, deterring future criminality, and punishing criminality already committed. (E.g., Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170, subd. (a)(1); <em>People v. Roberts </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 271, 316 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 276, 826 P.2d 274]; <em>People v. Camodeca </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 142, 147 [338 P.2d 903]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Friend </em>(1957) 47 Cal.2d 749, 766-767, fn. 8 [306 P.2d 463].) Although restitution has an element of deterrence (see <em>People v. Hanson, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 355, 362), the primary purpose of victim restitution is to provide monetary compensation to an individual injured by crime. (See Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (b) [\u201call persons who suffer losses as a result of criminal activity shall have the right to restitution ... for losses they suffer\u201d]; former Gov. Code, \u00a7 13967, subd. (c); Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subds. (f)(3) &amp; (g); <em>People v. Broussard </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1067 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 278, 856 P.2d 1134].) Compensation is the defining feature of civil law. (E.g., Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3300, 3333 [measure of damages for breach of contract or tort is \u201cthe amount which will compensate the party aggrieved for all the detriment proximately caused thereby\u201d].) Postcriminal proceedings vindicating the remedial purpose of reimbursement have long been treated as not constituting punishment for double jeopardy purposes. (E.g., <em>Helvering v. Mitchell </em>(1938) 303 U.S. 391, 398-405 [58 S.Ct. 630, 632-633, 82 L.Ed. 917] [defendant acquitted of criminal tax evasion subsequently found liable in civil action for tax deficiency]; <em>U.S. ex rel. Marcus v. Hess </em>(1943) 317 U.S. 537, 548-552 [63 S.Ct. 379, 386-388, 87 L.Ed. 443] [defendants convicted of defrauding government subsequently found liable in qui tarn action for civil penalties, damages, and costs]; <em>Rex Trailer Co. v. U.S. </em>(1956) 350 U.S. 148, 151-154 [76 S.Ct. 219, 221-222, 100 L.Ed. 149] [defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>convicted of fraudulently obtaining five war surplus trucks subsequently found liable for civil penalty of $2,000 for each truck]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ursery </em>(1996) 518 U.S. 267 [116 S.Ct. 2135, 135 L.Ed.2d 549] [defendants convicted of drug-related offenses subsequently liable for in rem forfeiture].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The circumstances in which victim restitution is ordered are not coextensive with those in which a restitution fine is ordered. The recipients are not the same. The scope of a restitution fine is far different from a victim restitution order. A fine may take account of more diverse factors, but it cannot exceed $10,000. On the other hand victim restitution is limited to economic loss but is unlimited in the amount that can be ordered. The collection procedures for a restitution order are clearly meant to be civil. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (h); cf. <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>303 U.S. 391, 402 [58 S.Ct. 630, 634-635] [\u201cCivil procedure is incompatible with the accepted rules and constitutional guaranties governing the trial of criminal prosecutions, and where civil procedure is prescribed for the enforcement of remedial sanctions, those rules and guaranties do not apply\u201d].) Most importantly, the purposes and objectives of each are not the same. We conclude from the language of the governing statutes that the Legislature intended victim restitution as a civil remedy rather than as a criminal punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">However, as the <em>Hanson </em>court pointed out, this determination does not end the appropriate analysis: \u201cAn initial determination that the legislature did not intend to impose a criminal sanction does not end the inquiry, however, since a statutory scheme may be \u2018 \u201cso punitive either in purpose or effect\u201d [citation] as to \u201ctransfor[m] what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\u201d [citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Hanson, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 355, 361, quoting <em>Hudson v. United States </em>(1997) 522 U.S. 93, 99 [118 S.Ct. 488, 493, 139 L.Ed.2d 450, 162 A.L.R.Fed. 737].)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\"><em>\u201cIn </em>making this latter determination, the factors listed in <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Mendoza-Martinez, </em>372 U.S. 144, 168-169 [83 S.Ct. 554, 567-568, 9 L.Ed.2d 644] (1963), provide useful guideposts, including: (1) \u2018[w]hether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint\u2019; (2) \u2018whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment\u2019; (3) \u2018whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter'; (4) \u2018whether its operation will promote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>the traditional aims of punishment\u2014retribution and deterrence\u2019; (5) \u2018whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime\u2019; (6) \u2018whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it\u2019; and (7) \u2018whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned.\u2019 It is important to note, however, that \u2018these factors must be considered in relation to the statute on its face,\u2019 [citation], and \u2018only the clearest proof\u2019 will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\u201d <em>(Hudson </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>522 U.S. 93, 99-100 [118 S.Ct. 488, 493].)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">In light of the previous statutory examination, this second stage inquiry will not be extensive. The purpose of victim restitution is compensation, which does not involve an affirmative disability or restraint, and which has not historically been regarded as punishment. Victim restitution can, when developed in the context of a criminal sentencing, come into play only on a finding of scienter, but it does not necessarily require such\u2014there ' is no barrier to the victim obtaining essentially the same relief, a civil judgment for money, outside the criminal process. The restitution statutes make no mention of scienter, and are separate from provisions specifying punishment for substantive offenses. (See <em>United States v. Ward </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 242, 249-250 [100 S.Ct. 2636, 2641-2642, 65 L.Ed.2d 742]; <em>id. </em>at p. 256 [100 S.Ct. at p. 2645] (conc. opn. of Blackmun, J.).) Victim restitution does have an element of deterrence, but it is far less important than the goal and alternative purpose of providing compensation to a victim of crime. (See <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>522 U.S. 93, 105 [118 S.Ct. 488, 496].) Because restitution is limited to actual and demonstrated economic loss, it can hardly be condemned as excessive to the stated purpose of compensation. (See <em>Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch </em>(1994) 511 U.S. 767, 777 [114 S.Ct. 1937, 1944, 128 L.Ed.2d 767].) Moreover, when these factors are considered in conjunction with the plain statutory language, there is nothing like \u201cthe clearest proof\u2019 need to override the Legislature\u2019s patent intent that victim restitution is a civil remedy and not a criminal penalty. <em>(Hudson </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at p. 100 [118 S.Ct. at p. 493].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">We conclude that victim restitution does not constitute punishment for double jeopardy purposes. In light of this conclusion, there was no constitutional impediment to the restitution order made at defendant\u2019s resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Defendant makes a number of nonconstitutional objections to the restitution order. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The disposition ordered on the first appeal read as follows: \u201cDefendant\u2019s conviction of first degree murder for the killing of Joel Vigil is affirmed. Defendant\u2019s conviction of second degree murder for the killing of Michael Gialouris and the multiple murder special circumstance finding are reversed with directions as follows: If the People do not bring defendant to trial within 60 days after the filing of the remittitur in the superior court (or, if the defendant waives time, within the resulting time limit), or if the People elect, in a writing filed in the trial court, not to retry defendant, the trial court shall proceed as if the remittitur constituted a modification of the judgment to reflect a conviction of voluntary manslaughter ([Pen. Code,] \u00a7 192, subd. (a)) and shall resentence defendant accordingly.\u201d Defendant argues that the restitution order was \u201cunlawful\u201d because it was in excess of the trial court\u2019s limited jurisdiction pursuant to our remand. This is too narrow a view of the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">All that was left intact by our previous decision was the first degree murder conviction. Following our remand, there could have been a second trial for murder, this time limited to whether defendant had committed second degree murder with the death of Michael Gialouris. The multiple-murder special-circumstance finding might have been restored, although this possibility was not expressly mentioned in our disposition. Regardless of how these matters were handled, defendant\u2019s resentencing would obviously require a recomputation of his custody and conduct credits. This was not mentioned in our disposition, but we hardly think defendant will insist his logic makes that portion of the resentencing jurisdictionally defective. If pretty much all of the particulars of sentencing could be revisited by the trial court following our remand, there is no reason why the issue of restitution should be placed off limits, particularly in view of the fact that the trial court had expressly reserved jurisdiction on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">As previously mentioned, the trial court reserved the issue of victim restitution at the time it initially sentenced defendant. Just precisely what happened thereafter is somewhat unclear. It appears that Gialouris\u2019s relatives contacted authorities about a claim for $5,500. The prosecutor advised the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Vigil family about the procedures for presenting a restitution claim. The trial court scheduled a \u201cpre-trial conference\u201d on the matter. For reasons that are not explicit, no more was heard of the matter until defendant\u2019s resentencing pursuant to our remand. Defendant contends these circumstances establish that the request for restitution made at his resentencing was untimely and ought not to have been acted upon according to \u201clegal doctrines of waiver, estoppel, and laches.\u201d We see no merit in this contention for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">First, as the trial court noted, there is no express statute of limitation on the matter of victim restitution. Second, the fact that the issue was reserved at the initial hearing\u2014and never protested by defendant\u2014put him on notice that the matter was not closed. Third, although estoppel may be invoked against the government, it will not be upheld if it will defeat a strong public policy (e.g., <em>City of Long Beach v. Mansell </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 462, 493 [91 Cal.Rptr. 23, 476 P.2d 423]), and the constitutional mandate for victim restitution (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (b)) qualifies as such. Fourth, there appears to be no equitable ground for finding estoppel against the government, which will inure to the disadvantage of persons who are not associated with the government. Fifth, as to waiver, the point made by the prosecutor at resentencing that \u201cwe, the People, legally cannot waive restitution on behalf of the victims\u201d appears irrefutable. Sixth, there is some basis for believing that the Vigil family was never actually advised of their right to appear at the \u201cpre-trial conference\u201d following defendant\u2019s initial sentencing hearing. Seventh, \u201c[l]aches can be asserted only in a suit in equity\u201d (11 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1990) Equity, \u00a7 14, p. 691), which the resentencing clearly was not. Eighth, there is nothing in defendant\u2019s situation that suggests the disadvantageous change of position required for estoppel. <em>(City of Long Beach v. Mansell, supra, </em>at p. 488.)</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The totality of these factors convinces us that defendant\u2019s objections lack the force to overturn the restitution order on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Defendant does not contest the restitution ordered for the Vigil family\u2019s burial expenses, but he does argue that the other two components of the restitution order lack \u201can adequate factual basis for the amount of restitution ordered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">With respect to the restitution for child support, the relevant portions of the trial court\u2019s written ruling of July 23, 1999, read as follows: \u201cChiarlene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Rae Vigil, Joel Vigil\u2019s former wife, on behalf of their daughter, has filed a restitution claim for $62,798.40 for the loss of child support Joel Vigil had been ordered to provide. The Court takes judicial notice of domestic docket D92-01019 wherein a stipulated order dated December 5, 1991 recites that the decedent, Joel Vigil, is the father of Melissa Lorraine Vigil, bom July 23, 1986: the order further recites that defendant shall pay current child support at the rate of $386.00 per month beginning December 1, 1991. . . . Persons legally dependant [sic] for support upon a person who sustains death as a direct result of a crime, are victims for the purposes of \u00a7 13967(c) of the [Government [C]ode. [Citation.] The death of Mr. Vigil directly deprived the minor of this support. Since the judgment for restitution must be calculable as of the date of the order, the Court will fix the loss at $386.00 per month, accmeing [sic], for restitution purposes, with the commencement of July, 1994 to the month of July, 1999, or 60 months, to a total of $23,160.00. . . . Current restitution on this portion of the claim is, therefore, fixed at $23,160.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">A trial court is required to use \u201ca rational method\u201d in computing restitution. (P<em>eople v. Draut, </em>supra, 73 Cal.App.4th 577, 582; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thygesen </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 988, 992 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 886].) The trial court\u2019s method is restrained, based on previous judicial computations, and is eminently logical. Moreover, it was defendant who suggested that \u201cthe appropriate approach . . . is to take the judicial notice approach\u201d of the existing child support order. Any resulting error would qualify as invited. (E.g., <em>People v. Whitt </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 620, 639-640 [274 Cal.Rptr. 252, 798 P.2d 849]; 6 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1989) \u00a7 3287, p. 4063.) As for defendant\u2019s argument that the award was predicated on the speculative assumption that Joel Vigil\u2019s financial status would not change, all that need be said is that this speculation was necessitated by defendant\u2019s murder of Mr. Vigil. (See <em>People v. Abraham </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 1221, 1229 [230 Cal.Rptr. 325].)</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Defendant\u2019s claim concerning the $5,500 awarded to Michael Gialouris\u2019s mother for burial expenses must be sustained. The Vigil family could support their claim with documentation and stood ready to testify, but the Gialouris claim had neither of these supports. There was mention of the Gialouris claim in the probation officer\u2019s report, which may satisfy notice requirements for due process (e.g., <em>People v. Blankenship </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 992, 996-998 [262 Cal.Rptr. 141]), but it cannot take the place of evidence. (See <em>People v. Thygesen, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th 988, 995-996.)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">That portion of the restitution order allowing the claim of $5,500 is reversed. The judgment of conviction and the restitution order are affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Reardon, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Although we are concerned here solely with the California Constitution\u2019s double jeopardy provision, it is analyzed in the same manner as its federal counterpart, and United States Supreme Court decisions are viewed as persuasive authority on its scope and application. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Castellanos </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 785, 790 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 346, 982 P.2d 211]; <em>People v. Frazer </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 737, 754, fn. 15 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 312, 982 P.2d 180].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Another concern in double jeopardy inquiries is the presence or potential for vindictiveness against a criminal defendant who successfully appeals a conviction. (E.g., <em>People v. Hanson, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 355, 360; <em>People </em>v. <em>Craig </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1444, 1447 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 659].) Defendant has never claimed he was subjected to vindictive behavior and we have found no trace of it in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b598-6\">POCH\u00c9, J.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"Ar1\">I respectfully dissent. In my view the legislative genesis of restitution fines and victim restitution does not permit the conclusion reached by the majority, to wit; that the Legislature expressly or impliedly indicated a preference that victim restitution is a civil punishment. Nor can I subscribe to the view that the statutory scheme is not so punitive in purpose and effect that, whatever indication the punishment may have been intended as civil, it operates as a criminal penalty. <em>(People v. Hanson </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 355, 361 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 58, 1 P.3d 650].)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The appropriate analysis as set out by our Supreme Court is to look first to the Legislature\u2019s characterization of the punishment. <em>(People v. Hanson, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 361; <em>Hudson v. United States </em>(1997) 522 U.S. 93, 99-100 [118 S.Ct. 488, 493, 139 L.Ed.2d 450, 162 A.L.R. Fed. 737].) As the <em>Hanson </em>court noted, the provisions for both types of restitution are now encompassed in Penal Code section 1202.4, having been moved there in 1994 from the Government Code. (Stats. 1994, ch. 1106, \u00a7 3.) Although victim restitution was first imposed on this defendant only by an order of July 1999, the court applied the version of the statute, then Government' Code former section 13967<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which was in effect in the summer of 1993 when defendant committed his crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>The Legislature\u2019s intent underlying the restitution scheme, as made express in 1994, is that \u201c \u2018all persons who suffer losses as a result of criminal activity\u2019\u201d shall receive restitution for their losses. (Stats. 1994, ch. 1106, \u00a71.)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Restitution directly from a defendant is premised upon the defendant\u2019s conviction, and it is measured by the amount of the victim\u2019s loss, absent \u201ccompelling and extraordinary reasons\u201d to reduce it. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subds. (a)(1) &amp; (f); see Gov. Code, former \u00a7 13967, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Both the language of the statute and the legislative findings made in 1994 speak broadly of \u201crestitution,\u201d when describing both restitution fines and victim restitution. Accordingly the legislative findings describe restitution as having both \u201ca rehabilitative effect on criminals\u201d and as acting as \u201ca deterrent to future criminality.\u201d (Stats. 1994, ch. 1106, \u00a7 1.) Similarly the statute directs that the \u201ccourt, in addition to any other penalty provided or imposed under the law, shall order the defendant to pay both\u201d types of restitution. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (a)(3); see Gov. Code, former \u00a7 13967, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Victim restitution in 1993 could be imposed as an alternative to \u201call or a portion of the restitution fine.\u201d (Gov. Code, former \u00a7 13967, subd. (c).) Thus at the time defendant committed his crimes the statutory scheme both described and treated victim restitution and restitution fines as so closely related as to be interchangeable penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Set against these indicia of legislative intent to treat victim restitution as a criminal penalty analogous to a restitution fine, a victim restitution order has been characterized consistently as enforceable as if it were a civil judgment. (Gov. Code, former \u00a7 13967, subd. (c); Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">Therefore, the Legislature may not have intended victim restitution to be a criminal punishment. Because I find there to be some doubt I reach the second level of inquiry\u2014whether the statutory scheme is so punitive either in purpose or effect as to transform what was intended to be a civil remedy into a criminal penalty. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hanson, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 361; <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>522 U.S. 93, 99 [118 S.Ct. 488, 493].)</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>The punitive purpose of restitution was made express by the legislative findings cited above which characterize it as operating as a deterrent and as having a \u201crehabilitative effect.\u201d Moreover, victim restitution, like a restitution fine, is only imposed upon conviction of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Securing the right to restitution for persons who suffer loss as a result of criminal activity is also one of the legislative purposes for victim restitution. Thus providing compensation for victim loss is an alternative, and potentially nonpunitive purpose of restitution. However, as the majority notes, this measure of loss results in an order for an extremely large sum in victim restitution; the majority points to one case in which it amounted to $1 million or \u201cmore than 100 times the maximum\u201d possible restitution fine. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 648.) By establishing a measure based solely on what has become an ever-expanded definition of victim loss (see Stats. 1996, ch. 629, \u00a7 3, adding subd. (f)(3)(F) &amp; (G)), however, the statute permits on its face restitution which may well exceed in scope and scale damages which would otherwise be available to the victim were he or she to seek redress in a separate civil suit against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">While the majority opinion asserts that only economic loss forms the basis for victim restitution, the statute on its face does not so provide. For example, victim restitution for noneconomic loss, such as psychological harm, has long been available from a defendant convicted of lewd acts committed against a child. (Gov. Code, former \u00a7 13967, subd. (c); Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f)(3)(F).)</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">In sum, viewing the provisions of Penal Code section 1202.4 against the factors enumerated in <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Mendoza-Martinez </em>(1963) 372 U.S. 144, 168-169 [83 S.Ct. 554, 567-568, 9 L.Ed.2d 644], as relevant to the inquiry, I conclude that victim restitution under Penal Code section 1202.4 is both so punitive in purpose and effect as to render it a criminal punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">In light of that finding I must further conclude that the increase in the victim restitution here, from zero to an amount totaling some $36,000 offends the double jeopardy provisions of our state Constitution under the rule announced in <em>People </em>v. <em>Henderson </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 482, 495-497 [35 Cal.Rptr. 77, 386 P.2d 677]. Here defendant having successfully appealed from his conviction for second degree murder, and the People having elected not to retry that charge, finds himself subject to a restitution award to the families of both victims, when at his initial sentencing no award was made to either family. It can scarcely be denied that permitting a restitution award of over $36,000 at resentencing when no restitution award was made initially is not a significant disincentive, indeed penalty, for having taken a successful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>appeal. The focus of double jeopardy protection under our state Constitution is whether increased punishment on resentencing \u201coperates to penalize the defendant\u201d for having exercised his right to appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hanson, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 365.)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">As our Supreme Court in <em>Hanson </em>concluded, the chilling effect upon a defendant\u2019s right of appeal which arises from the possibility of greater punishment at resentencing implicates both the state constitutional protections against double jeopardy protections and state constitutional due process guarantees. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hanson, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 366.)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Insofar as I find the imposition of victim restitution to be punitive, I can only question whether California\u2019s procedure of permitting a punitive sanction, whose upper limit is not defined by statute but by the extent of the victim\u2019s loss ascertained in a proceeding which is conducted with the barest of evidentiary and procedural formalities, can be squared with the due process provisions of our federal Constitution. (See <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466 [120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435] [statute permitting finding of racial bias as justification for sentence enhancement was infirm where the finding was not made by a jury under reasonable doubt standard].)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Regardless of the facial constitutionality of the victim restitution scheme, the manner in which it was applied to this defendant raises significant due process concerns. At defendant\u2019s original sentencing in December 1994 no victim restitution was ordered. As of mid-February 1995 the mother of Michael Gialouris had requested restitution in the amount of $5,500 and a pretrial conference was scheduled for March 9, 1995. On March 28, 1995, the district attorney sent a letter to the attorney of the Vigil family notifying them of a proposed restitution hearing and informing them that were it to be held defendant would be brought from prison to local custody which would permit defendant visitation with his family. At the 1999 sentencing the Vigil family denied ever learning about a restitution hearing from their attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Based upon this inconclusive explanation about why no restitution hearing had been had in the months immediately following defendant\u2019s first sentencing, the trial court concluded that there was no express statute of limitations as to victim restitution and, noting its statutory obligation to impose restitution, ordered victim restitution for the first time at the 1999 sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">Several points are clear from the record: first, on this record the People did not affirmatively waive victim restitution in 1994; second, in 1995 the Vigil family may either have elected not to pursue victim restitution in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>of its civil suit against defendant and the other young men involved in the death of Joel Vigil, or because the family wished to deny defendant an opportunity to be brought back from state prison, or the family may not have been informed of its right to obtain restitution through failures attributable to it\u2019s attorney. Still, the question is not, to my mind, whether either the Vigil family or the People should or should not be bound by principles of waiver, estoppel, or laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The issue before us is whether on these facts defendant was denied procedural due process. The dollar effect of waiting until 1999 to impose a victim restitution order of $36,000 was considerable. The trial court calculated the loss of child support from July 1994 to the month of its order, July 1999, or a period of 60 months at $386 per month yielding a total of $23,160. Had defendant been promptly given a restitution hearing\u2014say in March or April of 1995\u2014the amount of restitution for child support would literally have been in the range of $3,000 rather than $23,000. Accordingly, I would reverse that portion of the restitution ordered for child support attributable to the months of May 1995 through July 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The majority opinion suggests that any error in the child support award was invited in light of defense counsel\u2019s suggesting that the court should take judicial notice of the support order. I note that when defense counsel made that suggestion no document was before the court, other than a pay stub presented by the Vigil family, from which the amount of the victim\u2019s court ordered child support could be verified. Accordingly, I think it misreads the scope of the defense suggestion to assume that counsel was doing anything more than urging judicial notice of the amount of Vigil\u2019s child support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In sum, I find the victim restitution statute as applied to this defendant to violate principles of double jeopardy and due process. However, even if I were to accept the imposition of some $36,000 in victim restitution upon this defendant for the first time at resentencing, I reject as inherently unfair the notion that the victim\u2019s loss can be inflated by some $20,000 because the People waited for five years in which to bring the matter to hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied February 28, 2001. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Retired Associate Justice of the Court of Appeal, First Appellate District, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-9\">Government Code former section 13967, subdivision (c) provided in pertinent part: \u201cIn cases in which a victim has suffered economic loss as a result of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct, and the defendant is denied probation, in lieu of imposing all or a portion of the restitution fine, the court shall order restitution to be paid to the victim.
