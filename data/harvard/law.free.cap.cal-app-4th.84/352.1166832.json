J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW4\">The trial court denied appellant Juan Miguel Cisneros admission to the deferred entry of judgment program in which first time drug offenders are diverted to a rehabilitation program with judgment deferred and criminal charges dismissed upon successful completion of the program. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1000 et seq. [all further statutory references are to this code except as noted].) The probation department recommended appellant\u2019s admission to the program but the trial court denied admission because appellant is an illegal alien. The trial court concluded that appellant\u2019s illegal entry and unregistered residency in the United States was \u201ccrimin\u00e1l conduct\u201d that automatically rendered him \u201cunsuitable for deferred entry of judgment.\u201d (\u00a7 1000.3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">We conclude that the trial court erred in ruling that illegal aliens are categorically excluded from participation in the deferred judgment program for first time drug offenders. Trial courts are free to consider illegal alien status as a factor in determining whether a defendant is a good candidate for the deferred judgment program, but illegal alien status is not an automatic disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">On December 8, 1997, a bar\u2019s security guard saw appellant with a baggie of suspected cocaine and telephoned the police. Appellant was arrested and charged with possession of cocaine and possession of a fake identification card. (Pen. Code, 529.5, subd. (c); Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350, subd. (a).) The court referred appellant to the probation department for determination of eligibility for the deferred entry of judgment program. (Pen Code, \u00a7 1000.1, subd. (b).) The probation department recommended appellant\u2019s admission to the deferred judgment program for a period of 18 months, conditioned upon appellant\u2019s completion of drug treatment and payment of administrative and restitution fees. In listing certain social factors, the probation officer noted that appellant said he is an undocumented immigrant who has not established legal, permanent residency.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">A hearing .on whether to admit appellant to the deferred entry of judgment program was set for June 24, 1998. At that time, defense counsel noted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>probation department\u2019s positive recommendation and appellant offered to plead guilty in order to enter the program. The prosecutor said: \u201cNo objection.\u201d However, the court expressed concern with appellant\u2019s illegal alien status. The court said: \u201cI don\u2019t see how a defendant can obey the diversion requirements when he\u2019s violating a federal law each day.\u201d The court said it saw a distinction between diversion and probation that likewise requires obedience to all laws, but the court did not explain the distinction. Appellant\u2019s counsel requested a continuance to permit further research and the court set a hearing for August 12, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In advance of the August hearing, the prosecutor filed a brief objecting to appellant\u2019s participation in the deferred judgment program. The prosecutor observed that entry into the United States without inspection is a misdemeanor, as is continued residency without registration. (8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1302(a), 1306(a), 1325(a).) The prosecutor argued that appellant is committing a misdemeanor daily by failing to register.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">A different trial judge presided over the continued hearing. The court reiterated the concern that an illegal alien cannot satisfy the deferred judgment program\u2019s condition that participants obey all laws. The court did observe, however, that the diversion program has for years accepted defendants who are illegal aliens. The court was also concerned that a broad application of the obey-all-laws condition would make every illegal alien ineligible for both diversion and probation, mandating imprisonment for first time drug offenders. The court took the matter under submission and set a date to announce its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The court announced its ruling on November 5, 1998. The court denied appellant admission to the deferred entry of judgment program, stating: \u201c[I]t is inappropriate for Mr. Cisneros to be on diversion in that one of the criminal rights of diversion is that a divertee obey all laws, and by definition, if Mr. Cisneros is not in the United States of America legally, he is not obeying all laws . . . .\u201d The court noted that an alien\u2019s failure to register is a misdemeanor. Appellant\u2019s violation of law as an illegal, unregistered alien \u201cprecludes the defendant from being placed on diversion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Appellant later pled guilty to possessing cocaine pursuant to a negotiated plea. The court suspended imposition of sentence and placed appellant on probation conditioned upon serving 60 days in jail and obeying all laws. The court stayed the jail term pending resolution of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Statutory Overview</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The Legislature has provided that certain first time drug offenders meeting specified conditions may \u201cbypass the normal criminal process and enter a drug treatment program.\u201d <em>(Terry v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 661, 663-664 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 653]; \u00a7 1000 et seq.) The original state program of pretrial drug diversion has been replaced with the current program in which the defendant pleads guilty but judgment is deferred. <em>(Terry, supra, </em>at p. 664.) A defendant is eligible for deferral of judgment if, among other things, he or she has no prior drug convictions and no recent felony convictions. (\u00a7 1000, subd. (a)(1), (6).)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">With the defendant\u2019s consent, the trial court may refer a defendant to the probation department for a determination as to whether the defendant would be benefited by drug education, treatment, or rehabilitation. (\u00a7 1000.1, subd. (b).) The probation department reports its findings and recommendations to the court, which makes the final determination as to whether to defer entry of judgment. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The court may defer judgment for a period from 18 months to 3 years, during which time the court receives progress reports. (\u00a7 1000.2.) The prosecutor, probation department or court may move for entry of judgment if the defendant \u201cis performing unsatisfactorily in the assigned program . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1000.3.) Unsatisfactory performance includes conviction of a \u201cmisdemeanor that reflects the defendant\u2019s propensity for violence,\u201d conviction of any felony, or \u201ccriminal conduct\u201d rendering the defendant \u201cunsuitable for deferred entry of judgment.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>If the defendant does perform satisfactorily throughout the duration of the rehabilitation program, then the criminal charge is dismissed and disclosure of the defendant\u2019s arrest record is strictly limited. (\u00a7\u00a7 1000.3, 1000.4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\u201cThe plain objective of section 1000 is to permit \u2018the courts to identify the experimental or tentative user before he becomes deeply involved in drugs, to show him the error of his ways by prompt exposure to educational and counseling programs in his own community, and to restore him to productive citizenship without the lasting stigma of a criminal conviction\u2019 and thereby reduce \u2018the clogging of the criminal justice system.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Terry v. Superior Court, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th at p. 664, quoting <em>People v. Superior Court (On Tai Ho) </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 59, 61-62 [113 Cal.Rptr. 21, 520 P.2d 405].)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The trial court erred in ruling that illegal aliens are categorically excluded from participation in the deferred judgment program for first time drug offenders. Trial courts are free to consider illegal alien status as a factor in determining whether a defendant is a good candidate for the deferred judgment program, but illegal alien status is not an automatic disqualification. The court did not weigh appellant\u2019s illegal alien status as one of many factors, as the People argue. The court stated: \u201c[I]t is inappropriate for Mr. Cisneros to be on diversion in that one of the criminal rights of diversion is that a divertee obey all laws, and <em>by definition, </em>if Mr. Cisneros is not in the United States of America legally, he is not obeying all laws . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) The court found that appellant\u2019s violation of law as an illegal, unregistered alien \u201cprecludes the defendant from being placed on diversion.\u201d The court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The deferred entry of judgment program is \u201ca creature of statute.\u201d <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th at p. 665.) A court may not impose conditions beyond those specified in the statute, absent a compelling necessity. (I<em>bid.) </em>As remedial legislation, the deferral program must also be liberally construed to promote its objectives of rehabilitating novice drug users and of reducing congestion in the criminal justice system. <em>(Parra </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 690, 694 [148 Cal.Rptr. 203].)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The statutory eligibility standards do not preclude an illegal alien\u2019s participation in the deferral program. Certain past or current criminality disqualifies a defendant from admission to the program, but a misdemeanor violation of immigration laws is not one of the listed disqualifiers. (\u00a7 1000, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The standards for successful completion of the program have broader proscriptions against criminality. A defendant may be terminated from the program, and judgment of conviction entered, if the defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>convicted of either a violent misdemeanor or a felony, or if the defendant engages in \u201ccriminal conduct rendering him or her unsuitable for deferred entry of judgment . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1000.3.) The trial court\u2019s reference to an obey-all-laws condition appears to be an inexact invocation of this provision, with terminology drawn from probation cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Section 1000.3\u2019s provision against criminal conduct does not operate as a categorical exclusion of illegal aliens from the deferred entry of judgment program. A diversion (or deferral) program may be viewed as \u201ca specialized form of probation, available to a different class of defendants but sharing many similarities with general probation and commitment for addiction.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (On Tai Ho), supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 66.) Illegal alien status is a legitimate factor for consideration but does not categorically preclude a grant of probation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sanchez </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 224, 231 [235 Cal.Rptr. 264].) An illegal alien may be a poor candidate for probation given typically limited ties to the community and the prospect of deportation. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The same considerations may weigh against admitting an illegal alien to the deferred entry of judgment program. However, a defendant\u2019s misdemeanor violations of the immigration laws in entering the United States without inspection and failing to register do not necessarily constitute \u201ccriminal conduct rendering him or her unsuitable for deferred entry of judgment . . .\u201d in every instance. (\u00a7 1000.3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Interpreting section 1000.3 as a categorical exclusion of illegal aliens from the deferred entry of judgment program would create an inconsistency within the law. Lawfulness is required for both deferral and probation and yet illegal aliens would be excluded from only the deferral program. We are unable to discern the legal basis for the trial court\u2019s belief that an illegal alien is sufficiently obeying all laws for a grant of probation and yet is engaging in criminal conduct rendering him unsuitable for deferred entry of judgment. The People offer only the vague suggestion that probation and deferral \u201cmight\u201d incorporate \u201cdifferent expectations of law compliance.\u201d We reject the suggestion that there is a lower expectation of lawfulness for probationers, who are required to obey all laws. <em>(People v. Cortez </em>(1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 839, 844 [19 Cal.Rptr. 50].)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The trial court misinterpreted section 1000.3 as a categorical exclusion of illegal aliens from the deferred entry of judgment program. Given our interpretation of section 1000.3, we need not reach appellant\u2019s argument that a per se exclusion of illegal aliens from the program violates his constitutional right to equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to permit the trial court to exercise its discretion in determining if deferral is appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Sepulveda, J., and Poch\u00e9, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Section 1000, subdivision (a) provides, in relevant part, that a defendant may be considered for admission to the deferral program where \u201c(1) The defendant has no conviction for any offense involving controlled substances prior to the alleged commission of the charged offense.
