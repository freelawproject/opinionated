By the time of trial, the only parties were the patient (the plaintiff) and the emergency room doctor (the defendant). The patient claims (and the trial court agreed) that evidence of the personal physician\u2019s subsequent negligence is inadmissible. We hold that Proposition 51 and the rules of comparative indemnity compel a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">Stuart Chamo\u2019s lacerated thumb was sutured by Brigeli Westerband, M.D., an employee of Marina Emergency Medical Group, which provided emergency medical services at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital. Two days later, Chamo consulted his personal physician, Norman Solomon, M.D. About a month later, Dr. Solomon referred Chamo to Michael McGuire, M.D., a board certified hand surgeon. Dr. McGuire operated on Chamo\u2019s thumb, and in the process discovered two severed nerves and a partially severed tendon.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">Chamo sued Dr. Westerband, Marina Emergency, Dr. Solomon, and Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital for medical malpractice. Dr. Westerband answered, and discovery ensued. At his deposition, Dr. McGuire testified that based on the lapse of time between the injury and the surgery, Chamo\u2019s range of motion was permanently limited. At some point, Dr. Solomon and Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital were voluntarily dismissed from Chamo\u2019s action, leaving Dr. Westerband and Marina Emergency (which is included in our subsequent references to Dr. Westerband) as the only defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">Before trial, Chamo moved to exclude all evidence about Dr. Solomon\u2019s subsequent negligence, contending that Dr. Westerband\u2019s only remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>would be a separate action for indemnity against Dr. Solomon. The trial court agreed with Chamo, rejected Dr. Westerband\u2019s opposition, and granted the motion. Dr. Westerband then filed a petition for a writ of mandate in which she asked us to intervene. We stayed trial, issued an order to show cause, and set the matter for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">This is Chamo\u2019s syllogism; Since Dr. Westerband\u2019s negligence was the cause of the original injury, Dr. Westerband is liable to Chamo for any aggravation caused by Dr. Solomon\u2019s subsequent medical treatment. Since Dr. Westerband is the one who is liable to Chamo, she is not entitled to tell the jury about Dr. Solomon\u2019s negligence; her only remedy is a subsequent action for indemnity against Dr. Solomon. This is a false syllogism.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">In <em>American Motorcycle Assn. v. Superior Court </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 578, 582 [146 Cal.Rptr. 182, 578 P.2d 899], our Supreme Court held that its then recent adoption of comparative negligence \u201cto ameliorate the inequitable consequences of the contributory negligence rule d[id] not warrant the abolition or contraction of the established \u2018joint and several liability\u2019 doctrine; each tortfeasor whose negligence is a proximate cause of an indivisible injury remains individually liable for all compensable damages attributable to that injury.\u201d So that liability for an indivisible injury would be borne by each tortfeasor in direct proportion to his respective fault, the Supreme Court modified the rules of equitable indemnity to permit a joint tortfeasor to obtain partial indemnity from other tortfeasors on a comparative fault basis\u2014by way of a cross-complaint in the plaintiff\u2019s action or in a subsequent (and separate) indemnity action. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 591-598, 604-607.)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">By the time <em>American Motorcycle Assn. </em>was decided, it had long been settled that a tortfeasor who caused personal injuries was liable to the injured party not only for the original injury but also for any aggravation caused by a physician or surgeon whose services were secured by the injured party with reasonable care. <em>(Dewhirst v. Leopold </em>(1924) 194 Cal. 424, 432-433 [229 P. 30]; see also <em>Maxwell v. Powers </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1607-1609 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 62] [the rule is the same when the original tort is medical malpractice].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>American Motorcycle Assn. </em>did not change these rales. <em>(Blecker </em>v. <em>Wolbart </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 1195, 1201, 1203 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>[213 Cal.Rptr. 781] [under <em>American Motorcycle Assn., </em>\u201cit matters not whether the tortfeasors acted in concert to create a single injury, or successively, in creating distinct and divisible injury\u201d].) But in 1986, Proposition 51 (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1431 et seq.) <em>did </em>modify the doctrine of joint and several liability by limiting an individual tortfeasor\u2019s liability for noneconomic damages, so that noneconomic damages are now allocated to each defendant in direct proportion to that defendant\u2019s percentage of fault. (See <em>Evangelatos v. Superior Court </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1188, 1192 [246 Cal.Rptr. 629, 753 P.2d 585].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Chamo contends Dr. Westerband\u2019s \u201csole remedy is a subsequent indemnity action,\u201d and that the jury in this tort action can neither hear evidence about Dr. Solomon\u2019s aggravating negligence nor be asked to allocate fault between Dr. Westerband and Dr. Solomon. This is so, according to Chamo, because Dr. Westerband is liable to Chamo for Dr. Solomon\u2019s subsequent medical negligence\u2014and in spite of the fact that this is \u201cstrictly a non-economic damage case\u201d in which Chamo does not intend to present any evidence of any economic loss. Chamo is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The case relied on by Chamo and the trial <em>court\u2014Maxwell v. Powers, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th 1596\u2014does not support Chamo\u2019s position. It holds only that the original tortfeasor is liable for the subsequent tortfeasor\u2019s aggravating medical negligence, and that the jury is to be instmcted accordingly, no more and no less. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1606.) It does <em>not </em>hold that evidence of the subsequent tortfeasor\u2019s negligence is inadmissible, or that the jury cannot be asked to allocate fault between the original and subsequent tortfeasors. It does not consider Proposition 51 or the effect of section 1431.2, subdivision (a), on this issue. It does not address any of these points. <em>(Canales </em>v. <em>City of Alviso </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 118, 128, fn. 2 [89 Cal.Rptr. 601, 474 P.2d 417] [a case is not authority for a proposition that has not been considered].)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Chamo\u2019s novel approach to this case ignores Dr. Westerband\u2019s options. She could have but was not obligated to pursue a cross-complaint for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>equitable indemnity in Chamo\u2019s tort action. <em>(American Motorcycle Assn. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at pp. 604-607; <em>Evangelatos v. Superior Court, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 1197-1198.) She was equally entitled to do what she tried to do\u2014to have the jury in this action allocate fault between the two doctors so that the liability for noneconomic damages to be borne by each will be in direct proportion to his or her fault. (\u00a7 1431.2, subd. (a).) But if Chamo\u2019s damages are in fact all noneconomic, Dr. Westerband <em>cannot </em>later seek indemnity from Dr. Solomon\u2014because Dr. Westerband\u2019s liability to Chamo for noneconomic damages must necessarily be based on her own negligence. <em>(Union Pacific Corp. </em>v. <em>Wengert </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1444, 1448 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 68]; see also <em>Aetna Health Plans of Cal., Inc. v. Yucaipa-Calimesa Joint Unified School Dist. </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 1175 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 672] [as to noneconomic damages, \u201cthe plaintiff must sue all tortfeasors to enable a full recovery\u201d and a failure \u201cto name a defendant will preclude recovery of that defendant\u2019s proportional share\u201d of noneconomic damages].)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Chamo contends there are exceptions to the mies adopted by Proposition 51. He is right. He says there ought to be one here. He is wrong.  In cases where a person\u2019s liability is derivative (such as the respondeat superior liability of an employer for an employee\u2019s acts) or based solely on statute (such as an automobile owner\u2019s liability for the driver\u2019s negligence), Proposition 51 does not apply (other than as it might require an allocation of liability between the employee and third persons or the driver and third persons). <em>(Miller v. Stouffer </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 70, 81-85 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 454]; <em>Rashtian </em>v. <em>BRAC-BH, Inc. </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1847, 1851 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 411]; see also <em>Srithong v. Total Investment Co. </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 721, 727 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 672] [Proposition 51 does not apply when a defendant\u2019s liability is not based on any wrongdoing].)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">But Dr. Westerband\u2019s liability for Dr. Solomon\u2019s subsequent negligence is not derivative. It is not a creature of statute. It is based on Dr. Westerband\u2019s own negligence, and it exists because \u201cthe law regards the act of the original wrongdoer as a proximate cause of the damages flowing from the subsequent negligent medical treatment and holds [the original tortfeasor] liable therefor.\u201d <em>(Ash v. Mortensen, supra, </em>24 Cal.2d at p. 657.) The rationale for the rule is that the subsequent medical treatment \u201cis closely and reasonably associated with the immediate consequences of the [original . tortfeasor\u2019s] act and forms a normal part of its aftermath.\u201d <em>(Munoz </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 420, 427 [190 Cal.Rptr. 400]; see also <em>Blecker v. Wolbart, supra, </em>167 Cal.App.3d 1195, 1201.) Indeed, even where public policy precludes an indemnity claim against a subsequent tortfeasor\u2014for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>example, a lawyer sued for malpractice by a former client may not cross-complain for indemnity against a successor lawyer hired to extricate the client from the condition created by the predecessor lawyer\u2014the original tortfeasor may, by affirmative defense in the plaintiff\u2019s case, reduce his liability for noneconomic damages to the extent of the subsequent tortfeasor\u2019s fault. <em>(Shaffery v. Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman &amp; Dicker </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 768, 773 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 419].) It follows that Dr. Westerband is entitled to have Chamo\u2019s damages apportioned among the universe of tortfeasors, \u201cincluding nonjoined defendants.\u201d <em>(Roslan v. Permea, Inc. </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 110, 113 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 66].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Dr. Westerband must be given the opportunity to prove Dr. Solomon\u2019s comparative fault, and to have the jury allocate fault between the two doctors. If the jury finds Dr. Westerband liable to Chamo, she will be jointly and severally liable for all of Chamo\u2019s economic damages (if there are any), but only severally liable for her allocated share of his noneconomic damages. There simply isn\u2019t any authority to the contrary, and certainly none that would support Charno\u2019s effort to create a medical malpractice exception to Proposition 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">The petition is granted, and a writ will issue to command the trial court to vacate the order under review. Dr. Westerband is awarded her costs of these writ proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Ortega, Acting P. J., and Mallano, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 14, 2000, and the petition of real party in interest for review by the Supreme Court was denied February 21, 2001. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b412-10\">BAJI No. 14.66 puts the rule this way: \u201cIf you find that the defendant is liable for the original injury ... to the plaintiff, [the] defendant is also liable . . . [f]or any aggravation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>the original injury or additional injury caused by negligent medical or hospital treatment or care of the original injury.\u201d <em>Ash v. Mortensen </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 654, 657 [150 P.2d 876] explains the corollary to this rule: \u201cBut the fact that plaintiff could have obtained full compensation for all damages in [an] action against... the original wrongdoer[] does not establish that she has been so compensated [and the plaintiff is] at liberty to sue [the original wrongdoer] for damages resulting from the original injury alone, and to sue [the subsequent wrongdoer] for damages resulting from the additional injury or aggravation . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b413-10\">A11 section references are to the Civil Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b415-11\">Charno\u2019s reliance on <em>Kitzig </em>v. <em>Nordquist </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 1384 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 762] is misplaced. <em>Kitzig, </em>an action in which the only defendant was <em>the </em>subsequent (and not the original) tortfeasor, holds only that a subsequent tortfeasor cannot use Proposition 51 to reduce his own liability for the severable damages <em>he </em>has caused. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1398.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
