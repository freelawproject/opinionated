J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq9\">An employer admits to unreasonable delay in paying temporary disability benefits awarded to an injured employee. Here we decide how many penalties to assess under Labor Code sections 4650<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 5814<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> against the employer. We conclude, among other things, that the failure of an employer to self-assess a section 4650 penalty is subject to a section 5814 penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">The workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) awarded three separate penalties under section 5814. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) granted the employer\u2019s petition for reconsideration. It reduced the penalties to two, assessing one penalty under section 5814 and one under section 4650, subdivision (d) (hereafter section 4650(d)), finding the delay was the result of a single course of misconduct. Both the WCJ and the WCAB partially erred in assessing the penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>We annul the order of the WCAB with directions to impose penalties consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Petitioner Jill Moulton suffered an admitted industrial injury to her hands and wrists while working for real party in interest County of San Diego (the County) and was awarded temporary total disability benefits of $8,243 on May 12, 1999, for the period July 1998 to May 12, 1999. Under section 4650(d), the County was required to pay the entire amount of the award on or before May 26, 1999. The County failed to do so; it made no payment until Moulton filed and served a petition for penalty on July 13, 1999. On July 15, 1999, the County issued Moulton a payment of $3,886. The County provided no explanation for the delay in payment or the incorrect amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">At the August 19, 1999, hearing on the petition, the County offered no excuse or explanation for the delay, the partial payment, or its failure to self-assess the section 4650(d) penalty. Instead, the County admitted the payment was late and in the wrong amount, but argued that only one penalty under section 5814 should be assessed because it engaged in a single course of misconduct. The WCJ issued findings and award on September 2, 1999, assessing three separate 10 percent penalties against all past, present and future temporary disability as follows: (1) a penalty under section 5814 for unreasonable delay in paying the May 12, 1999 temporary disability award; (2) a second penalty under section 5814 for unreasonable failure to pay the correct amount of temporary disability; and (3) a third penalty under section 5814 for unreasonable failure to include the section 4650(d) penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The WCAB granted the County\u2019s petition for reconsideration and issued an opinion and decision after reconsideration assessing two penalties, one penalty under section 5814 for unreasonable delay in paying the award and a second penalty under section 4650(d). The WCAB rescinded the additional penalties assessed by the WCJ under section 5814 for failure to pay the correct amount of temporary disability and failure to self-assess the section 4650(d) penalty because \u201c[djefendant\u2019s failure to include a self-imposed penalty under . . . section 4650(d), its failure to pay the correct amount of temporary disability awarded on May 12, 1999, and its unreasonable delay in payment of temporary disability indemnity pursuant to the May 12, 1999 Findings and Award constitute a single continuous act of misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">\u201cThe penalty for unreasonable delay in the payment of compensation is designed to help an employee obtain promptly the cure or relief he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>entitled to under the law, and to compel his employer to provide this cure or relief in timely fashion.\u201d <em>(Davison </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 15, 18 [50 Cal.Rptr. 76].) Whether the length of the delay is unreasonable in the first instance is a question for the trier of fact to decide in light of all the circumstances. (\u00a7 5814; <em>Kampner </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 376 [150 Cal.Rptr. 222].)</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">\u201cIn considering a petition for writ of review of a decision of the WCAB, this court\u2019s authority is limited.\u201d <em>(Western Growers Ins. Co. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 227, 233 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 26].) \u201cIn reviewing the evidence our legislative mandate and sole obligation under section 5952 is to review the entire record to determine whether the board\u2019s conclusion was supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>(LeVesque v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 627, 637 [83 Cal.Rptr. 208, 463 P.2d 432].) <em>\u201cLeVesque </em>does not, however, limit appellate review of errors of law in workmen\u2019s compensation cases.\u201d <em>(Dimmig v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 860, 864 [101 Cal.Rptr. 105, 495 P.2d 433].)</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The material facts here are undisputed; the County unreasonably delayed paying the temporary disability award. Applying a statute to undisputed facts raises a question of law for the court to decide. <em>(Mote v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 902, 909 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 806].) Therefore, a purported finding of fact on a question of law is not binding on this court. <em>(Dimmig </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 864.)</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">\n<em>Section 5814</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">An unreasonable delay in providing workers\u2019 compensation benefits subjects an employer to a mandatory 10 percent penalty under section 5814. <em>(Gallamore v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 815, 822-823 [153 Cal.Rptr. 590, 591 P.2d 1242]; see also <em>Mote v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th at p. 911 [\u201cWhere the employer does not pay a type of benefit or unreasonably delays payment due, the WCAB cannot refuse to impose the section 5814 penalty\u201d].) The penalty has been applied to virtually all types of benefits provided by the workers\u2019 compensation laws, including temporary and permanent disability indemnity. <em>(Adams v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 226, 229 [133 Cal.Rptr. 517, 555 P.2d 303].)</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">Multiple penalties are properly assessed under section 5814 for delays in payment of the same kind of benefit under certain conditions. The decision whether assessment of multiple penalties is required turns on whether an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>employer engages in a \u201csingle course of misconduct\u201d or \u201cseparate and distinct acts of misconduct.\u201d In <em>Gallamore v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at page 824, our Supreme Court held that \u201cmultiple penalties are appropriate in a single penalty proceeding\u201d where \u201cthe circumstances disclose separate and distinct acts of delay or nonpayment, and prior notice was given of the applicant\u2019s intent to seek separate or additional penalties for such acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">In <em>Christian </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 505, 511 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 336, 936 P.2d 115], our Supreme Court clarified the rule: \u201cWhile we have held that multiple penalties must be applied in some circumstances, those penalties have been approved only when the refusal of, or delay in payment of benefits, necessarily involved separate and distinct unreasonable acts by the insurance carrier. Those multiple penalties involved separate classes of benefits, individual claims for payment or reimbursement of medical or travel expenses, or a repeated refusal or delay in payment of a benefit after the same conduct had already been found by the Board to be unreasonable and a prior penalty imposed, or some analogous, legally significant event such as a stipulation of liability by the carrier had intervened between the first act for which a penalty was imposed and the second.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">In <em>Mote </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th at page 912, we construed section 5814 as requiring separate penalties for each separate act of unreasonable conduct involving delayed temporary disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">\n<em>Section 4650</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">\u201c \u2018The section 4650 penalty does not duplicate or supersede the section 5814 penalty; . . . the section 4650 penalty, which is a self-executing, strict liability provision not dependent on a finding of unreasonable delay, is intended to supplement, not replace, the section 5814 penalty. . . .\u2019 [Citations.] Thus, respondents are strictly liable for section 4650 penalties, without application or demand, in addition to any other penalties which may be assessed against them.\u201d <em>(Mote v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th at p. 910.)</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">The parties do not dispute that assessment of a section 4650(d) penalty is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">\n<em>Calculation of Penalties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">We disagree with one of the WCJ\u2019s findings. We conclude the partial payment made on July 15, 1999, warrants only a single section 5814 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>penalty. Making a late partial payment is necessarily part of the delay in making the total payment. Were we to hold otherwise, we would treat the employer who makes a partial payment more harshly than the employer who makes no payment at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">We also disagree with one of the WCAB\u2019s findings. We conclude the failure to self-assess the section 4650(d) penalty is a separate act of misconduct subject to a separate penalty. It is not, as the WCAB held, part of a \u201csingle continuous act of misconduct.\u201d As noted above, section 4650(d) is intended to supplement, not replace, the section 5814 penalty. Our conclusion is consistent with a recent in bank decision of the WCAB. In <em>Farris v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2000) 65 Cal.Comp.Cases 824 (in bank), the WCAB determined that a section 5814 penalty awarded for failure to self-assess the section 4650(d) penalty is assessed against the entirety of the benefit increased by the section 4650(d) penalty amount.  (See also <em>Peter Kiewit Sons, Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (Garland) </em>(1998) 63 Cal.Comp.Cases 331 [WCAB imposed two penalties on permanent disability indemnity because defendant failed to pay at correct rate and failed to assess self-imposed penalty under \u00a7 4650] .)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">If any part of a specific benefit has been delayed or withheld, the penalty is imposed against the entirety of that benefit. <em>(Avalon Bay Foods v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1165, 1171 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 552, 959 P.2d 1228].) Each section 5814 penalty must be computed on the whole of the award applicable for the particular class of benefit involved. <em>(Christian v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 514; see also <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 954, 960 [172 Cal.Rptr. 398] [\u201ca section 5814 penalty is properly characterized as part and parcel of the original compensation award. It is an increase in compensation awarded, rather than a separate type of benefit. Accordingly, any subsequent penalties would be assessed against the principal amount of the original award as increased by any prior penalty assessments\u201d].) The method for calculating 4650(d) penalties is set forth in the statute: 10 percent of the amount of the payment delayed. <em>(Mote </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th at p. 910; <em>Farris v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>65 Cal.Comp.Cases 824.)</p>\n<p id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>Moulton is entitled to have her award increased by three separate penalties: the 10 percent self-imposed penalty under section 4650(d) and two 10 percent penalties under section 5814, one for unreasonable delay in paying temporary disability benefits and one for failing to self-assess the section 4650(d) penalty. Both section 5814 penalties are assessed against all past, present and future temporary disability payments as increased by the section 4650(d) penalty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">We believe this interpretation of sections 5814 and 4650(d) reflects the mandate that we construe the workers\u2019 compensation laws liberally in favor of the employee while achieving \u201ca fair balance between the right of the employee to prompt payment of compensation benefits, and the avoidance of imposition upon the employer or carrier of harsh and unreasonable penalties.\u201d <em>(Gallamore v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 828.)</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The WCAB\u2019s decision is annulled. The cause is remanded to the WCAB for such further proceedings as are consistent with the views expressed in this opinion and its decision in <em>Farris v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>65 Cal.Comp.Cases 824.
