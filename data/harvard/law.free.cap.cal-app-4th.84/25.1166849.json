Code, \u00a7 211) and found true the allegations that defendant had used a firearm during the commission of the crimes (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.53, subd. (b)). The trial court sentenced him to 20 years 8 months in prison. On appeal defendant argues the trial court abused its discretion in making several evidentiary rulings. He further contends he was denied due process when the prosecutor committed misconduct and the court denied his motion for a mistrial based upon such misconduct. We disagree, affirm the trial court, and hold that sexual battery is a crime involving moral turpitude and, therefore, under <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 284 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 418, 841 P.2d 938] may be used to impeach.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Facts<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">I*</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Defendant asserts the trial court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of his misdemeanor conviction for sexual battery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 243.4, subd. (d)). As we construe his argument, defendant contends his prior conviction has little bearing on his veracity and that its introduction into evidence was unduly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Over defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court allowed the prosecution to cross-examine defendant on the circumstances underlying his conviction for sexual battery. The court determined a sexual battery was conduct involving moral turpitude and that while the facts of the crime were admissible, the defendant\u2019s other convictions for spousal abuse would be excluded as cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">\u201c \u2018No witness [,] including a defendant who elects to testify in his own behalf[,] is entitled to a false aura of veracity.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Muldrow </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 636, 646 [248 Cal.Rptr. 891].) In accordance with this maxim the California Supreme Court in <em>People v. Wheeler, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th 284, abrogated the felony-only rule and permitted misdemeanors to be used to impeach. However, the threshold inquiry remains whether the prior conduct has some logical bearing upon the witness\u2019 veracity. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 293.) To answer this question, we must ascertain whether the least adjudicated elements of the offense constitute a crime of moral turpitude. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">The California Supreme Court has divided crimes of moral turpitude into two groups. <em>(People v. Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111].) The first group includes crimes in which dishonesty is an element (i.e., fraud, perjury, etc.). The second group includes crimes that indicate a \u201c \u2018general readiness to do evil,\u2019 \u201d from which a readiness to lie can be inferred. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 315.) Crimes in the latter group are acts of \u201cbaseness, vileness or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>fellowmen, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man.\u201d <em>(In re Craig </em>(1938) 12 Cal.2d 93, 97 [82 P.2d 442].) \u201cAlthough the inference is not as compelling in the latter case, \u2018it is undeniable that a witness\u2019s moral depravity of any kind has some \u201ctendency in reason\u201d [citation] to shake one\u2019s confidence in his honesty.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Thornton </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 419, 422 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 519].)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The question of whether misdemeanor sexual battery constitutes a crime of moral turpitude has not been decided in California. Other jurisdictions have held that similar crimes involve moral turpitude. <em>(Matter of Brooks </em>(1993) 263 Ga. 530 [436 S.E.2d 493] [misdemeanor sexual battery is a crime involving moral turpitude]; <em>Hernandez-Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Moyer </em>(N.D.Ill. 1995) 907 F.Supp. 1224 [Illinois offense of felony aggravated battery is a crime involving moral turpitude]; <em>Maghsoudi v. I.N.S. </em>(1st Cir. 1999) 181 F.3d 8 [conviction under Massachusetts statute for felony indecent assault and battery on person 14 or older is a crime involving moral turpitude]; <em>In Matter of S- </em>(B.I.A. 1954) 5 I. &amp; N. Dec. 686 [1954 WL 7947] [conviction under Canadian indecent assault statute is a crime involving moral turpitude]; <em>In Matter of Z- </em>(B.I.A. 1956) 7 I. &amp; N. Dec. 253 [1956 WL 10268] [indecent assault under Connecticut statute is a crime involving moral turpitude].)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Usually simple battery, which requires only a \u201cwillful and unlawful\u201d use of force on another (Pen. Code, \u00a7 242), does not involve moral turpitude. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lindsay </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 849, 855-856 [257 Cal.Rptr. 529].) Because the least offensive push can cause great bodily injury, even felony battery may not involve moral turpitude. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mansfield </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 82 [245 Cal.Rptr. 800]; but see <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 951, 957 [215 Cal.Rptr. 612] [\u201cbattery . . . , a crime of violence, demonstrates \u2018a general readiness to do evil\u2019 and thus moral turpitude\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Unlike simple or even felony battery, sexual battery does not result from a simple push or offensive touch. Sexual battery is a specific intent crime. It consists of touching an intimate part of another, against the victim\u2019s will, committed for the purposes of sexual arousal, gratification or abuse. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 243.4, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Other crimes involving elements in addition to simple battery have been held to involve moral turpitude. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Elwell </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 171 [253 Cal.Rptr. 480] [assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury].) Battery on a police officer (Pen. Code, \u00a7 243 subd. (c)) has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>held to involve moral turpitude. <em>(People v. Lindsay, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.3d at p. 856.) This is because battery on a police officer involves additional elements not required for simple battery, as does corporal punishment of a child. <em>(People v. Brooks </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 669 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 570].)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Intent to do harm is not necessary for moral turpitude. A violation of Penal Code section 422, making terrorist threats, has been deemed a crime of moral turpitude. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thornton, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.4th 419, 424.)  In <em>Thornton, </em>the defendant argued that since an intent to carry out the crime was not required, the crime was analogous to battery and did not necessarily involve moral turpitude. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 423.) The court disagreed, finding \u201c[t]he knowing infliction of mental terror [on his victim] is equally deserving of moral condemnation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 424.) The same is true of sexual battery; the degrading use of another, against her will, for one\u2019s own sexual arousal is deserving of moral condemnation. We hold that sexual battery is a crime of moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence as it was more prejudicial than probative. As it must, the court conducted a balancing test under Evidence Code section 352.  A trial court may only exclude relevant evidence when \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed\u201d by the risk of undue prejudice. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 352.) \u201c \u2018A trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion will not be disturbed unless it appears that the resulting injury is sufficiently grave to manifest a miscarriage of justice. [Citation.] In other words, discretion is abused only if the court exceeds the bounds of reason, all of the circumstances being considered. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Green </em>(1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 165, 182-183 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 239].)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Here, defendant\u2019s criminal conduct was recent, occurring in 1997. His prior and present offenses are substantially different and thus, \u201cthe prejudicial factor before the jury is limited.\u201d Although the prior crime was of a violent nature, it was no more violent than the circumstances surrounding defendant\u2019s present offense. The trial court\u2019s decision lay reasonably within its discretion. (See <em>People v. Williams, supra, </em>169 Cal.App.3d at p. 957.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Defendant \u201cdoubts if the jury could have limited the use of the evidence for impeachment rather than propensity.\u201d This assertion is unfounded. The jury received instruction regarding what it could use evidence of defendant\u2019s prior conviction for, specifically, in determining his believability as a witness only.  \u201c \u2018The crucial assumption underlying our constitutional system of trial by jury is that jurors generally understand and faithfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>follow instructions.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Callahan </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 356, 372 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 838].) We must assume the jury understood its duty to follow the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>pre-Castro/Wheeler </em>and pre-Proposition 8 cases is also unpersuasive. As the California Supreme Court noted in <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at page 312, the intention of the drafters of Proposition 8 was to \u201crestore trial court discretion as visualized by the Evidence Code and to reject the rigid, black letter rules of exclusion.\u201d The spirit of Proposition 8 supports the trial court\u2019s decision.-Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">III., IV.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Sims, Acting P.
