The superior court disagreed and issued a writ of mandate ordering the Commission to conduct further proceedings to determine the amount of reimbursement due to the County. The issue raised by this appeal is whether enactment of the ERAF legislation resulted in costs to the County for a state mandated new program or higher level of service, thereby requiring reimbursement pursuant to section 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-8\">We conclude that the state is not obligated to reimburse local governments for this change in the allocation of property tax revenues. The reallocation of revenue resulting from the challenged legislation does not result in reimbursable \u201ccosts\u201d within the meaning of section 6. Furthermore, shifting the percentage of responsibility for a program that was jointly funded by state and local governments at the time section 6 became effective is not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>imposition of a \u201cnew program or higher level of service.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>We reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">The challenged legislation added section 97.03 to the Revenue and Taxation Code. The legislation reduced the amount of property tax revenue to be allocated to local government pursuant to a specified formula and allocated an equal amount of revenue to the ERAF for distribution to county school districts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 97.2.) At the same time, the Legislature enacted Senate Bill No. 766 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.), which added section 41204.5 to the Education Code. The new Education Code provision had the effect of decreasing the amount of the state\u2019s contribution to the constitutionally mandated minimum funding level for education in the amount of the allocation to the county ERAF\u2019s.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">Our resolution of the issues presented by this appeal is aided by a review of the changes in the state\u2019s role in school finance, including the <em>Serrano </em>cases, Proposition 13, and the post-Proposition 13 legislative scramble to replace property tax revenues in the state budgetary scheme. Understanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>wMch entity had the responsibility for funding education on July 1, 1980, when section 6 became effective is necessary for an analysis of the issues raised in this case. The legislative action in 1992 did not spring up full-grown like Venus from the sea, but rather grew out of decades of developments in school funding and tax restrictions. Placing the issue in the proper historical context makes it clear that school finance has always been a partnership involving state and local financing buffeted at times by the external forces of initiatives, variable economic conditions in California, and court decisions interpreting constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">After reviewing the litigation, legislation, initiative measures, and specific events leading to this appeal, we proceed to an analysis of the purpose and requirements of subvention for state-mandated programs and conclude that neither a cost nor a new program has been created by the ERAF legislation. We begin with a historical review of the fluid nature of school funding in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">\n<em>The 1960\u2019s: State and Local Roles in School Funding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">In the late 1960\u2019s, California public schools derived over 90 percent of their financial support from local taxes on real property, supplemented by the State School Fund.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591 &amp; fn. 2 [96 Cal.Rptr. 601, 487 P.2d 1241, 41 A.L.R.3d 1187] <em>(Serrano I).) </em>The Legislature authorized local governments to levy taxes on real property to meet the needs of the district\u2019s schools. Most of the balance of a school district\u2019s revenue came from the state. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 592.) Specifically, in this <em>pre-Serrano I </em>and pre-Proposition 13 period, 55.7 percent of school revenues came from local property taxes and 35.5 percent from state aid.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Serrano I, supra, </em>at p. 591, fn. 2.) During this time the Legislature determined the manner of school financing shared by local government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>\n<em>1971-1976: The Serrano Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">The disparity created by reliance on the value of a district\u2019s real estate was challenged in 1971 on constitutional grounds in <em>Serrano I. </em>The court determined that the system of school financing impermissibly discriminated based on the wealth of the district. <em>(Serrano I, supra, 5 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 598, 614-615.) The result was that the quality of a child\u2019s education was irretrievably tied to the wealth of the residents of the district. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 599-601.) The <em>Serrano I </em>court remanded the case for a trial on the merits. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 619.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">During the trial of the remanded <em>Serrano I </em>case, the Legislature passed new legislation that increased the amount of state aid to schools, limited expenditures and tied the limitations to inflation adjustments so that districts with higher local revenues received smaller upward adjustments. <em>(Serrano II, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at pp. 736-737, 742-743.) At this juncture in school funding, financial responsibility was still primarily with local government, with the state supplying aid in an attempt to remedy the deficiencies identified by the Supreme Court. The Legislature continued to determine the manner of school financing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">In <em>Serrano II, </em>the court again determined that the state\u2019s school finance structure violated the California Constitution despite the legislative attempts to remedy the perceived discrimination. <em>(Serrano II, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 768. ) The court found that the system impermissibly \u201crenders the educational opportunity available to the students of this state a function of the taxable wealth [per pupil] of the districts in which they live . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 769. )</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-9\">After <em>Serrano II, </em>the Legislature passed Assembly Bill No. 65 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) to increase the ability of poorer districts to raise funds by providing state assistance if actual revenues fell below a scheduled amount. In addition, specified \u201csqueeze\u201d formulas served to decrease the inflation adjustment for wealthier districts and to transfer revenues from high to low wealth districts. (Stats. 1977, ch. 894, \u00a7 16.5, p. 2681; Comment, <em>Inequalities in California\u2019s Public School System: The Undermining of Serrano v. Priest and the Need for a Minimum Standards System of Education </em>(1999) 32 Loyola L.A. L.Rev. 583, 599.) It has been said that the Legislature\u2019s attempt to respond to the <em>Serrano </em>decisions resulted in \u201ca true \u2018power equalizing\u2019 system whereby local property tax revenue was to be redistributed from tax-rich to tax-poor districts.\u201d (Comment, <em>Educational Financing Mandates in California: Reallocating the Cost of Educating Immigrants Between State and Local Governmental Entities </em>(1994) 35 Santa Clara L.Rev. 367, 392.) School finance remained, however, a jointly funded system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>\n<em>1978: Proposition 13 and the Legislative Response</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">Before Assembly Bill No. 65 could take effect, the voters passed Proposition 13 in 1978, which fundamentally restricted the ability of local governments to raise funds to finance schools through local property tax revenues. Proposition 13 involved several elements, including limitations on the tax rate on real property and on increases in the assessed value of real property. The measure also limited any future changes in state taxes to those passed by two-thirds of the Legislature, and future changes in local tax increases to those imposed by a two-thirds vote of the electors. <em>(Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 208, 220 [149 Cal.Rptr. 239, 583 P.2d 1281] <em>(Amador Valley).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">The consequences of Proposition 13 were perceived as catastrophic. \u201cAlthough California is renowned for its earthquakes, no tremor of high Richter-scale proportion has shaken it quite like the enactment of Proposition 13. Every local entity in the state feared potential economic collapse in the aftershock of that momentous decision by the people.\u201d <em>(Jarvis </em>v. <em>Cory </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 562, 573 [170 Cal.Rptr. 11, 620 P.2d 598] <em>(Jarvis).) </em>Despite the dire predictions, Proposition 13 was upheld as a valid constitutional amendment in <em>Amador Valley, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">\u201cBecause the state had accrued a sizeable surplus of funds, it was immediately called upon to help maintain local governments through the initial period of drastic revenue loss.\u201d <em>(Jarvis, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 573.) Proposition 13 provided that property taxes, at the reduced amount, were to be \u201ccollected by the counties and apportioned according to law to the districts within the counties.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, \u00a7 1, subd. (a).) As noted by the Legislative Analyst\u2019s comment in the California voters pamphlet, there was no state law at the time that provided for the distribution of these revenues. (Ballot Pamp., Primary Elec. (June 6, 1978) pp. 56-57.) The Legislature acted quickly to fill this void.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-8\">The Legislature enacted Senate Bill No. 154 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.), an emergency \u201cbailout\u201d bill, effective for the 1978-1979 fiscal year, providing that the state would distribute the reduced pool of property tax revenues. (Stats. 1978, ch. 332, \u00a7 36, p. 706; <em>Jarvis, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 574.) The state also provided block grants and relieved counties of the costs of various health and welfare programs. Additional state aid was allocated to the public schools on a sliding scale, to attempt to guarantee to each school district 85 percent (for higher revenue districts) to 91 percent (for lower revenue districts) of the revenue it would have been allocated if Assembly Bill No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>65 had been implemented. <em>(Arvin Union School Dist. </em>v. <em>Ross </em>(1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 189, 196 [221 Cal.Rptr. 720]. Senate Bill No. 154 was a temporary one-year measure that increased state aid to schools, but did not place full financial responsibility on the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">\n<em>1979-1980: The Assembly Bill No. 8 Shift of Funds to Local Governments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">The most important legislation, for purposes of this appeal, is Assembly Bill No. 8 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.), the long-term attempt to address the post-Proposition 13 financial problems of schools and other local entities. (Stats. 1979, ch. 282, p. 959.) The initial provisions of Assembly Bill No. 8 took effect in the 1979-1980 fiscal year. The long-range financing provisions of Assembly Bill No. 8 did not become effective until the 1980-1981 year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">It is undisputed and a part of the administrative record in this case, that in 1979, the Legislature reduced the share of local property tax revenues allocated to schools from approximately 53 percent to approximately 35 percent and made up the difference with state funds. The property tax revenue allocated to counties was increased from approximately 30 percent to approximately 32 percent, the allocation to cities was increased from approximately 10 to approximately 15 percent and the allocation to special districts was increased from approximately 7 to approximately 18 percent. (See also Legis. Analyst, analysis of Assem. Bill No. 8 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 21, 1979.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">Each school district received a share of the reduced pool of property taxes in the county in proportion to the share received in the 1978-1979 school year. Additional aid from state funds was supplied to replace the reduction in property taxes. (Assem. Conf. Com. on Long-term Local Gov. &amp; School Financing, Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 8 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) as amended July 19, 1979, p. 8.) Although in the aftermath of Proposition 13, the state\u2019s percentage of support for schools increased from the <em>pre-Serrano </em>days, joint state and local funding responsibility for school districts existed when section 6 became effective on July 1, 1980. (Cal. Const., art. XIII B, \u00a7 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">\n<em>The 1992 Reallocation to ERAF\u2019s</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-9\">School funding practices remained relatively stable until enactment of the 1992-1993 legislation that forms the basis for the claim of subvention in this case. \u201cThe State of California faced an unprecedented budgetary crisis at the outset of fiscal year 1991-1992, with expenditures projected to exceed revenues by more than $14 billion.\u201d <em>(Department of Personnel Administration </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 155, 163 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 714].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>In 1992, the Legislature enacted the bill that was subsequently codified as Revenue and Taxation Code section 97.2. That statute reduced the post-Proposition 13 allocation of property taxes to local governments and allocated amounts equal to those reductions to county ERAF\u2019s for distribution to the county schools. (Stats. 1992, ch. 699, \u00a7 12, p. 3093; Stats. 1992, ch. 700, \u00a74, p. 3120 [Sen. Bill No. 844 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) rewriting the provisions of the prior bill]; see Historical and Statutory Notes, 59 West\u2019s Ann. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code (1998 ed.) foll. former \u00a7\u00a7 97.01 to 97.05, p. 174.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">By 1993, the recessionary economy and the growing revenue requirements of schools jeopardized the state\u2019s ability to finance even essential state functions. Given the bleak economic circumstances, the Governor determined that education, along with public safety, had to receive priority over state funding of other local services. The result was that the 1993-1994 budget again reduced the amount of the post-Proposition 13 bailout to local government and reallocated local property tax revenues to ERAF\u2019s.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Governor\u2019s Budget Summary, 1993-1994, pp. 44, 92-93.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">The ERAF reallocation design can be summarized as requiring reduction of property tax revenues previously allocated to counties by use of a specified formula, deposit of the reduced amounts into ERAF\u2019s, and distribution of the ERAF funds to schools. Another portion of the same legislation deemed the ERAF revenues to be part of the state General Fund revenues for purposes of calculating the minimum educational funding guarantee under Proposition 98.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The overall result of these statutes is that the tax revenues of the counties are decreased, school revenues remain the same, and the minimum school funding guarantee of Proposition 98 is satisfied in part by the ERAF funds. This legislative adroitness fulfilled the funding of Proposition 98 by reallocating available finite funds from one local governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>entity to another. (Legis. Analyst, Rep. to Joint Legis. Budget Com., analysis of 1993-1994 Budget Bill, p. 90.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">Concurrently with the ERAF legislation, and thereafter, the state cushioned the loss of revenue to local governments through a variety of mitigation measures, including an additional sales tax, that was established in the Constitution by the voters in 1993, trial court funding reform, supplemental funding for special police protection districts, grants of authority to counties to reduce general assistance levels, loans for property tax administration and a one-time mitigation of $292 million. The effects of the ERAF legislation and the state\u2019s efforts to offset those effects continue to the present time. (Governor\u2019s Budget Summary, 1999-2000, pp. 41-43; Legis. Analyst, Rep. to Joint Legis. Budget Com., The 1999-00 Budget: Perspectives and Issues, pp. 154-157.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">The ERAF legislation has been challenged and upheld. In <em>County of Los Angeles v. Sasaki </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1442 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 103] (Sasaki) and <em>San Miguel Consolidated Fire Protection Dist. v. Davis </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 134 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 343] <em>(San Miguel), </em>the courts upheld the legislation against constitutional challenges. The petitioner in <em>San Miguel </em>also argued that it was entitled to offset reimbursement owed by the state against any shifting of property tax revenues. <em>(San Miguel, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th at pp. 142-143.) The court rejected the claim of offset as premature, noting that claims for payment had been submitted to the state but had not yet been adjudicated. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 155-156.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">This case now raises the issue foreshadowed in <em>San Miguel.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The counties here argue that the challenged reallocation of property tax revenues is a state-mandated cost of a new program, entitling the affected local governments to reimbursement. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 17500 et seq.; \u00a7 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number><em>Background of This Appeal </em>\u2014 <em>The Test Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">After the adverse decisions for the county and special district in <em>Sasaki, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th 1442, and <em>San Miguel, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th 134, the County and 47 other counties (collectively, the Counties) filed a test claim with the Commission, pursuant to the provisions of section 6 and the implementing legislation of Government Code section 17500 et seq.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The County claimed that it had been subjected to a new program or an increased level of service for which subvention was required. The \u201cnew\u201d program or service was identified as the state\u2019s shift of local property tax revenues to ERAF\u2019s and the contemporaneous reduction in the amount the state contributed to meet the Proposition 98 minimum funding goal for schools.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The County argued that these two actions combined to force local government to bear the financial burden of Proposition 98 funding that had formerly been financed solely by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">On November 30, 1998, following public hearings on the test claim, the Commission issued its decision rejecting the claim. The Commission based its denial of the test claim on its conclusion that although the test claim legislation reduced county revenues, it did not impose a spending program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">\n<em>The Action in the Superior Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-8\">On March 17, 1999, the County challenged the Commission\u2019s decision by filing both a petition for writ of administrative mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and a complaint for declaratory relief in the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-9\">The petition alleged that the ERAF legislation imposed a new program or higher level of service and required reimbursement of nearly $5 billion to local governments for the 1996-1997 and 1997-1998 fiscal years. The second cause of action for declaratory relief alleged the same facts, but added that by the Legislature\u2019s actions in shifting the allocation of funds to the ERAF\u2019s and deeming the shift to have occurred in 1986-1987 for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of Proposition 98, the state reduced the percentage of state funds allocated to education from 40 percent to 34 percent. The second cause of action requested a declaration that the state may not exercise its power to allocate property taxes without reimbursing local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>governments, that the California Constitution requires reimbursement whenever the state shifts property tax revenues from one local entity to another for state purposes, that funding education is a state obligation, and that the state cannot increase the percentage of public school funding derived from property tax revenue without reimbursing local governments in an equal amount. In May of 1999, the court allowed an additional 53 counties to intervene in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">On October 21, 1999, the court granted a motion to dismiss the second cause of action, finding that the request for declaratory relief addressed issues that were neither definite nor concrete in the factual context of the case, which involved the Commission\u2019s rejection of the test claim. On the same date, after reviewing the administrative record, the briefs of the parties, and hearing argument, the court filed its statement of decision finding that the ERAF legislation: \u201ccreated a new program or higher level of service which requires reimbursement under Article XIII B, section 6 of the California Constitution since the shift of local property taxes compels the counties to accept financial responsibility in whole or in part for a program which was required to be funded by the State by the enactment of Proposition 98.\u201d The requested writ of mandate issued on November 18, 1999. The State of California, California Department of Finance, and the Director of the Department of Finance appealed from the judgment directing issuance of the writ.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">Based on our review of the relevant historical events, focusing on the language of section 6 and the challenged legislation, we determine that the trial court improperly looked to the use made of the reallocated revenues instead of whether the legislation mandates costs due to a new program or higher level of service for a program previously funded entirely by the state as required by the Constitution, interpretive case law, and implementing statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">Decisions of the Commission are reviewed by petition in the superior court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, \u201con the ground that the commission\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence. The court may order the commission to hold another hearing regarding the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>and may direct the commission on what basis the claim is to receive a rehearing.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 17559, subd. (b).)  Although the statute references a substantial evidence standard of review, \u201c[t]he determination whether the statutes here at issue established a mandate under section 6 is a question of law.\u201d <em>(County of San Diego </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 68, 109 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 134, 931 P.2d 312] (County <em>of San Diego).) </em>The facts underlying this case were undisputed, thus we review the issues as questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">\n<em>Limited Scope of Issues Addressed in This Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">It is important at the outset of this discussion to clarify the scope of the issues raised by this appeal and identify issues that are not properly before us on an appeal from a subvention decision. As our Supreme Court cautioned a decade ago, in evaluating a claim for subvention, we cannot become entangled in consideration of where the benefit of questioned state action falls. In <em>City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 51 [266 Cal.Rptr. 139, 785 P.2d 522] <em>(City of Sacramento), </em>the court cautioned that subvention does not depend on \u201cwhether the \u2018benefit\u2019 of a state-imposed local requirement falls principally at the state or local level. Attempts to apply such a \u2018benefit\u2019 test to the myriad of individual cases could easily produce debates bordering on the metaphysical. Nothing in the language or history of article XIII B, or prior subvention statutes, suggests an intent to force such debates upon the Legislature each time it considers legislation affecting local governments.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 70, fn. 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">In addition, this appeal does not encompass an attack on the constitutionality, wisdom, or propriety of the state\u2019s budget process that resulted in the ERAF legislation. The original complaint in the superior court contained a second cause of action for declaratory relief requesting a wide-ranging declaration that, among other things, funding education is a state obligation, the state may not exercise its power to allocate tax revenues in a manner that interferes with home rule powers, section 6 established the state\u2019s obligation to fund education solely from the General Fund, and Assembly Bill No. 8 froze the amount of property taxes that may be allocated to schools. However, that cause of action was dismissed by the trial court, and no appeal or cross-appeal was filed regarding that claim. Issues raised by the second cause of action are not properly before us in this appeal by the state.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1117-8\">Finally, we note that the court in <em>Sasaki, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th 1442, held that the county plaintiffs in that case lacked standing to challenge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>constitutionality of Education Code section 41204.5. That court reasoned that the matter of how the state treats revenues it allocates to educational entities may concern the educational entities, but no theory would entitle a county to a writ of mandate negating that code section. <em>(Sasaki, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at p. 1449.) In <em>San Miguel, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th 134, the court acknowledged a question as to whether special districts could challenge the constitutionality of the ERAF legislation, but indicated that individual taxpayer plaintiffs in that case had standing. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 143-145.) The only plaintiffs in this action are counties. Thus, the only issues properly before us are those bearing on the question of whether the decision to reallocate a portion of property tax revenues in the challenged years results in a state mandated cost for a new program or higher level of service such that subvention is required. We have no wish to become enmeshed in the metaphysical debates that the court warned against in <em>City of Sacramento. (City of Sacramento, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 70.) This case does not involve whether it was legally prudent to rob Peter to pay Paul.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Consequently, we decline to expand our consideration to issues of the identity of the beneficiary of the allocation or the constitutionality of legislation relating to school entities. We confine our discussion to the question of subvention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">\n<em>Rules of Constitutional Construction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">Unlike the federal Constitution, our state Constitution sets out limitations on the power of the Legislature. <em>(California Teachers Assn. v. Hayes </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1513, 1531 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 699] <em>(Hayes).) </em>The state Legislature has the \u201c \u2018 \u201centire lawmaking authority of the state . . . \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Furthermore, \u201c \u2018 \u201call intendments favor the exercise of the Legislature\u2019s plenary authority . . . <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1532.) Any doubts regarding the Legislature\u2019s power are resolved in favor of the exercise of that power. Limitations on that power are strictly construed and are not extended by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-8\">The principle that the Legislature may exercise all powers not denied to it by the Constitution \u201c \u2018is of particular importance in the field of taxation, in which the Legislature is generally supreme. . . . \u201c[t]he provisions on taxation in the state Constitution are a limitation on the power of the Legislature rather than a grant to it. [Citations.] Its power in the field of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>taxation is limited only by constitutional restrictions.\u201d [Citation.] In other words, the Legislature\u2019s authority to impose taxes and regulate the collection thereof exists unless it has been <em>expressly </em>eliminated by the Constitution. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Sasaki, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1453-1454, citing <em>Armstrong v. County of San Mateo </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 597, 624 [194 Cal.Rptr. 294].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">When considering the Legislature\u2019s considerable powers regarding budget and tax matters, \u201cthe Legislature, not this court, decides which of the innumerable public mouths tax revenues will feed. Barring a statutory or constitutional violation, it is not for this court to stop the Legislature if it transfers revenue from Peter to compensate Paul . . . .\u201d <em>(Arcadia Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Ikemoto </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 444, 453 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 112] <em>(Arcadia).) </em>\u201cUnder these principles, there is no basis for applying section 6 as an equitable remedy to cure the perceived unfairness resulting from political decisions on funding priorities.\u201d <em>(City of San Jose v. State of California </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1802, 1817 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 521] <em>(City of San Jose).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">Allocation of local property tax revenues is an appropriate exercise of the Legislature\u2019s authority regarding taxes. In <em>Amador Valley, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 208, the court upheld Proposition 13 and the vesting in the Legislature of the general power to allocate revenues from local property taxes. (22 Cal.3d at pp. 225-226.) The court noted that the Legislature was not thereby empowered to reward or punish local agencies and thereby undermine local power to address regional issues by withholding funds. The court explained that Proposition 13 did not empower the state to \u201cdirect or control local budgetary decisions or program or service priorities . . .\u201d or otherwise interfere with local decisionmaking. (22 Cal.3d at p. 226.) However, the <em>Amador Valley </em>court specifically stated that legislation that merely allocates funds on a pro rata basis, without imposing conditions on the local entity\u2019s use of the funds is a valid exercise of the state\u2019s authority under Proposition 13. (22 Cal.3d at p. 227.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">Courts have upheld the Legislature\u2019s specific power to reduce a county\u2019s allocated share of property taxes. In <em>Sasaki, </em>the court reviewed the same legislation that is the basis of the claim for subvention in this appeal. The court traced the history of education funding from <em>Serrano </em>through the post-Proposition 13 legislation, noting that the Legislature\u2019s bailout of counties and distribution of the remaining tax revenues was upheld in <em>Amador Valley. (Sasaki, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1450-1452.) The <em>Sasaki </em>court recognized that in the wake of Proposition 13, the state assumed a larger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>share of the funding of schools, but found no intent to prevent the state from altering the proportionate shares of revenue to address future changed conditions. <em>(Sasaki, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at p. 1456.) The fact that the state shifted revenue away from the schools and towards local government after Proposition 13 did not restrict the state\u2019s power to change the allocation again, \u201cin the context of comprehensive legislative planning for the funding of both entities from a variety of sources, including property tax revenue.\u201d <em>(Sasaki, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at p. 1457.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">When acting to allocate taxes among various entities, the Legislature is acting within its particular sphere of power and discretion. Constitutional provisions will not be extended by implication to curtail the proper exercise of that power. Keeping these principles in mind, we turn to an analysis of the requirements of section 6 to determine whether the challenged allocation of property tax revenues necessitates subvention to the Counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">\n<em>Section 6 Subvention Is Intended for Increases in Actual Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-6\">In the November 1979 election, the voters passed Proposition 4, which included section 6, and was intended as a complementary measure to . Proposition 13. Designated \u201cthe Spirit of 13,\u201d the initiative provided for a constitutional limitation on government spending. (Ballot Pamp., Special Statewide Elec. (Nov. 6, 1979) p. 18.) As incorporated in California Constitution, article XIII B, Proposition 4 was intended to \u201crequire state and local governments to limit their budgets . . . .\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Special Statewide Elec., <em>supra, </em>p. 18; <em>County of San Diego, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 81.) In addition, voters were told that section 6 of Proposition 4 was intended to prevent state government attempts \u201cto force programs on local governments without the state paying for them.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Special Statewide Elec., <em>supra, </em>p. 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-7\">Section 6 provides: \u201cWhenever the Legislature . . . mandates a new program or higher level of service on any local government, the State shall provide a subvention of funds to reimburse such local government for the costs of such program or increased level of service . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As noted in <em>Lucia Mar Unified School Dist. v. Honig </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 830 [244 Cal.Rptr. 677, 750 P.2d 318] <em>(Lucia Mar), </em>the principle of reimbursement was \u201censhrined in the Constitution ... to provide local entities with the assurance that state mandates would not place additional burdens on. their increasingly limited revenue resources.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 836, fn. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>Analysis of a section 6 reimbursement claim includes an assessment of the language of the constitutional provision, including the explicit requirements of \u201ccosts\u201d of a \u201cnew program or higher level of service\u201d as well as the purpose of the voters in seeking to prevent new, unfunded mandates in light of the spending limits of California Constitution, article XIII B. <em>(County of Los Angeles v. State of California </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 46, 56 [233 Cal.Rptr. 38, 729 P.2d 202] <em>(County of Los Angeles).) </em>Section 6 does not provide subvention for every increased cost mandated by state law. <em>(Lucia Mar, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 835.) The court <em>in County of Los Angeles </em>confirmed that the voters had not intended that all local costs resulting from compliance with state law would be reimbursable, but intended to prevent: \u201cthe perceived attempt by the state to enact legislation or adopt administrative orders creating programs to be administered by local agencies, thereby transferring to those agencies the fiscal responsibility for providing services which the state believed should be extended to the public.\u201d <em>(County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 56.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">The trial court determined that section 6 does not require an actual expenditure of funds as a prerequisite to reimbursement. The court indicated that <em>Lucia Mar, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 830, and <em>County of San Diego, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th 68, held that no actual cost need be shown if the state has in fact shifted a financial burden to local government. However, the court failed to note that in both <em>Lucia Mar </em>and <em>County of San Diego, </em>the shift of responsibility to local government resulted in actual expenditures by those entities. In <em>Lucia Mar, </em>for example, the state attempted to collect the actual dollar amounts claimed for use of the state schools from the local districts by sending invoices to the schools. <em>(Lucia Mar, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 832-833.) Similarly, in <em>County of San Diego, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th 68, the county had to expend funds to provide health care services for a population formerly served solely by the state. San Diego County had a direct and ascertainable cost resulting from the state\u2019s action. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 79-80.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">In this case, the County\u2019s tax revenues were not expended. No invoices were sent, no costs were collected, and no charges were made against the counties in this case. Contrary to the conclusion of the trial court, it is the expenditure of tax revenues of local governments that is the appropriate focus of section 6. <em>(County of Fresno </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 482, 487 [280 Cal.Rptr. 92, 808 P.2d 235] <em>(County of Fresno) </em>[stating that \u00a7 6 was \u201cdesigned to protect the tax revenues of local governments from state mandates that would require expenditure of such revenues.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">An examination of the intent of the voters and the language of Proposition 4 itself supports our conclusion that Proposition 4 was aimed at controlling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>and capping government spending, not curbing changes in revenue allocations. Section 6 is an obvious compliment to the goal of Proposition 4 in that it prevents the state from forcing extra programs on local governments in a manner that negates their careful budgeting of expenditures. A forced program that would negate such planning is one that results in increased actual expenditures of limited tax proceeds that are counted against the local government\u2019s spending limit. Section 6, located within a measure aimed at limiting expenditures, is expressly concerned with \u201ccosts\u201d incurred by local government as a result of state-mandated programs, particularly when the costs of compliance with a new program restrict local spending in other areas. (\u00a7 6.) \u201cNo state duty of subvention is triggered where the local agency is not required to expend its proceeds of taxes.\u201d <em>(Redevelopment Agency v. Commission on State Mandates </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 976, 987 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 270] [Cal. Const., art. XIII B intended to limit spending of the proceeds from taxes].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">Aside from the implications to be drawn from the location of section 6 within the spending limitations of Proposition 4, the Legislature has interpreted California Constitution, article XIII B in subsequent statutes.  Where a constitutional provision may have different meanings, \u201c \u2018. . . \u201cit is a fundamental rule of constitutional construction that, if the Legislature has by statute adopted one, its action in this respect is well nigh, if not completely, controlling.\u201d . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Arcadia, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at p. 452.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">Government Code sections 17500 through 17630 were enacted by the Legislature to implement section 6. <em>(County of Fresno, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 484.) Government Code section 17514 defines \u201ccosts mandated by the state\u201d for purposes of section 6 as \u201cany increased costs which a local agency or school district is <em>required to incur </em>after July 1, 1980, as a result of any statute . . . which mandates a new program or higher level of service of an existing program within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.\u201d (Italics added.) Government Code section 17522 defines \u201cannual reimbursement claim\u201d to mean \u201ca claim for <em>actual costs incurred </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Similarly, Government Code section 17558.5 refers to a claim for <em>\u201cactual costs </em>filed by a local agency . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) The obvious view of the Legislature is that reimbursement is intended to replace actual costs incurred, not as compensation for revenue that was never received. The Legislature\u2019s view is entitled to significant weight. <em>(Arcadia, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at pp. 452-453.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">The County argues that if an actual cost is required for subvention, the reduced allocation of tax revenues challenged here should be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>such a cost. But, as noted by the Commission in its brief in support of appellant, when reimbursement for lost revenues is intended by the Constitution, it is clearly expressed. For example article XIII, section 8.5 of the California Constitution regarding postponement of property taxes provides for subvention to local government in \u201can amount equal to the amount of revenue lost by each by reason of the postponement of taxes . . . .\u201d Section 25 of article XIII of the California Constitution, regarding the homeowners property tax exemption, provides for reimbursement to local government \u201cfor revenue lost because of Section 3(k).\u201d The presence of these references to reimbursement for lost revenue in article XIII supports a conclusion that by using the word \u201ccost\u201d in section 6 the voters meant the common meaning of cost as an expenditure or expense actually incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">In light of the constraints imposed by the rules regarding strict construction of constitutional limitations on the power of the Legislature, and the rule that requires respect for the Legislature\u2019s adoption of a particular meaning of a constitutional phrase, we cannot extend the provisions of section 6 to include concepts such as lost revenue, that are not fairly implicated by the history, voter materials, language and legislative interpretation of section 6. We can only conclude that when the Constitution uses \u201ccosts\u201d in the context of subvention of funds to reimburse for \u201cthe costs of such program,\u201d that some actual cost must be demonstrated, and not merely decreases in revenue.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">\n<em>Subvention Cases Involve Programs Previously Funded Exclusively by the State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-7\">The trial court stated that <em>Lucia Mar, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 830, and <em>County of San Diego, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th 68, held that whenever a state shifts a burden to local government, it has established a new program or higher level of service for purposes of subvention. The trial court believed that so long as the local entity could demonstrate a financial burden had been shifted, subvention was necessary irrespective of actual costs or prior funding of the program. Like the trial court, the Counties insist that <em>Lucia Mar </em>and <em>County of San Diego </em>involve striking similarities to this case and establish that any shift in funding is a new program for purposes of subvention. But there is a critical difference, aside from the issue of actual costs expended, between the facts of <em>Lucia Mar </em>and <em>County of San Diego, </em>and this case. The programs at issue in the cited cases were entirely funded by the state at the time section 6 became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>The County argues that <em>Lucia Mar </em>involved a situation in which the state attempted to return to local school districts the cost of educating students at special state schools, a cost the state assumed after Proposition 13. However, any apparent similarity to the reallocation brought about by the ERAF legislation is only superficial. <em>Lucia Mar </em>concerned a statute that required a school district to pay part of the cost of educating students from the local district at a state school for the severely handicapped. By July 1, 1980 (the date that \u00a7 6 became effective), the state had already assumed the entire responsibility for funding of the state school program. The <em>Lucia Mar </em>court found that it violated the purpose of section 6 to compel local governments to \u201caccept financial responsibility in whole or in part for a program which was <em>funded entirely by the state </em>before the advent of article XIIIB . . . .\u201d <em>(Lucia Mar, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 836, italics added.) Thus, the facts of <em>Lucia Mar </em>involved the transfer of costs from a totally state-funded program to the local governmental entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\"><em>County of San Diego, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th 68, said by the Counties to extend <em>Lucia Mar </em>to a de facto shift of financial responsibility, involved the care of medically indigent persons (MIP) who were not linked to a federal category of disability, but only lacked the income and resources to afford health care. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 77.) In 1971, the state extended Medi-Cal coverage to these individuals. At the time the voters adopted section 6, the state provided health care funding for MIP\u2019s without any financial contribution from the counties. In 1983 the state excluded those individuals from the Medi-Cal program. (15 Cal.4th at p. 98.) An existing statute made the counties responsible for treating indigent persons who did not qualify for other aid. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 92.) The result of the state\u2019s exclusion of the MIP population from Medi-Cal was that their care fell to the counties as providers of last resort under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">The opening paragraph of Justice Chin\u2019s opinion in <em>County of San Diego </em>expresses this critical part of the holding. \u201c[W]hen the electorate adopted section 6, the state provided Medi-Cal coverage to these medically indigent <em>adults without requiring financial contributions from counties.\u201d (County of San Diego, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 75, italics added.) This point was amplified in a response to the dissent. \u201cWe do not hold that \u2018whenever there is a change in a state program that has the effect of increasing a county\u2019s financial burden ... there must be reimbursement by the state.\u2019 . . . Rather, we hold that section 6 prohibits the state from shifting to counties the costs of state programs for which the state assumed <em>complete financial responsibility before adoption of section 6.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 99, fn. 20, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>The Counties have ignored the key point in both <em>Lucia Mar </em>and <em>County of San Diego, </em>that in both cases, the state shifted some part of its sole financial responsibility to the local entity. The forced acceptance of that new financial cost implicates section 6. Neither <em>Lucia Mar </em>nor <em>County of San Diego </em>held that subvention would be required for a change in allocation of the percentage of responsibility for a program that has always been jointly funded by state and local governments. The unifying concept in those cases was the transfer of actual costs of a program that had been entirely funded by the state at the time section 6 went into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">In this case, on July 1, 1980, the funding of education in California was still a joint endeavor between the state and local governments, subject to changing allocations of responsibility. \u201cThe system of public school support should effect a partnership between the state, the county, and school districts, with each participating equitably in accordance with its relative ability.\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 14000.) The financing of public schools in California has been, and remains, a complex and sometimes convoluted system of joint responsibility between state and local government. <em>(Butt </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th 668, 679, fn. 11 [describing the Legislature\u2019s complex financing scheme utilizing local property tax revenues and state equalizing payments]; <em>Hayes, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 1525.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Funding for education had not been, and never was fully assumed by the state. As expressed by the court in <em>Sasaki, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th 1442, 1457, \u201cthere is a historical fluidity in the fiscal relationship between local governments and schools. The state has shifted property tax revenue both from schools to local governments, and, as in this case, from local governments to schools. These shifts, including the one presently complained of, have been made in the context of comprehensive legislative planning for the funding of both entities from a variety of sources, including property tax revenue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">Unlike the <em>Lucia Mar </em>and <em>County of San Diego </em>cases, there is no shift in this case from a totally state-supported status to a forced sharing on the part of local government. The state has not imposed responsibility for any program that local governments have not always had a substantial share in supporting. (Accord, <em>City of El Monte, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th 266 <em>[Lucia Mar </em>involved program expenses entirely borne by state].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">The County argues that a number of subvention cases support its contention that the \u201cbedrock\u201d of analysis of any section 6 claim is only whether there was a shift of financial responsibility to local government. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>those other subvention cases, which we discuss next, do not address the issues raised in this case as clearly as <em>Lucia Mar </em>and <em>County of San Diego. </em>Nothing in those cases focuses on a shift of responsibility alone as the keystone of subvention analysis. Rather, the cited cases have turned on other factors. None of the cases found subvention appropriate where the state had not required a local entity to assume financial responsibility for a formerly state funded program. No case holds that changes in the allocation of budgetary amounts to local entities must be offset by subvention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\">The other cases regarding reimbursement do not turn on the existence of a shift in only a portion of a jointly funded program. In <em>Long Beach Unified Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 155 [275 Cal.Rptr. 449], the school district sought reimbursement for the cost of developing desegregation programs. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 164-165.) The court required a specific state mandated action to trigger subvention. The court stated that a mere increase in the cost of providing a service does not trigger reimbursement. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 173.) Similarly, in <em>Hayes v. Commission on State Mandates </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1564 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 547], school districts sought reimbursement for the cost of providing due process hearings in connection with state mandated special education evaluation programs that the districts argued exceeded costs necessitated by federal requirements. (11 Cal.App.4th at p. 1574.) The court determined that a federal mandate would not require state subvention, except \u201c[t]o the extent the state implemented the [federal] act by freely choosing to impose new programs . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1593-1594.) In <em>Redevelopment Agency v. Commission on State Mandates, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th 976, subvention was not appropriate because the financing received by the agency was deemed exempt from section 6. That court also noted that the state was not transferring a program for which it was \u201cformerly legally and financially responsible.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>(Redevelopment Agency, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at pp. 986-987.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>We do not find a single case, statute, or administrative ruling that indicates the shifting of percentage allocations of financial responsibility for joint state and locally funded programs requires reimbursement to the local government whenever it receives less money than it did in the previous budget year. The critical point in the analysis is that school funding in California was, at the time section 6 became effective, a jointly funded partnership between the state and local governments. These joint budget allocations are not subject to section 6. To hold otherwise would impermissibly cripple the ability of the Legislature to function in the critical area of budget planning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">\n<em>Proposition 98 Confers No Right of Subvention on the County</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-6\">An important premise of the County\u2019s argument is that Proposition 98 imposes a requirement that the state may use only funds from the state\u2019s General Fund to satisfy the minimum level of school finance. According to the County, if the state uses any other type of funding to satisfy the minimum amount, it must repay whatever source was used. It is this claimed impermissible use of the revenue not allocated to the County that supports the claim of subvention in this case. The County argues that it can trace the state\u2019s use of the unallocated revenue, through the provisions of Education Code section 41204.5, to a reduction in the Proposition 98 minimum funding amounts, which proves the County\u2019s claim that it was mandated to assume the cost of a program that was previously solely funded by the state.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The reality is that the County has no claim to revenues it never received and has no basis for challenging the state\u2019s methods of allocating funds to other entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-7\">Proposition 98, adopted by the voters in 1988, amended article XVI, section 8 of the California Constitution to provide a minimum level of funding for schools. (Ballot Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 8, 1988) p. 78.) The measure, supported by the California Teachers Association and the state Parent-Teacher Association, set up two tests, later expanded by the passage of Proposition 111 in 1990 to three tests, for determining the mandated minimum funding level for the coming year. <em>(Hayes, supra, 5 </em>Cal.App.4th at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>p. 1519, fn. 2.)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The first formula uses a percentage of General Fund revenues appropriated to schools in fiscal year 1986-1987. The second and third formulas use a measure that includes both General Fund revenues and \u201callocated local proceeds of taxes.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XVI, \u00a7 8, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\">In arguing that Proposition 98 establishes a wholly state-funded program that they have been forced to finance, the Counties misconstrue the impact of Proposition 98. Proposition 98 did not alter the state\u2019s role in education. <em>(Hayes, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 1533.) Proposition 98 does not appropriate funds nor does it result in some mandated county program or higher level of service that the Counties had not previously supported through property tax allocations. The power to appropriate funds was left in the hands of the Legislature. Proposition 98 merely provides the formulas for determining the minimum to be appropriated every budget year. The state\u2019s obligation is to ensure specific amounts of moneys are applied by the state for education. Budgetary decisions that allocate funds to various agencies of the state or political subdivisions cannot be placed in the category of mandates that require subvention. Such decisions, of necessity, impact different agencies of the state or political subdivisions, with some getting more funds as others get less. Sometimes Peter receives more than Paul. We perceive no intent in Proposition 98\u2019s concern for an appropriate level of funding for education that would tie the hands of the Legislature in meeting that goal, particularly in years of low revenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-5\">Furthermore, local governments do not have a claim to a specified portion of the budget in each budget year. We recognize that the trial court found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>that the County had not asserted a claim of entitlement, but the belief in such an entitlement is a necessary foundation for the claim for subvention. The County\u2019s case, stripped to its core complaint, is that the County\u2019s revenue decreased in the challenged years, not that the Legislature found a different way to meet the Proposition 98 funding requirements for schools. Absent some entitlement to the claimed revenues, the County cannot prevail in this action for reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">As noted by the court in <em>San Miguel, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th 134, the plaintiffs there had \u201cno \u2018vested right\u2019 to receive property tax revenues [citation] and no \u2018property interest\u2019 in such revenues [citation] because \u2018as against the state, the county [or district] has no ultimate interest in the property under its care.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 143, italics omitted.) The County in this case argues that <em>San Miguel </em>was based on an erroneous historical analysis. The County notes that <em>San Miguel </em>relied on <em>Conlin </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1893) 99 Cal. 17 [33 P. 753], which predated a 1910 amendment to the Constitution. This reliance, the County contends, reveals the mistaken analysis of the <em>San Miguel </em>court because the 1910 amendment to the Constitution provided for strict separation of state and local revenue. Aside from the fact that one accepted purpose of Proposition 13 was to establish state, as opposed to local, control over local property taxes, the <em>San Miguel </em>court relied on cases as recent as <em>Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>McMahon </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 286 [268 Cal.Rptr. 219], which also made it clear that \u201cas against the state, the County has no \u2018property\u2019 interest in its revenues. \u2018 [A]ll property under the care and control of a county is merely held in trust by the county for the people of the entire state.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 297, italics omitted [county may not challenge state\u2019s aid to families with dependent children funding statute requiring county to contribute to state program].) In <em>Marin Hospital Dist. v. Rothman </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 495 [188 Cal.Rptr. 828], this court rejected an argument that a local agency had a vested right to receive tax revenues. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 501-502.) We agree with the <em>San Miguel </em>court that political subdivisions of the state have no basis for challenging revenue allocations to another agency and no right to receive a particular allocation of tax revenues themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">We also note that even if the Counties prevailed on this argument and the Legislature\u2019s reduction of the General Fund component of the' guaranteed minimum financing to schools was invalidated, the Counties would not receive any payment as a result. The only consequence of invalidation of the change in the state\u2019s General Fund payment would be that the state would be required to pay more to schools in the challenged years, not that a portion of the school\u2019s revenue allocation would be revoked and paid to the Counties. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>This outcome highlights the reality that the Counties have no legally cognizable interest that would entitle them to challenge the Legislature\u2019s manner of funding education. The inclusion of a discussion of Proposition 98 and minimum funding for schools serves only to confuse the issues properly raised in this appeal from a decision ordering subvention for a reduction in revenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">It is clear from the trial court\u2019s opinion that the injection of the Proposition 98 issues into the case obscured the real issues and distorted the outcome below. For example, the trial court framed the issue as being whether \u201cthe state can use property taxes to fulfill its obligation to provide funding for schools from the state general fund.\u201d As discussed, local governments have no interest in invalidating state funding allocations to schools. From this mistaken hypothesis, the court made the erroneous determination that because funding a portion of the school budget is solely the state\u2019s responsibility, a change in the source of the funding of that portion of the school program implicated principles of subvention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">In its review of the County\u2019s claim, the Commission properly focused its inquiry, in conformance with the appropriate narrow construction given to limitations on the Legislature\u2019s taxing powers, on whether the reduction in revenues caused by the ERAF legislation required the Counties to expend tax revenues in support of a state program. <em>(City of El Monte, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th 266 [Prop. 98 not properly before court on subvention appeal].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-6\">Understanding that the argument of the Counties is at once too narrow and too broad is critical to reaching a correct result in light of the need for a narrow construction of limitations on the state\u2019s power to allocate tax revenues. The Counties\u2019 argument is too narrow in that it focuses on one aspect of school finance\u2014the minimum funding of Proposition 98\u2014to claim that education is solely a state funded program. The Counties ignore the larger picture that education is and always has been a jointly funded program. The argument is too broad because it encompasses the whole of the budget process for the questioned years in a misguided attempt to trace the decreased revenues to some impermissible use, rather than focusing on the decrease in revenue to the County. In fact, the Counties never received the disputed revenue, and the Counties have no standing to challenge budget allocations to other entities. The Commission properly limited its review of the subvention claim to the decreased allocation of revenue that resulted from the ERAF legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-7\">\n<em>Home Rule Has Not Been Abolished</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-8\">Returning to an argument considered and rejected in <em>Amador Valley, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 208, <em>City of Rancho Cucamonga v. Mackzum </em>(1991) 228 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>Cal.App.3d 929 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 448], and <em>Sasaki, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th 1442, the County contends that the Legislature\u2019s decrease of its property tax revenues violates principles of home rule.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As all of the referenced cases have concluded, from the time of Proposition 13 to the present, home rule has been limited, but not extinguished. As previously noted, this appeal is solely from a subvention decision and does not properly place before us a challenge to the validity of the state\u2019s actions. Although the issue of reallocation of local property tax revenues and home rule has been definitively discussed in prior cases, we again note them in response to the County\u2019s and amici curiae\u2019s repeated raising of this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">The principle of home rule refers to a local government\u2019s power to control and finance its own local affairs. <em>(Amador Valley, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at pp. 224-225.) In Amador, the court upheld Proposition 13 against a claimed impairment of home rule. The court recognized that a limitation on the ability to levy taxes had a limiting effect on home rule, but stated that nothing in the proposition abrogates home rule \u201cor discloses any intent to undermine or subordinate preexisting constitutional provisions on that subject . . . .\u201d (22 Cal.3d at p. 225.) The key reason that the court found that home rule was not improperly infringed was that the funds at issue in that case were allocated to local agencies on a pro rata basis, \u201cwithout imposing any condition whatever regarding their ultimate use.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 227.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">In <em>City of Rancho Cucamonga </em>v. <em>Mackzum, supra, </em>228 Cal.App.3d 929, the court recognized that \u201cthe purpose of Proposition 13 itself was to achieve statewide control over escalating local property tax rates.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 945.) The court determined that Proposition 13 was a grant of authority to the Legislature to act in an area of statewide concern, and therefore, controlled over the home rule taxing power of charter cities. (228 Cal.App.3d at p. 945.) The court concluded that although the home rule power was limited, it was not repealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-7\">When considering the same objection in relation to the ERAF legislation that supports the claim in this appeal, the court in <em>Sasaki, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th 1442, found that shifting property tax revenues away from local governments did not result in impermissible infringement on the home rule powers. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1457.) Neither the record in this case nor the ERAF legislation suggests that the Legislature has infringed upon the County\u2019s discretionary affairs so as to interfere with the rights of local residents to home rule. We agree with the analysis of the foregoing cases and reject the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>County\u2019s attempt to interpose home rule as a bar to budget allocation decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-5\">The state is not obligated to reimburse local governments for the challenged change in allocation of property tax revenues among local entities. The reallocation of revenue resulting from the challenged legislation imposes no reimbursable cost on local governments and is neither a \u201cnew program\u201d nor a \u201chigher level of service\u201d within the meaning of the Constitution. The Legislature is the proper forum to address those perceived inequities and to seek fiscal relief. The judgment of the superior court is reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a new judgment denying the petition for writ of mandate. In the interests of justice each party should bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-6\">Strankman, P. 1, and Swager, 1, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied December 19, 2000, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.
