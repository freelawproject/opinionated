J.</author>\n<p id=\"ArH\">Joy Oriola appeals from an order dismissing her application for a restraining order against Adam Thaler for lack of jurisdiction under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Domestic Violence Prevention Act (DVPA or the Act) (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6200 et seq.). The Act extends protection to individuals who are or have been in certain relationships with the perpetrator of defined types of abuse, including \u201ca dating or engagement relationship.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a76211, subd. (c).) Appellant contends the trial court erred in finding there was no \u201cdating relationship\u201d between her and respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">.The sole legal question this case presents, which is considerably more difficult than it may first appear, is the meaning of the phrase \u201cdating relationship\u201d as used in the DVPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Statement of the Case and Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">On August 7, 1998, appellant filed an application for a restraining order against respondent under the DVPA. In her application, appellant indicated that she and respondent had had a \u201cdating or engagement relationship\u201d; that respondent had \u201ccaused, threatened, or attempted bodily injury to [her] or another member of [her] household,\u201d \u201cmade [her] or another member of [her] household afraid of physical or emotional harm,\u201d and \u201cstalked\u201d her. She requested restraining and stay-away orders, including staying away from the gym facility to which the parties belonged, as well as attorney fees and reimbursement for gym expenses of $733.20 and lost wages of $1,680.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">In the declaration accompanying her application, appellant stated that she first met appellant during the fall of 1996, at the 24-hour Nautilus gym where they were both members. In November 1996, the parties began to have conversations at the gym and to exchange e-mail correspondence. Initially, the two were attracted to one another. In December, appellant invited respondent to attend a concert with a group of her friends; however, during that occasion she realized she was not interested in him romantically and the next day, over the telephone, told him she just wanted to be friends. She continued to see respondent at the gym and talk to him on the phone. He told her he had recently moved to San Francisco and did not have many friends in the area, and described his break-up with a girlfriend of several years. She told him she would introduce him to some of her friends and other people their age to \u201cexpand his associations.\u201d Over the Christmas holiday, appellant invited respondent to her family\u2019s Christmas dinner. After respondent complained that they always went out with other people and expressed a desire for the two to go out alone, they went together to a Sunday brunch at which respondent talked constantly about his ex-girlfriend and \u201chow alone he felt.\u201d A week later, appellant invited respondent to a friend\u2019s party in order to introduce him to other people.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">According to appellant\u2019s declaration, several days after the party, respondent indicated appellant did not spend enough time with him or make time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>for him as she did for her other friends. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if you started dating another man.\u201d She reminded him she was not interested in establishing a romantic relationship and told him she would be happy to listen if he needed to talk but did not think they should \u201chang out\u201d anymore. For the next several weeks, respondent repeatedly telephoned appellant at home, sometimes talking about how lonely he felt and sometimes relating how upset he was that she did not want to \u201chang out\u201d with him. The calls turned into arguments and appellant told respondent they should cut off their friendship and he should not call her. For several days, respondent called, crying and upset with appellant for terminating their friendship. From January 1997 through the summer of 1997, respondent \u201ccrank called\u201d appellant. She saw him at the gym but did not talk to him. In the summer, he called her at work and said, \u201cI\u2019m so angry. You\u2019re very disrespectful. You\u2019re weak.\u201d She asked what she could do to make him stop being angry and he said, \u201cI won\u2019t stop being angry at you until you no longer exist.\u201d On two occasions, respondent followed appellant when she left the gym to take public transportation, although this was not his regular mode of travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">From late December 1997 through March 1998, appellant received 25 to 40 \u201ccrank calls and hang up calls\u201d per day from respondent, mostly after he saw her at the gym. In February 1998, while the parties were at the gym, appellant inquired how respondent was doing, and he told her, \u201cshut the fuck up.\u201d She told him he had to \u201cstop doing this\u201d and \u201c[i]f you try intimidating me, it would be harassment.\u201d In March, respondent followed appellant into the sauna at the gym, giving her dirty looks. After others in the sauna left, respondent began to \u201chit the bench and bang the walls with his shoulders and elbows.\u201d Appellant told him if he did this again she would assume he was physically threatening her; he hit the walls and bench again. She told him she would report him to the management and he again hit the wall and bench. She reported the matter to the manager. In late March, respondent paged some 45 individuals and left them appellant\u2019s cell phone and work numbers. Also in late March, respondent called appellant at work; when she told him she would take action if he did not stop bothering her, he said, \u201cI have nothing to lose, you asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Afraid respondent would continue to threaten her and might hurt her, appellant made a police report against appellant in early April 1998. She avoided the gym from April until mid-June and then, having not seen respondent for 11 weeks, hoped he would no longer threaten or harass her. On June 15, she went to the gym; respondent was there but did not talk to her. From June 16 until June 30, she received approximately 25 \u201ccrank calls\u201d daily. On or about June 30, appellant received an \u201ce-mail bomb\u201d with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>approximately 263 messages resulting from appellant\u2019s e-mail address having been subscribed to receive crop, livestock and United States Department of Agriculture reports from all 50 states. The overload \u201ccreated a potential shutdown\u201d at appellant\u2019s workplace. Subsequent investigation revealed the e-mail \u201cbomb\u201d had been sent from respondent\u2019s computer at his place of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The initial police report reflecting appellant\u2019s complaint of harassment and threats described appellant as having \u201cbe-friended\u201d respondent and explained to him that she was not interested in him \u201coutside of a platonic relationship,\u201d and reported that appellant \u201cstated there was only a platonic relationship between [respondent] and herself.\u201d This report listed appellant as the suspect\u2019s girlfriend. In a subsequent police department incident report statement, appellant sought to correct \u201cerrors\u201d in the prior report, including that the \u201creporting party relationship is \u2018acquaintance,\u2019 not \u2018girlfriend.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In a supplemental declaration in support of her application for restraining orders, appellant stated that she had never been respondent\u2019s \u201cgirlfriend\u201d but did \u201cbriefly date\u201d him. Appellant explained that when, after the concert date, she told respondent she was not interested in him romantically, she still found him attractive and entertained the possibility they could \u201ccontinue to go out together.\u201d She decided to go out with him a few more times to decide how she felt about him, but after he became \u201cvery possessive of [her] time and [her] space\u201d realized she did not want a relationship with him and told him they should have no further contact. When respondent began to harass and threaten her, she felt embarrassed that she had been attracted to him and felt uncomfortable with the description of her in the police report as respondent\u2019s girlfriend. She asked for correction of the report because she did not want respondent to assume their relationship \u201chad reached that level.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Respondent took the position that the application should be denied because a \u201cplatonic relationship\u201d with an \u201cacquaintance\u201d did not amount to a \u201cdating or engagement relationship\u201d within the meaning of the DVPA; that the restraining orders sought were overbroad; and that the monetary relief appellant sought exceeded that available under the DVPA. Respondent sought attorney fees and restitution for vacation and sick leave he used after being served with appellant\u2019s application at his place of work, without warning, in a humiliating manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Respondent\u2019s declaration stated his recognition of appellant\u2019s desire to have no contact with him and his intention to honor that request. According to respondent, when he began exchanging e-mails with appellant in the summer of 1996, he had a girlfriend of more than four years and was not looking to date anyone else. He and his girlfriend broke up in November 1996. In December, appellant invited respondent to join a group attending a concert; in a subsequent conversation, respondent told appellant about his break-up and said he \u201ccould really use a friend.\u201d Appellant spoke about other men she was dating. Respondent stated that he and appellant \u201cexpressly agreed to be \u2018friends.\u2019 \u201d At appellant\u2019s family Christmas dinner, when someone told the parties to move closer together for a picture, appellant said, \u201cNo, we\u2019re just friends.\u201d Respondent\u2019s declaration stated his desire to be able to use his gym, where his friends were members, and asked that any restraining order entered establish a schedule for the parties\u2019 separate use of the facility rather than prohibiting respondent from all such use.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The parties stipulated that Commissioner Susan B. King could act as temporary judge in this case and a hearing was held on September 2, 1998.. At the hearing, the judge stated that she thought appellant had a \u201cgreat case for a harassment order,\u201d but it was a civil harassment case rather than a domestic violence one. The judge noted that the other relationships enumerated in the DVPA were \u201cspouses, people with whom you\u2019ve had a child, people that you\u2019ve lived with, cohabitants,\u201d and stated that \u201cfour outings in groups in 1996 is not a dating relationship.\u201d The judge suggested treating the case as one for a civil harassment order, but appellant apparently did not wish to pursue that course. After a brief discussion of the parties\u2019 wishes regarding use of the gym, the court concluded it was going to be \u201cimpossible\u201d to work out an order and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, without prejudice to appellant filing a civil harassment case.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">On September 4, 1998, appellant filed a petition for an injunction under Code of Civil Procedure section 527.6.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An order to show cause and temporary restraining order issued on September 4 and was filed on September 8, with a hearing date set for September 18. The order to show cause was served on respondent on September 15. Respondent stipulated to entry of restraining orders which prohibited contacting appellant and required respondent to stay away from the gym during specified hours; appellant agreed to forgo attorney fees and costs regarding this matter. The resulting injunction was filed on September 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>The order dismissing the DVPA case was filed on October 13, 1998, and notice of entry of the order was served on October 15 and filed on October 21. Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal was timely filed on December 11, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The DVPA provides for issuance of orders \u201cto restrain any person for the purpose of preventing a recurrence of domestic violence and ensuring a period of separation of the persons involved, if an affidavit shows, to the satisfaction of the court, reasonable proof of a past act or acts of abuse.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6300.) \u201cDomestic violence\u201d is defined in section 6211 of the DVPA as \u201cabuse perpetrated against any of the following persons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">\u201c(a) A spouse or former spouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">\u201c(b) A cohabitant or former cohabitant, as defined in Section 6209.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">\u201c(c) A person with whom the respondent is having or has had <em>a dating or engagement relationship.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">\u201c(d) A person with whom the respondent has had a child, where the presumption applies that the male parent is the father of the child of the female parent under the Uniform Parentage Act ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-11\">\u201c(e) A child of a party or a child who is the subject of an action under the Uniform Parentage Act, where the presumption applies that the male parent is the father of the child to be protected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-12\">\u201c(f) Any other person related by consanguinity or affinity within the second degree.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">Appellant sought the protection of the DVPA under subdivision (c) of Family Code section 6211. She contends the trial court erred in failing to apply the \u201ceveryday literal meaning of the word \u2018date or dating\u2019 \u201d to find that the parties had a \u201cdating relationship\u201d within the meaning of the statute. She additionally urges the trial court erred in finding that \u201c \u2018only four dates\u2019 \u201d was insufficient to meet the definition of the DVPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">\u201cThe fundamental rule of statutory construction is that a court should ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. <em>(T. M. Cobb Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 273, 277 [204 Cal.Rptr. 143, 682 P.2d 338].) An equally basic rule of statutory construction is that courts are bound to give effect to statutes according to the usual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>and ordinary meaning of the language employed in framing them. <em>(Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224].) Although a court may properly rely upon extrinsic aids, it should first look to the words of the statute to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent. Where the words of the statute are clear, the court should not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history. <em>(California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 698 [170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856].)\u201d <em>(O\u2019Kane </em>v. <em>Irvine </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 207, 211 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 549].)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The DVPA was originally enacted in 1979. (Stats. 1979, ch. 795 \u00a7 10, pp. 2710-2711.) At that time, the Legislature had been advised that legal remedies then available to battered persons\u2014specifically the injunctive relief available under Code of Civil Procedure section 527, subdivision (a), and protective orders then available under the Family Law Act\u2014were ineffective in dealing with domestic violence. A lengthy 1978 Report of the Advisory Commission on Family Law to a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee observed, for example, that the laws then providing for protective orders only addressed the need for immediate protection and included no \u201cspecific authority enabling the courts to grant orders pertaining to other issues which may need to be decided or to other individuals in need of the court\u2019s protection in order to provide comprehensive relief. [\u00b6] Most victims of domestic violence seem to have little, if any, knowledge of the availability of protective orders or the various legal methods of enforcing their rights. [\u00b6] Enforcement of protective orders has been generally nonexistent. This non-enforcement policy is the failure of existing statutes to provide the necessary mandate for law enforcement officers to insure compliance with valid court orders or quick protective action when violations occur. [\u00b6] Given the many problems that interfere with the execution and enforcement of protective orders, it is not surprising that a widely held attitude among attorneys, law enforcement officers and batterers is protective orders are not worth the paper they are printed on.\u201d (Advisory Com. on Family Law, First Report to Sen. Subcom. on Admin. of J. (Oct. 23, 1978) p. 10; <em>Caldwell v. Coppola </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 859 [268 Cal.Rptr. 453].)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">As a result of this and similar advice from other sources, the Legislature inserted in the pertinent law, which now appears in the Family Code, elaborate provisions relating to the issuance and effect of emergency protective orders (Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6250-6257), the duties of law enforcement officers (Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6270-6273), various services for victims of domestic violence, such as the appointment of a \u201csupport person\u201d who can \u201cprovide moral and emotional support for a person who alleges he or she is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>victim of domestic violence\u201d and accompany that person at legal proceedings and mediation sessions (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6303), and the various forms of injunctive and other relief that can be made available (Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6320-6345), including the payment of child support by a presumed father (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6341), restitution for loss of earnings and out-of-pocket expenses (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6342), and attorney fees and costs (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6344). The stated purposes of the foregoing provisions \u201care to prevent the recurrence of acts of violence and sexual abuse and to provide for a separation of the persons involved in the domestic violence for a period sufficient to enable these persons to seek a resolution of the causes of the violence.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6220.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Originally, the DVPA did not protect persons in a \u201cdating relationship.\u201d As first enacted, the DVPA applied only to family members and persons who regularly resided in the household and had sexual relations with another family or household member, or had so resided within the last six months. (Former Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 542, subds. (b), (c); Stats. 1979, ch. 795, \u00a7 10, p. 2711.) The DVPA was soon amended to delete the requirement of a sexual relationship for persons regularly residing in the household (former Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 542, subd. (c); Stats. 1980, ch. 1158, \u00a7 6, p. 3880), and subsequently amended to extend to abuse between parents of a minor child. (Former Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 542, subd. (c); Stats. 1984, ch. 1163, \u00a7 3, pp. 3995-3996.) Finally, as previously noted, the statute was amended to include the present \u201cdating or engagement relationship\u201d language. (Former Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 542, subd. (b)(1); Stats. 1990, ch. 752, \u00a7 2, p. 3409.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">This last language was added in 1990, in a measure (Assem. Bill No. 4000 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.)) sponsored by the Los Angeles City Attorney\u2019s Office. A report on the bill states that \u201c[t]he laws governing eligibility for a restraining order need to be expanded to include the many victims who do not qualify currently as they are not a blood relative, former or current spouse, co-parent, or live-in partner with their abuser. Many cases of domestic violence in a dating relationship must [therefore] be handled through the harassment order [i.e., that available under Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 527.6], which offers less protection and can be a financial burden for petitioners.\u201d (Legis. Analyst, analysis of Assem. Bill No. 4000 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 16, 1990, p. 4.) A Senate committee report on the measure states that expanding coverage of the DVPA to include \u201ca person with whom the respondent has had a child or has had a dating relationship ... is intended to encompass a broad range of modem relationships that may be affected by acts of violence and sexual abuse.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 4000 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) p. 2.) So far as we can tell, the foregoing statements are the only portions of the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>history shedding any light on the reason the protections of the DVPA were extended to persons in a \u201cdating relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The DVPA does not define the phrase \u201cdating or engagement relationship,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the meaning of a \u201cdating relationship\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is not clear enough to delineate the particular meaning the Legislature had in mind when it used these words.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The practice of \u201cdating\u201d evolved in this nation during the 1920\u2019s. (Modell, <em>Dating Becomes the Way of American Youth </em>in Essays on the Family and Historical Change (Moch &amp; Stark edits., 1983) p. 91.) \u201cThe defining characteristic of the new dating system and, what is more critical, of the graduated series of dates that might lead to a closer relationship between young men and women was that a date was away from home, unchaperoned, and not subject to parental veto; it depended upon the free election of the participants. Certainly, <em>some </em>American boys and girls of the middle classes had coupled in every imaginable way without parental awareness before the turn of the century, but \u2018dates\u2019 of this sort lacked the continuity and regularity that the full evolution of the dating system would permit after World War I.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>pp. 92-93, italics in original.) \u201cDating,\u201d it has been said, is \u201ca twentieth-century term for a primarily recreational aspect of courting.\u201d (1 Encyclopedia of Soc\u2019y (1991) p. 333.) \u201cIn twentieth-century America, the new system of dating added new stages to courtship and multiplied the number of partners (from serious to casual) an individual was likely to have before marriage. All this premarital experience necessarily had an impact on the final stages of mate selection. Thus, ... the unattached flirt, the engaged college seniors, the eighth-grade \u2018steadies,\u2019 and the mismatched couple on a blind date are all engaged in courtship.\u201d (Bailey, From Front Porch to Back Seat: Courtship in Twentieth-Century America (1988) p. 6.) It is important to note, finally, that customs, of courtship, and in particular those that relate to \u201cdating,\u201d are not fixed and are constantly changing. (See, e.g., Newcomb, <em>Recent Changes in Attitude Toward Sex and Marriage </em>(1937) 2 Am. Soc. Rev. 659 and Waller, <em>The Rating and Dating Complex </em>(1937) 2 Am. Soc. Rev. 727; cf. Gordon, <em>Was Waller Ever Right? The Rating and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number><em>Dating Complex Reconsidered </em>(1981) 43 J. of Marriage and the Fam. 67, 75 [\u201cNow, even non-competitive, pluralistic dating is giving way to more group-based activity. Young men and women are socializing together in groups as the path that ultimately leads to exclusive, though not necessarily mate choice-oriented, relationships.\u201d]; Miller &amp; Gordon, <em>The Decline in Formal Dating: A Study in Six Connecticut High Schools </em>(1986) 10 Marriage and Fam. Rev. 139 [the \u201cmixed-sex group socializing\u201d that is \u201cseemingly replacing one-on-one couple dating .... gives young people much more room, so to speak, to reject and experiment with various modes of heterosexual interaction .... [and] does not involve the traditional quid pro quo bargain that characterized formal dating.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">While the DVPA \u201cclearly has a broad protective purpose, both in its stated intent and the breadth of the persons protected (see <em>Caldwell v. Coppola, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d 859, 863.)\u201d <em>(O\u2019Kane v. Irvine, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.4th at p. 212), it reflects no legislative intent to extend its protection to <em>all </em>categories of people who have social relationships with one\u2018another (see <em>ibid. </em>[DVPA inapplicable where victim and perpetrator of abuse separately rented rooms in same house, sharing common areas]) or even all the informal socializing relationships that could conceivably be described as \u201cdating.\u201d As reflected in the other categories of relationships enumerated in Family Code section 6211, the DVPA aims to protect individuals from harassment and abuse by people in relationships that involve some measure of exclusivity or at least continuity\u2014spouses, cohabitants, parents and family members. To state the obvious, the problem addressed by the DVPA is <em>domestic </em>violence. \u201cDomestic,\u201d according to the Oxford English Dictionary, <em>supra, </em>means \u201c[o]f or belonging to the home, house, or household; pertaining to one\u2019s place of residence or family affairs; household, home, \u2018family.\u2019 \u201d The \u201cdating relationship\u201d specified in Family Code section 6211, subdivision (c), which appears to be less formal than the \u201cengagement relationship\u201d with which it is associated in that subdivision, is at the outer edge of the relationships covered by the DVPA in terms of intimacy or connection between the individuals involved; whereas the other relationships covered by the DVPA are patently \u201cdomestic,\u201d a \u201cdating\u201d relationship might be viewed as a step toward a potentially domestic relationship. Moreover, the other relationships covered by the DVPA\u2014those between current or former spouses, cohabitants, co-parents, or blood relatives\u2014are more objectively discernible than a \u201cdating relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The parties assume, without discussion, that for purposes of the DVPA a \u201cdating relationship\u201d is simply one in which the parties have a \u201cromantic\u201d interest in one another, and that this excludes relationships in which the mutual interest, or perhaps even the interest of just one party, is \u201cplatonic.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>The parties disagree only as to whether their past relationship was, in fact, \u201cromantic\u201d or \u201cplatonic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">We have no quarrel with the proposition that a \u201cdating relationship\u201d ordinarily refers to a \u201cromantic,\u201d as opposed to a \u201cplatonic\u201d relationship between two people, as those words are today commonly understood.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, while contemporary or classical concepts of romantic and platonic love can sometimes be judicially relevant (see, e.g., Nussbaum, <em>Platonic Love and Colorado Law: The Relevance of Ancient Greek Norms to Modern Sexual Controversies </em>(1994) 80 Va. L.Rev. 1515; Posner, Sex and Reason (1992) p. 1), the concepts are too abstract to provide useful guidance in judicial fact finding. More importantly, an unlimited inquiry into the \u201cromantic\u201d or \u201cplatonic\u201d nature of a relationship could frustrate the remedial purposes of the DVPA. One of the circumstances a court might seize upon to determine whether a particular relationship was \u201cromantic\u201d or \u201cplatonic,\u201d because it may be thought to mark the difference, is the sexual intimacy of the parties, if any, or the degree of any such intimacy. Such an inquiry would be of questionable validity, however, as human experience teaches that sexual intimacy does not necessarily reflect a romantic interest (see, e.g., Huxley, Point Counter Point (1928) [\u201cHe had such a pure, childlike and platonic way of going to bed with women, that neither they nor he ever considered that the process really counted as going to bed.\u201d]) and a romantic relationship need not involve sexual intimacy. (As, e.g., the relationship between Jake Barnes and Brett Ashley in Ernest Hemingway\u2019s 1926 novel, The Sun Also Rises; see also Austen, Sense and Sensibility (1811).) Though the two are certainly not incompatible, neither is the one necessary to the other. Moreover, if sexual intimacy were deemed a relevant indicator of romantic interest, what level of intimacy would have to be shown? Would a kiss be enough or would something more be required and, if so, what?</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The graver danger presented by the simplistic proposition that a \u201cdating relationship\u201d is one involving a certain level of physical intimacy is that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>need to establish such past intimacy in a public forum in order to obtain relief under the DVPA would almost certainly discourage many from seeking the relief that Act affords, though they be desperately in need of it. The amorous intentions or sexual expectations of the parties are undoubtedly important characteristics of a \u201cdating relationship,\u201d but the definition of such a relationship cannot be made to depend on the past sexual intimacies of the parties or the nature of such intimacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The failure of the Legislature to define the nature of the \u201cdating relationship\u201d it had in mind creates a daunting judicial problem. \u201cDating\u201d can signify so many different types of relationships\u2014some clearly within the ambit of the DVPA, some clearly not (see, e.g., <em>People v. Elliott </em>(1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 659 [50 Cal.Rptr. 757])\u2014that we must find some place to draw the line. Whatever the \u201cdating relationship\u201d contemplated by the Legislature may be, however, it relates to a state of mind; a sentiment different people experience in different ways and in different degrees, and for which, in truth, there are no reliable objective measurements to help identify the place at which to draw the necessary line. Therefore, as no judicial attempt to compass the human mind can fully succeed, we can devise no completely satisfactory definition of the \u201cdating relationship\u201d the Legislature contemplated. Our hope is only to provide a more useful touchstone than that provided by the language of the Act. In the event the Legislature disagrees with the meaning we impute to its words, we hope and expect it will correct us.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">We commence our exegetical enterprise by looking to the law of other jurisdictions that have addressed the problem. Domestic violence prevention statutes in many other states employ language similar to that found in Family Code section 6211, subdivision (c). (E.g., Ala. Code \u00a7 15-10-3(b)(3) [\u201cdating or engagement relationship\u201d] [Alabama]; Alaska Stat. \u00a7 18.66.990(5)(C) [\u201care dating or have dated\u201d] [Alaska]; 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. \u00a7 5/112A-3(3) [\u201cdating or engagement relationship\u201d] [Illinois]; Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 209A, \u00a7 1(e) [\u201csubstantive dating relationship\u201d] [Massachusetts]; Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 600.2950 (1) [Michigan]; Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 45-5-206(2)(b) [\u201cdating or ongoing intimate relationship with a person of the opposite sex\u201d] [Montana]; Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 33.018(2) [\u201cdating relationship\u201d] [Nevada]; N.J. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 2C:25-19(d) [\u201cdating relationship\u201d] [New Jersey]; N.D. Cent. Code \u00a7 14-07.1-01(4) [\u201cdating relationship\u201d] [North Dakota]; R.I. Gen. Laws 1956, \u00a7 8-8.1-1(3) [\u201csubstantive dating or engagement relationship within the past six (6) months\u201d] [Rhode Island]; Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-3-601(9)(C) [\u201cwho are dating or who have dated\u201d] [Tennessee]; Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 10.99.020(1) [\u201cdating relationship\u201d] [Washington]; W.Va. Code \u00a7 48-2A-2(b) [\u201cpersons who . . . are or were dating\u201d] dated\u201d] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>[West Virginia].) A few of these statutes, unlike the DVPA, contain express definitions of the term \u201cdating relationship.\u201d Thus, the Illinois statute provides that \u201cneither a casual acquaintanceship nor ordinary fraternization between 2 individuals in business or social contexts shall be deemed to constitute a dating relationship.\u201d (725 Ill. Comp. Stat. \u00a7 5/112A-3(3).) In Michigan, \u201c \u2018Dating relationship\u2019 means frequent, intimate associations primarily characterized by the expectation of affectional involvement. This term does not include a casual relationship or an ordinary fraternization between 2 individuals in a business or social context.\u201d (Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 600.2950(30)(a).) In Nevada, \u201c \u2018dating relationship\u2019 means frequent, intimate associations primarily characterized by the expectation of affectional or sexual involvement. The term does not include a casual relationship or an ordinary association between persons in a business or social context.\u201d (Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 33.018.) The Tennessee definitions of \u201cdating\u201d and \u201cdated\u201d similarly \u201cdo not include fraternization between two (2) individuals in a business or social context.\u201d (Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-3-601(9)(C).) Under the Washington statute, \u201c \u2018[d]ating relationship\u2019 means a social relationship of a romantic nature. Factors that the court may consider in making this determination include: (a) The length of time the relationship has existed; (b) the nature of the relationship; and (c) the frequency of interaction between the parties.\u201d (Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 26.50.010(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The above statutory definitions limit the term \u201cdating relationship\u201d not just by requiring some showing of \u201caffectional involvement\u201d but by excluding casual social relationships. Massachusetts case law similarly limits the reach of that state\u2019s \u201csubstantive dating relationship\u201d language. In one case, considering the scope of the \u201cdating\u201d relationship as relevant to a determination of probable cause in a criminal case, the court explained, \u201cMass.Gen.L.Ch. 209A exists to enable victims of domestic violence to distance themselves from their batterers. ... [\u00b6] The \u2018substantive dating relationship\u2019 language of the statute is clearly a proxy for a close domestic relationship between an individual living with, or near, another.\u201d <em>(White v. Town of Marblehead </em>(D.Mass. 1997) 989 F.Supp. 345, 351-352, fn. 8.) In another case, the court rejected the contention that the victim could not be in a \u201csubstantive dating relationship\u201d with the perpetrator because she was living with a different man at the time, noting that the perpetrator referred to the victim as a former girlfriend, saw her several times a week, had been sexually active with her, and revealed in his personal correspondence \u201can emotional relationship which entailed substantially more than a few casual dates.\u201d <em>(Brossard </em>v. <em>West Roxbury Dist. Court </em>(1994) 417 Mass. 183 [629 N.E.2d 295, 296].)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Because they all relate to statutes similar to the DVPA, the foregoing legislative and judicial definitions of \u201cdating relationship\u201d are instructive as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>to what the California Legislature most likely had in mind by its use of that phrase. Adopting the sense of those legislative and judicial prescriptions, and in light of the other classes of persons protected by our Legislature under the DVPA, we conclude that, for purposes of the Act, a \u201cdating relationship\u201d refers to serious courtship. It is a social relationship between two individuals who have or have had a reciprocally amorous and increasingly exclusive interest in one another, and shared expectation of the growth of that mutual interest, that has endured for such a length of time and stimulated such frequent interactions that the relationship cannot be deemed to have been casual.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">We do not think there ever was such a continuing and mutually committed emotional relationship between the parties before us. Appellant and respondent went on four social outings (on only one of which they were alone) and had telephone conversations, e-mail correspondence and contacts at the gym for a period of several months. Immediately after their first date, however, appellant told respondent she was not interested in a romantic relationship with him; their relationship was relatively brief and never exclusive, at least insofar as appellant was concerned, and respondent was immediately disabused of any expectation that an exclusive romantic relationship might be established. The police report resulting from appellant\u2019s complaint about respondent\u2019s harassment stated that appellant described her relationship with respondent as \u201cplatonic\u201d and indicated she had conveyed this sentiment to respondent. Appellant specifically corrected the police report\u2019s listing of her as appellant\u2019s \u201cgirlfriend,\u201d stating she should be referred to as an \u201cacquaintance.\u201d Respondent\u2019s declaration confirms that the parties expressly agreed to be no more than \u201cfriends\u201d and relates appellant\u2019s having reiterated this point by telling her family at the Christmas dinner that she and respondent were \u201cjust friends.\u201d The prospect of a \u201cdating relationship\u201d was, in short, quashed almost at the outset.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">This finding does not leave appellant without any relief. It must be remembered that finding the DVPA inapplicable to a given instance of harassment or abuse does not leave the victim without remedy, as he or she can seek a temporary restraining order and injunction under Code of Civil Procedure section 527.6. This is precisely what the trial court suggested in the present case, and what appellant did after dismissal of the application under the DVPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">One of the chief differences between the relief available to appellant under Code of Civil Procedure section 527.6 and that potentially available under the DVPA is that the DVPA authorizes the court to order restitution \u201cfor loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>of earnings and out-of-pocket expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses for medical care and temporary housing, incurred as a direct result of the abuse inflicted by the respondent or any actual physical injuries sustained from the abuse.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6342.) The potential for such restitution is presumably the reason appellant chose to proceed under the DVPA even after obtaining the injunctive relief she sought under a different statute. It is also the only reason this entire appeal is not moot, injunctive relief having been obtained despite the adverse ruling of the trial court. Having concluded the trial court correctly dismissed the application under the DVPA for lack of jurisdiction, we need not determine whether appellant would in fact have been entitled to any or all of the restitution she sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Respondent seeks sanctions against appellant and her attorney, claiming the appeal is frivolous and arguing that appellant and her attorney improperly used legal procedures to harass and impose undue expense upon respondent, twice serving him in an unduly humiliating manner and taking advantage of respondent\u2019s attorney\u2019s vacation to schedule the hearing on the Code of Civil Procedure section 527.6 restraining order while he was unavailable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Respondent argues the appeal is frivolous by characterizing it as raising solely an impossible-to-win substantial evidence issue. According to respondent, the only question for us to decide on the appeal is whether substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the parties did not have a \u201cdating relationship.\u201d We disagree. No California case has previously construed the provision of the DVPA here at issue. This appeal required us to resolve a legal question\u2014definition of a \u201cdating relationship\u201d\u2014and not merely to evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u201c[A]n appeal should be held to be frivolous only when it is prosecuted for an improper motive\u2014to harass the respondent or delay the effect of an adverse judgment\u2014or when it indisputably has no merit\u2014when any reasonable attorney would agree that the appeal is totally and completely without merit.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Flaherty </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 637, 650 [183 Cal.Rptr. 508, 646 P.2d 179] <em>(Flaherty); </em>see <em>Estate of Walters </em>(1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 552, 558-559 [222 P.2d 100].) Litigants and attorneys, however, have a right to present issues that are \u201carguably correct\u201d even if they do not ultimately prevail. <em>(Flaherty, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 650;) \u201c[A]n appeal that is simply without merit is not by definition frivolous and should not incur sanctions.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics omitted.) As <em>Flaherty </em>explained, because \u201c \u2018the borderline between a frivolous appeal and one which simply has no merit is vague indeed,\u2019 \u201d the power to dismiss frivolous appeals should be exercised in only the \u201cclearest cases\u201d and the power to punish attorneys for prosecuting frivolous appeals \u201cshould be used most sparingly to deter only the most egregious conduct.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 651.)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">While we have rejected appellant\u2019s position on this appeal, we cannot say the appeal was frivolous. Respondent attempts to portray appellant as having acted in bad faith, stressing her reluctance to informally resolve the restraining order issue as well as the timing of her application for the civil restraining order and service of the order to show cause and the manner in which respondent was served with process in both the DVPA and civil harassment cases. This appeal, however, did raise a legitimate issue; indeed, definition of the scope of the DVPA by clarifying the meaning of the phrase \u201cdating relationship\u201d will affect cases other than this one. Additionally, while the fact that appellant is presently protected by the Code of Civil Procedure section 527.6 restraining order renders the appeal irrelevant on the issue of injunctive relief, appellant believed she stood to gain financially from the appeal through her claim for restitution under the DVPA. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that this appeal was pursued solely to harass respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The trial court\u2019s order dismissing the application for injunctive and other relief under the DVPA is affirmed.
