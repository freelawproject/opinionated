S.), P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) found that petitioner, Josephine Martinez, failed to participate in vocational rehabilitation (VR) until more than five years from the date of injury and more than one year from the last adjudication of permanent disability. Although Martinez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>had timely requested VR, the WCAB concluded benefits were barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Martinez maintains that jurisdiction for VR benefits continues once properly established, absent an intervening contrary order by the WCAB. We agree, and annul and remand the WCAB\u2019s decision for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">Josephine Martinez, a master electronic assembler for Hughes Aircraft Company (Hughes), sustained injury to her back and left knee on May 11, 1994, and from August of 1980 to July 22, 1994. When Martinez filed an application for adjudication of claim (application) for each injury, she designated VR as an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">In a medical report dated May 8, 1996, by the treating doctor, work restrictions were imposed and Martinez was declared medically eligible for VR.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">On January 13, 1998, Martinez was awarded 60 percent permanent disability by a workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ). After a petition for reconsideration by Hughes was denied by the WCAB and the decision became final, Martinez requested VR by letter to Hughes dated June 4, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">Shortly thereafter, Career Works was assigned to facilitate development of VR. However, Martinez apparently had personal problems and VR was placed on hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">In a letter dated November 24, 1998, Career Works indicated authorization had been given to recontact Martinez regarding VR. Martinez responded she was interested, but desired to wait until the beginning of next year.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-13\">A January 19, 1999, meeting between Martinez and Career Works was rescheduled in writing for October 1, 1999. After Martinez met with Career Works, she demanded weekly benefits, which was rejected by Hughes based on the statute of limitations even though there had never been a request for closure or an act of closure by the Rehabilitation Unit (RU) of the WCAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">Martinez then filed for dispute resolution with the RU. The RU ruled in favor of Martinez, partly because Hughes failed to provide any opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>Hughes appealed the RU\u2019s determination to the WCJ. Hughes set forth that Labor Code sections 5410<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 5405.5<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> controlled. Although Hughes conceded Martinez had timely requested VR, Hughes contended that the failure to participate until more than five years from the date of injury and more than one year from the last finding of permanent disability barred benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Hughes further alleged Martinez could not interrupt VR without agreement or approval of the administrative director, according to section 4644, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, Hughes asserted closure was irrelevant because Martinez failed to perform any of the conditions allowing termination of liability under section 4644, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">At trial, counsel for Martinez argued that the initial demand for VR was within the statute of limitations periods, and without a request or RU order for termination further demand for benefits beyond the statutory periods was still timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">The WCJ found Hughes no longer had liability for VR because there was \u201c. . . no actual attempt to participate in vocational rehabilitation services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>until October 1, 1999, a date well outside the 5 year period from the date of injury and more than one year from the date of the last finding of permanent disability by the Board in this matter.\u201d In the opinion on decision the WCJ agreed with Hughes that since Martinez could not unilaterally interrupt VR pursuant to section 4644, subdivision (b), and due to her actions closure could not occur according to section 4644, subdivision (a), participation in VR beginning after the statute of limitations periods was barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">Martinez petitioned the WCAB for reconsideration. Martinez alleged she could unilaterally interrupt VR under California Code of Regulations, title 8, section 10129.1 (hereafter title 8, section 10129.1), subdivision (b),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Hughes did not object or request termination. Since the initial request for VR was admittedly timely and there was no intervening order by the RU divesting jurisdiction,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Martinez urged she remained eligible for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">In the report on reconsideration the WCJ restated the reasons for the ' decision and recommended denial of the petition. The WCAB agreed with the WCJ and denied reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">Martinez petitioned this court for review. Martinez further alleges jurisdiction was timely invoked under section 5405.5 by her June 4, 1998, VR request, and a petition to reopen under section 5410<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was unnecessary without prior RU action as indicated by <em>Youngblood </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 764 [265 Cal.Rptr. 211].</p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>In <em>Youngblood, </em>section 5405.5 was interpreted as allowing only an \u201cinitial\u201d VR request beyond five years from the date of injury but within one year of the last finding of permanent disability. <em>(Youngblood </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d at p. 772.) However, an adverse adjudication of VR within five years from the date of injury, and not pleading VR in a petition to reopen which was resolved, precluded a VR request by letter to the employer, more than five years from the date of injury but within one year of last finding of permanent disability, from being an \u201cinitial\u201d request. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 773-775.)</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">In addition, Martinez continues to assert Hughes\u2019s approval of interruption was not mandatory, however, under title 8, section 10129.1, subdivision (a)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> because services, or a VR plan, was not provided. Martinez also alleges Hughes accepted interruption by not requesting dispute resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Hughes has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"A9Re\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">The facts in this case are not in dispute. Therefore, application of sections 5410 and 5405.5 to established facts is a matter of law subject to de novo judicial review. <em>(Granco Steel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 191 [65 Cal.Rptr. 287, 436 P.2d 287].)</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">It is also well recognized that entitlement to VR is one of the most important benefits under the Labor Code. (\u00a7 4635 et seq.; <em>Estrada </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1458 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 176]; <em>Sanchez v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 346 [266 Cal.Rptr. 21].) Section 3202 provides that courts should liberally construe, with the purpose of extending benefits, matters which govern all aspects of workers\u2019 compensation. <em>(Arriaga v. County of Alameda </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 1055 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 116, 892 P.2d 150].) This policy is particularly compelling policy where the right to VR is at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">II. <em>Compliance with Section 5410 or 5405.5</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">In this case VR was initially raised as an issue in the applications, followed by an award of other benefits. We need not decide, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>whether compliance with section 5410 and a petition to reopen were necessary, if Martinez alternatively complied with section 5405.5. <em>(Sanchez </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>217 Cal.App.3d 346, and <em>O\u2019Loughlin </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1518 [272 Cal.Rptr. 499].)</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">This determination turns on whether the June 4, 1998, request for VR to Hughes was an \u201cinitial\u201d request as addressed by <em>Youngblood v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d 764. In <em>Roberts v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 631 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 576], an injured worker waited to file for VR with the RU more than five years from the date of injury, but within one year of the last finding of permanent disability. Previously, the employee designated VR as an issue on the application, and then demanded VR from the employer before and after five years from the date of injury. The court held that since there had been no adjudication of VR prior to filing with the RU, the filing was the \u201cinitial\u201d request and timely under section 5405.5. <em>(Roberts, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.4th at p. 638.)</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">In <em>Visalia School Dist. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1211 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 696], the injured worker originally raised VR as an issue on the application and called the claims examiner and requested VR more than five years from the date of injury, but within one year of the last finding of permanent disability. The court held that the phone call was sufficient to satisfy section 5405.5 considering the statute is not specific and the WCAB rules allow such contact. (40 Cal.App.4th at p. 1227.) The court further found that a written request or filing with the RU was not the exclusive means to request VR. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">In this case there was no prior adjudication of VR before the June 4, 1998, request, which was within one year of the January 13, 1998, last finding of permanent disability. Since Hughes and the WCJ conceded the request was timely, and section 5405.5 does not state how VR must be requested, we find that writing the employer is sufficient under section 5405.5 and filing with the RU is not essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">Furthermore, section 5405.5 only limits the time to initially request VR, and not the period for completion. Therefore, it was erroneous to require participation by Martinez within one year of the last finding of permanent disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">III. <em>Compliance with Section 5405.5 Notwithstanding VR Interruption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">Similarly, a timely VR request does not somehow become untimely solely because interruption ends beyond the limitations period of section 5405.5. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>Thus, we do not have to decide whether Martinez could unilaterally interrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Nor do we agree Hughes was powerless to avoid waiting indefinitely. Hughes could have attempted VR termination under section 4644, subdivision (a). In our view, unreasonably not pursuing a VR plan is part of unreasonably failing to complete a plan. Therefore, Hughes could have unilaterally pursued termination, but did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">The decision of the WCAB is annulled and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">Epstein, J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Labor Code section 5410 states in relevant part: \u201cNothing in this chapter shall bar the right of any injured worker to institute proceedings for the collection of compensation, including vocational rehabilitation services, within five years after the date of the injury upon the ground that the original injury has caused new and further disability or that the provision of vocational rehabilitation services has become feasible because the employee\u2019s medical condition has improved or because of other factors not capable of determination at the time the employer\u2019s liability for vocational rehabilitation services otherwise terminated.

The interruption shall be for an agreed upon period of time. If the employee had previously agreed to a plan at the time of interruption, the claims administrator shall provide the notice specified in Section 9813(a)(4).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b949-10\">Examples of cases where RU actions divested jurisdiction are: <em>Langford </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp.
