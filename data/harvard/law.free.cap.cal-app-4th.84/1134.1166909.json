In the DMV\u2019s appeal of this ruling, the issue presented is whether a school bus driver, who submitted a purportedly adulterated urine specimen in a random drug test, is entitled to a hearing before the DMV, prior to the revocation of her school bus driver\u2019s certificate. We conclude the driver is entitled to a prerevocation hearing, and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">Menge was a school bus driver employed by the San Ramon Valley Unified School District (District). She was required to possess, and did possess, a California school bus certificate issued by the DMV. (See Veh. Code, \u00a7 12517, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Menge was also obligated to comply with the controlled substances and alcohol use and testing requirements set forth in section 382.101 et seq. of title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 34520, subd. (a).) Section 382.211 of title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations mandates such drivers to submit to random testing for alcohol or controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">The District subjected Menge to a random drug test, administered by National Medical Review Offices, Inc. (NMRO), on February 18, 1999. It was determined that Menge\u2019s urine sample was unsuitable for testing due to the presence of nitrate, an adulterant. When the District learned of the test results, it placed her on administrative leave, with pay, and scheduled a <em>Shelly </em>hearing for March 10, 1999.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Menge did not attend this hearing, reserving her right to appeal any decision that her employment be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>By letter dated March 10, 1999, the District next notified Menge of its intention to recommend that the State Board of Education (Board) terminate her employment as a school bus driver, on the ground that she falsified information, acted dishonestly, and willfully violated the Education Code or Board rules, based on the allegedly adulterated urine sample. The letter, quoting from a ruling of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), advised that an adulterated specimen constituted a refusal to test, and the donor therefore had no right to test a split specimen or retest the primary specimen. Menge was placed on administrative leave, without pay, pending Board action at its meeting on March 30, 1999, and advised of her right to request a hearing before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">At some point, Menge contacted the District to inquire whether her urine specimen could be retested, and she was told to contact the NMRO. The NMRO advised her that the specimen could not be made available for retesting. The NMRO forwarded a copy of the test result, which read in part: \u201cSpecimen Adulterated.\u201d Menge then elected not to attend the March 30 meeting before the Board, but instead resigned from her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Upon learning of the results of Menge\u2019s test report, the DMV, on March 31, issued an order of revocation of Menge\u2019s school bus certificate, effective April 15, 1999, on the ground that her adulterated specimen constituted a refusal to test under title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations. (49 C.F.R. \u00a7 382.107 (1999).) The DMV order erroneously cited section 13376, subdivision (b)(1), which pertains to testing positive on a drug or alcohol test. The order also informed Menge she was not entitled to a hearing because the DMV\u2019s revocation was mandatory under the Vehicle Code, but she could nevertheless seek court review of the order by filing a petition for a writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">Menge filed a petition for writ of administrative mandate in the superior court, seeking to compel the DMV to reinstate her certificate. In its written order, the trial court noted that the DMV was not \u201cremiss\u201d in revoking Menge\u2019s certificate, because the DMV was \u201crequired to do so by the Legislature of this state.\u201d The court nonetheless granted Menge\u2019s petition, to the extent of commanding the DMV to set aside its order of revocation. The trial court found that Menge \u201cwas deprived of due process: the system of testing and reporting in place here does not allow persons such as [Menge] to challenge the validity of the process by which they are stripped of their professional license.\u201d In particular, the court was disturbed by the federal regulation denying Menge access to the split sample, and believed the hearings offered by the District and Board provided no realistic opportunity to challenge the NMRO report.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">The DMV argues: (1) the writ compels the DMV to perform an act that violates federal regulations, section 34520 (which mandates obedience to the Code of Federal Regulations) and public policy; (2) Menge had a meaningful opportunity to challenge the test results; (3) Menge waived her right to assert a due process violation when she elected not to attend the hearings before the District and the Board; and (4) Menge pursued the wrong party, because the DMV does not control the evidence of the adulterated sample and is merely an \u201cinnocent bystander.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">Whether the DMV\u2019s administrative procedures comply with due process is a question of law, and we review the trial court\u2019s determination of that question de novo. We accept as conclusive the trial court\u2019s factual findings if supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Clark v. City of Hermosa Beach </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1169 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 223].)</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">B. <em>Does the Order Compel the DMV to Violate the Law?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">As mentioned <em>ante, </em>school bus drivers must comply with the controlled substances and alcohol use and testing requirements of title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations. (\u00a7 34520, subd. (a).) Those regulations prohibit such drivers from using alcohol and controlled substances while on duty, as well as for certain periods before and after duty. They also require employers to impose on their drivers random testing for alcohol and controlled substances, and require drivers to submit to the testing. (49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 382.201-382.215 (1999).) Under the regulations, \u201cNo driver shall refuse to submit to ... a random alcohol or controlled substances test required under [section] 382.305.\u201d (49 C.F.R. \u00a7 382.211 (1999).) A driver is deemed to refuse to submit to an alcohol or controlled substances test if she fails to provide an adequate urine sample or \u201c[e]ngages in conduct that clearly obstructs the testing process.\u201d (49 C.F.R. \u00a7 382.107 (1999).)</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">Federal regulations relating to the testing of school bus drivers for alcohol and controlled substances \u201cpreempt[] any State or local law, rule, regulation, or order to the extent that: [\u00b6] (1) Compliance with both the State or local requirement and this part is not possible; or [\u00b6] (2) Compliance with the State or local requirement is an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of any requirement in this part.\u201d (49 C.F.R. \u00a7 382.109 (1999).)</p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">The DMV argues that, by requiring the DMV to reinstate Menge\u2019s certificate, the trial court\u2019s action presents \u201can obstacle to the accomplishment and execution\u201d of the federal regulations. (49 C.F.R. \u00a7 382.109 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>(1999).) These regulations, however, do not address the process by which the DMV issues or revokes a school bus certificate. Nor do they forbid the DMV from affording a hearing to a driver whose school bus certificate has been revoked. In this regard, the trial court\u2019s issuance of the writ does not conflict with federal regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">The DMV also takes the position that the action taken by the lower court is contrary to public policy, because of the government\u2019s overriding interest in regulating the conduct of its employees and ensuring public safety. The DMV\u2019s position, however, presupposes that Menge\u2019s urine sample <em>was </em>adulterated and the trial court excused Menge from the consequences. The trial court did not condone the adulteration of urine specimens or allow Menge to escape the ramifications of adulterating her sample. Instead, it found fault with the <em>process </em>which precluded Menge from contesting the conclusion that her sample was, in fact, adulterated.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">For that reason, the DMV\u2019s reliance on <em>Doyle v. Board of Supervisors </em>(1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1358 [243 Cal.Rptr. 572], and <em>Swan </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission </em>(1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 710 [94 Cal.Rptr. 236], is misplaced. Neither decision has any bearing upon the issue before us, since the issuance of the writ of mandate does not compel the performance of acts which were unlawful, contrary to public policy, or in conflict with federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">C. <em>Opportunity to Challenge Determination of Adulterated Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">In ruling that Menge had no meaningful opportunity to challenge the determination that she adulterated her drug test, the lower court\u2019s notice of decision placed considerable reliance upon <em>Rios v. Cozens </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 792 [103 Cal.Rptr. 299, 499 P.2d 979] <em>(Rios).</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Sections 16000-16553 required any driver who was in an accident involving bodily injury or property damage over $200 to file an accident report. Based on the reports of the involved parties, the DMV would decide whether there was credible evidence of potential culpability on the part of one of the drivers and, if so, it would suspend the license of that driver, without a hearing. Our Supreme Court held that due process required a presuspension hearing\u2014even though the statutes mandated that suspension orders be issued without a hearing\u2014in light of the magnitude of a person\u2019s significant interest in retaining his driver\u2019s license and use of his vehicle. <em>(Rios, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 795.)</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>The DMV attempts to distinguish <em>Rios </em>from the matter at hand, because in <em>Rios </em>the DMV was required to form an opinion on culpability after reviewing reports, while here the DMV simply reads the NMRO report. The DMV contends the instant case is therefore governed instead by <em>Thomas v. Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 335 [90 Cal.Rptr. 586, 475 P.2d 858] <em>(Thomas), </em>in which our Supreme Court held that the DMV could revoke a driver\u2019s license based on an abstract of judgment showing prior DUI convictions, without permitting the driver to challenge the validity of the convictions before the DMV. (See also <em>Larsen </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 278 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 151, 906 P.2d 1306].)</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">In the matter we review, the DMV\u2019s role falls somewhere between the quasi-adjudicatory function in <em>Rios </em>(warranting a hearing) and the administrative reliance on an abstract of judgment in <em>Thomas </em>(not warranting a hearing). For several reasons, we view its role as more analogous to the function in <em>Rios. </em>First, although the DMV \u201cshall\u201d revoke the certificate under section 13370, subdivision (a)(3) if the holder \u201cfailed to meet prescribed testing or training requirements,\u201d the DMV <em>must first </em>make a factual determination whether the licensee actually failed to meet those testing requirements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As applicable here, the DMV must decide whether the driver in fact adulterated the specimen. (49 C.F.R. \u00a7 382.107 (1999).) Its duty is not, therefore, entirely mandatory in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Second, the abstract of judgment in <em>Thomas </em>recorded the outcome of a criminal proceeding, in which the defendant had an opportunity to be heard and to contest the charges before judgment was entered. By contrast, the NMRO report is merely a test result recorded at a laboratory on behalf of a state agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">Third, the licensee in <em>Thomas </em>had the further opportunity to challenge the convictions, after they were entered, before the court in which they arose. Menge, on the other hand, had no such meaningful opportunity to challenge the NMRO report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>The DMV, however, contends Menge was offered the opportunity to challenge the test result in a <em>Skelly </em>hearing before the District and again before the Board. In those forums, it is argued, Menge could have challenged the finding that she had adulterated the sample by presenting character evidence or other evidence tending to prove she had not adulterated the sample. The DMV makes no showing, however, that any action which could have been taken at either the <em>Skelly </em>or Board hearings would have had any effect on the DMV\u2019s decision to revoke Menge\u2019s certificate, particularly given the DMV\u2019s insistence that revocation is <em>mandatory </em>upon receipt of the NMRO report. Unlike the successful attack against the judgment of a criminal conviction, nothing in this record suggests that a successful attack upon the NMRO report before the District or Board would lead to a reversal of the NMRO\u2019s findings, since the DMV fails to show that any such action by District or Board would be communicated to the DMV. Nor has it even been shown that a <em>Skelly </em>hearing or Board hearing would necessarily occur <em>before </em>the DMV took action on the NMRO report. Indeed, at oral argument the Attorney General requested that we urge the Legislature to make binding on the DMV any Board ruling either upholding or overturning the result of such testing. This request leads us to conclude that any finding by the Board that the test result was inaccurate or insufficient would do nothing to spare the school bus driver from the revocation of her certificate. At present, the results of hearings before the District and the Board have no bearing upon the action the DMV believes it must take.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Given Menge\u2019s significant interest in being certified to pursue her chosen vocation of school bus driver, due process requires that she be afforded a hearing at which evidence may be presented challenging the test result. In the absence of any hearing before the District or Board that is binding on the DMV, a prerevocation hearing must be provided by the DMV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">D. <em>Waiver</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">The DMV contends that Menge waived her right to assert a due process challenge to the revocation of her certificate because she chose not to attend the hearings before the District and the Board. The issue before the District and the Board, however, involved Menge\u2019s employment with a particular school district only. The distinct issue before the DMV was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>whether her certificate would be revoked, thus precluding her from driving a school bus anywhere in California. Although Menge voluntarily relinquished her right to challenge the termination of her employment by failing to appear at the Board hearing, it cannot be said she voluntarily relinquished her right to challenge the process by which the DMV would ultimately revoke her certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Of course, a hearing before the Board would have undoubtedly addressed the test result. Nevertheless, Menge\u2019s decision not to challenge the test result before the Board could not possibly waive her right to challenge the test result in connection with the revocation of her certificate, since the record does not support a finding that the Board would communicate the results of any such hearing to the DMV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">The cases on which the DMV relies are inapposite. In <em>Hawthorne Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Signal Hill </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 148, 156, fn. 2 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 272], the appealing party waived an issue by failing to raise it during the hearing which was the subject of the appeal. Here, on the other hand, Menge brought before the trial court the very issue she now raises on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\"><em>Stenson </em>v. <em>Kerlikowske </em>(W.D.N.Y., June 10, 1999, No. 98-CV-0316E(H)) 1999 U.S.Dist. Lexis 9288 <em>(Stenson), </em>is an opinion designated only for electronic publication, from an out-of-state federal trial court. There, a police officer tested positive for cocaine and was subject to the mandatory termination of his employment. In his exit interview, the officer was given an opportunity to raise \u201c \u2018any concerns that he might have had\u2019 \u201d but declined to do so and instead resigned. The trial court held that the exit interview, together with the availability of a posttermination hearing, provided the officer with a reasonable opportunity to be heard , in connection with his <em>termination. </em>(U.S.Dist. Lexis 9288, <em>supra, </em>at pp. *7-8.) <em>Stenson </em>might be germane to our analysis if Menge were challenging the process by which she was terminated from her employment, but it has no applicability to the matter we review. The DMV did not afford Menge anything akin to an exit interview or the opportunity to be heard before or after revoking her certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">On the record before us, we conclude that Menge\u2019s failure to attend the hearings before the District and the Board did not result in a waiver of the right to challenge the NMRO finding before the DMV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">E. <em>Materiality of DMV Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">The DMV makes three other arguments to justify its refusal to provide a hearing to school bus drivers whose NMRO reports indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>adulterated specimens. First, it contends that a hearing is unnecessary because, under the ruling of the DOT, an adulterated specimen constitutes a refusal to test, and the donor is not entitled to a test of the split specimen or a retest of the primary specimen. Therefore, it is argued, even with a hearing the driver would not be able to test the split sample. This is a rather odd argument, given the DMV\u2019s discourse on the adequacy of the proceedings before the District and the Board\u2014in which no retesting was available. Although testing of a split sample is not available to a driver under the terms of the DOT ruling, the unavailability of such evidence does not render a hearing inconsequential. As previously mentioned, a hearing on the issue of adulteration may nevertheless be meaningful, since Menge may introduce evidence concerning the chain of custody of the sample, character evidence, or other evidence tending to show she did not adulterate the specimen.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Second, the DMV argues that it does not have possession of the testing evidence or any control over the NMRO. It does, however, have the NMRO test report, and certainly it need not have <em>control </em>over the laboratory that published the report to determine if the report is rebutted by the driver\u2019s evidence at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">Finally, the DMV feigns it is being held \u201cresponsible\u201d for errors committed by the NMRO and that it is an \u201cinnocent bystander.\u201d It further claims that the \u201cfundamental problem with [the trial court\u2019s] ruling is that it imposes upon the DMV the punishment for a regulation it did not promulgate and did not enforce.\u201d The DMV\u2019s hypersensitivity reflects a misperception of its role as a public agency. Its concern should not focus upon whether it is an \u201cinnocent bystander,\u201d but rather upon whether it is, in fact, serving the public in accordance with the fundamental tenets of our Constitution. After all, it was the <em>DMV </em>that revoked Menge\u2019s license without a hearing, not another agency. Nor does the DMV make any record that it will be unduly burdened by extending a hearing to those in Menge\u2019s position, and surely it is neither harmed nor punished by affording due process to California drivers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>III.

The DMV subsequently represented that the applicable statutes were section 13370, subdivision (a)(3) and section 13376, subdivision (a)(4). Section 13376, subdivision (a)(4), does not apply, because it pertains only where the <em>\u201capplicant </em>has failed to meet the prescribed testing requirements for issuance of the certificate.\u201d (Italics added.)
