J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8F\">Appellants El Dorado County Board of Equalization (CBOE) and El Dorado County Board of Supervisors (CBOS) appeal from the trial court\u2019s grant of Heavenly Valley\u2019s petition for a writ of administrative mandamus (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5), in which the trial court determined Heavenly Valley had a right to administrative review following a business property audit under Revenue and Taxation Code section 469.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The audit revealed an undervaluation of some property but, because other property had been overassessed, the assessor concluded the net difference was de minimis and issued a \u201cno change\u201d audit result. Appellants contend (1) a taxpayer has no postaudit administrative appeal rights unless an audit results in actual levy of an additional assessment (escape assessment), (2) even if administrative appeal rights exist, the trial court should have remanded the case for an administrative hearing rather than adopting Heavenly Valley\u2019s opinion concerning value of the property, and (3) the doctrine of laches should be applied against Heavenly Valley.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-10\">We shall conclude, as did the trial court, that the taxpayer has a right to administrative appeal. We shall also conclude, however, the trial court should have remanded for an administrative hearing rather than ordering adopted the taxpayer\u2019s opinion of value. We shall therefore affirm in part and reverse in part.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>Statutory Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\">We begin with an overview of the statutes pertinent to resolution of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-5\">\u201cAll property in this State, not exempt under the laws of the United States or of this State, is subject to taxation under this code.\u201d (\u00a7 201; see also Cal. Const., art. XIII [stating all property is taxable but setting forth exemptions].) The assessor assesses all property subject to general property taxation on the annual lien date. (\u00a7 401.) The initial valuation of real property is made by the county assessor (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, \u00a7 2; \u00a7\u00a7 110, 110.1); the initial valuation of business personal property is made using a business property statement, which the taxpayer is required to submit. (\u00a7 441.) The assessed value of all property is listed on the assessment roll. (\u00a7 601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-6\">A property owner dissatisfied with the annual assessment must file an application for reduction by September 15 with the county board of equalization,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which has authority to \u201cequalize the values of all property on the local assessment roll by adjusting individual assessments.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XIII, \u00a7 16; \u00a7 1603.) \u201cEqualization\u201d means \u201cadjusting the. value of property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>assessed to conform to its real value.\u201d <em>(County of Sacramento v. Assessment Appeals Bd. No. 2 </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 654, 663 [108 Cal.Rptr. 434].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">Section 469<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> requires an audit every four years for businesses with tangible personal property valued at $300,000 or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-6\">If the audit reveals property was overassessed for any cause, the taxpayer may be entitled to seek a refund. (\u00a7 469 [see fn. 4, <em>ante].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-7\">If the audit discloses property that has \u201cescaped assessment,\u201d i.e., has been underassessed or unassessed <em>(American Airlines, Inc. v. County of San Mateo </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 1110, 1127 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 251, 912 P.2d 1198]), the assessor has a duty to levy an \u201cescape assessment\u201d for pertinent years within the audit period. (\u00a7 469 [see fn. 4, <em>ante]; </em>\u00a7 531.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-8\">However, if the audit reveals both underassessment and overassessment, the assessor may offset overassessments against proposed tax liabilities resulting from escape assessments for any tax year covered by the audit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>(\u00a7 533.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>) Moreover, section 155.20,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> if implemented by a county, allows the county assessor to forego collection of \u201cde minimis\u201d taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">Section 1605, subdivision (e) (see fn. 13, <em>post), </em>allows a taxpayer to seek administrative review by the county board of equalization \u201c[i]f an audit of the books and records of any profession, trade, or business pursuant to Section 469 discloses property subject to an escaped [sic] assessment for any year . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1605, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">The main question in this appeal is whether the taxpayer is entitled to administrative review where an audit discloses underassessments, but the underassessments are offset against overassessments, such that no escape assessment is actually levied, i.e., \u201cenrolled.\u201d (\u00a7 534 [assessment is deemed made on date entered on the roll if assessee is timely notified].) .</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-7\">Heavenly Valley conducts business in El Dorado County as a ski lift resort operator. The El Dorado County Assessor (County Assessor) assessed Heavenly Valley\u2019s real property and personal business property for tax purposes. The tax years at issue in this appeal are 1992-1993 (1992), 1993-1994 (1993), 1994-1995 (1994), and 1995-1996 (1995). For each of those years, the full value of the taxpayer\u2019s business tangible personal property exceeded $300,000. Heavenly Valley did not protest any of those assessments by the September 15 deadline for those years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-8\">In early 1996, the County Assessor conducted a mandatory audit of Heavenly Valley pursuant to section 469 (see fn. 4, <em>ante), </em>which requires an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>audit every four years for businesses with tangible personal property valued at $300,000 or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">Heavenly Valley and the County Assessor met on February 1, 1996, to discuss the audit results. The County Assessor presented an \u201cAudit Summary\u201d showing a significant underassessment of property for the tax years under audit. Heavenly Valley countered that other property had been overvalued and asked that overassessments be corrected by following SEE depreciable economic life schedules for ski lifts, and by using appropriate depreciation tables that adequately reflected actual loss in value for assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-6\">The County Assessor determined property had been overassessed, by over $3 million, for 1993. The overassessment was offset against the underassessment (\u00a7 533; see fn. 6, <em>ante), </em>with a net result of $1,290 in underassessed value, which assertedly would yield $12.90 in additional revenue for the county.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Pursuant to section 155.20 (see fn. 7, <em>ante) </em>(implemented by El Dorado County in 1994), the County Assessor found this amount to be de minimis, such that no change was necessary. In a letter dated April 24, 1996, the County Assessor notified Heavenly Valley: \u201cWe have completed the required mandatory audit for Heavenly Lake Tahoe. Although some modifications were made for individual years, the net changes resulted in a \u2018no change\u2019 audit.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-7\">On June 25, 1996, Heavenly Valley filed for each of the four tax years (1992 through 1995) an \u201cApplication for Changed Assessment\u201d with the CBOE, pursuant to section 1605, subdivision (e) (see fn. 13, <em>post), </em>which allows a taxpayer to seek administrative review if a section 469 audit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>\u201cdiscloses property subject to an escaped [sic] assessment for any year.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (\u00a7 1605, subd. (e).) CBOE set a February 1997 date for a hearing on valuation but, at the County Assessor\u2019s request, notified Heavenly Valley on January 10th that the hearing would be limited to jurisdictional questions only.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">At the February 1997 hearing, the County Assessor argued that since the audit resulted in \u201cno change,\u201d Heavenly Valley had no right to apply for an assessment reduction. According to the County Assessor, a taxpayer has the right to an administrative appeal only if an escape assessment is actually levied or \u201cenrolled.\u201d Heavenly Valley countered that section 1605 authorized an administrative appeal because the audit disclosed property \u201csubject to\u201d an escape assessment, i.e., property that had been underassessed, even though no escape assessment was imposed due to the offset. Heavenly Valley produced a 1984 administrative interpretation by the SBE in a letter to county assessors (LTA), which addressed this specific question. The 1984 LTA noted the legislative intent of sections 469 and 1605 was \u201cto afford the taxpayer a similar right to \u2018open up\u2019 past assessments as the assessor has.\u201d The LTA said the statutory language about property \u201csubject to\u201d an escape assessment \u201cdoes not specify an escape assessment must be enrolled, only that the audit disclose[] property that should have been assessed but was not. It would be a tortured reading of the law to conclude that property is not \u2018subject to an escape assessment\u2019 merely because some other error offset the escape.\u201d Heavenly Valley also produced at the hearing SBE employee Mark Buckley, who stated SBE\u2019s current position remained consistent with the 1984 LTA, that property \u201csubject to an escape assessment\u201d does not require an actual assessment to be enrolled, but only that property have been underassessed or unassessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">CBOE decided to continue the hearing and seek an opinion from the State Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-6\">On November 21, 1997, the Attorney General published an opinion, No. 97-315 (80 Ops.Atty.Gen. 322), concluding: \u201cA property owner may apply for review, equalization, and adjustment of a county assessor\u2019s assessment with respect to the value of all property at the location of the owner\u2019s business after a mandatory audit of the owner\u2019s books and records has been made by the county assessor that discloses both an underassessment and overassessment of some of the property, resulting in no change to the original assessment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 323). The Attorney General opinion stated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>part: \u201cThe requirement of sections 469 and 1605 are met for filing an application for review if the audit discloses \u2018property subject to an escape assessment.\u2019 In this context, the term \u2018subject to\u2019 commonly means exposed to, disposed to, or being under the contingency of. (See Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Dict. (1961), p. 2275.) The statutes do not require the actual issuance of an escape assessment, only that the audit disclose some or all of the property as being under the contingency of an escape assessment. We are to interpret statutes by consulting \u2018the words themselves, giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 325, fn. omitted) The Attorney General opinion stated nothing in the legislative history was inconsistent with its conclusion. The opinion also stated its interpretation was consistent with the 1984 SEE administrative interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">At the continued hearing on March 9, 1998, CBOE, rejecting the Attorney General opinion, ruled it had no jurisdiction because the taxpayer had no right to review. Heavenly Valley through its attorney stated on the record that it would wait until expiration of the two-year period within which CBOE must complete the hearing (\u00a7 1604) before commencing court action, in order to claim operation of a provision calling for automatic adoption of the taxpayer\u2019s opinion of value when the CBOE fails to hear evidence and make a final determination on an application for reduction within two years of the timely filing of the application. (\u00a7 1604, subd. (c).)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-6\">After expiration of the two-year period, Heavenly Valley on April 12, 1999, filed its petition for a writ of administrative mandamus in the trial court, arguing the audit\u2019s discussion of underassessed property triggered the right to administrative review, and since the time for completing the administrative hearing had passed, Heavenly Valley\u2019s opinion of property value must be adopted. CBOE and CBOS opposed the petition, defending the decision that jurisdiction was lacking, and arguing laches and that the proper remedy (if there was jurisdiction) was to remand for further administrative proceedings.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-7\">Following a court hearing, the trial court on July 29, 1999, issued a written \u201cDecision\u201d granting the petition for writ of mandamus. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>concluded Heavenly Valley was entitled to administrative appeal of the audit because the audit disclosed property that had been underassessed, hence was \u201csubject to an escape assessment,\u201d even though no assessment was actually levied. The court further indicated Heavenly Valley was not required to file a separate claim for a refund as to property that had been overassessed, because no refund would be in order without the requested hearing to equalize value, which would determine the tax. With respect to laches, the trial court said laches did not apply because any delay was attributable to the acts of CBOE, and application of laches would deny Heavenly Valley due process and defeat the intent of sections 469 and 1605. The court ruled the time for an administrative hearing had expired, CBOE had failed to hold the required hearing, hence the taxpayer\u2019s valuation would be automatically adopted under section 1604, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">CBOE and CBOS appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-6\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-7\">This appeal presents questions of statutory construction, which are questions of law subject to de novo review. <em>(Burden </em>v. <em>Snowden </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 556, 562 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 531, 828 P.2d 672].)  The question of laches may also be decided as a matter of law where, as here, the underlying facts are undisputed. <em>(San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society </em>v. <em>City of Moreno Valley </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 593, 605 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 897].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-8\">II. <em>Right to Administrative Appeal of Audit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-9\">Appellants argue the taxpayer does not have a right to an administrative appeal following a section 469 audit unless an escape assessment is actually levied (\u201cenrolled\u201d). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-10\">As indicated, the statutory scheme allows that (1) if the audit reveals overassessed property, the taxpayer may be entitled to a refund; (2) if the audit reveals underassessed property, an escape assessment must be levied; but (3) if the audit reveals both underassessed and overassessed property, the two may be offset against each other. (\u00a7 469; see fn. 4, <em>ante; </em>\u00a7 533; see fn. 6, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-11\">Section 1605,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> in subdivision (e), authorizes an administrative appeal if the section 469 audit \u201cdiscloses property subject to an escaped [szc] assessment for any year . ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>The objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. <em>(Burden </em>v. <em>Snowden, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 562.) In determining intent, we look first to the language of the statute, giving effect to its plain meaning. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Where the words of the statute are clear, we may not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history. <em>(Ibid.; </em>Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1858.) We interpret statutes by consulting \u201cthe words themselves, giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>(DaFonte v. Up-Right, Inc. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 593, 601 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 238, 828 P.2d 140].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">The common meaning of \u201csubject to\u201d includes \u201cexposed to.\u201d (Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Dict. (1961) p. 2275.) By a plain reading of the statutes, the taxpayer is entitled to administrative review if an audit reveals property that was underassessed or unassessed (hence exposed to further taxation) regardless whether or not an escape assessment is actually levied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-6\">Appellants argue that the dictionary also defines \u201csubject to\u201d as \u201cmaking liable,\u201d and we should therefore adopt only that one restrictive meaning. Appellants argue a taxpayer is not \u201csubject to\u201d an assessment unless an assessment is actually enrolled. We note the statute refers to <em>property </em>being subject to assessment, not the <em>taxpayer. </em>In any event, the term \u201csubject to assessment\u201d plainly encompasses exposure to assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-7\">Even if we were to consider the statutory language ambiguous, we would reach the same conclusion, that the taxpayer has a right to administrative review if the section 469 audit discloses property that was underassessed or unassessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-8\">Thus, appellants argue we should not construe \u201csubject to\u201d in its ordinary meaning of \u201cexposed to,\u201d because to do so would ignore the context of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>related Revenue and Taxation Code provisions, which assertedly require actual levy of an escape assessment as a prerequisite for administrative review. Appellants\u2019 argument appears to be as follows: Section 1605, subdivision (a) (see fn. 13, <em>ante), </em>indicates that an escape assessment is not effective for any purpose, including its administrative review, until the assessee is notified of the assessment. Section 1605, subdivision (e) (see fn. 13, <em>ante), </em>starts the 60-day period for administrative review on \u201cthe date on which the assessee was notified,\u201d and receipt of a tax bill \u201cshall suffice as that notice.\u201d Therefore, argue appellants, the review period of section 1605, subdivision (e), is never triggered absent a duly enrolled escape assessment with notice of the escape assessment. Appellants further suggest that requiring enrollment of an escape assessment provides a date certain for triggering the right to administrative appeal, as opposed to an \u201camorphous\u201d date of finding property exposed to an escape assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">However, the fact that section 1605, subdivision (a) (see fn. \u00cd3, <em>ante), </em>says an escape assessment is not effective for any purpose including its administrative review until the assessee is notified of the assessment, does not say or suggest that an escape assessment is the only event that triggers the right to review. Where no escape assessment is levied, the \u201cdate on which the assessee was notified\u201d is the date on which the assessee is notified of the audit results. We note the SBE\u2019s 1984 LTA (which concluded an escape assessment need not be actually levied in order for the taxpayer to appeal), observed that where an overassessment offsets an underassessment, it is necessary to provide a formal notice to the taxpayer which will trigger the 60-day period for administrative appeal. Since the statutes did not describe the requirements for the notice, the LTA set forth suggestions for minimum contents of the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">Appellants argue their interpretation (that actual levy of an escape assessment is a prerequisite to administrative appeal) is supported by the fact that section 533 (see fn. 6, <em>ante) </em>says \u201c[i]f the assessments are made as a result of an audit which discloses that property . . . has been incorrectly assessed . . . the tax refunds resulting from the incorrect assessments shall be an offset against <em>proposed </em>tax liabilities, including accumulated penalties and interest, resulting from escaped assessments for any tax year covered by the audit.\u201d (Italics added.) Appellants assert the word \u201cproposed\u201d in section 533 refers to the proposed escape assessment amount <em>before </em>the overassessed valuation amount is taken into account by offsetting, which assertedly harmonizes sections 469, 533 and 1605. However, appellants fail to show how use of the word \u201cproposed\u201d supports their position. Nothing in any of the statutes suggests any legislative intent to limit administrative review to cases where n\u00f3 offset occurred under section 533. Section 469 (see fn. 4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number><em>ante), </em>clearly allows a taxpayer to recoup an overpayment if the audit discloses an overassessment of property. If the assessor proposes to negate that potential refund by finding other property was underassessed, then we see no reason and no statutory prohibition precluding the taxpayer from challenging that finding of underassessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">Appellants argue that allowing administrative review in this case would allow the taxpayer two bites of the apple. They note that under section 1605, subdivision (e) (see fn. 13, <em>ante), </em>the postaudit appeal opens up for review not merely the underassessed property but also the entire original assessment of all property for that year (except property that has been the subject of a previous equalization review). In appellants\u2019 view, allowing administrative review in the circumstances of this case would effectively void the September 15th deadline for regular administrative appeals, because a second right of appeal would exist \u201cfor the intentionally or negligently tardy business taxpayer who should have examined the assessment at the time of original levy.\u201d Appellants argue it is \u201cabsurd\u201d to allow the taxpayer a \u201csecond right of appeal.\u201d They argue it would allow taxpayers to let business property statements (documents filled out by the taxpayer under penalty of perjury)\u2014 the foundation of the assessor\u2019s annual assessment\u2014be filed incorrectly for the original year of assessment. Then the taxpayer would \u201cdiscover\u201d the error during the mandatory audit and demand an appeal even though they accepted the earlier valuation without appeal, in the hopes of lowering their ultimate property tax bill in a spirit of \u201cgamesmanship.\u201d Appellants suggest taxpayers would undervalue their own property by \u201ca single cent\u201d in order to create property subject to an escape assessment, opening up the entire original assessment for review, and it is hard to prove intentional misconduct by taxpayers so as to avoid such manipulation. Appellants argue the danger of taxpayer manipulation is borne out by the experience of Fresno County, as reflected in the amicus curiae brief filed by the Fresno County Assessor. Fresno\u2019s brief says that after issuance of the Attorney General opinion in 1997, taxpayers are \u201cgladly . . . \u2018discovering\u2019 \u201d undervalued personal property in section 469 audits in order to reopen real property valuations. Fresno requests that we take judicial notice of documents to this effect, appended to its amicus curiae brief. Heavenly Valley opposes the request because it was not presented in a separate document.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">We decline Fresno\u2019s request for judicial notice of its appendix 3, attached to its amicus curiae brief, because it does not help appellants. The possibility that a taxpayer may risk penalties for tax fraud by undervaluing property in the hopes of gaining extended time for administrative review is not a basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>for this court to impose a statutory construction contrary to the language and intent of the statutes.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">Appellants argue that allowing administrative appeal in Heavenly Valley\u2019s circumstances would allow business taxpayers to have advantages not granted to residential taxpayers, resulting in unequal treatment. However, as appellants acknowledge, nonbusiness taxpayers and small business taxpayers do not have to undergo the mandatory audit that business taxpayers such as Heavenly Valley are required to undergo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">Moreover, appellants\u2019 position is defeated by the fact that section 469 (see fn. 4, <em>ante), </em>expressly allows a taxpayer to file a claim for a refund if an audit discloses a net overassessment \u201cfor any cause.\u201d If appellants\u2019 interpretation were correct, the statute would not allow a taxpayer to obtain a post-audit refund for an overvaluation for which the taxpayer may have been responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-6\">According to appellants, the Legislature intended to allow administrative review only when the assessor \u201cactually levies\u201d an escape assessment. Appellants argue that if the Legislature wanted to allow administrative appeals in Heavenly Valley\u2019s circumstances, the Legislature would have amended section 1603 (the statute setting the September deadline for administrative appeal of each year\u2019s assessment) or referred to section 1603 in section 469\u2019s audit provision. Appellants argue the Legislature chose to refer to postaudit section 469 appeals only in section 1605, an escape assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>provision, assertedly reflecting an intent to limit appeals to cases where escape assessments are enrolled. Appellants argue that if the Legislature had intended to allow postaudit administrative review regardless of whether an escape assessment was actually levied, it would have said so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">However, the Legislature <em>did </em>say so, by enacting a statute authorizing review whenever the audit discloses property \u201csubject to\u201d an escape assessment. Appellants would have us change the statute, by reading \u201csubject to an escape assessment\u201d as \u201csubjected to an escape assessment.\u201d We are aware, as appellants note, that the Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest for the pertinent 1978 legislative amendments (Stats. 1978, ch. 732, Sen. Bill No. 1752), said the bill would \u201crequire the review, equalization and adjustment of the assessment of all property on the business premises where property is <em>subjected to </em>an escape assessment, unless such property has been equalized, and would provide for the refund of any overpayment of taxes which have been determined in such review to have been incorrectly assessed.\u201d Thus, the Legislative Counsel referred to property \u201csubjected to\u201d an escape assessment, while the statute refers to property \u201csubject to\u201d an escape assessment. The language \u201csubjected to\u201d is arguably supportive of appellants\u2019 position that an escape assessment must be actually enrolled in order to trigger a right to administrative review. However, upon analysis of the legislative history, we shall conclude the reference to \u201csubjected to\u201d does not support appellants\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">Thus, the statute, as enacted by the Legislature, said \u201csubject to,\u201d not \u201csubjected to.\u201d  Insofar as a Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest conflicts with a statute, the digest must be disregarded. <em>(Kern River Public Access Com. v. City of Bakersfield </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 1205, 1222 [217 Cal.Rptr. 125].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-7\">Moreover, we note other legislative history speaks of \u201csubject to,\u201d not \u201csubjected to.\u201d Thus, for example, the Legislative Analyst\u2019s analysis of Senate Bill No. 1752 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-8\">\u201cUnder existing law, taxpayers may file an application for review, equalization and adjustment of assessments with the county board of equalization or assessment appeals board only within a specified period following receipt of the original assessment. Existing law also requires the assessor to perform an audit at least once every four years of each business reporting personal property with a full value of $100,000 or more, and to report all findings of such audits to the taxpayer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-9\">\u201cThis bill would provide that, whenever such an audit discloses property <em>subject to </em>an escape assessment, the taxpayer may file an application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>review, equalization and adjustment of the entire original assessment for the year to which the escape assessment applies. This bill also would provide for the refund of any amounts determined to have been incorrectly assessed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-4\">\u201cSB 1752 would provide that when property is <em>subject to </em>escape assessments for being undervalued or under-appraised, there be taken into account any overassessment on the same property. . . .\u201d (Italics added, original italics omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">The Senate Committee on Revenue and Taxation said with respect to the 1978 amendments that \u201cthe intent of SB 1752 is to provide a mechanism whereby over-assessments of property would be taken into consideration if an audit disclosed property <em>subject to </em>escape assessments for a particular year. Such over-assessments would be offset against escape assessments for any tax year covered by the audit.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Rev. and Taxation, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 1752 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) p. 1, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">Thus, the Legislative Counsel\u2019s reference to property \u201csubjected to\u201d escape assessment loses significance. Since section 469 did not authorize refund or offset of overassessments before the 1978 amendments, there was no reason to distinguish between \u201csubjected to\u201d and \u201csubject to.\u201d We therefore disagree with appellants\u2019 assertion that the Legislative Counsel\u2019s comment has \u201cunmistakable meaning\u201d of circumstances where an escape assessment has been levied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-7\">We see nothing in the legislative history suggesting administrative review is available where an escape assessment is actually imposed, but not where an escape assessment wipes out a potential postaudit refund to the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-8\">We have reviewed the legislative history and find nothing inconsistent with our interpretation that a taxpayer is entitled to administrative review when an audit discloses property subject to an escape assessment, i.e., property that has been underassessed or unassessed, and there is no requirement that an escape assessment actually be levied as a prerequisite to administrative review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-9\">Appellants, in a March 20, 2000, reply to an amicus curiae brief, ask us to take judicial notice of (1) a letter to the Governor from the author of the 1978 bill to amend sections 469 and 1605, and (2) a letter to the Governor from a consultant to the State Bar taxation section (which apparently sponsored the 1978 bill).  However, appellants fail to show these letters are cognizable legislative history. <em>(Quintano v. Mercury Casualty Co., supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 1049, 1062 [statements of individual legislator, including bill\u2019s author, are generally not considered in construing a statute, as the court\u2019s task is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature as a whole]; <em>California </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number><em>Teachers Assn. v. San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 700-701 (170 Cal.Rptr. 817/621 P.2d 856] [letters to Governor, even from bill\u2019s author, do not necessarily reflect <em>Legislature\u2019s </em>intent].) The letters do not state that the views expressed therein were presented to the legislators who voted on the bill. Appellants\u2019 request for judicial notice of these materials is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">Appellants cite a 1978 letter from SEE to the Governor opposing the 1978 amendment which added the \u201csubject to\u201d language to sections 469 and 1605 (Stats. 1978, ch. 732, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4, pp. 2287-2288, 2289-2290). We treat this citation as a request for judicial notice of the letter, which we grant. This letter is not helpful to appellants. As SEE points out in its amicus curiae brief supporting Heavenly Valley in this appeal, the letter indicated SEE interpreted the bill to allow administrative review if the assessor \u201cproposes to levy\u201d an escape assessment\u2014i.e., that an escape assessment need not actually be levied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">Appellants suggest SEE\u2019s employee testified at the Heavenly Valley\u2019s administrative hearing that SEE sided with appellants\u2019 interpretation before 1984. We do not read the record that way, but even assuming appellants are right, a pre-1984 opinion by SEE would obviously carry little weight, in view of SEE\u2019s 1984 LTA reaching an opposite conclusion\u2014a conclusion that remains the SEE\u2019s current position. Indeed, SEE has filed an amicus curiae brief in support of Heavenly Valley\u2019s position in this appeal that the term \u201cproperty subject to an escape assessment\u201d does not require enrollment of an escape assessment in order to trigger the administrative appeal provisions of section 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">Appellants argue we should not defer to the 1984 LTA issued by the SEE. Appellants assert the SEE interpretation of the statutory language \u201cproperty . . . subject to escape assessment\u201d is not entitled to deference because LTA\u2019s are advisory only, SEE held a contrary position before 1984, and the trial court erred in giving too much deference to the 1984 LTA under <em>Western States Petroleum Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 559, 576 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 139, 888 P.2d 1268]. Appellants cite case law where courts rejected SEE interpretations concerning other matters. Appellants argue their own interpretation should carry more weight, because it is the county entities which deal most intimately with these matters (though Gov. Code, \u00a7 15606, subd. (e), authorizes SEE to issue instructions to assessors \u201cto promote uniformity throughout the state and its local taxing jurisdictions in the assessment of property for the purposes of taxation\u201d). However, although we note SEE has accumulated a \u201c \u2018body of experience and informed judgment\u2019 in the administration of the business tax law \u2018to which the courts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>litigants may properly resort for guidance\u2019 \u201d <em>(Yamaha Corp. of America </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 1, 14 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 960 P.2d 1031]), we do not defer to the SBE\u2019s interpretation in the 1984 LTA but independently reach the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">Our interpretation is also consistent with the reasoning in the Attorney General opinion, 80 Ops.Atty.Gen. 322, <em>supra, </em>which we have previously described and which is entitled to great weight. <em>(California Assn. of Psychology Providers v. Rank </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1, 17 [270 Cal.Rptr. 796, 793 P.2d 2]; <em>Planned Parenthood Affiliates v. Van De Kamp </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 245, 263 [226 Cal.Rptr. 361].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">Heavenly Valley asks us to take judicial notice of proposed legislation in 1999 (Assem. Bill No. 1643 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.)), which would have amended section 469 to require enrollment of an escape assessment as a prerequisite to an administrative appeal, but which was withdrawn by the author. Heavenly Valley claims appellants lobbied in favor of this bill, which according to Heavenly Valley means appellants realized existing law does not require the enrollment of an escape assessment. However, the documents for which Heavenly Valley seeks judicial notice reflect that the proposed legislation was a response to the opinions of the Attorney General and SBE interpreting \u201csubject to an escape assessment\u201d as not requiring actual levy of an escape assessment. Thus, even assuming appellants supported Assembly Bill No. 1643, their support would not constitute any kind of admission. Since the bill was apparently withdrawn rather than voted down, we draw no inference of legislative intent from it. We therefore deny Heavenly Valley\u2019s request for judicial notice of the 1999 proposed legislation, Assembly Bill No. 1643.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">To sum up, when we view the statutory scheme, together with its cognizable legislative history, we conclude the Legislature intends to grant a taxpayer the right of administrative review, by elected representatives, where the assessor\u2019s audit discloses property that was underassessed or unassessed, regardless of whether or not an escape assessment is actually enrolled. The Legislature has apparently concluded the assessor ought not to be able unilaterally to increase the value of a taxpayer\u2019s taxable property without a check on that power by CBOE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-7\">We conclude Heavenly Valley was entitled to administrative review following the audit. As provided by statute, the review would encompass the original assessment for the years that were the subject of the audit, except for any property which had already been equalized for the years in question by CBOE. (\u00a7 1605, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>III. <em>Remedy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">Appellants argue the trial court erred in ordering adopted Heavenly Valley\u2019s opinion concerning market value of its property rather than remanding for an administrative hearing. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">As indicated, section 1604, subdivision (c) (see fn. 11, <em>ante), </em>provides (with exceptions inapplicable here) that the taxpayer\u2019s opinion of market value shall be the value upon which taxes are to be levied for the tax year covered by the taxpayer\u2019s application for reduction, if the county assessment appeals board \u201cfails to hear evidence <em>and </em>fails to make a final determination on the application for reduction in assessment of property within two years of the timely filing of the application.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Adoption of the taxpayer\u2019s opinion of market value does not prevent the board from thereafter making a determination of value, but the board\u2019s determination will not apply retroactively to the tax year covered by the application.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">In construing section 1604, we look first to the words of the statute. <em>(Burden v. Snowden, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 562.) Adoption of the taxpayer\u2019s opinion of market value under section 1604 is triggered where the county assessment appeals board \u201cfails to hear evidence and fails to make a final determination on the application . . .\u201d within two years of the timely filing of the application. Heavenly Valley argues that because the statute refers to hearing \u201cevidence,\u201d the board must hear evidence on the underlying tax dispute and make a final determination on those merits in order to avoid having to adopt the taxpayer\u2019s opinion of property value. Thus, according to Heavenly Valley, the hearing and final determination on jurisdictional grounds that occurred in this case did not satisfy the statute, and the board must pay the penalty for its erroneous decision that it lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-8\">We disagree with Heavenly Valley. The statute does not require that the hearing of evidence and final determination must be on the merits of the underlying tax dispute. We see no reason why the statute should not apply to a hearing on jurisdictional grounds, at which the parties would presumably be able to introduce evidence relevant to the question of jurisdiction if appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>Thus, the legislative history, of which we take judicial notice at Heavenly Valley\u2019s request (see fn. 18, <em>post), </em>supports our construction. In 1982, subdivision (c) was added to section 1604, to provide the board must accept the taxpayer\u2019s opinion of value if the board \u201cfails to hear evidence\u201d on the taxpayer\u2019s application. (Stats. 1982, ch. 7, \u00a7 3, p. 7; <em>id., </em>ch. 1465, \u00a7 11.5, p. 5645.) (The reference to a failure to make a final determination was added later.) The 1982 legislative history reflects the bill would \u201crequire that if the county assessment appeals board fails to hear a petition for reduction within two years of filing, the taxpayer\u2019s opinion of the property\u2019s market value shall prevail . . .\u201d and \u201c[t]he purpose of this provision is to prevent appeals from being tied up for extended periods without a hearing.\u201d (Assem. Rev. <em>&amp; </em>Tax. Com., Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1603 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 29, 1981, p. 4.) Thus, the purpose was to prevent appeals from being tied up, not to assure taxpayers a hearing on the underlying merits despite lack of jurisdiction. We conclude section 1604 does not require adoption of the taxpayer\u2019s opinion of value where the board has held a hearing and made a final determination on jurisdictional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">This conclusion is in accord with the purpose of section 1604. \u201cThe purpose of section 1604 is to assure a prompt resolution of applications for reduction of assessments. [Citation.] The section is designed to prevent bureaucratic delay and forestalling of the return of taxpayer\u2019s money, by providing a significant disincentive for a taxing authority to delay resolution of the case. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(United Enterprises, Ltd. v. Assessment Appeals Bd. </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 152, 159 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 279].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">The trial court agreed with Heavenly Valley\u2019s position that section 1604, subdivision (c), requires adoption of the taxpayer\u2019s opinion of market value where a county assessment appeals board makes an erroneous determination that it lacks jurisdiction to hear the merits of an administrative appeal, such that no hearing on the merits is held within the two-year period. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">County boards of equalization or assessment appeals boards are quasi-judicial bodies which have authority to pass upon questions of their own jurisdiction in the first instance. <em>(County of Sacramento v. Assessment Appeals Bd. No. 2 </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 654, 663, 673 [108 Cal.Rptr. 434].) Where an administrative agency erroneously decides it lacks jurisdiction, the proper remedy is generally to remand for the administrative agency to act. <em>(Sunrise Retirement Villa v. Dear </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 948, 955-956 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 416].) <em>Sunrise </em>said that where the county assessment appeals board erred in refusing to exercise jurisdiction, \u201cthe trial court could have and should have issued the writ to compel it to so act. <em>(County of Sacramento, supra, </em>32 Cal.App.3d 654 [assessment appeals board erroneously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>ruled it had no jurisdiction]; <em>Main &amp; Von Karman Associates v. County of Orange </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 337, 343-344 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 432] [assessment appeals board used wrong methodology and refused to admit competent evidence; mandate issued to conduct further proceedings]; <em>California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. State Personnel Bd. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1133, 1150 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 693, 899 P.2d 79] [administrative agency failed to adjudicate grievance within the statutory time limit].)\u201d <em>(Sunrise Retirement Villa </em>v. <em>Dear, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th 948, 955-956.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">CBOE made a final determination on Heavenly Valley\u2019s applications for reduction in assessment; the determination was that CBOE lacked jurisdiction.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This determination satisfied the purpose of section 1604, to secure prompt resolution of taxpayer claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-6\">Heavenly Valley\u2019s position\u2014that in order to avoid the section 1604 penalty, the hearing must be on the merits of the underlying valuation dispute\u2014is extreme. Under that construction, every county assessment appeals board that determines it lacks jurisdiction would have to go ahead (assuming for the sake of argument that it retained authority to proceed) and hold a hearing on the merits of the valuation issues anyway and make a final determination on the merits just to protect its rights on the off chance that a taxpayer will pursue court action and obtain a reversal on the jurisdictional question. To require such potentially superfluous proceedings is nonsensical.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-7\">Heavenly Valley cites authority that administrative action based on legal error is void. Heavenly Valley appears to believe that judicial reversal of CBOE\u2019s jurisdictional decision would void the jurisdictional hearing held by CBOE, for section 1604 purposes. Heavenly Valley asserts CBOE has now lost jurisdiction to hold an evidentiary hearing on the underlying merits of the valuation dispute. We disagree, because section 1604 was clearly satisfied by the hearing and determination that jurisdiction was lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-8\">Under a separate heading that its own conduct was always ethical, Heavenly Valley argues that, despite rules prohibiting reconsideration, an administrative agency retains jurisdiction to correct an erroneous (hence void) conclusion of law. <em>(Cal. Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Butte Community College Dist. </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1293, 1304 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 269].) Heavenly Valley argues CBOE could have corrected its erroneous decision concerning jurisdiction at any time before expiration of the two-year period for completion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>of hearings on taxpayer claims. We need not address this point, since its presentation violates the rule requiring that points be presented under appropriate headings. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 15(a).) Moreover, we see no merit to this point, which responds to appellants\u2019 argument that CBOE was precluded from taking further action by an SBE regulation applicable to county boards, which provides \u201c[t]he decision of the board upon an application is final. The board shall not reconsider or rehear an application or modify a decision unless [there is ministerial clerical error, or the decision was entered based on the applicant\u2019s failure to appear and the applicant furnishes excusable good cause of the failure to appear].\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, \u00a7 326.) Even assuming CBOE could have reconsidered its decision on the jurisdictional question, it was not required to do so, and its failure to do so does not warrant dispensing with a hearing on the merits of the valuation issues. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 497 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 476], held remand for a new administrative hearing was the proper remedy, where the county assessor\u2019s evidence of property valuation in the first administrative hearing was legally inadmissible. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 505-506.) In response to the taxpayer\u2019s argument that the county should not be given \u201ctwo bites of the apple,\u201d <em>Mitchell </em>responded that despite the appeal of the argument, there is an \u201coverriding policy concern\u201d that \u201call property should be properly assessed and bear its fair share of property taxes.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 506.) Heavenly Valley argues <em>Mitchell </em>is distinguishable because it did not involve section 1604; however, that distinction is without consequence. Heavenly Valley also points out the taxpayer\u2019s expert in <em>Mitchell </em>testified to a value $600,000 more than what the taxpayer put on his application, and the appellate court said it saw \u201cno fairness in a situation where a taxpayer\u2019s low-ball valuation would have to be mandatorily accepted because the assessor, for whatever valid or invalid reason, did not comply with [a rule in California Code of Regulations].\u201d <em>(Mitchell, </em>at p. 506.) Heavenly Valley suggests its own conduct was exemplary, justifying the sanction of requiring CBOE to accept Heavenly Valley\u2019s opinion of property value. However, remand for an administrative hearing is appropriate because Heavenly Valley presents nothing to defeat the \u201coverriding policy concern\u201d that \u201call property should be properly assessed and bear its fair share of property taxes.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">Heavenly Valley cites <em>International Medication Systems, Inc. v. Assessment Appeals Bd. </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 761 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 394], that comliance with the constitutional requirement for an equalization hearing is not met unless the \u201csubstance and form\u201d of the hearing is granted to the taxpayer. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 767 [by failing to give proper notice, board did not acquire jurisdiction over taxpayer\u2019s application and had no power to continue and conduct evidentiary hearing without taxpayer\u2019s consent].) Heavenly Valley argues evidence on the underlying merits of valuation must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>presented in order to avoid the penalty of section 1604. However, the cited case did not involve a jurisdictional hearing and does not mandate imposition of a section 1604 penalty for an erroneous decision on jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">Heavenly Valley cites inapposite authority holding that a trial court lost jurisdiction to proceed with a new trial where no effective order granting a new trial was rendered within the statutory period, such that the motion was denied by operation of law. That principle has no bearing on the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">Heavenly Valley argues it will be prejudiced by remand for an administrative hearing, because Heavenly Valley has \u201csevere doubts\u201d that CBOE can be fair. Heavenly Valley fails to cite any authority that its doubts constitute grounds for decision by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">The parties dispute whether the administrative decision of no jurisdiction was made in good faith, with appellants characterizing the decision as one made in good faith, and Heavenly Valley disputing that characterization. Since the trial court made no finding of bad faith, and Heavenly Valley does not develop any argument that a finding of good faith was required, we need not address this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-8\">We conclude section 1604\u2019s requirements of a hearing and final determination were met in this case, and the trial court should have remanded the case for an administrative hearing on property valuation rather than ordering adopted the taxpayer\u2019s opinion of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-9\">We therefore need not address the parties\u2019 other arguments, e.g., appellants\u2019 argument that section 1604 does not apply because of the \u201cpending litigation\u201d exception contained therein, or appellants\u2019 argument that BOB could not have undertaken further action after it determined it lacked jurisdiction, because SBE rules prohibit the board from reconsidering, its decision, or Heavenly Valley\u2019s argument that CBOE should have sought judicial review of its own jurisdictional decision in a declaratory relief action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-10\">We conclude the trial court erred in ordering adopted Heavenly Valley\u2019s opinion concerning valuation.

Since we are ordering the matter remanded for an administrative hearing on valuation, appellants are not prejudiced by Heavenly Valley\u2019s action. For that reason, we reject appellants\u2019 laches argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">We need not address amicus curiae\u2019s arguments concerning equitable estoppel or equitable tolling, which Heavenly Valley protests as new theories raised inappropriately on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-9\">The judgment is reversed insofar as it adopts plaintiff Heavenly Valley\u2019s opinion of property valuation. The trial court shall issue a writ of mandate directing defendant El Dorado County Board of Equalization to hear and determine plaintiff\u2019s administrative appeal on the merits. The judgment is otherwise affirmed.

However, section 533 allows offset against \u201cproposed tax liabilities.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1169-9\">Arguments are presented on appeal as to whether section 155.20 was applicable to the section 533 offset result. Appellants argue it is applicable. Heavenly Valley argues inter alia that section 155.20 does not allow a county to exempt a portion of property, hence cannot be used to wipe out the $12.90 net tax owed by Heavenly Valley under the audit results. Apparently, Heavenly Valley wants an escape assessment to be levied against it, in order unequivocally to trigger the right to administrative review, which will open up for review all the property. Amici curiae join the fray on the question of section 155.20\u2019s applicability. However, we need not resolve this matter because it is inconsequential to this appeal, given our conclusion that the auditor\u2019s finding of underassessed property triggered the taxpayer\u2019s right to administrative review, regardless of whether or not an escape assessment was actually levied. Accordingly, we deny as unnecessary appellants\u2019 request for judicial notice of a page from an SBE Assessors\u2019 Handbook, which assertedly supports application of section 155.20 to a section 469 audit.

The application shall be filed with the clerk no later than 60 days after the date on which the assessee was notified. Receipt by the assessee of a tax bill based upon that assessment shall suffice as that notice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1176-7\">Amicus curiae William Greenwood, Fresno County Assessor-Recorder, also requests judicial notice of a decision by the Fresno County Assessment Appeals Board, appended to its brief as appendix 1, which assertedly addresses a situation where taxpayers argue that administrative review is available even when a postaudit letter states the actual values as a result of the audit were close enough to the enrolled values so that no changes to the enrolled values were required. That situation is not at issue here, and we decline to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"AJt\">Fresno also requests judicial notice of a May 1989 letter from SBE to a taxpayer representative, attached to the amicus curiae brief as appendix 2, which indicated the assessor must make an escape assessment, in supposed disagreement with the 1984 LTA. We deny the request for judicial notice. The query in that matter was whether the taxpayer could obtain administrative review by disclosing unassessed property, where the auditor did not find any unassessgd property. The answer was no. That matter is not at issue here. We note section 469 indicates the right to review occurs where the <em>audit </em>(not the taxpayer) discloses property subject to an escape assessment. Accordingly, we deny Fresno\u2019s request for judicial notice of appendix 2.</p>\n<p id=\"A8o\">Fresno also argues Heavenly Valley should not be allowed administrative review for the 1993 tax year, because the audit found an overassessment of property for that year. It does not appear to us that appellants make this argument, hence we will not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"ALB\">Fresno argues that even if a taxpayer is entitled to administrative review under the circumstances of the case before us, that review should be limited to personal property only and should not encompass real property. That issue is not necessary to our disposition of this appeal, and we decline to address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1181-9\">The board may also voluntarily choose this option by notifying the taxpayer that it will accept the taxpayer\u2019s opinion of value rather than hold a hearing.

Each point in an appellate brief should appear under a separate heading, and we need not address contentions not properly briefed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 15(a); <em>Live Oak Publishing Co. v.

Heavenly Valley suggests the legislative history supports its position that in order to avoid the section 1604 penalty, the hearing must be on the merits of the underlying valuation dispute, rather than a hearing and final determination that jurisdiction is lacking. We grant the request for judicial notice but see nothing in the legislative history helpful to Heavenly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>Valley\u2019s position. To the contrary, the legislative history supports the board\u2019s position, as we explain in the text of this opinion. Heavenly Valley also asks that we take judicial notice of State Board of Equalization rule 309. However, Heavenly Valley fails to persuade us that rule 309 helps its case, and we therefore decline the request.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
