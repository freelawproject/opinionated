About a month later, Jean was abducted by his father, Patrick B. Three years later, with Jean still missing and Patrick still at large, the dependency court terminated jurisdiction\u2014at the request of Patrick\u2019s counsel and over the objection of Jean\u2019s lawyer. The Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-12\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-13\">In July 1994, the police went to the family home to investigate a report of a fight. There was no food or electricity, and Darla\u2019s 13-year-old daughter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1445\">*1445</page-number>(Lisa W.) told the police that Darla had fled with Jean (then 3 years old). Patrick then left (but only after he locked Lisa out of the apartment). The next day, Darla and Patrick were arrested on outstanding drug-related warrants. Jean and Lisa were taken into protective custody. A petition was filed and Jean was placed in shelter care; Lisa was also placed, but she has since turned 18 and is no longer involved in these proceedings. Jean was nonverbal and \u201cvery delayed in other areas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">When interviewed after her release from jail, Darla said she and Patrick fought frequently. He had been laid off. They had no money. They were about to be evicted. Patrick had a drug problem. Darla admitted that she too had used drugs and abused alcohol, but not recently. Patrick, interviewed in jail, admitted that he had used drugs but claimed he had stopped in 1993. Everything was Darla\u2019s fault, he said. He took a voluntary layoff \u201cto teach Jean some things, including being potty trained and to make sure he had more fun and got out.\u201d Reports from others showed that both Darla and Patrick were still using drugs and that they fought all the time. In September, an amended petition was sustained and reunification services (drug rehabilitation programs and testing, parenting classes, and family counseling) were ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">By the fall of 1995, Darla and Patrick had completed parenting classes and some drug counseling, and they had tested negative for drugs. In October, the court gave DCFS discretion to liberalize the parents\u2019 visits. In December, Jean was returned to the parents for a 60-day visit, which went well. In February 1996, DCFS reported that both parents continued to test negative and Patrick was employed. By that time, however, Darla had moved in with her mother and had taken Jean with her to protect the child from Patrick\u2019s threats of inappropriate discipline (washing Jean\u2019s mouth out with soap). Jean was \u201cstrongly bonded with his mother\u201d and enrolled in kindergarten. Patrick agreed to the new living arrangement, and the court formally placed Jean with Darla on February 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-7\">On March 3, 1996, with Darla\u2019s permission, Patrick took Jean for a walk. Patrick did not return and Darla has not seen Jean since that time. Warrants were issued on March 11, and Darla was instructed to file a missing person report (she thought Patrick might have taken Jean to Dade County, Florida, where his family lives). No information about Jean or Patrick was presented to the court at subsequent hearings in 1996 and 1997. In April 1998, Patrick\u2019s lawyer asked the court to recall the warrants. The court denied the request, finding a need for continuing jurisdiction. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 300, 364, subd. (c) [all section references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1446\">*1446</page-number>In October 1998, DCFS reported that its efforts to locate Jean and Patrick had been unsuccessful, and explained that it had asked for help from the Department of Justice, the Florida Department of-Law Enforcement, Missing Children Information. Clearing House, the Crime Intelligence Analyst, and the Department of Motor Vehicles. Patrick\u2019s lawyer asked the court to terminate jurisdiction. The court refused, explaining that it did not want to \u201cencourage anybody to use self-help when they disagree\u201d with DCFS or the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-5\">In April 1999, DCFS filed an abduction report with the Los Angeles Police Department. On April 20, the dependency court vacated the order for Jean\u2019s placement in Darla\u2019s home and \u201cplaced\u201d him in the care of DCFS. Patrick\u2019s renewed request for an order terminating jurisdiction was denied. In October, the court suggested that DCFS ask for help from the district attorney\u2019s \u201clocator service.\u201d Patrick\u2019s lawyer again asked the court to terminate jurisdiction, explaining that there was \u201cno indication that the child is at risk anymore.\u201d The court stated the obvious\u2014that there was also no information to suggest the child was safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-6\">In December, DCFS still had no information\u2014but did report that it could not find copies of the warrants, without which there could be no help from the district attorney\u2019s locator service. Patrick\u2019s lawyer again asked the court to terminate jurisdiction. Over objections from DCFS and Jean\u2019s lawyer, the court granted Patrick\u2019s request and terminated jurisdiction\u2014because Jean \u201chas been missing for quite some time.\u201d The warrants for Jean\u2019s return and Patrick\u2019s arrest were recalled. DCFS appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-8\">We agree with DCFS that the orders terminating jurisdiction and recalling the warrants were unauthorized. Leaving to one side any issue about Patrick\u2019s criminal responsibility for Jean\u2019s abduction, it is sufficient for our purposes that (1) Patrick\u2019s conduct violated the dependency court\u2019s orders and (2) the court\u2019s order (a) left an at-risk child in the custody of a father who had a history of drug abuse and (b) ignored the existence of the continuing need for jurisdiction\u2014until Jean turns 18 or is found and returned to court. Where, as here, the progress of an ongoing dependency proceeding is thwarted by a parent\u2019s abduction of his child and by the parent\u2019s ability to avoid the court\u2019s grasp, \u201cthe court has no reason to do anything but issue warrants for their arrest and return and await their return.\u201d <em>(Katheryn S. v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 958, 969, fn. 11 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 741]; <em>In re Kamelia S. </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1224, 1227 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 816]; \u00a7 364, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1447\">*1447</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">The December 6, 1999, order is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the dependency court with directions to issue new warrants for Patrick\u2019s arrest and Jean\u2019s return, to set the matter for periodic review hearings as required by law, and to take such further action as is appropriate to secure Jean\u2019s return.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-6\">Spencer, P. J., and Ortega, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
