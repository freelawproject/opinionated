J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar9\">In this case we hold an order by the trial court sealing certain court documents and barring disclosure of certain information, whether obtained through discovery or otherwise, is an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-9\">Factual and Procedural Background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-10\">This appeal arises from a daisy chain of litigation among Dr. Steven M. Hoefflin, a cosmetic surgeon whose patients included many celebrities, and several of his former employees and associates. Appellant Dr. James S. Hurvitz is also a cosmetic surgeon, and had a business relationship with Hoefflin until the two reached a parting of the ways in 1996. Hurvitz filed suit against Hoefflin and his medical corporation, alleging causes of action for breach of contract and various torts, including misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, and slander per se. Hoefflin denied the allegations and filed a cross-complaint against Hurvitz and his wife, appellant Jackie Hurvitz, alleging various business torts on the part of the Hurvitzes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-11\">Also in 1996, four members of Hoefflin\u2019s administrative and medical staff, Barbara Maywood, Kim Moore-Mestas, Lydia Benjamin and Donna Burton (former employees), filed a lawsuit against him alleging sexual harassment (harassment action). The case settled shortly after it was filed, with each of the former employees receiving $42,500 in exchange for their agreement to: (1) waive all claims against Hoefflin; (2) seal the Los Angeles Superior Court case file in the matter; (3) keep the subject matter of their claims and the terms of the settlement confidential; (4) not disclose the names of Hoefflin\u2019s patients or try to solicit them for two years following the settlement; and (5) not \u201ccriticize, defame or disparage\u201d Hoefflin or any persons or entities related to him and his medical corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>As part of the settlement of the harassment action, the former employees\u2019 attorneys executed a letter addressed \u201cto whom it may concern,\u201d stating as follows: \u201cIn connection with our initial representation of [the former employees] a working draft of a proposed complaint was prepared before our investigation was completed. Regrettably, the complaint was inadvertently filed through an internal secretarial misunderstanding and immediately dismissed the same day when we learned of the mistaken filing. [\u00b6] Upon further investigation, we have concluded that the allegations contained in the mistakenly filed complaint were without sufficient factual or legal basis. [\u00b6] We regret any inconvenience or embarrassment the filing of the complaint has caused to Steven M. Hoefflin, M.D.\u201d Under the terms of the settlement Hoefflin was permitted to \u201cuse and disclose\u201d the letter \u201cif anyone inquires regarding the complaint or the subject matter of the complaint.\u201d The former employees, on the other hand, under the terms of the settlement could \u201conly state that the matter has been resolved\u201d and \u201csay nothing further.\u201d Finally, Hoefflin agreed not to \u201ccriticize, defame or disparage\u201d the former employees to third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">On October 26, 1997, the Washington Post published an article containing allegations of wrongdoing by Hoefflin, based on the allegations in a complaint prepared in connection with the former employees\u2019 action, but never filed. These allegations included highly inappropriate behavior by Hoefflin with respect to patients who had been anesthetized for surgical procedures. For example, Hoefflin was alleged to have exposed and ridiculed the genitals of unconscious patients. The Post reported Hurvitz had notified its reporters about the allegations against Hoefflin, and quoted Hurvitz as saying \u201cMy motive was to do the right thing. I was given this information and what could I do? I came forward, I had a conscience. There needs to be an independent, objective investigation of these charges.\u201d According to press reports, the California Medical Board did indeed launch an investigation into \u201ca telephone complaint in 1996 alleging that [Hoefflin] used drugs and fondled and photographed patients\u2014many of them in the entertainment industry while they were under anesthesia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">Hoefflin filed a separate action against appellants, alleging libel and slander per se in connection with the allegations published by the Post. This action was consolidated with the original <em>Hurvitz </em>v. <em>Hoefflin </em>action in January 1998. In his answer in the second action, Hurvitz admitted having provided information and documents to the <em>Post </em>reporter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">In April, 1998, appellants filed another complaint for defamation and interference with economic advantage against Hoefflin, alleging he had defamed them in his public response to the Post article. On October 6, 1998, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>the superior court found the Hoefflin/Hurvitz cases related to three other cases pending between Hoefflin and the former employees and their attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">On May 15, 1998, Hoefflin sued the former employees for various torts relating to the dissemination of the allegations in the Post article, and for breach of the settlement agreement in the harassment action. On October 29, 1998, the former employees sued Hoefflin for defamation and breach of contract. This complaint included the allegations of wrongdoing by Hoefflin with respect to anaesthetized patients, but did not give the patients\u2019 names. On February 1, 1999, Hoefflin filed a motion for sanctions against the former employees and their attorney, arguing their defamation suit was filed in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">On February 16, 1999, in opposition to the motion for sanctions, the former employees filed a joint declaration in which they repeated the allegations of wrongdoing from the harassment complaint and the Post article, but for the first time gave the names of the patients against whom the alleged wrongdoing was directed. The patients included very well-known celebrities, and the contents of the declaration were widely reported in the media. The trial court sealed the declaration the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">Hoefflin immediately moved to shorten time for a protective order to prevent any further disclosure of confidential information concerning patients of any of the physicians involved in the five related cases. A hearing on Hoefflin\u2019s motion was held on February 25, 1999. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court issued an interim gag order, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-8\">\u201cFirst, the court\u2019s sealing order regarding the declarations of Barbara Maywood, Kim Moore-Mestas, Lydia Benjamin and Donna Burton was done in order to protect the privacy rights of both public and private individuals who were referred to in these declarations as well as to preserve the patient-physician privilege held by those individuals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-9\">\u201cThis court is required to recognize, respect and protect the rights of those persons not parties to this action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-10\">\u201cIt is this court\u2019s goal to allow the parties freedom to fully litigate this matter. This right to litigate does not include the right to share with others, including the press, privileged information about third persons not involved in this lawsuit on the basis that the need to share this information is permitted on the First Amendment right to free speech. This court is also mindful of the right of all parties in this litigation to an unbiased jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>\u201cNeedless dissemination of this privileged information, this court finds, might prejudice potential jurors. Although some of this prejudice might inure against the defendant doctors, other prejudice could run against the plaintiff and plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys for what might be viewed as grandstanding or attempting to grab the spotlight at the expense of nonparty patients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-4\">\u201cConsequently, after balancing the rights to free speech of the attorneys and the parties, the right to a fair and impartial jury panel for all parties, the physician-patient privilege of both celebrity and noncelebrity patients and their right to privacy, and finally the right to dignity of all the parties and third persons, this court finds that a protective order is necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-5\">\u201cFurther, as it pertains to the declarations contained in the opposition papers filed on February 16th, 1999, by parties Maywood, Moore-Mestas, Benjamin and Burton and sealed by this court on February 17, 1999, these declarations have been thoroughly reviewed by myself for two purposes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-6\">\u201cOne, to understand these plaintiffs\u2019 opposition to the request for sanctions; and secondly to consider the various parties\u2019 requests to unseal these declarations. These declarations contain specific information about both celebrity and noncelebrity patients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-7\">\u201cThese declarations set forth not only the names but also the treatment rendered, physical oddities, treatment complications and other personal information. This court considered redacting the names of the patients but finds that this procedure would be inadequate protection because of their physician-patient privilege and their rights to privacy and dignity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-8\">\u201cBecause of the nature of the patient descriptions, including events surrounding the treatment of these individuals and the types of treatment, it would be impossible to guarantee that these rights would remain unsullied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-9\">\u201cThe reason for this protective order and sealing order is that identifying these individuals by name, since confidential information concerning their medical treatment has been disclosed in the pleadings filed in this case, would violate the physician-patient privilege held by these third parties under Evidence Code Section 993.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-10\">\u201cThe party physicians are not the holders of this privilege. I want to stress that. The holders of the privilege are not the physicians and not the attorneys in this case, and lack the authority\u2014the party physicians are not holders of this privilege, and they lack the authority and capacity to waiver [sic] their patients\u2019 privilege under Evidence Code section 993. Rather, it is the patients who hold the privilege.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>\u201cUnder Evidence Code section 994, a physician is authorized to claim the privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communication between a patient and a physician. Further, this court finds that courts generally are obligated to protect the privileges and rights of third parties not involved in litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-5\">\u201cAnd I\u2019m not just referring to physician-patient rights or rights of privacy here, but I\u2019m talking about all rights of persons not involved actively in the litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-6\">\u201cPlaintiffs argue that since the patients were unconscious and under anesthesia there was no, quote, \u2018communication,\u2019 close quote, between the physician and the patient and, therefore, the privilege does not apply. However, confidential communications, quote, \u2018means information, including information obtained by an examination of a patient. . . ,\u2019 close quote. That\u2019s under Evidence Code section 992.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-7\">\u201cTherefore, any information that these doctors obtained as a result of communicating with or examining these patients during their treatments or consultations is privileged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-8\">\u201cWhile the plaintiffs cite case law to support their argument that a patient\u2019s name is not protective <em>[sic] </em>communication if its disclosure would reveal nothing regarding the person\u2019s medical condition\u2014that\u2019s under Rudnick, R-U-D-N-I-C-K, versus Superior Court, a 1974 case found at 11 Cal.3d 924 at 933 [114 Cal.Rptr. 603, 523 P.2d 643].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-9\">\u201cIn this case these individuals\u2019 medical condition, type of treatment and surgeries have been disclosed in intimate detail in these declarations. To reveal their names would expose these individuals to an unwarranted invasion of their privacy rights and rights to dignity and would violate their physician-patient privilege.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-10\">\u201cConsequently, this court finds it necessary to order the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-11\">\u201cNumber 1, the declarations contained in the plaintiff\u2019s opposition filed in Maywood, et al. versus Hoefflin, et al. on or about February 16, 1999, are to remain sealed based on the physician-patient privilege and the patients\u2019 rights to privacy and dignity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-12\">\u201cSecondly, counsel are ordered to meet and confer and establish a system for identifying the individuals in neutral terms, such as \u2018patient number 1\u2019 or \u2018visitor number 1.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>\u201cThe use of a neutral patient identification system, this court finds, will protect the privileges of the patients and yet allow for complete discovery in the aggressive litigation of this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-4\">\u201cNo party, attorney, or their agents and employees shall reveal or state nor in any manner release or publish any information which would identify any patient of Dr. Hoefflin, Dr. Hurvitz, or Dr. Goodstein by name or initials, occupation, physical attributes and/or distinguishing physical features.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-5\">\u201cI want to make it clear, ladies and gentlemen, that I am not preventing you from talking about what you believe happened to the patients or happened in the rooms, in the operating room or wherever else. I simply am trying to protect the right to privacy and the physician-patient privileges and the right to dignity of people who are not part of this lawsuit. I am not in any way trying to restrain you from discussing or talking about, sending e-mails, writing your friends, calling your mother, or any other communication that deals with the actions that you believe occurred during the treatment of these people. I\u2019m simply trying to protect the rights of nonparties to this lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-6\">\u201cAny documents filed with this court in the future shall have the names of these patients redacted and substituted with a neutral designation previously agreed to among the parties. This order also applies to depositions distributed to others apart from the attorneys, parties and their agents and employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-7\">\u201cEach party, all witnesses and deposition officers shall be provided with a copy of this order in giving testimony in connection with this lawsuit or being interviewed in connection therewith.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1078-8\">After the February 26 hearing, counsel for the parties engaged in several sessions, among themselves and with the trial court, in an attempt to agree on a final protective order. At a final hearing on March 5, 1999, the trial court rejected appellants\u2019 proposed order restricting only the dissemination of information obtained through discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-9\">The trial court\u2019s written order, filed on March 19, 1999, contained the trial court\u2019s findings as expressed at the February 26 hearing, and contained more details about how patients should be referred to in connection with the lawsuit and procedures regarding depositions and deposition transcripts. The order defined \u201cconfidential information\u201d as \u201cany information which would identify any Patient, including but not limited to the Patients\u2019 name or initials, occupation, physical attributes, and/or distinguishing physical features.\u201d It specifically prohibited \u201crevealing, stating or in any manner releasing or publishing\u201d any confidential information without prior court approval, whether the information was obtained via discovery or independently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>The Hurvitzes appealed and contend the order, as well as the trial court\u2019s order sealing the former employees\u2019 declaration, constitutes an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech to the extent it enjoins them from disseminating information learned outside the discovery process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">The right to free speech is, of course, one of the cornerstones of our society. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides \u201cCongress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The California Constitution is even broader: \u201cEvery person may freely speak, write and publish his or her sentiments, on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of this right. A law may not restrain or abridge liberty of speech or press.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">As our Supreme Court explained over 100 years ago, \u201cThe wording of this section is terse and vigorous, and its meaning so plain that construction is not needed. The right of the citizen to freely speak, write, and publish his sentiments is unlimited, but he is responsible at the hands of the law for an abuse of that right. He shall have no censor over him to whom he must apply for permission to speak, write, or publish, but he shall be held accountable to the law for what he speaks, what he writes, and what he publishes.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">Orders which restrict or preclude a citizen from speaking in advance are known as \u201cprior restraints,\u201d and are disfavored and presumptively invalid.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Gag orders on trial participants are unconstitutional unless (1) the speech sought to be restrained poses a clear and present danger or serious and imminent threat to a protected competing interest; (2) the order is narrowly tailored to protect that interest; and (3) no less restrictive alternatives are available.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court must make express findings showing it applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>this standard and considered and weighed the competing interests.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As the reviewing court, we make an independent examination of the entire record to determine the constitutionality of the trial court\u2019s order in light of this standard.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">Here, the trial court found the confidential information was protected by the physician-patient privilege. It further found the dissemination of the information \u201cmight prejudice potential jurors.\u201d Finally, it found the information was protected by the patients\u2019 rights of \u201cprivacy and dignity.\u201d While we agree with the trial court these are important considerations, we cannot agree they are sufficient to justify prior restraint on the parties\u2019 speech in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">I. The Mere Possibility of Prejudice to Potential Jurors Does Not Justify the Prior Restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">The trial court based its order in part on its finding \u201cneedless dissemination of this privileged information . . . might prejudice potential jurors.\u201d This does not constitute a finding a risk of prejudice actually exists, and indeed there is no evidence in the record to support such a finding. Where a party contends his or her right to a fair trial has been or will be compromised by pretrial publicity, the law has long imposed on that party the burden of producing evidence to establish the prejudice.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201c[I]t is not enough for a court to decide that the fair trial right <em>may </em>be affected by the exercise of free speech.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Here, the trial court\u2019s ruling relies on just such speculation. This is not enough to support the prior restraint on speech.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>II. The Physician-patient Privilege Does Not Justify the Prior Restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">The trial court also found the confidential information was protected by the physician-patient privilege. The parties dispute whether the privilege applies, but even if we assume the information is covered by the physician-patient privilege, its dissemination may not be subject to prior restraint of the type in the trial court\u2019s order.  As a rule of evidence, the physician-patient privilege applies only <em>\u201cif </em>properly invoked <em>in a proceeding in which testimony can be compelled.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The California Supreme Court made this clear in <em>Rudnick v. Superior Court,</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>when it stated \u201cit is perhaps pertinent to remember the obvious, namely, that the physician-patient privilege is a rule of evidence concerning the admissibility of evidence in court and is not a substantive rule regulating the conduct of physicians.\u201d  Thus, while the privilege protects the patient from forced disclosure in the course of litigation, it may not be extended to cover the dissemination of information already made known outside of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">To be sure, there are statutes prohibiting health care providers from disclosing confidential health care information.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, while under these statutes an unauthorized disclosure may give rise to a cause of action in tort, or various administrative sanctions against the physician, they cannot support a prior restraint on speech.  To the contrary, in <em>Gilbert, </em>the court held \u201c \u2018publication of information about a person, \u201cwithout regard to truth, falsity, or defamatory character of that information,\u201d is not subject to prior restraint.\u2019 [Citation.] While [a party] may be held responsible for abusing his right to speak freely in a subsequent tort action, he has the initial right to speak freely without censorship.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This rationale applies with equal force to speech which is violative of a privilege or which subjects the speaker to administrative or professional sanctions.  And indeed, respondent can point to no case where any court in the nation has held a threatened violation of the physician-patient privilege, or any other privilege, justifies a prior restraint on speech.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>III. The Patients\u2019 Right to Privacy Does Not Justify the Prior Restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">Finally, the trial court based its order on a finding that publication of the confidential information would violate the patients\u2019 rights of \u201cprivacy and dignity.\u201d The things Hoefflin is alleged to have done to his anaesthetized patients are vulgar and crude in the extreme, and we do not doubt those patients, if identified, would suffer embarrassment and shame. However, sparing citizens from embarrassment, shame, or even intrusions into their privacy has never been held to outweigh the guarantees of free speech in our federal and state Constitutions. Just as a court may not enjoin speech which constitutes the tort of defamation,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> it also may not enjoin the speech at issue here, which may or may not ultimately be found to constitute the tort of invasion of privacy. Indeed, we are aware of no case in any jurisdiction in which a prior restraint has been imposed to prevent an intrusion into privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\"><em>In re Marriage of Candiotti (Candiotti)</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>demonstrates a prior restraint on speech may not be constitutionally imposed to prevent the dissemination of information obtained outside the discovery process, even if it is libelous and even if it invades a person\u2019s privacy. In Candiotti, the family law court restrained a mother, Debra, from \u201cdisseminating information to third parties about the background of her ex-husband[\u2019s] present wife, Donna.\u201d The trial court based its order on concern for the welfare of the minor children, who it feared would be harmed by exposure to negative information about their stepmother.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Notably, even the trial court rejected a justification based on Donna\u2019s right to privacy, and concluded \u201cif Donna\u2019s privacy right alone was at issue, Debra\u2019s right to free speech would clearly prevail.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Court of Appeal struck down the order to the extent it covered information obtained outside the discovery process, holding the order \u201cconstitutes undue prior restraint of speech\u201d to the extent it \u201cactually imping[ed] on a parent\u2019s right to speak about another adult, outside the presence of the children.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The court held the order was unconstitutional because it was \u201caimed at conduct that might cause others, outside the immediate family, to think ill of Donna. Such remarks by Debra may be rude or unkind. They may be motivated by hostility. To the extent they are libelous, they may be actionable. But they are too attenuated from conduct directly affecting the children to support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>prior restraint on Debra\u2019s constitutional right to utter them.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In this case, too, there can be no constitutional justification for a prior restraint on speech, solely because it may invade the patients\u2019 privacy or cause others to think ill of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">The order in this case is particularly troubling because of its chilling effect on the litigants\u2019 ability to properly prepare for trial. Every third party witness must be shown the order, and agree to be bound thereby, before counsel can interview them about the case. Thus, unless a witness agrees to voluntarily have his or her right of free speech curtailed on penalty of contempt of court, he or she may not be interviewed or deposed. This burden on the parties\u2019 ability to freely communicate with witnesses and potential witnesses is not justified, even by the patients\u2019 right to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">The burden on the parties\u2019 ability to prepare for trial is especially unwarranted because at this point the confidential information has already been made public by means of the former employees\u2019 declarations, which were in the public record for one day before they were sealed, and the contents were widely reported as a result. Indeed, those reports are available on the Internet even now. As the court held in <em>Sipple v. Chronicle Publishing Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cthere can be no privacy with respect to a matter which is already public or which has previously become part of the \u2018public domain.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In its order, the trial court acknowledged \u201conce the information is released, unlike a physical object, it cannot be recaptured and sealed.\u201d We agree with this assessment, and we agree with appellants that it reveals why the order is unconstitutional: because the information is already public, the harm to the patients\u2019 privacy has already occurred and cannot be prevented by the order. While we are sympathetic to the trial court\u2019s concerns, neither the state nor the federal Constitution permits the court to lock the bam door after the horse is gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>At oral argument, respondents cited <em>Michaels v. Internet Entertainment Group, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in support of their contention the right to privacy constitutes a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d sufficient to justify a prior restraint on speech. <em>Michaels </em>is distinguishable. In <em>Michaels, </em>a well-known actress and a rock star sought and obtained an injunction against the dissemination of a video of them having sexual relations, on three grounds: copyright infringement, violation of the state law right to publicity, and tortious violation of the right to privacy.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The trial court granted the requested injunction, finding the plaintiffs had, on all three of their claims, showed the requisite combination of likelihood of success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In this case, as appellant points out, respondents did not even attempt to comply with the requirements for obtaining a preliminary injunction, including demonstrating likelihood of success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury, or posting a bond. Indeed, as there is no claim for tortious invasion of privacy before the court, it is difficult for us to imagine how respondents would even begin to meet those requirements. Therefore, <em>Michaels </em>does not provide authority for the trial court\u2019s order in this case.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">IV. The Trial Court\u2019s Sealing Order Is Also Unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">In light of our conclusion the trial court\u2019s order restricting dissemination of the confidential information does not withstand constitutional scrutiny, we also must vacate the trial court\u2019s order sealing the former employees\u2019 declaration.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \u201cCourt records are public records, available to the public in general, including news reporters, unless a specific exception makes specific records nonpublic.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> No such specific exception applies in this case because, as we have seen, there is no overriding public interest to justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>restrictions on the dissemination of confidential information obtained outside of the discovery process. Moreover, as discussed above, the former employees\u2019 declaration was part of the public record for one day, during which time it was widely reported in the media, and it makes little sense to seal information after the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">The order is reversed to the extent it applies to information obtained independently of discovery. To the extent it applies to information obtained through discovery, it is affirmed. The order sealing the records in the trial court is vacated, and the record on appeal is also ordered unsealed. All parties to bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">Woods, J., and Neal, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-8\">The petition of respondent Steven M. Hoefflin for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 21, 2001. Baxter, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1073-12\">Appellants\u2019 brief contains a 24-page \u201cstatement of the case,\u201d, consisting in large part of statements of purported fact supported only by reference to the many press clippings included in their request for judicial notice.
