Because dismissal with prejudice, as it was here,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is a drastic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>sanction,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we have studied the record on appeal with meticulous care. Finding, however, no abuse of discretion in the circumstances of the case, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">This action, filed by appellants on July 3, 1969, sought specific performance of a contract to purchase real estate in the District of Columbia or, in the alternative, damages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellees filed an answer to the complaint and a counterclaim seeking damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Discovery was subsequently completed<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the case was pretried on December 1, 1971, and apparently was then ready for trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On January 7, 1972, the case was reassigned to a District Judge<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and, we are told, was set for trial on the following May 8 but was thereafter continued indefinitely on appellants\u2019 motion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> From that point onward, the docket reflects no action whatever until shortly prior to the order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-13\">On September 27, 1973, the District Judge wrote to counsel for the opposing parties requesting each to advise, within ten days, as to the status of the case. Appellants, who had moved from nearby Maryland to Kentucky,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> were telephonically contacted by their counsel on October 1, whereupon they stated that they were ready for trial. During the telephone conversation, counsel explained that he would send to appellants a letter formally requesting advice as to their trial readiness, and that he wanted confirmation of that fact in writing. Counsel\u2019s letter was sent on the same day<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and, no response having been received, counsel renewed his request by another letter on October 15,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but still there was no response from appellants. Meanwhile appellees had replied by letter of October 2, stating their \u201cview that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>case should be dismissed without prejudice by the failure of [appellants] to diligently prosecute the case, particularly in view of the difficulties that now arise in the trial of the case because of the passage of time.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On October 31, the District Judge ordered the action dismissed for want of prosecution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Appellants then presented a timely motion to set the order of dismissal aside, declaring their preparedness for trial. The motion referred to counsel\u2019s letters and represented that appellants received the first but not the second, but thought that the first letter was simply a confirmation of the telephone conversation and did not require an answer. Appellees opposed the motion, charging that after the case was pretried appellants \u201cessentially disappeared from sight and took no further steps to prosecute the case.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The response in opposition called attention to the fact that appellants had not \u201cexplained] why they have failed to prosecute the case for almost two years\u201d;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> it also averred that \u201c[m]any of the witnesses to the very complex transaction that took place in 1968 and 1969 are no longer available,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and that the delay had unfairly advantaged appellants and disad.vantaged appellees.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-14\">The District Judge convened a hearing on the motion and entertained argument by counsel for the parties. Counsel for appellants referred to his telephone call and the ensuing letters, and attributed the lack of an answer to a mixup in communications. The judge observed that counsel\u2019s explanation \u201cjust has to do with what happened since October of \u201973,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and that his \u201cconcern is what happened two years from December of \u201971.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Counsel\u2019s reply was that \u201cwe were awaiting word as to what the condition of your trial calendar was so that we could go forward.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Counsel for appellees reminded that in May, 1972 \u201cat [appellants\u2019] request the case was taken off the calendar\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and that appellants had \u201cdone nothing since that time, taken no further steps in the matter.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Counsel repeated his claim that appellees \u201cwould be greatly prejudiced\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> by reason of uncertainty as to the availability of witnesses and documents.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The judge took the matter under advisement and later denied the motion to reinstate the action.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">In <em>Link v. Wabash Railroad Company,</em><footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the Supreme Court dealt extensively with the power and discretion of federal courts to dismiss lawsuits for want of prosecution. There, in a personal injury case, a district judge set a date for a pretrial conference, and two hours before the appointed time counsel for the plaintiff telephoned from a point 160 miles away to inform the judge\u2019s secretary that because of other pressing business he could not be present but would be available on the next day and the day following. The conference nevertheless went forward and the judge, after reviewing the history of the litigation, announced that it would be dismissed <em>sua sponte </em>for failure of diligent prosecution. The prominent facts, aside from the absence of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney from the conference, were that six years had passed since the case was filed, three years since the plaintiff had prevailed on defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings, and two fixed trial dates had been postponed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The dismissal, the Supreme Court held, was within the district judge\u2019s authority,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> which he could appropriately exercise on his own motion.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> On the facts of the case, the Court further held, the judge did not abuse his discretion in doing so. Although counsel\u2019s absence from the pretrial conference, in light of the history of the c\u00e1se, permitted an inference that the plaintiff had deliberately been dilatory in proceeding,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> the Court made clear that its affirmance of the district judge\u2019s action was predicated on the full circumstances of the case.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-13\">In the case at bar, the dismissal came after the District Judge received no reply to his status inquiry from appellants\u2019 counsel \u2014 because counsel never got the written confirmation on trial readiness which, quite understandably, he sought from his clients. The order of dismissal awaited three times-over the ten-day period within which responses to the judge\u2019s request were to have been made.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> After appellants moved to vacate the dismissal, the judge conducted a hearing, listened to counsels\u2019 arguments and took the motion under advisement before issuing his ruling. Certainly it cannot be said that the District Judge did not handle the matter judiciously.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Mere lapse of time does not warrant dismissal when the plaintiff has been diligent throughout;<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> speed simply for the sake of speed is not the purpose to be served.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> As <em>Link </em>makes plain, whether there has been a \u201cfailure to prosecute\u201d is to be determined upon a consideration of all pertinent circumstances,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and it is evident from the District Judge\u2019s expressed concern at the hearing about overall delay that he followed that course.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The critical fact was that the case had lain dormant for nearly seventeen months after it became ripe for trial.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The failure to inform the judge, upon his inquiry, that appellants could proceed to trial thus was but the culmination of a history of inactivity which was not persuasively accounted for.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">We cannot view appellants\u2019 omission to confirm their trial readiness, and their attorney\u2019s consequent inability to suitably respond to the judge\u2019s status call, differently from counsel\u2019s failure in <em>Link </em>to appear at the pretrial conference, or from other types of delinquencies which have capped a period of protracted idleness.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> By the same token, the District Judge was at liberty to view that omission in light of the inertia which had preceded it.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> To be sure, an adequate explanation may avert a delay otherwise justifying dismissal;<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> even a misunderstanding may excuse.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> But the judge was not required to accept appellants\u2019 statement that they misread their counsel\u2019s unambiguous call for written confirmation of their preparedness for trial.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Moreover, the essential question was whether upon the whole proceeding appellants had manifested reasonable diligence.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> That a litigant is aroused from his slumber by the imminence of dismissal is hardly an excuse which a court is compelled to abide.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-13\">Dismissal for want of prosecution summons the judge to a high degree of judicial discretion.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> It is well settled that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>his action will be reversed only for abuse.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Here the District Judge faced up to the crucial question and concluded that appellants had been inexcusably dilatory. From aught that appears, appellees had no responsibility for the delay<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and there was positive indication that the delay had operated prejudicially to them.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> We find no abuse in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">The orders appealed from are accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b34-19\">. \u201cFor failure of the plaintiff to prosecute ., a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against him. .

Appellants, husband and wife, contracted on January 4, 1968, to purchase from appellees, five individuals doing business as a limited partnership, a parcel of real estate improved by an apartment building at the price of $450,000. Appellants paid $22,500 and by the terms of the contract were to discharge the balance of indebtedness secured by two existing deeds of trust and to give a third deed of trust to appellees. Appellants\u2019 complaint charges that appellees thereafter refused to consummate the sale, and they claim payment of an aggregate of $81,996, either to appellees or on account of the deed-of-trust obligations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b35-8\">. The answer attributes responsibility for nonperformance of the contract to appellants. It further asserts that after execution of the contract appellants collected $101,327 in rents, failed to maintain the premises in proper repair and thereby necessitated the expenditure of more than $14,000 by appellees, and defaulted in the mortgage payments assumed. The counterclaim sought judgment against appellants in the sum of $59,596, representing the claimed losses minus credits to which appellants appeared to be entitled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b35-9\">.

The power to invoke this sanction is necessary in order to prevent undue delays in the disposition of pending cases and to avoid congestion in the calendars of the District Courts. The power is of ancient origin, having its roots in judgments of <em>nonsuit </em>and <em>non prosequitur </em>entered at common law . and dismissals for want of prosecution of bills in equity . . <em>.Id. </em>at 629-630, 82 S.Ct. at 1388, 8 L.Ed.2d at 737-738 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b37-10\">. It was argued that Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) permits dismissal for want of prosecution only on a defendant\u2019s motion, and that by negative implication the rule forbids dismissals by the court sua <em>sponte. </em>This argument was rejected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-11\">Neither the permissive language of the Rule \u2014 which merely authorizes a motion by the defendant \u2014 nor its policy requires us to conclude that it was the purpose of the Rule to abrogate the power of courts, acting on their own initiative, to clear their calendars of cases that have remained dormant because of the inaction or dilatoriness of the parties seeking relief. The authority of a court to dismiss <em>sua sponte </em>for lack of prosecution has generally been considered an \u201cinherent power,\u201d governed not by rule or statute but by the control necessarily vested in courts to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.
