The five counts of identity theft arose from defendant\u2019s possession of the victim\u2019s wallet, which contained various forms of the victim\u2019s personal identification. On appeal, defendant contends that \u201c[t]he trial court erred in failing to merge Counts 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 into one conviction of identity theft.\u201d According to defendant, \u201c[b]ecause [his] conduct constituted multiple violations of the same statutory provision, harmed the same victim, and was simultaneous rather than separated by any pause,\u201d the trial court should have merged the identity theft convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The state concedes that the trial court erred in that regard. We agree and accept the concession. ORS 161.067(3) (\u201cWhen the same conduct or criminal episode violates only one statutory provision and involves only one victim, but nevertheless involves repeated violations of the same statutory provision against the same victim, there are as many separately punishable offenses as there are violations, except that each violation, to be separately punishable under this subsection, must be separated from other such violations by a sufficient pause in the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct to afford the defendant an opportunity to renounce the criminal intent.\u201d); <em>State v. Merrick, </em>224 Or App 471, 472-73, 197 P3d 624 (2008) (holding that ORS 161.067(3) required the merger of the defendant\u2019s three convictions for first-degree possession of a forged instrument arising from one occasion when the defendant possessed several counterfeit bills).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Reversed and remanded for merger of convictions for identity theft and for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
