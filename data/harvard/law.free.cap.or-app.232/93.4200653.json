The Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (the board) determined that, because claimant\u2019s errand was not a recreational or social activity performed primarily for her personal pleasure, and because claimant\u2019s employer controlled the parking lot where the fall occurred, the injury was sufficiently work-related to be compensable. Legacy Health Systems, the self-insured employer, seeks judicial review. We agree that claimant\u2019s injury did not occur during a social or recreational activity and that it occurred \u201cin the course of\u2019 employment, but, because the board failed to determine whether the injury arose \u201cout of\u2019 claimant\u2019s employment, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The following facts are undisputed. During a paid morning break from her work as a patient care coordinator at employer\u2019s hospital in northwest Portland, claimant decided to deposit a personal check at a credit union located at a different part of employer\u2019s campus. She left the hospital, crossed a street, and started to cut across a parking lot. While in the lot, she slipped on ice and fell, fracturing her right ankle. Another hospital employee, entering the lot to park her car, found claimant and came to her assistance. A hospital security guard arrived and filled out an incident report, and an ambulance took claimant to the emergency room.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Claimant filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim with employer, and employer denied it on the ground that the injury did not arise out of and in the course of employment. ORS 656.005(7)(a). Claimant requested a hearing. The administrative law judge (ALJ) determined that the injury was compensable and reversed the denial. The ALJ concluded, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">\u201cAt the outset, I do not agree with the employer\u2019s argument that claimant was engaged in a recreational activity primarily for her personal pleasure. I do not believe that visiting a credit union is a \u2018recreational\u2019 activity primarily for her personal pleasure. I do not believe that this is the type of activity contemplated by the statute. ORS 656.005(7)(b)(B) does not apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\">\u201cI conclude that * * * the going and coming rule and the parking lot exception to that rule should be applied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">\u201cGenerally, under the \u2018going and coming rule,\u2019 injuries sustained while going to or coming from the workplace are not compensable. However, an exception to the \u2018going and coming\u2019 rule is the \u2018parking lot rule.\u2019 Under that exception, when an employee traveling to or from work sustains an injury \u2018on or near\u2019 the employer\u2019s premises, the \u2018in the course of portion of the work-connection test may be satisfied if\u2018the employer exercises some \u201ccontrol\u201d over the place where the injury is sustained.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">\u201cIn this case, claimant was going to the credit union on the employer\u2019s campus on her paid break and was crossing a parking lot used by the employer when she slipped on ice and fell sustaining an injury. A security guard employed by the employer responded and filled out an incident report. This fact establishes that the lot where claimant fell was controlled by the employer. Under the circumstances presented here, I conclude that claimant\u2019s injuries arose out of the course and scope of her employment. In this regard, when claimant\u2019s injuries occurred, she was in the course of her employment and was taking her paid break. She was injured by a hazard (ice) on an employer controlled area of the employer\u2019s campus. Claimant was permitted to stay on the employer\u2019s campus during her paid break and was allowed to go to the credit union at the employer\u2019s facilities. Under such circumstances, I find that claimant\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course and scope of her employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">(Citations omitted.) The ALJ noted, \u201cBased on her demeanor at the hearing, I had no reason to question claimant\u2019s credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">The board affirmed the AL J\u2019s order with supplemental findings. In particular, the board noted that the \u201cparking lot\u201d rule applied and that \u201cthere is sufficient evidence that claimant was injured on the employer\u2019s premises.\u201d Employer seeks judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">To be compensable, an injury must \u201caris[e] out of and in the course of employment,\u201d ORS 656.005(7)(a), a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>two-part requirement often referred to as the \u201cunitary work-connection inquiry.\u201d An injury must satisfy both requirements, although \u201cthe work-connection test may be satisfied if the factors supporting one prong are minimal while the factors supporting the other prong are many.\u201d <em>Krushwitz v. McDonald\u2019s Restaurants, </em>323 Or 520, 531, 919 P2d 465 (1996) (citing <em>Phil A. Livesley Co. v. Russ, </em>296 Or 25, 28, 672 P2d 337 (1983)). To occur \u201cin the course of\u201d employment, \u201cthe time, place, and circumstances of the injury [must] justify connecting the injury to the employment.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Nabisco, Inc., </em>331 Or 178, 186, 11 P3d 1286 (2000). To satisfy the \u201carising out of\u2019 employment prong, there must be \u201csome causal link\u201d between the injury and the employment. <em>Krushwitz, </em>323 Or at 525-26. That link exists if employment exposes the worker to some risk from which the injury originates. <em>Fred Meyer, Inc. v. Hayes, </em>325 Or 592, 601, 943 P2d 197 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Before determining whether an injury meets the primary requirement for compensability that is captured in the \u201carising out of and in the course of employment\u201d test, however, we must address a prior question. ORS 656.005(7)(b)(B) categorically excludes from coverage any injury resulting from a social or recreational activity that a worker was engaged in primarily for the worker\u2019s personal pleasure. \u201c[0]nly after we have concluded that an injury was not suffered while engaging in a recreational or social activity primarily for the worker\u2019s personal pleasure do we consider whether the injury arose out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d <em>Roberts v. SAIF, </em>196 Or App 414, 417, 102 P3d 752 (2004), <em>aff'd, </em>341 Or 48, 136 P3d 1105 (2006) (citing <em>Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp. v. Nichols, </em>186 Or App 664, 667, 64 P3d 1152 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We therefore begin with that prior inquiry. In <em>Roberts, </em>341 Or at 52, the Supreme Court explained that the inquiry involves a three-step analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">\u201cTextually, ORS 656.005(7)(b)(B) raises three questions. The first is whether the worker was engaged in or performing a \u2018recreational or social activitfy].\u2019 The second is whether the worker incurred the injury \u2018while engaging in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>or performing, or as the result of engaging in or performing,\u2019 that activity. The final question is whether the worker engaged in or performed the activity \u2018primarily for the worker\u2019s personal pleasure.\u2019 If the answer to all those questions is \u2018yes,\u2019 then the worker cannot recover.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The phrase \u201crecreational or social activities\u201d is not defined by statute or rule. Employer concedes that claimant was not engaged in a \u201csocial\u201d activity, and we agree; she was walking alone, from a workstation, to her credit union. For purposes of ORS 656.005(7)(b)(B), we previously adopted the dictionary definition of \u201crecreation\u201d: \u201c \u2018the act of recreating or state of being recreated : refreshment of the strength and spirits after toil: DIVERSION, PLAY * * * a means of getting diversion or entertainment * * *[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Roberts, </em>196 Or App at 418 (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1899 (unabridged ed 1993)). Here, as noted, the board confirmed the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that walking to a credit union to deposit a check is not the type of activity contemplated by ORS 656.005(7)(b)(B). We agree. As the Supreme Court has explained, the exclusion for \u201crecreational or social activities\u201d was a legislative reaction to <em>Beneficiaries of McBroom v. Chamber of Commerce, 11 </em>Or App 700, 713 P2d 1095, <em>rev den, </em>301 Or 240 (1986), a case in which this court found compensable the death of a travelling salesman who, on a business trip to Los Angeles, became extremely inebriated and drowned in his hotel\u2019s hot tub. <em>Roberts, </em>341 Or at 53. Further, we have noted that the typical \u201crecreational activity\u201d case involves \u201coff-the-job group recreational or social activities such as picnics, office parties, or organized or spontaneous sports or games.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>196 Or App at 416 (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Claimant\u2019s activity in the present case does not fit the established definition, nor is it the kind of activity that we have previously recognized as \u201crecreational.\u201d Claimant was walking to the bank, while on the clock; by no stretch of the imagination can we conclude that she was refreshing her strength and spirits after toil or engaged in play, diversion, or entertainment. <em>Id. </em>at 418. Nor does walking to the bank to deposit a check bear any kind of relationship to soaking in a hot tub, picnicking, or engaging in a game or sport. It is true that walking can, in some circumstances, be social (a group hike), refreshing to the spirit after toil (a stroll along the river <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>after work on a warm spring day), or a sport (a 10-kilometer walk race). The ALJ, however, found that, when claimant walked toward the credit union in this case, she was not engaged in refreshment of strength and spirit after toil, or in diversion or play. The board agreed. Substantial evidence supports that finding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In response to questions regarding the purpose of her errand, claimant testified only that she wanted to perform personal banking business.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">We therefore turn to the question whether claimant\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of her employment. To occur \u201cin the course of\u2019 employment, \u201cthe time, place, and circumstances of the injury [must] justify connecting the injury to the employment.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>331 Or at 186. Injuries sustained while an employee is going to or coming from the place of employment generally do not occur within the course of employment. <em>Norpac Foods, Inc. v. Gilmore, </em>318 Or 363, 366, 867 P2d 1373 (1994). The \u201cparking lot\u201d rule, however, provides one exception: An injury sustained on premises controlled by the employer while an employee is coming to or going from work occurs within the \u201ccourse of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367. Further, we held in <em>Hearthstone Manor v. Stuart, </em>192 Or App 153, 158, 84 P3d 208 (2004), that we could discern no reason to distinguish, for purposes of the parking lot rule, between a worker\u2019s injury while going to or coming from work at the beginning or end of the work day, on the one hand, and an injury incurred while going to or coming from lunch, on the other. Likewise, we see no distinction between lunch and a break. Further, we find no significance to the fact that, in <em>Hearthstone Manor, </em>the worker was injured during an unpaid period, while in the present case claimant was \u201con the clock.\u201d The parking lot rule, after all, is one way of measuring the extent to which an injury occurs in the course of employment. The fact that the injury in this case occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>during a paid break actually makes the work connection in this case <em>stronger </em>than the one in <em>Hearthstone Manor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Thus, if claimant was injured in a place over which employer exercised some control, the injury meets the criteria for the parking lot exception. The board expressly found that employer exercised control over the parking lot. Employer makes a one-sentence assertion that the finding is not supported by substantial evidence. We disagree. Claimant testified that she believed the lot was owned and controlled by employer. After she fell, she was assisted by another of employer\u2019s workers who was using the lot to park her car. Employer\u2019s security guard came to claimant\u2019s aid. And, most significantly, employer offered no evidence suggesting that it did <em>not </em>control the lot. We therefore conclude that claimant met her burden of establishing that she was injured while leaving work on a break in a parking lot controlled by employer. The injury therefore occurred in the course of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">However, to prove compensability, a claimant must establish both parts of the unitary work-connection test, including whether the injury arose \u201cout of\u2019 the employment. An</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">\u201cemployer * * * is not liable for any and all injuries to its employees] irrespective of their cause, and the fact that an employe[e] is injured on the premises during working hours does not of itself establish a compensable injury. The employe[e] must show a causal link between the occurrence of the injury and a risk connected with his or her employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-7\"><em>Phil A. Livesley Co., </em>296 Or at 29. Employer argues that neither the ALJ nor the board addressed the \u201carising out of\u2019 aspect of the work-connection test. We agree. Nothing in either opinion deals with that question, either directly or by implication. For that reason, we reverse and remand the case to the board for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-6\"> Under the three-part analysis mandated by <em>Roberts, </em>341 Or at 52, the abstract nature of the activity presents a question (social or recreational?) that is distinct from the actor\u2019s state of mind while acting (primarily for the claimant\u2019s personal pleasure?). As this case demonstrates, the two inquiries are not easily separated. Our determination' \u2014 walking may be recreational or not, depending on the circumstances, and under the circumstances here it was not \u2014 could equally be presented as a determination that claimant\u2019s activity was for claimant\u2019s business and not primarily for her personal pleasure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
