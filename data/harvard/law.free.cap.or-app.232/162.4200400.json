The auto policy contains an omnibus clause that provides that the policy covers anyone using the car with the permission of the \u201cpolicyholder.\u201d Plaintiff brought an action against the driver and a passenger in the car, neither of whom had permission from the named insureds to use the car when the accident occurred. Plaintiff contended that the named insureds\u2019 daughter, who was listed as a driver in the auto policy, was a policyholder and had given the driver and passenger permission to use the car. She also contended that, even if the daughter was not a policyholder, as a matter of law, her permission was sufficient to extend coverage to the driver and passenger under the \u201cinitial permission\u201d rule. The trial court directed a verdict in defendant\u2019s favor. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The facts material to our decision are not in dispute. The car in question was purchased by Jim and Gayle Ritz for their daughter Jillian, who was a college student at the time, to use.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the car was registered in the names of all three and Jillian was its primary driver, Jim and Gayle, who paid for the car and for its upkeep, considered the car to be theirs and maintained a certain level of control over it. Specifically, they instructed Jillian that she was not to allow anyone else to drive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">In spite of that instruction, Jillian allowed her boyfriend, Dillon Franklin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to use the car on occasion. On the night of the accident at issue in this case, Franklin used the car to take three other people, including his friend Jason Barker, from Newport to a party in Depoe Bay. At the party, Barker and Franklin became intoxicated. At some point, the two of them decided to go back to Newport. Barker believed that he was \u201cin better shape\u201d than Franklin, so he asked for the keys to the car, which Franklin gave him. On the way back to Newport, the car crossed the center line and collided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>head-on with a pickup, which plaintiffs husband was driving. He died from his injuries. Franklin also suffered serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Plaintiff brought a wrongful death action against Barker and Franklin, both of whom tendered their defense to defendant. Franklin also brought a personal injury action against Barker, who tendered his defense in that case to defendant as well. Defendant refused to defend either Barker or Franklin. Barker and Franklin stipulated to judgments in plaintiffs favor and assigned to her whatever indemnity rights they have against defendant. Barker also stipulated to a judgment in Franklin\u2019s favor. Franklin assigned plaintiff 50 percent of his indemnity rights for that action. Plaintiff then brought this action against defendant, claiming that it was obligated to defend both Barker and Franklin and to pay the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The trial court ruled that Jillian was not a policyholder under the terms of the auto policy and thus could not, for purposes of insurance coverage, grant permission to Barker and Franklin to use the car. It construed the term \u201cpolicyholder\u201d to mean \u201cone who holds the policy, one who owns or purchases the policy, one who is able to exercise control over the policy.\u201d From there, it concluded that the named insureds are the persons who purchase and control the policy. Thus, it concluded that Jim and Gayle, the named insureds on the auto policy, were the only policyholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">With respect to the personal umbrella policy, the court concluded that, other than providing a higher liability limit, its coverage was coextensive with the auto policy. In other words, it concluded that the umbrella policy also covered permissive users of vehicles owned by Jim and Gayle. In light of its determination that Barker and Franklin were not permissive users, however, it concluded that the policy did not provide coverage in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Defendant moved for a directed verdict. At plaintiffs request, the court agreed to defer ruling on the motion, and a jury trial was held to determine whether Jillian had actually given either Barker or Franklin permission to use the car and whether Franklin had given Barker permission. The jury found that permission had been given in each instance. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>court then directed a verdict in defendant\u2019s favor based on its conclusion that Jillian was not a policyholder. It also granted a partial directed verdict on the question whether Jillian had actually given Barker permission to use the car, concluding that there was no evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding in that respect. The court also ruled that defendant did not have a duty to defend Barker and Franklin.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Plaintiff appeals, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s rulings on defendant\u2019s motions for directed verdict and to its ruling on the issue of defendant\u2019s duty to defend Barker and Franklin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In her first assignment of error, plaintiff challenges the trial court\u2019s conclusion that, under both policies, only Jim and Gayle could grant permission to use the car. Plaintiff makes two arguments in support of that assignment. First, she contends that Jillian was a policyholder under the auto policy and, accordingly, that her permission was sufficient to extend coverage to Barker and Franklin. Plaintiff contends that the auto policy is ambiguous as to who is a \u201cpolicyholder\u201d and, therefore, that the policy must be construed against defendant. Second, she argues that, even if Jillian was not a policyholder, as a permissive user herself, she was, as a matter of law, able to give permission to Barker and Franklin.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">We begin with plaintiffs argument that Jillian was a policyholder under the auto policy. To address that argument, we must construe the policy to determine the meaning of the word \u201cpolicyholder.\u201d The goal in interpreting an insurance policy is to determine the intent of the parties, <em>North Pacific Ins. Co. v. Hamilton, </em>332 Or 20, 24, 22 P3d 739 (2001), as interpreted from the perspective of the \u201cordinary purchaser of insurance.\u201d <em>Totten v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>298 Or 765, 771, 696 P2d 1082 (1985). In determining the parties\u2019 intent, the first step is to examine the text of the policy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>determine whether it is susceptible to more than one plausible interpretation. <em>Andres v. American Standard Ins. Co., </em>205 Or App 419, 423, 134 P3d 1061 (2006). The text of the policy includes any definitions given in the policy. <em>Id. </em>When a term is undefined in an insurance policy, \u201cwe identify the ordinary meaning of the term and examine both the immediate context in which it is used and the broader context of the policy as a whole to determine whether there remains any ambiguity about what the parties [to the policy] intended.\u201d <em>Mutual of Enumclaw Ins. Co. v. Rohde, </em>170 Or App 574, 579, 13 P3d 1006 (2000). If the ambiguity persists, we construe the policy against the drafter, in this case, defendant. <em>Hoffman Construction Co. v. Fred S. James &amp; Co., </em>313 Or 464, 470-71, 836 P2d 703 (1992). Although ordinary rules of contract interpretation generally apply to the interpretation of an insurance policy, extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intent is not part of the interpretation of an insurance policy under Oregon law. <em>Employers Insurance of Wausau v. Tektronix, Inc., </em>211 Or App 485, 502-03, 505, 156 P3d 105, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 363 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">The policy at issue here begins with policy declarations. The first page of the policy declarations provides a summary and a statement of the total premium. The summary consists of four sections separated by horizontal lines. The first section begins with \u201cNAMED INSURED(S),\u201d followed by \u201cJimmy Roy &amp; Gayle L Ritz\u201d and their address. It then states, \u2018TOUR ALLSTATE AGENT IS,\u201d and lists the name, telephone number, and address of the agent. It then states, \u2018TOUR BILL lists your payment options.\u201d The second section states the policy number and the period of coverage. The third section states, \u201cDRIVER(S) LISTED,\u201d followed by \u201cJimmy Roy,\u201d \u201cGayle L,\u201d and \u201cJillian.\u201d It also notes that no drivers are excluded from coverage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The fourth section lists the three vehicles covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The policy declarations are followed by the policy itself, which is divided into five sections: general provisions followed by provisions governing each of four different types <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>of coverage \u2014 liability, personal injury protection, uninsured motorist, and loss to the covered autos. The policy is followed by a \u201cPolicy Endorsement,\u201d which contains a number of amendments. Where applicable, we refer to the endorsement when describing the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Among the general policy provisions is a \u201cDuty To Report Policy Changes,\u201d which states, in part, \u201cYour policy was issued in reliance on the information you provided concerning autos and persons insured by the policy. To properly insure your auto, you should promptly notify us when you change your address or whenever any resident operators insured by your policy are added or deleted.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It states further, \u201cYou must notify us within 30 days when you acquire an additional or replacement auto or if your inoperable motor vehicle not described on the Policy Declarations becomes operational.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Another provision governs cancellation of the policy. It first states, \u201cYou may cancel this policy by writing and telling us on what future date you wish to stop coverage.\u201d It then states, \u201cAllstate may cancel part or all of this policy by mailing notice to you at your last known address.\u201d Another provision governs \u201c[n]onrenewal\u201d: \u201cIf we don\u2019t intend to continue the policy beyond the current policy period, we will mail you notice at least 30 days before the end of the policy period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The liability insurance section of the policy \u2014 the section specifically at issue in this case \u2014 states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">\u201cAllstate will pay for all damages a person insured is legally obligated to pay because of: (1) bodily injury sustained by any person, and (2) damage to or destruction of property, including loss of use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">\u201cUnder these coverages, your policy protects a person insured from liability for damages on account of accidents arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use, loading or unloading of an insured auto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\u201cWe will defend an insured person sued as the result of a covered auto accident * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">It goes on to provide who qualifies as an insured person:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGg\">\u201cPersons Insured</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">\u201c(1) While using your insured auto:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">\u201c(a) you,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">\u201c(b) any resident, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">\u201c(c) any other person using it with your permission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">The policy also defines \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d: \u201c You\u2019 or Your\u2019\u2014 means the policyholder named on the [policy declarations] and that policyholder\u2019s resident spouse.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The word \u201cpolicyholder\u201d is not defined and, aside from the definition of \u201c You\u2019 or Your,\u2019 \u201d which appears in several places, is not used anywhere else in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">As noted, plaintiff contends that Jillian was a policyholder and, thus, under the terms of the policy, was able to give Barker and Franklin permission to use the car. Plaintiff contends that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cpolicyholder\u201d means \u201cnamed insured\u201d is at odds with the rules of contract interpretation. Specifically, she contends that different terms in a policy are presumed to have different meanings. Noting that all of the persons named in the policy declarations are identified either as named insureds or as listed drivers, she contends that, because \u201cpolicyholder\u201d cannot mean either of those things, it must be construed to mean both of them. In other words, \u201cpolicyholder\u201d must refer collectively to the named insureds and the listed drivers. In light of the presumption that different terms have different meanings, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>contends, her construction of the policy is the only plausible one. At the very least, in her view, if the trial court\u2019s construction of the policy \u2014 with which defendant agrees \u2014 is plausible, her construction is plausible as well, rendering the policy ambiguous. The resulting ambiguity, she argues, requires that the policy be construed against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">We begin with the text of the policy \u2014 specifically, the word \u201cpolicyholder.\u201d Because the word is not defined in the policy, we identify its ordinary meaning, which is \u201cone (as a person or firm) granted an insurance policy.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1754 (unabridged ed 2002). \u201cPolicy,\u201d in turn, means \u201ca certificate of insurance : a writing whereby a contract of insurance is made : the document containing the contract made by an insurance company with a person whose property or life is insured * * <em>Id. </em>Those definitions suggest that a policyholder is a person who enters into a contract with an insurance company, which is consistent with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a policyholder is a person who purchases and has the right to control the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The broader policy as a whole also supports that conclusion. In the provision on the duty to report policy changes, the statement that the policy was issued \u201cin reliance on the information you provided\u201d indicates that \u201cyou\u201d refers to the persons who obtained the policy, not merely those who are insured under it. The next statement \u2014 that \u201cyou should promptly notify us when you change your address or whenever any resident operators insured by your policy are added or deleted\u201d \u2014 similarly indicates that \u201cyou\u201d refers to the persons who have control over the policy, as does the provision allowing \u201cyou\u201d to cancel the policy. We agree with the trial court that it stands to reason that the named insureds are the persons who obtain and control an insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The broader context also suggests that \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d refer to the named insureds. The first page of the policy declarations identifies the named insureds and immediately thereafter identifies \u2018YOUR ALLSTATE AGENT\u201d and explains that \u2018YOUR BILL lists your billing options.\u201d The proximity of those statements suggests that \u2018YOUR\u201d refers to the named insureds. Furthermore, the provision allowing defendant to cancel the policy specifies that it may do so by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\u201cmailing notice to you at your last known address.\u201d The only address listed in the policy is for Jim and Gayle \u2014 under the heading \u201cNAMED INSURED(S).\u201d If \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d were intended to include listed drivers other than the named insureds, it seems likely that the policy would note the address of any such person.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">As noted, plaintiff contends that it is at least plausible that \u201cpolicyholder\u201d refers collectively to the named insureds and the listed drivers. We disagree. We acknowledge the maxim of construction on which plaintiff relies\u2014 that different words are presumed to have different meanings. It is noteworthy that, aside from the single reference to \u201cNAMED INSURED(S)\u201d on the first page of the policy declarations, that term does not appear anywhere else in the declarations, the policy itself, or the endorsement, just as the term \u201cpolicyholder\u201d does not appear in the policy declarations. The declarations appear to have been drafted separately from the policy itself and the endorsement; both of which are standard, preprinted forms. Although the confined use of the term \u201cnamed insureds\u201d is not dispositive, if both terms were used in any one of the portions of the overall policy, plaintiff\u2019s case for the application of that maxim might be stronger.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In all events, as we have previously noted, \u201cwe apply all maxims with restraint * * *.\u201d <em>Harris v. Warren Family Properties, LLC, </em>207 Or App 732, 748, 143 P3d 548 (2006). To be plausible, a construction of a contract must be \u201csensible and <em>reasonable.\u201d Deerfield Commodities v. Nerco, Inc., </em>72 Or App 305, 317, 696 P2d 1096, <em>rev den, </em>299 Or 314 (1985). Ultimately, we must construe the policy from the perspective of the \u201cordinary purchaser of insurance.\u201d <em>Totten, </em>298 Or at 771. If the application of a particular maxim of construction leads to a result that is not sensible and reasonable from that perspective, we will not apply it.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In our view, the ordinary purchaser of insurance would not read the policy as allowing a person who is a listed driver but not a named insured to amend the policy by adding vehicles to it or to cancel the policy altogether. In short, we conclude that the only plausible construction of the policy is to read the word \u201cpolicyholder\u201d as referring to the named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>insureds. It follows that the policy did not authorize Jillian to give permission to Barker and Franklin to use the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">We turn to plaintiffs argument that, as a permissive user herself, Jillian was, as a matter of statutory law, able to give permission to Barker and Franklin. Under ORS 742.038, a policy that does not comply with the insurance code must be construed and applied in accordance with the code. Plaintiff urges us to construe Oregon\u2019s financial responsibility law (FRL) as adopting the \u201cinitial permission rule,\u201d under which any person given permission to use an insured motor vehicle may in turn, for purposes of insurance coverage, permit another person to use the vehicle, even if the named insured expressly told the initial borrower not to allow others to use it. In other words, in plaintiffs view, because Jillian had her parents\u2019 permission to use the car, her permission to Franklin extended insurance coverage to him and, subsequently, Franklin\u2019s permission to Barker extended coverage to him as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\"> We disagree. The specific provision in the FRL requiring coverage for permissive users is found in ORS 806.080(1)(b). To determine the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting that statute, we look first to its text in context. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). The text of ORS 806.080(1)(b) provides that a liability insurance policy used to comply with statutory financial responsibility requirements \u201cmust include in its coverage all persons who, with the consent of the named insured, use the motor vehicles insured under the policy, except for any person specifically excluded from coverage under ORS 742.450.\u201d As plaintiff notes, we have previously stated that \u201cthe overriding purpose of the FRL [is] to ensure that all motor vehicle accident victims are compensated for their injuries * * <em>Safeco Ins. Co. v. American Hardware Mutual Ins. Co., </em>169 Or App 405, 415, 9 P3d 749 (2000). We observed in that case, however, that ORS 806.080 does not mandate universal coverage. Indeed, it expressly provides that certain persons may be excluded from coverage. Thus, not <em>all </em>motor vehicle accident victims are compensated under the FRL.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Even if the overriding goal of the FRL were to provide universal coverage, the text of ORS 806.080(l)(b) simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>cannot be reconciled with that aim. The statute mandates coverage for all persons using an insured vehicle \u201cwith the consent of the named insured.\u201d When an initial borrower allows a third person to use a vehicle despite having been told by the named insured not to do so, the third person cannot be said to be using the vehicle with the consent of the named insured. Nothing else in the context of which we are aware undermines that conclusion. Accordingly, we cannot construe ORS 806.080(l)(b) as plaintiff urges.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">As noted, the trial court concluded that the personal umbrella policy that defendant issued provided coverage that, other than the liability limits, was coextensive with the auto policy, a conclusion that defendant challenges. Because the result would be the same whether the court was correct or not, we need not express any opinion on that issue. It suffices to say that Barker and Franklin were not covered under the umbrella policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Because neither the auto policy nor the umbrella policy covered Barker and Franklin, the trial court correctly granted a directed verdict in defendant\u2019s favor. For that reason, we need not address plaintiffs second assignment of error, in which she challenges the court\u2019s directed verdict on the question whether Jillian actually gave Barker permission to use the car. It also follows that the court did not err in ruling that defendant did not have a duty to defendant Barker and Franklin, so we reject plaintiffs third assignment of error as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Affirmed on appeal and cross-appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-7\"> To avoid confusion, we refer to the members of the Ritz family by their first names throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b196-8\"> Jillian and Franklin have since married.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b198-6\"> Defendant cross-appeals, challenging the trial court\u2019s ruling that the umbrella policy covered permissive users. Defendant\u2019s \u201ccross-appeal\u201d is actually a cross-assignment of error, because defendant does not seek reversal or modification of the judgment. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.57(2). Because we affirm on plaintiffs appeal, we need not address defendant\u2019s contention. However, we must dispose of the cross-appeal, which we do by affirming. <em>See Abbott v. Baldwin, </em>178 Or App 289, 291 n 1, 36 P3d 516 (2001), <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 75, <em>cert den, </em>537 US 901 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b199-6\"> ORS 742.450(6) provides that a motor vehicle liability insurance policy \u201cmay exclude by name from coverage * * * any person other than the named insured\u201d for specified reasons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b200-9\"> Throughout the policy, words that are expressly defined in the \u201cdefinitions\u201d sections of the policy, such as \u201cyou,\u201d \u201cyour,\u201d \u201cresident,\u201d and \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d are printed in bold. For readability purposes, we omit the boldface in quotations from the policy throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b201-11\"> The \u201cdefinitions\u201d portion of the liability insurance section of the policy actually defines that term as \u201cthe policyholder named on the declarations page and that policyholder\u2019s resident spouse.\u201d The same definition of \u201c You\u2019 or Your\u2019 \u201d appears in each of the three other sections governing specific types of coverage. The policy endorsement expressly amends the definition of \u201c You\u2019 or Your\u2019 \u201d in each of the other three sections; the amended definition is identical except that the words \u201cpolicy declarations\u201d are replaced with \u201cdeclarations page.\u201d The endorsement does not provide an amended definition of \u201c You\u2019 or Your\u2019 \u201d for the liability insurance section. However, the first provision of the endorsement states, \u201c \u2018Declarations page\u2019 is replaced by \u2018Policy Declarations\u2019 throughout the policy.\u201d Accordingly, in this opinion, quotations of the definition of \u201c You\u2019 or Your\u2019 \u201d in the liability insurance section reflect that replacement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
