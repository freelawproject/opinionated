Specifically, the state contends that the trial court erred in concluding that (1) it was precluded, under the principles announced in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 490, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000) (\u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d), from determining whether defendant\u2019s convictions on Counts 1 through 3 counted as part of his criminal history for purposes of Counts 4 and 5; (2) it lacked authority under the rule of <em>Apprendi </em>to impose consecutive sentences based on facts found by the trial court rather than the jury; and (3) \u201cthe people of Oregon\u201d were not the victim of defendant\u2019s drug offenses for consecutive sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The issue raised by the state\u2019s second argument has since been resolved in the state\u2019s favor by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Oregon v. Ice, </em>555 US_, 129 S Ct 711, 172 L Ed 2d 517 (2009) (judicial factfinding in support of consecutive sentences does not violate the Sixth Amendment). The trial court erred in its conclusion to the contrary. Because that error requires us to remand the case for resentencing, ORS 138.222(5)(a), and it is not certain that the other issues will again arise on remand, we decline to address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
