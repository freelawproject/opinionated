He assigns error to the denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained after a police officer stopped him for bicycling without a visible light, a traffic violation. Defendant argues that the officer unlawfully expanded the scope of the traffic stop in violation of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution by asking him if he was on probation and by requesting consent to search without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. He also claims that the officer violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution by exceeding the subject matter of the lawful traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The state agrees that, under this court\u2019s decisions in <em>State v. Kirkeby, </em>220 Or App 177, 185 P3d 510, <em>rev allowed, </em>345 Or 301 (2008), and <em>State v. Rodgers, </em>219 Or App 366, 182 P3d 209, <em>rev allowed, </em>345 Or 301 (2008), the trial court should have granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. We <em>agree </em>that <em>Rodgers </em>and <em>Kirkeby </em>are controlling and that, under those decisions, the trial court erred. We thus need not consider defendant\u2019s argument under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Because it appears that defendant\u2019s conduct that resulted in his conviction for possession of methamphetamine in Case Number A138520 also formed the basis for the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant violated his probation in Case Numbers A138625 and A138626, the probation revocation judgments in those cases must also be reversed and remanded to the trial court for reconsideration in light of the reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction in Case Number A138520. <em>State v. Huggett, </em>228 Or App 569, 578-79, 209 P3d 285 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Case Number A138520, Case Number A138625, and Case Number A138626 reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
