On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in entering separate convictions on the two burglary counts (Counts 2 and 3) based on a single unlawful entry against a single victim and in entering separate convictions on two of the three coercion counts (Counts 5 and 6) based on the compulsion of a single act against a single victim. The state concedes that the court erred under ORS 161.067 in entering separate convictions on the two burglary counts (Counts 2 and 3). The state further concedes that the trial court erred in entering separate convictions on the coercion counts in Counts 5 and 6. We conclude that the state\u2019s concessions are well founded and accept them. <em>See State v. White, </em>341 Or 624, 147 P3d 313 (2006); <em>see also State v.
