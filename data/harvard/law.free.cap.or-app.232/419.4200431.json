Claimant contends that the board erred in not awarding benefits for the loss of range of motion for his wrists based on findings made by a medical arbiter under OAR, 436-035-0007(12). We review the board\u2019s order to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence in the whole record, ORS 183.482(8)(a), and whether the board\u2019s order is consistent with applicable rules, ORS 183.482(8)(b). On the basis of that review, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The administrative law judge (ALJ) found the following facts, which were adopted by the board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">\u201cClaimant is a 62 year-old janitor who began working for employer\u2019s janitorial service in 1986. In that job, claimant regularly used vibrating equipment to clean floors. In 2002, claimant sought treatment for pain and numbness in his hands and was diagnosed with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The employer issued an acceptance of this condition as an occupational disease in May 2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">\u201cDr. Worland, M.D., performed left and right carpal tunnel releases in May and June 2004, respectively. Claimant continued to experience significant bilateral CTS symptoms. * * * In September 2005, Dr. Worland performed a repeat left carpal tunnel release, and his operative findings included significant compression with active tenosynovitis about the median nerve. Claimant experienced some relief from numbness following the repeat surgeries, but he continued to experience significant bilateral hand pain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">\u201cOn January 20,2006, Dr. Worland reported that claimant had normal range of motion in all joints. On March 24, Dr. Worland concurred with the closing examination findings of Dr. Melson, M.D., who evaluated claimant on February 21,2006. Dr. Melson reported the following range of motion and expressly opined that these measurements were valid: radial deviation of 10 degree right and left; ulnar deviation of 20 degrees right and 40 degrees left, dorsiflexion of 40 degrees right and 45 degrees left; and palmar flexion of 25 degrees right and 40 degrees left. Dr. Melson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>also opined that claimant might experience some further recovery in his hands over time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\">\u201cOn April 21, 2006, the insurer closed claimant\u2019s injury claim with an award of 18 percent permanent partial disability (PPD) of the right wrist and 15 percent PPD of the left wrist. The closure award included impairment values for the reduced motion reported by Dr. Melson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">\u201cClaimant requested reconsideration of the closure award, and Dr. Gallagher, orthopedic surgeon, performed an arbiter examination on August 24, 2006. Dr. Gallagher reported the following range of motion for claimant\u2019s wrists: radial and ulnar deviation of 10 degrees right and left; dorsiflexion of 30 degrees right and 20 degrees left; and palmar flexion of 12 degrees right and 15 degrees left. Dr. Gallagher noted his reservations regarding the validity of these range of motion measurements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">\u201cOn September 11, 2006, the Department issued an Order on Reconsideration (OOR) that reduced the PPD award for claimant\u2019s right forearm (wrist) from 18 percent to 15 percent, and reduced the PPD for the left forearm (wrist) from 15 percent to 14 percent. The OOR award was based on the arbiter\u2019s examination findings and <em>did not include an award for range of motion because of the arbiter\u2019s reservations regarding the validity of those measurements.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">Gallagher\u2019s report included two statements about the range of motion findings. Gallagher reported as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-10\">\u201c* * * It is to be noted that motion in both wrists is markedly abnormal and much more so than noted on previous examinations in the medical record. I cannot say with any medical probability whether the motion is valid or not. It is, in my opinion, much more restricted than I would expect following two carpal tunnel surgeries on each hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-11\">* * * H?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-12\">\u201cI think the findings on sensation examination are valid but as stated previously, I cannot say within any medical probability that the abnormal wrist motion findings are valid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">The issue in this case concerns the legal effect to be given to Gallagher\u2019s range of motion findings, given his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>equivocation on their validity or invalidity. OAR 436-035-0007, an administrative regulation of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, Workers\u2019 Compensation Division, sets out policies to be used by the department and the board in rating permanent disabilities under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. A subsection of that rule, OAR 436-035-0007(12), requires that findings of impairment by an evaluating physician be used \u201cunless the physician determines the findings are invalid and provides a written opinion, based on sound medical principles, explaining why the findings are invalid.\u201d Another subsection of the rule states that, when a rating is reconsidered through use of a medical arbiter, that \u201cimpairment is established based on objective findings of the medical arbiter, except where a preponderance of the medical evidence demonstrates that different findings by the attending physician are more accurate and should be used.\u201d OAR 436-035-0007(5). The application of those parts of the rule controls the legal effect to be given to Gallagher\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Claimant sought review of the failure of the department to award a greater percentage of PPD based on his loss of range of motion. Before the ALJ, claimant argued that he is entitled to an additional impairment value for the reduced range of motion reported in Gallagher\u2019s medical arbiter report or, in the alternative, that he is entitled to an impairment value for the reduced wrist range of motion found by Melson.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ALJ held that \u201cthe record does not support an impairment value based on the arbiter\u2019s range of motion measurements. However, claimant is entitled to an impairment value based on Dr. Melson\u2019s range of motion measurements.\u201d The ALJ reasoned that, although the medical arbiter did not expressly find that the range of motion findings were invalid, \u201cthat conclusion is implicit in his opinion,\u201d and, therefore, a preponderance of the evidence demonstrated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>that the attending physician\u2019s findings were more accurate and should be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Claimant appealed that order, seeking an additional award for loss of range of motion based on Gallagher\u2019s findings instead of Melson\u2019s. The board agreed with the ALJ that \u201cGallagher\u2019s explanation regarding the invalidity of the [range of motion] findings meets the requirements of OAR 436-035-0007(12), as it is a written opinion based on sound medical principles,\u201d and concluded that \u201cit establishes that [Gallagher] considered the wrist [range of motion] findings to be invalid.\u201d Accordingly, the board held that claimant is not entitled to a PPD award for range of motion based on Gallagher\u2019s findings. Furthermore, the board held that, in the alternative, even if Gallagher\u2019s report did not clearly establish that his findings were invalid, the board would reach the same result under OAR 436-035-0007(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The board examined other medical evidence of claimant\u2019s range of motion and concluded that, even considering Gallagher\u2019s findings, the record does not support a finding that claimant had permanent impairment of his wrist range of motion. The board stated that, \u201cassuming that Dr. Gallagher\u2019s * * * findings are ambiguous, claimant\u2019s [range of motion] impairment may be established only by Dr. Worland.\u201d Worland, claimant\u2019s attending physician, initially reported that claimant\u2019s \u201crange of motion of all joints is entirely normal.\u201d Based on Worland\u2019s finding, the board concluded, in the alternative, that claimant had no range of motion impairment and was not entitled to a PPD award based, in part, on any loss of range of motion. Despite that conclusion, the board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s award of PPD, which was based, in part, on a loss of range of motion in claimant\u2019s wrists.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">On review, claimant argues only that the board erred in concluding that Gallagher\u2019s findings were invalid. He contends that Gallagher\u2019s report states only that he could not determine whether the findings were valid or invalid and that, therefore, the findings should have been rated under OAR 436-035-0007(12). Employer argues that \u201cany reasonable person\u201d would find Gallagher\u2019s report to be substantial evidence that Gallagher considered claimant\u2019s range of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>motion findings invalid for rating impairment. ORS 183.482(8)(c), governing this court\u2019s standard of review in administrative proceedings, directs us to set aside or remand the order if we find \u201cthat the order is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Substantial evidence exists to support a finding of fact when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d We review the board\u2019s interpretation of a medical report under that standard. <em>See SAIF v. Strubel, </em>161 Or App 516, 522, 984 P2d 903 (1999) (\u201c[G]iven the context of [the doctor\u2019s] opinion and the record as a whole, it was reasonable for the Board to interpret [the doctor\u2019s] use of the word \u2018symptoms\u2019 to mean claimant\u2019s current condition and need for treatment. Accordingly, the Board did not err in concluding that claimant\u2019s combined condition was compensable.\u201d). We also review the board\u2019s application of OAR 436-035-0007 to determine if its action was \u201cinconsistent with [that] rule\u201d under ORS 183.482(8)(b)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">We begin the analysis with the text of the relevant portions of OAR 436-035-0007:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">\u201c(5) Impairment is established based on objective findings of the attending physician under ORS 656.245(2)(b)(B) and OAR 436-010-0280. On reconsideration, where a medical arbiter is used, impairment is established based on objective findings of the medical arbiter, <em>except where a preponderance of the medical evidence demonstrates that different findings by the attending physician are more accurate and should be used.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">\u201c(6) Objective findings made by a consulting physician or other medical providers * * * at the time of closure may be used to determine impairment if the worker\u2019s attending physician concurs with the findings as prescribed in OAR 436-010-0280.<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-4\">\u201c(12) Validity is established for findings of impairment according to the criteria noted in the <em>AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, 3rd Ed., Rev., 1990, </em>unless the validity criteria for a particular finding is not addressed in this reference, is not pertinent to these rules, or is determined by physician opinion to be medically inappropriate for a particular worker. <em>Upon examination, findings of impairment which are determined to be ratable under these rules are rated unless the physician determines the findings are invalid and provides a written opinion, based on sound medical principles, explaining why the findings are invalid. </em>When findings are determined invalid, the findings receive a value of zero. If the validity criteria are not met but the physician determines the findings are valid, the physician must provide a written rationale, based on sound medical principles, explaining why the findings are valid. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Read together, those parts of OAR 436-035-0007 require that, on reconsideration, the impairment must be based on the medical arbiter\u2019s objective findings. There are two exceptions: (1) where the medical arbiter states that those findings are invalid; or (2) where a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that different findings are more accurate. If a preponderance of the medical evidence shows that the attending physician\u2019s findings are more accurate, then the impairment is rated based on those findings or on closure findings made by a consulting physician if the attending physician concurs in those findings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">After reporting his findings, Gallagher declared that the tested range of motion was \u201cmarkedly abnormal and much more so than noted on previous examinations\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>\u201cmuch more restricted than I would expect\u201d so that he could not \u201csay with any medical probability whether the motion is valid or not.\u201d Gallagher also stated that \u201cI cannot say within any medical probability that the abnormal wrist motion findings are valid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Those statements, on their face, indicate that Gallagher did not and could not determine whether the findings were valid, not that Gallagher had in fact made a determination that the findings were invalid. OAR 436-035-0007(12) directs that findings are to be rated \u201cunless the physician <em>determines the findings are invalid </em>and provides a written opinion, based on sound medical principles, explaining why the findings are invalid.\u201d (Emphasis added.) However, the board rejected claimant\u2019s argument that, \u201cbecause Dr. Gallagher did not clearly declare the [range of motion] findings invalid but only questioned their validity, the findings should be considered valid,\u201d and concluded that, \u201cviewing Dr. Gallagher\u2019s opinion as a whole, * * * it establishes that he considered the wrist [range of motion] findings invalid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">We do not think that the report as a whole can be reasonably interpreted that way. Although not dispositive, the fact that Gallagher\u2019s report lacks any assertion of <em>invalidity </em>is significant. We acknowledge that not every medical report uses the precise words and phrases employed in the workers\u2019 compensation statutes and rules. <em>Strubel, </em>161 Or App at 521 (\u201cWe have stated that an expert\u2019s opinion need not be ignored merely because it fails to include magic words.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)). But, even without the use of statutory verbiage, there must be some express text in a report that demonstrates compliance with statutory or rule requirements. In <em>Strubel, </em>we said that, although a medical expert must take into account certain factors to determine their relative weight, a doctor\u2019s statement that appeared to avoid that required evaluation would suffice where the context of the statement permitted the board to conclude that the doctor \u201cunderstood the necessary analysis and applied it properly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under that reasoning, it may be possible for a medical arbiter report as a whole to constitute a determination of invalidity under OAR 436-035-0007(12) even if the doctor does not explicitly state that the findings are \u201cinvalid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>However, the record does not support that conclusion in this case. The board relied on Gallagher\u2019s discussion of the medical principles that were his reasons for questioning validity and cited a case related to the validity of medical arbiter findings, <em>Sherry M. Bouris, </em>59 Van Natta 297 (2007). In that case, the claimant argued that the medical arbiter\u2019s opinion explaining invalidity was not based on sound medical principles. The arbiter had reported that \u201c[t]he cervical ranges of motion as measured by me, I would consider invalid since they are considerably less than that measured by [another doctor] and I would expect [range of motion] to get better with time, not worse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 299. There, the board concluded that the arbiter\u2019s explanation was sufficient. In its order on review, the board stated that \u201cthe circumstances here [are] similar to those in Bouris,\u201d such that \u201cwe agree with the ALJ that Dr. Gallagher\u2019s explanation regarding the invalidity of the [range of motion] findings meets the requirements of OAR 436-035-0007(12).\u201d The Board considered Gallagher\u2019s explanation that the findings were \u201cmore restricted than I would expect following the two carpal tunnel surgeries\u201d as evidence that Gallagher considered his findings invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">We disagree. Although the Board is correct that the reasoning in <em>Bouris </em>would support a conclusion that Gallagher\u2019s explanation of his findings is \u201cbased on sound medical principles,\u201d the reasoning in <em>Bouris </em>does not address the predicate issue: whether Gallagher in fact determined that his findings were invalid. The medical arbiter in <em>Bouris </em>clearly stated that the findings were invalid and went on to explain why. That doctor stated unequivocally as to the measured ranges of motion, \u201cI would consider [them] invalid.\u201d Here, Gallagher did not state that his findings were invalid. He said, \u201cI cannot say with any medical probability whether the findings were valid or not\u201d and then explained why he had reservations about the findings. (Emphasis added.) That is, he could not make a determination about validity or invalidity. Explaining his reservations about the findings does not suffice to convert those reservations about validity to a determination of invalidity.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\"> We note that, under OAR 436-035-0007(12), validity</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>\u201cis established * * * according to the criteria noted in the <em>AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, 3rd Ed., Rev., 1990, </em>unless the validity criteria for a particular finding is not addressed in this reference, is not pertinent to these rules, or is determined by physician opinion to be medically inappropriate for a particular worker.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The same standards apply to a determination of invalidity. A medical examiner\u2019s opinion \u201cexplaining why the findings are invalid\u201d necessarily must consider those standards. Gallagher\u2019s report did not provide the necessary explanation of a determination of invalidity. We are not persuaded that a reasonable person would construe the medical explanation as an indication that Gallagher had made a determination of invalidity, when the explanation appears alongside his explicit statement that he <em>could not </em>make that determination with any medical certainty and the discussion fails to evaluate the relevant criteria for invalidity. The board erred in concluding that Gallagher sufficiently determined that his findings were invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\"> What remains is the board\u2019s alternative basis for its holding and the application of OAR 436-035-0007(5) and (6). The board determined that, if the medical arbiter\u2019s findings were not invalid, they were ambiguous, and so it turned <em>only </em>to Worland\u2019s findings to determine whether the range of motion of claimant\u2019s wrists was impaired. The board concluded that \u201cDr. Worland\u2019s opinion does not support a finding that claimant had permanent impairment from bilateral wrist [range of motion] loss,\u201d and, assuming Gallagher\u2019s findings are not used, \u201cclaimant would still not be entitled to an award of scheduled PPD\u201d for range of motion loss. Nonetheless, the board <em>affirmed </em>the ALJ\u2019s order which had granted a PPD award based in part on bilateral wrist range of motion loss as measured by Melson and concurred in by Worland. Again, our standard of review of the board\u2019s determination is governed by the substantial evidence standard in ORS 183.482(8)(a) and by ORS 183.482(8)(b), which directs this court to \u201cremand the order to the agency if the court finds the agency\u2019s exercise of discretion to be * * * [inconsistent with an agency rule.\u201d As we restated in <em>Cummings v. SAIF, </em>197 Or App 312, 319, 105 P3d 875 (2005), to meet the substantial evidence requirement, \u201cthe board\u2019s opinion must include a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>sufficient explanation to allow a reviewing court to examine the agency\u2019s action,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>it must be supported by substantial reason. (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">The board\u2019s statement that, \u201cassuming that Dr. Gallagher\u2019s * * * findings are ambiguous, claimant\u2019s [range of motion] impairment may be established <em>only </em>by Dr. Worland\u201d (emphasis added) is inconsistent with OAR 436-010-0280, which allows a consulting physician\u2019s findings to be used where, as here, the attending physician concurred with those findings in full and in writing. That inconsistency requires remand under ORS 183.482(8)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">9,10. In addition, we hold that the board\u2019s order is not supported by substantial reason. An order that is supported by \u201csubstantial reason\u201d contains a sufficient explanation that \u201cclearly and precisely state[s] what [the board] found to be the facts and fully explain[s] why those facts lead it to the decision it makes.\u201d <em>Home Plate, Inc. v. OLCC, </em>20 Or App 188, 190, 530 P2d 862 (1975); <em>see also Ross v. Springfield School Dist. No. </em>19, 294 Or 357, 370, 657 P2d 188 (1982) (\u201cIt is essential that an agency articulate in a contested case the rational connection between the facts and the legal conclusion it draws from them.\u201d). Here, the board\u2019s rationale, as articulated in its order, is that Gallagher\u2019s findings are either invalid or ambiguous and that, in either circumstance, \u201cclaimant would still not be entitled to an award of scheduled PPD for [range of motion] loss in his bilateral wrists.\u201d However, the board then affirmed the ALJ\u2019s award for PPD that was based in part on the loss of range of motion in claimant\u2019s wrists. Because the board\u2019s order does not clearly explain its decision or demonstrate the rational connection between its analysis and the outcome of the case, it is not supported by \u201csubstantial reason.\u201d We remand to allow the board to reconsider its alternative conclusion and better explain itself in light of the Gallagher and Melson findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-5\"> Although Melson is not claimant\u2019s attending physician, his findings may he used to determine impairment under OAR 436-035-0007(6), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">\u201cObjective findings made by a consulting physician or other medical providers (e.g. occupational or physical therapists) at the time of closure may be <em>used </em>to determine impairment if the worker\u2019s attending physician concurs with the findings as prescribed in OAR 436-010-0280.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[2]\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\">2 OAR 436-010-0280 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">\u201c(1) On disabling claims, when the worker becomes medically stationary, the attending physician must complete a closing exam or refer the worker to a consulting physician for all or part of the closing exam. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">\u201c(2) The attending physician or authorized nurse practitioner has 14 days from the medically stationary date to send the closing report to the insurer.
