He argues that he is entitled to relief because his trial counsel provided constitutionally inadequate assistance under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Petitioner assigns error to the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief and its findings that his trial counsel provided adequate and effective legal assistance during the preparation, investigation, trial, and sentencing stages of the underlying criminal proceeding. We review a post-conviction court\u2019s judgment for errors of law appearing on the record and for evidence to support its findings. ORS 138.220; <em>Davis v. Armenakis, </em>151 Or App 66, 69, 948 P2d 327 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 83, 328 Or 194 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We write only to address petitioner\u2019s contention that his trial counsel was constitutionally inadequate at sentencing and reject his remaining contentions without discussion. We conclude that petitioner was prejudiced because his trial counsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment at sentencing. Accordingly, we reverse with instructions to vacate petitioner\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing; otherwise, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The following facts are not in dispute. In 2003, a jury convicted petitioner of sexual abuse in the first degree, a felony. ORS 163.427. At sentencing, the state requested the imposition of a life sentence under ORS 137.719. At the time of sentencing, ORS 137.719(1) provided, as it does now, that \u201c[t]he presumptive sentence for a sex crime that is a felony is life imprisonment without the possibility of release or parole if the defendant has been sentenced for sex crimes that are felonies at least two times prior to the current sentence.\u201d The state presented evidence of petitioner\u2019s criminal history of sex offenses in California in 1967 and 1983. In response to the state\u2019s evidence, petitioner\u2019s trial counsel noted to the court that petitioner did not believe he had a \u201csecond conviction,\u201d but that, after looking at the state\u2019s documents, those documents indicated otherwise. The trial court subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>sentenced petitioner to life imprisonment without the possibility of release or parole pursuant to ORS 137.719(1), finding that \u201cthere is sufficient basis in the information provided * * * [by the state] to conclude that [petitioner] has at least two prior felony convictions for sexual offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Petitioner appealed, asserting that (1) imposition of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was cruel and unusual punishment under Article I, section 16, of the Oregon Constitution as applied in his circumstances and (2) because it was based on findings of fact neither admitted by petitioner nor submitted to a jury, the sentence imposed violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We affirmed without opinion. <em>State v. Gordon, </em>206 Or App 520, 138 P3d 62 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Petitioner filed a petition for post-conviction relief in 2006 and an amended petition in 2007. In his amended petition, petitioner claimed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">\u201cthe underlying criminal proceedings resulted in a substantial denial of petitioner\u2019s rights under ORS 138.530, and he was denied due process of law and the effective and adequate assistance of trial counsel under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and under Article I, Section 11 of the Oregon Constitution * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Among his specific allegations, petitioner alleged that his trial counsel was constitutionally inadequate at sentencing. Petitioner argued that his trial counsel failed to investigate his prior criminal record and was unprepared to challenge the imposition of an enhanced life sentence under ORS 137.719 based on that record. Petitioner contended that he was prejudiced as a result of his counsel\u2019s deficiencies because ORS 137.719 was inapplicable at sentencing. Petitioner asserted that the 1967 California proceedings did not result in the imposition of a sentence; rather, he argued that sentencing had been suspended in 1967 when he was placed on probation. Petitioner also argued that the 1967 California proceedings were for a \u201cwobbler\u201d offense \u2014 an offense punishable either as a felony or as a misdemeanor depending on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>sentence actually imposed by the court \u2014 and that his placement on probation resulted in a conviction for a misdemeanor, not a felony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">In response, the state did not address petitioner\u2019s argument that he had not been sentenced in 1967; it did, however, address petitioner\u2019s remaining arguments. The state asserted that petitioner\u2019s 1967 California conviction was properly considered a conviction of a felony by the Oregon sentencing court in 2003 because (1) Oregon courts need only determine if the out-of-state crime is comparable to a sex crime in Oregon that is currently a felony, and (2) petitioner\u2019s 1967 conviction remained a conviction for a felony offense under California law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Evidence was presented at the post-conviction trial on the extent of trial counsel\u2019s investigation of petitioner\u2019s criminal history and the details of that history. Trial counsel averred that, although petitioner initially denied his 1967 conviction, he later admitted to that conviction. In addition, trial counsel stated that petitioner\u2019s 1967 and 1983 convictions were proved at sentencing through certified copies offered by the prosecutor and that he had reviewed those copies.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The California records of petitioner\u2019s criminal history indicated the following. In 1967, petitioner pleaded guilty to one count of rape in violation of California Penal Code (CPC) 261(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following the guilty plea, the California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>court suspended proceedings and placed petitioner on four years\u2019 probation, with the condition that he pay a $500 fine and a penalty assessment. In 1970, following his completion of probation, the court entered an order terminating probation, setting aside the guilty plea, entering a not guilty plea, and dismissing the information or complaint. In 1983, petitioner was convicted in California following a jury trial on three counts of lewd and lascivious conduct in violation of CPC 288(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5The California court subsequently sentenced petitioner to three five-year terms of imprisonment to be served concurrently, for a total term of five years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Ultimately, the post-conviction court rejected the petition and denied petitioner relief. In its findings and conclusions, the court stated that \u201c[p]etitioner has failed to prove each and every allegation of the [p]etition[,]\u201d and it specifically ruled that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">\u201ctrial counsel did not reasonably [sic] fail to investigate [petitioner\u2019s prior sex felony convictionfs] which were used to impose an enhanced life sentence under ORS 137.719. The prosecutor had certified copies of the two convictions and the [p]etitioner admitted to trial counsel that he had been convicted of these two sex crimes. And \u2014 under California law[,] even dismissed sex crimes may be utilized at sentencing proceedings for other crimes.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">On appeal, petitioner renews his arguments that he is entitled to post-conviction relief pursuant to ORS 138.530(l)(a) because his trial counsel\u2019s performance at sentencing was constitutionally inadequate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state likewise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>renews its arguments advanced below. In addition, the state responds to petitioner\u2019s contention that he had not been sentenced in 1967. The state argues that \u201c[i]t is undisputed that petitioner was punished for his offense with a term of probation\u201d and that, \u201c[a]t the time the legislature enacted ORS 137.719 in 2001, * * * the legislature had long viewed probation as a \u2018sentence.\u2019 \u201d According to the state, \u201cthere is nothing in the text, context or [legislative] history that suggests that the legislature intended to deviate from its usual intent that the word \u2018sentence\u2019 refer to both incarcerative and probationary sentences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">To prevail on a post-conviction claim of inadequate assistance of counsel under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, petitioner has the burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, \u201cfacts demonstrating that trial counsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment based on the law at the time of sentencing and that counsel\u2019s failure had a tendency to affect the result of the criminal trial, that is, that petitioner suffered prejudice as a result.\u201d <em>Chase v. Blacketter, </em>221 Or App 92, 96, 188 P3d 427, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 381 (2008). The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires a similar showing. To show that counsel was inadequate under the Sixth Amendment, a petitioner must demonstrate that his counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d under \u201cprevailing professional norms\u201d and that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 US 668, 688, 694, 104 S Ct 2052, 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">We recently elaborated on the meaning of the exercise of \u201creasonable professional skill and judgment\u201d during sentencing proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">\u201cAdequate performance includes identifying and advocating for issues that may benefit the defendant at sentencing. If a lawyer exercising reasonable professional skill and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>judgment would have recognized such an issue and would have concluded under the circumstances that the benefits of raising it outweighed the risks of doing so, failing to raise the issue may constitute inadequate assistance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><em>Buffa v. Belleque, </em>214 Or App 39, 42, 162 P3d 376, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 690 (2007) (citation omitted). We have also noted that \u201c \u2018[reasonable professional skill and judgment\u2019 can be described only generally; counsel must be prepared on the law to the extent appropriate for the nature and complexity of the case but \u2018need not, however, expend time and energy uselessly or for negligible potential benefit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chase, </em>221 Or App at 96 (quoting <em>Burdge v. Palmateer, </em>338 Or 490, 493, 112 P3d 320 (2005) (citing <em>Krummacher v. Gierloff, </em>290 Or 867, 874-75, 627 P2d 458 (1981))). More specifically, in circumstances analogous to petitioner\u2019s, where we have considered what counsel must do to adequately represent a defendant subject to the sentencing guidelines system, we have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">\u201cUnder that system, * * * the grid block is central in determining sentences. The grid block is determined according to the seriousness of the crime of conviction and the defendant\u2019s criminal history. Given the importance of a defendant\u2019s criminal history in the sentencing guidelines system, we conclude that, just as in preparing for trial, counsel must inform himself or herself regarding the client\u2019s prior convictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">\u201cIt does not follow from that, however, that counsel must necessarily make an independent investigation of a defendant\u2019s criminal history. Just as there is no single, objective standard applicable in evaluating the duties to be performed by counsel in preparing for trial, there can be no single objective standard in evaluating a counsel\u2019s duty to prepare for sentencing. The facts of each case determine whether counsel has provided informed representation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-7\"><em>DeJac v. Baldwin, </em>136 Or App 388, 390-91, 902 P2d 125 (1995) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Thus, under <em>Buffa </em>and <em>Chase, </em>petitioner\u2019s trial counsel had a duty to identify and advocate for issues that may have benefited petitioner at sentencing in light of the nature and complexity of his case. The nature of his sentencing case was the application of ORS 137.719, the plain text of which unambiguously indicated that prior <em>sentences, </em>and not prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number><em>convictions, </em>were the predicate facts that would lead to the imposition of the presumptive life sentence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In light of that plain meaning, petitioner\u2019s trial counsel had a duty to investigate and identify the nature of petitioner\u2019s prior sentences and a duty to advocate for the proper application of ORS 137.719 based on that investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">First, a lawyer exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment in reading the statute\u2019s plain text would have recognized that whether petitioner had two prior <em>sentences </em>for felony sex crimes was an issue of paramount importance. A lawyer exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment would have investigated and determined the nature of petitioner\u2019s prior dispositions. The reasoning from <em>DeJac </em>makes that failure clear. As in analogous sentencing proceedings under the sentencing guidelines system, petitioner\u2019s criminal history weighed heavily in the calculus that led the court to impose life imprisonment. Similar to the duty recognized in <em>DeJac </em>\u2014 that trial counsel must be informed of a defendant\u2019s prior convictions under the sentencing guidelines system \u2014 petitioner\u2019s trial counsel had a duty to be informed of petitioner\u2019s prior sentences given their importance under ORS 137.719. <em>See </em>232 Or App at 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Here, however, petitioner\u2019s trial counsel was not so informed. Although petitioner\u2019s trial counsel had discussions with him about his history of convictions and reviewed the certified copies of the California criminal proceedings offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>by the prosecutor at sentencing, the evidence presented to the post-conviction court indicates that trial counsel failed to engage in similar discussions or review of petitioner\u2019s history of prior <em>sentences. </em>Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel failed to look beyond the face of the documents offered by the prosecutor to determine whether they had actually involved the imposition of sentences. Without making that determination, petitioner\u2019s trial counsel was unprepared to advance any argument against the sufficiency of the evidence presented by the state in proving that petitioner had two prior sentences to support the imposition of life imprisonment under ORS 137.719.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Second, when the trial court indicated that it was imposing a life sentence based on the evidence of petitioner\u2019s prior convictions, a lawyer exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment would have argued that ORS 137.719(1) was inapplicable without proof of the prior sentences. A lawyer exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment would have concluded that, under the circumstances, the benefits outweighed the risks of arguing for a correct reading of the statute because doing so involved a question of law, namely, the statutory construction of ORS 137.719. Failure to raise that argument by petitioner\u2019s trial counsel was also a failure to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The determination that petitioner\u2019s trial counsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment at petitioner\u2019s sentencing, however, does not automatically lead to the conclusion that petitioner received constitutionally inadequate assistance of counsel. As noted above, petitioner must also show that his trial counsel\u2019s deficiencies resulted in prejudice at sentencing. To reiterate, under Article I, section 11, prejudice results where \u201ccounsel\u2019s failure had a tendency to affect the result of the criminal trial.\u201d <em>Chase, </em>221 Or App at 96. Similarly, under the Sixth Amendment, prejudice results where \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 US at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Whether petitioner suffered prejudice depends on whether an argument raised by his trial counsel that ORS 137.719 was inapplicable at petitioner\u2019s sentencing would have been successful. The answer to that question, in turn, depends on the construction of ORS 137.719 and whether the term \u201csentence\u201d as used in the statute encompasses petitioner\u2019s 1967 probation. Our determination of the intended meaning of the term \u201csentence\u201d in ORS 137.719 is governed by the method described in <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). First, we attempt to ascertain the intent of the legislature by examining the text and context of the statute and the legislative history of its enactment when that history appears useful to our analysis. Then, if the legislature\u2019s intent remains unclear, we may resort to other aids of construction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">As an initial matter, the legislature chose to make imposition of the presumptive life sentence under ORS 137.719(1) dependent on the predicate facts of a defendant\u2019s prior sentences. Specifically, the legislature in ORS 137.719(1) chose to use the words \u201chas been <em>sentenced </em>for sex crimes that are felonies at least two times prior to the current sentence,\u201d rather than the words \u201chas been <em>convicted </em>of sex crimes that are felonies at least two times prior to the current sentence.\u201d We assume the legislature made that choice purposefully and, in fact, the context of ORS 137.719(1) supports that assumption. In ORS 137.719(3)(a), the legislature distinguished between sentences and convictions when it provided that, for the purposes of the section, \u201c[sentences for two or more convictions that are imposed in the same sentencing proceeding are considered to be one sentence^]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">ORS 137.719(3)(b)(B) provides that, for the purposes of the section, a prior sentence includes \u201c[sjentences imposed by any other state or federal court for comparable offenses.\u201d Thus, under ORS 137.719, a \u201csentence! 1 imposed\u201d on petitioner by a California court for a \u201ccomparable offense\u201d would contribute to his eligibility for life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Based on the evidence presented to the post-conviction court, there is no question that, in 1983, a California court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>imposed on petitioner a total sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment for his three convictions for lewd and lascivious conduct.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In 1967, however, a California court suspended proceedings following petitioner\u2019s guilty plea on one count of rape and placed petitioner on probation. Notably, the court engaged in the following exchange with petitioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. Proceedings will be suspended. [Petitioner] will be placed on probation for a period of 4 years on the following terms and conditions!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">* <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">\u201cDo you understand, Mr. Gordon, that if you get into any further difficulties or if there is any violation, the State prison sentence will probably be imposed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">\u201c[PETITIONER]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. That will be the order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">That exchange indicates that the California court did not \u201cimpose\u201d a \u201cstate prison sentence\u201d on petitioner. Rather, the California court acted to withhold the imposition of such a sentence until, and if, a time arose in the future where petitioner violated his probation. Because petitioner did not violate his probation, no prison sentence was ever imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">The question, then, is whether the Oregon legislature, when using the term \u201csentence\u201d in enacting ORS 137.719 in 2001, intended to include an order of probation that was to be served during a suspension of the proceedings. The state argues that the legislature \u201chad long viewed probation as a \u2018sentence\u2019 \u201d and that \u201cthere is nothing in the text, context or [legislative] history that suggests that the legislature intended to deviate from its usual intent that the word \u2018sentence\u2019 refer to both incarcerative and probationary sentences.\u201d Those arguments are not well taken. We understand the state\u2019s arguments to refer to the legislature\u2019s understanding of the term \u201csentence\u201d since 1989, when the legislature enacted the Oregon sentencing guidelines. <em>See, e.g., </em>Or Laws 1989, ch 790, \u00a7 6. For crimes committed <em>after </em>November 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>1989, the sentencing guidelines expanded the term \u201csentence\u201d to include probation. <em>State v. Rice, </em>114 Or App 101, 110 n 3, 836 P2d 731, <em>rev den, </em>314 Or 574 (1992) (De Muniz, J., dissenting). In <em>State v. Munro, </em>109 Or App 188, 193, 818 P2d 971 (1991), <em>rev den, </em>312 Or 588 (1992), we explained that, \u201c[i]n classifying <em>pre-guideline dispositions, </em>the guidelines did not change the definition of sentence to include an order of probation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In other words, the guidelines\u2019 expanded conception of \u201csentence\u201d did not retroactively affect the classification of preguidelines dispositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">We conclude that the terms \u201chas been sentenced in ORS 137.719(1) and \u201c[sentences imposed\u201d in ORS 137.719(3)(b)(B) refer to dispositions that were \u201csentences\u201d at the time of their imposition. Both terms refer to completed actions and seemingly classify the nature of the action based on its quality at the time of its completion. Nothing in the text, context, or legislative history of ORS 137.719 indicates that the legislature intended that statute to apply so as to classify as a \u201csentence\u201d a disposition that, when ordered, was not a \u201csentence.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Thus, to determine whether petitioner\u2019s placement on probation in 1967 was a \u201csentence,\u201d we must look to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>law as it existed in 1967. First, under Oregon law in 1967, probation was not a sentence. <em>See State v. McClure, </em>295 Or 732, 736, 670 P2d 1009 (1983) (\u201c[Probation is an alternative to the imposition of a sentence.\u201d); <em>State v. Gates, </em>230 Or 84, 91, 368 P2d 605 (1962) (\u201cThe [statutory] language used suggests at least, that an order suspending \u2018imposition\u2019 of sentence and granting probation was not intended by the legislature to be the equivalent of an \u2018imposition of sentence.\u2019 \u201d). Second, under California law in 1967, probation was not a sentence. <em>See People v. Carter, </em>48 Cal App 3d 369, 375, 121 Cal Rptr 677, 680 (1975) (\u201cAn order granting probation, even though it includes a term in the county jail as a condition of probation, is not a sentence[.]\u201d); <em>People v. Robinson, </em>184 Cal App 2d 69, 80, 7 Cal Rptr 202, 209 (1960) (\u201cAfine, imposed as a condition of probation, is not a sentence or a judgment.\u201d); <em>People v. Wallach, </em>8 Cal App 2d 129, 133, 47 P2d 1071, 1072 (1935) (\u201c[T]he order placing a defendant on probation, even though it include as a condition a period of detention in the county jail, is not a judgment and sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Therefore, we conclude that, under the law of both states, petitioner\u2019s 1967 probation was not classified as a sentence at the time it was ordered. Thus, the 1967 probation is not a predicate \u201csentence\u201d within the meaning of ORS 137.719. Because petitioner had only one prior sentence for a felony sex crime at the time of his sentencing, the presumptive sentence of life imprisonment under ORS 137.719 did not apply. Had petitioner\u2019s trial counsel raised that argument at sentencing, it would have been successful. Petitioner would have been sentenced to a shorter sentence. <em>See </em>ORS 137.700(2)(a)(P) (presumptive sentence for sexual abuse in the first degree). Thus, petitioner has shown that he suffered prejudice as a result of his trial counsel\u2019s deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">For the reasons explained above, we conclude that petitioner\u2019s trial counsel provided constitutionally inadequate assistance at petitioner\u2019s 2003 sentencing. We hold that petitioner\u2019s trial counsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment at sentencing when he (1) failed to inform himself of petitioner\u2019s history of prior <em>sentences </em>and thus failed to prepare any argument against the sufficiency of the evidence presented by the state in proving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>that petitioner had two prior <em>sentences </em>to support the imposition of life imprisonment under ORS 137.719; and (2) failed to argue for a correct reading of ORS 137.719 when the trial court imposed a life sentence based on evidence of petitioner\u2019s prior <em>convictions. </em>We also hold that petitioner was prejudiced as a result of his counsel\u2019s deficient performance, because the presumptive life sentence under ORS 137.719 was inapplicable at petitioner\u2019s 2003 sentencing. Given that our holdings on those issues require us to reverse and remand with instructions to grant petitioner relief on his claim of ineffective and inadequate assistance of counsel at sentencing, we need not reach petitioner\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Reversed with instructions to vacate petitioner\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-7\"> Petitioner also argued that his trial counsel failed to object to the imposition of an enhanced life sentence on the ground that the sentence was imposed based on facts not pleaded in the indictment or proved beyond a reasonable doubt at trial, as required by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004). The post-conviction court denied relief on that basis, and petitioner renews his contentions on appeal. In light of our holding that petitioner was denied effective and adequate assistance of counsel during his sentencing proceedings, we do not address petitioner\u2019s alternative contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\"> As discussed, petitioner focused his arguments before the post-conviction court on whether he was sentenced in 1967 and, if so, whether that sentence was for a felony crime. Petitioner did not argue that the disposition imposed in his 1967 case was not a \u201csentence\u201d because no judgment of conviction was ever actually entered in that case. Accordingly, we express no opinion on that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b210-9\"> In 1967, CPC 261(1) provided that \u201c[rjape is an act of sexual intercourse, accomplished with a female not the wife of the perpetrator, * * * [w]here the female is under the age of eighteen years!.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b211-7\"><em> </em>In 1983, CPC 288(a) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">\u201c \u2018Any person who shall willfully and lewdly commit any lewd or lascivious act including any of the acts constituting other crimes provided in Part 1 of this code upon or with the body, or any part or member thereof, of a child under the age of 14 years, with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of such person or of such child, shall be guilty of a felony * * *.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-10\"><em>People v.
