Employer contends that it did have good cause: it filed late because both the Employment Department and the Office of Administrative Hearings told its attorney that employer had prevailed and did not need to appeal. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The following facts are undisputed. After working for employer for five years, claimant left work and filed a claim for unemployment compensation benefits. The Employment Department (department) denied the claim in an administrative decision issued on December 27, 2007. Claimant requested a hearing to challenge that decision; the department granted that request and set a hearing for January 22, 2008, to be conducted by an administrative law judge (ALJ) from the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH). However, before that date \u2014 on January 10 \u2014 the department apparently reconsidered and issued an amended administrative decision granting benefits to claimant. Employer received a copy of that decision and believed it to be wrong. The order contained the following notice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">\u201cTHIS DECISION CANCELS BY AMENDING THE ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION ISSUED December 27, 2007[.] NOTE \u2014 The prior decisions) which this order supersedes is no longer of any force or effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Claimant was notified of the amended order as well and presumed that the hearing before the ALJ was no longer necessary: the purpose of that hearing was to argue that the December 27 denial was erroneous, and the department had now come to that conclusion on its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Apparently, however, nobody told the OAH that the December 27 denial had been superseded, and an ALJ went ahead with the hearing. Employer attended, but claimant, believing that he had already prevailed, did not. Because claimant did not appear, the ALJ dismissed claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>request for hearing and ruled that the December 27 decision in favor of employer was \u201cundisturbed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">At that point, then, there were two orders: the \u201cundisturbed\u201d December 27 order <em>denying </em>benefits to claimant, and the January 10 order <em>allowing </em>them. Employer was confused. It contacted its attorney, and the attorney contacted both the department and the OAH to find out whether he needed to appeal the January 10 decision in favor of claimant; the attorney knew that the deadline for doing so was January 30. Both agencies informed him that the controlling decision was still the \u201cundisturbed\u201d one from December 27 denying claimant\u2019s benefits and that no appeal was necessary. The attorney passed that information on to employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">On February 7, a week after the appeal deadline had passed, the department informed employer that it had made an error and that the (adverse) January 10 decision, not the (favorable) December 27 decision, was controlling. Employer immediately requested a hearing, notwithstanding the fact that the deadline for doing so had passed on January 30. The ALJ dismissed the request, concluding, \u201cBecause the employer did not file a timely request for hearing and did not establish good cause to extend the appeal period, it is not entitled to a hearing on the merits of the amended decision. That decision remains undisturbed.\u201d The ALJ reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">\u201cFor an Employment Department or OAH employee\u2019s statements about when or if the employer should file its request for [a] hearing to support equitable estoppel, the employer must have reasonably relied upon misleading information from the agency representative. * * * [Employer] did not rely upon misleading information from agency representatives, but rather upon information provided to him by his attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">(Internal citations omitted.) Employer appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the Employment Appeals Board (EAB), which affirmed, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">\u201c[T]he Department\u2019s decision is final unless good cause is shown to extend the time for filing. ORS 657.269 and ORS 657.875. The request for hearing may be accepted only if the employer\u2019s failure to file a timely request was beyond its reasonable control. OAR 137-003-0528.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>\u201cThe employer filed a late request for hearing as the result of inadvertence or neglect, which are within a party\u2019s reasonable control to avoid, and so do not amount to good cause under Oregon law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\">\u201cThe request for hearing may not be accepted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Employer seeks judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Generally, a party may appeal an adverse department decision within 20 days. ORS 657.269. However, for good cause, the period may be extended for a time that is reasonable under the circumstances of each case. ORS 657.875. \u201c \u2018Good cause\u2019 exists when the appellant provides satisfactory evidence that factors or circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the appellant caused the late filing.\u201d OAR 471-040-0010(1). Here, the EAB determined that the late request resulted from inadvertence or neglect. Those are factual determinations that we review for substantial evidence. ORS 183.482(8)(c). \u201cInadvertence\u201d means, as relevant, \u201clack of care or attentiveness : INATTENTION.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1139 (unabridged ed 2002). \u201cNeglect\u201d means the act of \u201cgivfing] little or no attention or respect to : considering] or dealing] with as if of little or no importance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1513. There is <em>no </em>evidence in this case to support the EAB\u2019s finding that employer\u2019s late filing was due to employer\u2019s inattention or failure to give the matter immediate consideration. When confronted by conflicting orders, employer immediately did what any prudent employer would do: it contacted an attorney. The attorney, in turn, did what any prudent attorney would do: he contacted the agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The EAB, as noted, ultimately found that employer did not qualify for late filing because the factors that caused lateness, that is, inadvertence and neglect, were within its reasonable control. We conclude that there is no evidence of inadvertence or neglect. EAB therefore erred in dismissing employer\u2019s request for a hearing. We reverse and remand with instructions that employer be afforded a hearing on the merits of the department\u2019s January 10, 2007, decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
