She argues, first, that the juvenile court erred in denying her motion to dismiss the dependency petition because the allegations that it contained, even if proved, are insufficient to establish jurisdiction; and, second, that, even if those allegations are sufficient, the state failed to prove them by a preponderance of the evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Mother has two children, L and T. At the time of the hearing, L was three years old and living with his father; T was one year old and living in nonrelative foster care. Mother ended her relationship with L\u2019s father in early 2006; T has no legal father.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Mother has been the subject of seven Department of Human Services (DHS) referrals, four of which were determined to be founded. The first founded referral occurred in 2005. At that time, DHS found that mother had been \u201cactively using marijuana\u201d in the home and that \u201cthe home was * * * in [an] unsanitary and unsafe condition! ] for\u201d L. Mother was subsequently convicted of possession of a controlled substance and endangering the welfare of a minor. After some initial resistance, mother cooperated with DHS. By early 2006, she had completed the recommended parenting program, a 12-step program, and a chemical dependency drug treatment program. She also attended Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) meetings up to three times per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The second founded referral occurred in October 2006. DHS determined that Swift, a convicted sex offender and mother\u2019s boyfriend at that time, had had contact with L. DHS advised mother, who had been unaware of Swift\u2019s history, that Swift was a sex offender and could not, under any circumstances, \u201cbe around children.\u201d Mother agreed that Swift would no longer have any contact with L.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">The third founded referral occurred in September 2007. DHS determined that, despite the warnings, mother had knowingly allowed L and T to be around Swift and another convicted sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>The fourth and final founded referral occurred in August 2008 and led to the dependency proceeding at issue in this appeal. On the afternoon of August 20, mother took T with her on a visit to a friend\u2019s apartment. Mother knew that drug users frequented the house, but testified that, when she visited, nobody used drugs. Also according to mother\u2019s testimony, she visited because her friend who lived there wanted to see T.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\">During the visit, Settell, a probation officer, was conducting routine home visits in the neighborhood to check on one of his sex-offender clients. According to Settell, he heard \u201claughing, giggling[, and] what [he] * * * describe[d] as horseplay\u201d coming from one of the two bedrooms in the apartment. For approximately 45 seconds, he stood and listened outside the bedroom window, which had no screen but was covered by blinds. He knew Swift from earlier encounters (although Swift was not his client at the time) and recognized Swift\u2019s voice. Eventually, he reached into the window, lifted the blind, and saw \u201cSwift laying * * *, on his back on the bed holding * * * a small child,\u201d later determined to be T. Mother was sitting on the bed with them, and another woman was standing in the doorway. When the other woman saw Settell, she recognized him as a probation officer and cursed at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Settell called for backup and then entered the apartment. He detected a \u201cmoderate smell or a very mild smell\u201d of marijuana. That odor led him to the apartment\u2019s other bedroom. When he entered that second bedroom, he was able to \u201cclearly identify]\u201d the \u201cvery strong burnt odor\u201d of marijuana. He and other responding officers found marijuana and drug paraphernalia inside. Swift was arrested for violating his probation by coming into contact with a minor and received a 58-day jail sentence for that contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Mother insists that the incident with Swift was \u201ctotally accidental.\u201d By mother\u2019s account, she did not know that Swift would be at the apartment that day; she claims that, when her friends invited her to come over, she asked them who would be at the apartment and had been assured that Swift \u201chadn\u2019t been there in a couple of months or so.\u201d According to mother, she was outside behind the apartment smoking a cigarette when Swift walked into the apartment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>through the open front door and picked up T from his car seat on the floor in the living room, where a friend was watching him, and then took the child into the first bedroom. The friend rushed outside to warn mother, and mother immediately went into the first bedroom to \u201cget [her] baby,\u201d telling Swift that \u201che wasn\u2019t suppose[d] to be there * * * and needed to leave.\u201d Then, just as Swift \u201cwent to hand [T] to [her],\u201d Settell lifted the blinds. Mother also maintains that she did not discover that people were smoking marijuana in the second bedroom until Settell opened that bedroom\u2019s door, at which point she smelled the drug for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">A few days after that incident, mother met with Rucker, a DHS social services specialist. At that meeting, mother refused to submit to a urinalysis (UA) and declined to meet with a representative from the DHS Addiction Recovery Team, a support group for parents designed as an adjunct to drug and alcohol treatment, stating that she wanted to speak to an attorney first. After speaking with her attorney sometime in late October or early November 2008, mother signed a release indicating her willingness to submit to random UAs. By the time of the hearing, however, DHS had not asked her to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">After completing its assessment, DHS sought temporary custody of the children. Following an initial shelter hearing on August 27, 2008, the juvenile court placed L with his father and T in nonrelative foster care, where they remained at the time of the hearing. DHS then filed a jurisdictional petition under ORS 419B.809, alleging that the children\u2019s \u201ccondition or circumstances are such as to endanger [their] welfare,\u201d ORS 419B.100(l)(c), because mother (1) \u201chas a history of substance abuse\u201d; (2) \u201chas repeatedly allowed convicted and untreated sex offender(s) [to] have contact with her children, despite being advised of the concerns repeatedly by DHS\u201d; and (3) \u201chas refused to submit to a [UA] and has refused to engage in services with DHS to ameliorate the concerns.\u201d The court held a hearing on the petition in January 2009, as required by ORS 419B.305.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">At that hearing, mother\u2019s testimony (in addition to her version of the events leading to DHS intervention) described her then-current living situation. She was living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>with her mother, who had completed one substance abuse rehabilitation program and was about to begin another, and her grandfather, a previously registered foster parent. Her only employment was as a part-time caregiver to an elderly neighbor. She did not allow the children to be alone with her mother, and her grandfather had been cautioned to report any appearance by Swift. In the event that the children were released back to her care, she planned either to continue living with her mother and grandfather or to move in with her ex-fianc\u00e9, who would pay rent and utilities. According to mother, the ex-fianc\u00e9 did not drink or use drugs, and never had.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\">Mother testified that she intended to prevent any substance abuse relapse by going back to AA and NA meetings, although she had stopped attending those meetings approximately six to eight months earlier because she \u201cdidn\u2019t need them anymore.\u201d She stated that she had relapsed once after completing treatment in early 2006 by smoking \u201ctwo bowls\u201d of marijuana, but that she had gone \u201cstraight to AA, NA,\u201d attending up to three times per week, and that she had not used nor felt compelled to use drugs since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">After the state had presented its case, mother\u2019s attorney moved to dismiss the jurisdictional petition on two grounds: first, that the allegations in the petition, even if proven, failed to establish a legal basis for jurisdiction; and, second, that, even if the allegations did establish a legal basis for jurisdiction, the state had failed to prove those allegations by a preponderance of the evidence. The court denied the motion, and, after mother had presented her case, ultimately concluded that the state had proved each allegation in its petition by a preponderance of the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">\u201cI do find * * * that [mother] * * * ha[s] an established history of substance abuse ***[,] including] a relapse after completion of the DHS prior involvement. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">\u201cI do find that [mother] knowingly took her child to a residence where known drug usage was frequented. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">\u201cThe marijuana odor was clearly evident at the front door of the apartment when Mr. Settell first opened the front door. And it was even overpowering when he opened the door to the [second] bedroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u201cMr. Swift was observed holding * * * the child and playing with the child on the bed while [mother] was sitting on the bed making no apparent effort to obtain the child from Mr. Swift until Mr. Settell\u2019s presence was seen when he opened the [blind].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\">* * \u2021 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">\u201c[Mother] has refused to engage in any services offered by DHS to [e]nsure the safety of the child, and therefore DHS is unable to [e]nsure the safety of the child or protect the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">\u201cAnd by [mother\u2019s] own actions it appears that she is not concerned with it, overriding the safety of the child contrary to her own personal desires for her freedom of contact of other individuals and association with people that she knows that ha[ve] a drug history.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">\u201c[Mother\u2019s] history of substance abuse and taking the child to a known place of * * * drug usage and being there while the child was in the presence where drugs were being used has placed the child in danger.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">The court expressly found mother\u2019s testimony about the events at the apartment \u201cnot credible,\u201d a finding with which, on <em>de novo </em>review, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\"> On appeal, mother first assigns error to the juvenile court\u2019s denial of her motion to dismiss the petition for failure to state facts sufficient to support a finding of jurisdiction. The relevant legal principles are not in dispute. \u201c[T]he juvenile court has exclusive original jurisdiction in any case involving a person who is under 18 years of age and * * * [w]hose condition or circumstances are such as to endanger [his or her] welfare * * *.\u201d ORS 419B.100(1)(c). To establish jurisdiction on that basis, a party must file a petition in conformance with ORS 419B.809. Among other requirements, that petition \u201cshall * * * [c]ontain the facts that bring the child within the jurisdiction of the court, including sufficient information to put the parties on notice of the issues in the proceeding.\u201d ORS 419B.809(4)(b). The court shall then hold a hearing on the petition. ORS 419B.305. After the proponent of the petition has presented evidence, any other party, without waiving the right to offer evidence in the event that the motion is denied, \u201cmay move for dismissal of any or all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>allegations of the petition on the ground that[,] * * * if proven, the allegations do not constitute a legal basis for the relief sought by the petition.\u201d ORS 419B.890(1). We review the sufficiency of the allegations in a jurisdictional petition for errors of law. <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Froats, </em>117 Or App 467, 470, 844 P2d 917 (1992); <em>accord In re Conner, </em>207 Or App 223, 230,140 P3d 1167 (2006); <em>see, e.g., State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Randall, </em>96 Or App 673, 773 P2d 1348 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Mother argues, as she did at the hearing, that the allegations in the petition, even if proven true, individually and collectively fail to establish that the children\u2019s welfare was endangered. As noted above, the petition alleged three facts in support of the assertion that the children\u2019s \u201ccondition or circumstances are such as to endanger [their] welfare,\u201d ORS 419B.100(l)(c): first, that \u201cmother * * * has a history of substance abuse\u201d; second, that \u201c[mother] has repeatedly allowed convicted and untreated sex offender(s) [to] have contact with her children, despite being advised of the concerns repeatedly by DHS\u201d; and third, that \u201c[mother] has refused to submit to a [UA] and has refused to engage in services with DHS to ameliorate the concerns.\u201d In response, the state argues that those allegations, \u201ctaken as a whole, are sufficient to establish jurisdiction\u201d; it contends that \u201crepeated contact with untreated sex offenders does pose a risk of harm to any child\u201d and that, given mother\u2019s history of substance abuse, \u201cthe fact that mother refused to engage in services with DHS heightened the concern that * * * she would continue to expose the children to drug use and untreated sex offenders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Mother relies primarily on <em>Randall, </em>96 Or App 673. In that case, this court examined the sufficiency of the allegations in a jurisdictional petition regarding one of the mother\u2019s two children under a version of the juvenile code that predated the substantial revisions made to the code in 2001. <em>Id. </em>at 675-76. The petition in that case alleged that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">\u201c[t]he behavior, condition or circumstances of [the] child is such as to endanger the child\u2019s own welfare and the welfare of others by reason of the following facts: The child\u2019s mother uses controlled substances. The child\u2019s [younger] sibling, [when] born * * *, had controlled substances in her system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 675 (internal quotation marks omitted). The state argued that it was \u201capparent that [the] mother\u2019s drug use poses a danger to the child\u2019s welfare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We disagreed and concluded that, \u201calthough * * * a parent\u2019s use of controlled substances is a proper consideration in determining whether a child should be made a ward of the state, that allegation is insufficient by itself to establish that the child\u2019s welfare is endangered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that \u201c[t]he petition must also include some factual allegation showing how the parent\u2019s drug usage endangers the welfare of the child over whom the court is asserting jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 675-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">We find <em>Randall </em>to be unpersuasive authority. In that case, the <em>only </em>allegation in the petition was that the mother used controlled substances, and we held <em>only </em>that the allegation was \u201cinsufficient <em>by itself </em>to establish jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 675 (emphasis added). Here, the allegations regarding mother\u2019s substance abuse are complemented by allegations that she allowed untreated sex offenders to be with T. The two allegations together present a more compelling case than either one alone; the danger that is inherent in contact with untreated sex offenders is heightened by the use of controlled substances. Thus, the controlled substance allegations are \u201ca proper consideration.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Next, mother argues that, even if the allegations themselves are sufficient, the court erred in finding that the state proved that the children\u2019s \u201ccondition or circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>are such as to endanger [their] welfare,\u201d the statutory basis for jurisdiction alleged. ORS 419B.100(l)(c). The state responds that the evidence was sufficient. We agree with the state for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u201cThe key inquiry in determining whether \u2018condition or circumstances\u2019 warrant jurisdiction is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, there is a reasonable likelihood of harm to the welfare of the child.\u201d <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. T. S., </em>214 Or App 184, 191, 164 P3d 308, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 363 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). In deciding whether the juvenile court has jurisdiction, \u201c[i]t is the <em>child\u2019s </em>condition or circumstances that are the focus of the * * * inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original). The state must prove the facts supporting jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. ORS 419B.310(3); <em>T. S., </em>214 Or App at 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">In this case, we conclude that the evidence presented at the hearing is sufficient to prove that the children\u2019s circumstances endangered their welfare. First, we disagree with mother\u2019s assertion that the state failed to prove that she \u201callowed\u201d Swift to contact T at her friend\u2019s apartment in August 2008. As noted above, the juvenile court found mother\u2019s testimony regarding those events not credible. We agree and defer to that finding of credibility. Accordingly, we conclude, consistently with Settell\u2019s testimony, that mother did \u201callow\u201d Swift to contact T as alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The record thus establishes that mother, who has a history of substance abuse, brought T to a known drug house and, despite a moderate odor of marijuana emanating from the second bedroom into other areas of the apartment, stayed there with him. It also establishes that, despite her knowledge that Swift was a convicted and untreated sex offender who was prohibited by the terms of his probation from coming into contact with children, mother allowed Swift to come into contact with L and T in September 2007 and with T in August 2008. Furthermore, the record establishes that Swift received a 58-day jail sentence for his contact with T.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">It is true that, in <em>State ex rel Dept., of Human Services v. N. S., </em>229 Or App 151, 157-58, 211 P3d 293 (2009), we rejected the state\u2019s argument that contact with an untreated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>sex offender is <em>per se </em>dangerous to children even where the state has not demonstrated a nexus between the sex offense and the supposed harm. This case is distinguishable for several reasons. First, <em>inN. </em>S., there were two bases for our conclusion: the nature of the sex offense was unknown, and the record did not establish that the offender would have contact with the child. <em>Id. </em>Here, by contrast, mother\u2019s repeated inability or unwillingness to keep Swift away from her children, despite warnings, shows that mother does not acknowledge that contact with an untreated sex offender could present a risk and that Swift probably <em>would </em>have continued contact with the children, mother\u2019s promises to the contrary notwithstanding. Second, the petition inN. <em>S. </em>contained only the single allegation that potential contact with the sex offender created a risk of danger. Here, as we discussed with respect to the drug use, the presence of untreated sex offenders in combination with the use of controlled substances synergistically creates a whole that is more dangerous than the sum of its parts. And third, we can infer from the fact that a court ordered Swift not to contact children that his violation of that order presented a risk of harm to the children that he did contact \u2014 L and T. In short, the fact that mother brought her child to an apartment that she knew to be frequented by drug users and remained there with the child despite the fact that drug use was occurring, and, while there, allowed an untreated sex offender to come into contact with the child, establishes that mother is unable or unwilling to protect the children from exposure to dangerous situations. We thus cannot say that the juvenile court erred in its determination that the children\u2019s \u201ccondition or circumstances are such as to endanger [their] welfare.\u201d ORS 419B.100(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-6\"> A puzzling situation could be presented (but is not, in this case) under ORS 419B.890, the statute permitting a parent to move for dismissal, after the state has presented its case, on the ground that the petition does not contain allegations that, \u201cif proven, * * * constitute a legal basis\u201d for establishing jurisdiction. What is the correct outcome on appeal if the appellate court determines (1) that the court erred in allowing the case to continue because the allegations are insufficient, but that (2) the state nonetheless has presented evidence sufficient to establish jurisdiction? The Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply in juvenile court dependency proceedings, ORS 419B.800(1), and there is no rule of Juvenile Court Dependency Procedure analogous to ORCP 23 B, which states that, \u201c[w]hen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.\u201d That divergence suggests a curious result \u2014 that is, that a party\u2019s failure to allege sufficient facts in a dependency petition might sometimes trump evidence presented at the jurisdictional hearing that a child is endangered, resulting in a remand. Because we conclude in this case that the petition contains sufficient allegations, we need not confront this question \u2014 which could, of course, be mooted by appropriate legislation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
