Holdner is the personal representative of the estate of Roy Keller, Norma\u2019s deceased former husband.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 2001, Norma and Roy dissolved their marriage, and a stipulated judgment of dissolution awarded certain insurance policies to Roy. When Roy died in June 2006, Holdner discovered that Norma was still listed as one of the beneficiaries on those policies, and he requested that she sign a declaration disclaiming her interest in the insurance proceeds. When Norma refused to disclaim her interest, Holdner initiated this contempt proceeding in the dissolution matter against her for disobeying the terms of the dissolution judgment, one of which required both parties to \u201cexecute and deliver to the other party any and all documents necessary to effectuate the terms of this judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">After taking evidence at a contempt hearing, the trial court declined to find Norma in contempt. The court entered a supplemental judgment that contained five \u201cFindings of Fact\u201d and concluded, \u201c[Norma] is not in contempt of court for failing to sign a disclaimer renouncing her right as a beneficiary to receive the proceeds of any life insurance policy on decedent, Roy Keller\u2019s life, in which she is named as a beneficiary.\u201d Holdner appeals that supplemental judgment, advancing six assignments of error directed at the \u201cFindings of Fact\u201d and the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Norma was not in contempt. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Before describing the relevant facts, we must consider our standard of review. Holdner\u2019s assignments of error involve questions of both law and fact. Holdner submits that, as to the factual questions, our standard of review is <em>de novo, </em>\u201cbecause it is governed by the general standard of review for dissolution cases. ORS 19.415[.]\u201d That is, he invites this court to weigh the evidence and find the facts anew in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">This, however, is a contempt proceeding, which carries with it a different standard of review. ORS 33.055(11) provides, \u201cIn any proceeding for imposition of a remedial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>sanction other than confinement, proof of contempt shall be by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>See State v. Burleson, </em>342 Or 697, 703, 160 P3d 624 (2007) (noting that \u201cmatters of remedial contempt, when the sanction does not include confinement, require[ ] a review of the facts for clear and convincing evidence\u201d). On appeal, however, we do not reweigh the evidence to determine anew whether there is clear and convincing evidence of contempt. <em>Gritzbaugh Main Street Prop. v. Greyhound Lines, </em>205 Or App 640, 648, 135 P3d 345, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>207 Or App 628, 142 P3d 514 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 299 (2007). Rather, \u201ca contempt proceeding is legal in nature.\u201d <em>Polygon Northwest v. NSP Development, Inc., </em>194 Or App 661, 670, 96 P3d 837 (2004). Accordingly, \u201cwe review the trial court\u2019s findings under the same standard that applies to our review of jury verdicts, which is a review for any evidence to support the findings. <em>See, e.g., </em>Or Const, Art VII (Amended), \u00a7 3.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>That is the case even if the contempt proceeding arises out of a dissolution judgment. <em>Niman and Niman, </em>206 Or App 259, 278, 136 P3d 105 (2006) (\u201cOur review is for \u2018any evidence\u2019 to support the trial court\u2019s finding that husband acted willfully [in failing to perform obligations under the dissolution judgment].\u201d). <em>Cf. State ex rel Maubach v. Sarangi, </em>223 Or App 421, 425, 196 P3d 26 (2008) (applying the \u201cany evidence\u201d standard in the context of contempt proceedings regarding parenting time orders).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">With that standard of review in mind, we turn to the relevant facts. Norma and Roy married in 1977. In 2001, Norma filed a petition to dissolve the marriage. During the course of the dissolution proceedings, her attorney sent a letter to Roy\u2019s attorney stating, \u201cI am advised that Mr. Keller has life insurance and would appreciate receiving information regarding number of policies, beneficiaries and their cash value(s).\u201d Roy\u2019s counsel responded with a letter that included a \u201cStatement of Estimated Assets\u201d for Norma and Roy. It listed five insurance policies, four of which insured Roy and one of which insured Norma. As to Roy\u2019s four policies, the statement further identified \u201cVirginia Keller,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>\u201cJerry,\u201d \u201cVicki,\u201d and \u201cBarbara\u201d as beneficiaries. That is, according to the statement, none of Roy\u2019s four policies listed Norma as a beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The parties subsequently reached a marital settlement agreement and stipulated to the entry of a dissolution judgment. The dissolution judgment awarded Norma\u2019s insurance policy to her and awarded the remaining four insurance policies to Roy. The dissolution judgment states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">\u201c5. Property Awarded to [Roy].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">\u201cA. [Roy] shall be awarded the following property free and clear of any interest of [Norma], subject to any encumbrances thereon which encumbrances [Roy] shall pay, indemnify, and hold [Norma] harmless therefrom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">\u201c(1) US Bank, Account No. * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">\u201c(2) US Bank, Account No. * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">\u201c(3) Bank of the West, Account No. * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\">\u201c(4) Bank of the West, Account No. * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-11\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-12\">\u201cG. Life Insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-13\">\u201c(1) Metropolitan Life Insurance Policy No. * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-14\">\u201c(2) Guardian Life Insurance Policy No. * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-15\">\u201c(3) National Life, Policy No. * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-16\">\u201c(4) National Life, Policy No. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-17\">(Underscore in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-18\">Approximately two weeks after the dissolution judgment was entered, Roy executed a new will. He also revoked his power of attorney, which had named Norma his attorney-in-fact, and he revoked his advance directive, which had named Norma as his health care representative. He did not, however, revisit his life insurance beneficiary designations.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-19\">Roy died in 2006 and, as it turned out, the \u201cStatement of Estimated Assets\u201d was incorrect with respect to the named beneficiaries on Roy\u2019s four insurance policies. In addition to Roy\u2019s three children (Jerry, Vicki, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Barbara), the policies also listed Norma as a primary beneficiary. Upon discovering that Norma was still listed as a beneficiary, Holdner, as personal representative of Roy\u2019s estate, requested that Norma sign a declaration that disclaimed any interest that she had in the insurance proceeds. When Norma refused, Holdner filed a motion for an order compelling her to appear and show cause why she should not be held in contempt for disobeying the dissolution judgment. Holdner relied on two provisions of that judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\">\u201c2. Subject to the provision of this judgment, each party <em>releases and relinquishes any and all claims or rights which he or she may now have, may have had, or may have in the future against the other as a result of the marriage of the parties, </em>including but not limited to spousal support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">\u201c3. Compliance of Judgment. [Norma] and [Roy] are directed to comply with all provisions of the judgment, and <em>each party shall execute and deliver to the other party any and all documents necessary to effectuate the terms of this judgment. </em>This Court shall retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the provisions of the judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">(Emphasis added; underscore in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">At the contempt hearing, Norma testified that she \u201cknew [Roy] had put [her] name on some of the policies, but [she] thought he had removed them.\u201d She testified that she had never seen the policies themselves, although Roy had \u201cmentioned that he was going to put [her] on the policies with his children.\u201d She explained that, when she stipulated to the dissolution judgment, she understood that she was giving up any \u201cownership\u201d interest in Roy\u2019s polices and that Roy was giving up the same interest in her policies. In her view, that meant that she \u201ccould either change beneficiaries or leave them as they were on [her] own, and [Roy] was the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Meanwhile, Holdner, who was also Roy\u2019s longtime accountant, testified that he had prepared the \u201cStatement of Estimated Assets\u201d in 2001 \u2014 the statement that did not list Norma as one of the beneficiaries on the policies. He further testified that he had prepared that statement based on the policies that he had in his office and that, in his view, \u201cmaybe [Roy] wasn\u2019t coherent enough to or have the knowledge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>convey that [he had added Norma as a beneficiary] to us, whatever the reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">At the close of the contempt hearing, Holdner advanced a number of arguments as to why Norma was not a proper beneficiary of the insurance policies: (1) Norma failed to disclose to Roy that she was a beneficiary on his life insurance policies or tell him to change the beneficiary; (2) under paragraph 2 of the dissolution judgment, Norma relinquished any claim that she had to the proceeds, which were \u201cas a result of the marriage\u201d; and (3) under paragraph 5 of the dissolution judgment, the fact that Roy was given the insurance policies \u201cfree and clear\u201d of any interest in them operated to extinguish any expectancy interest as a beneficiary. Holdner also argued that the beneficiary designation was simply the result of a mistake. According to Holdner, Roy simply had not realized that Norma was still the beneficiary; \u201chad the decedent [Roy] remembered or known that * * * some 20 years ago that she [Norma] had been named as a beneficiary, the change would undoubtedly have been made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">In response, Norma argued that she could not have given up an expectancy interest in life insurance policies that she did not even know she had \u2014 that is, she was told at the time of the dissolution that she was no longer a beneficiary on those policies. In her view, she gave up only an \u201cownership\u201d interest in the policies, or the right to control who the beneficiary of those policies would be; it was Roy\u2019s obligation to change the beneficiary, if that was his desire. And on that point, the evidence, in her view, supported a conclusion that Roy had actually <em>intended </em>to leave her as the beneficiary, given that Roy had changed his will and his advance directive but did not change the beneficiary designations on the insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Both parties relied heavily on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Prudential Ins. v. Weatherford, </em>49 Or App 835, 841, 621 P2d 83 (1980), in which we held that the former spouse\u2019s \u201cinterest in the [life insurance] policy was not a property interest, but a mere expectancy, and it was not specifically dealt with by the terms of the property settlement agreement.\u201d In Holdner\u2019s view, <em>Prudential Ins. </em>involved a policy that was not mentioned in the dissolution judgment, which was critical to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the court\u2019s analysis. Norma, on the other hand, took the position that, under <em>Prudential Ins., </em>an \u201cexpectancy\u201d interest is not lost by way of a dissolution agreement \u201cunless it\u2019s specifically given away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The trial court agreed with Norma. In an order, and later a supplemental judgment, the court explained the basis of its ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">\u201c1. The case of <em>[.Prudential Ins. </em>] provides clear authority for finding in favor of [Norma],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">\u201c2. A beneficiary designation in a life insurance policy is not a claim or interest arising from the marital relationship of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">\u201c3. The Court heard no persuasive evidence regarding the intent of the deceased spouse regarding his life insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">\u201c4. It is quite interesting that decedent, on a timely basis, changed his Will after the Dissolution, revoked the Power of Attorney to his ex-wife and his Advanced Directive, giving her authority regarding his final illness. He did not change the beneficiary designation on the insurance policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\">\u201c5. Petitioner did not at any time in the dissolution process or since have any duty to tell decedent to change the beneficiary designation on his insurance policies.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">In his first assignment of error, Holdner takes issue with two of those \u201cFindings of Fact.\u201d Those \u201cfindings\u201d were made in response to the parties\u2019 respective reliance on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Prudential Ins. </em>At its core, the parties\u2019 debate at trial and on appeal has focused on whether the dissolution judgment had the legal effect of terminating Norma\u2019s beneficiary interest \u2014 described by the trial court and the parties as an \u201cexpectancy\u201d interest \u2014 in the insurance proceeds. Although styled as factual findings, both of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>court\u2019s first two \u201cfindings\u201d are in fact legal conclusions. Accordingly, we review those conclusions for errors of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">We begin our analysis with <em>Prudential </em>Ins., a case in which an insurer interpleaded life insurance proceeds to resolve a dispute between the decedent\u2019s ex-wife, Weatherford, and the personal representative of the decedent\u2019s estate. The circumstances of that case were roughly analogous to those here. During their marriage, Weatherford was the named beneficiary of a group life insurance policy maintained by the decedent\u2019s employer. The parties later dissolved their marriage and entered into a property settlement. Six days after the dissolution judgment was entered, the decedent was accidentally killed. At the time of his death, the decedent\u2019s life insurance policy still listed Weatherford as the beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The personal representative contended that the property settlement had the effect of precluding Weatherford\u2019s claim to proceeds under the insurance policy. That agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">\u201cThis agreement constitutes the full, complete and final property settlement agreement between the parties hereto and each party does hereby release and discharge the other from any and [all] claims and property deman[ds], each against the other, except as expressly provided in this agreement, and except for the grounds of dissolution which either party may have against the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">49 Or App at 837. The personal representative directed this court to \u201cnumerous cases in which the courts of several jurisdictions have held, under facts similar to those before us, that a property settlement agreement precluded a recovery by the named beneficiary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 838. We examined those cases and \u201cdetermined that <em>each turns on the degree of specificity of the language employed in the property settlement agreement.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Accordingly, we then proceeded to analyze the language of the settlement agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">\u201cIt is to be observed that the policy of insurance in this case was a term policy, had no cash value and was not expressly disposed of by the property settlement agreement. The agreement provided only that each party released and discharged the other from all claims and property demands. Accordingly, we conclude that evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the parties\u2019 intent with respect to the policy of insurance would not be inconsistent with the written agreement so as to vary its terms. <em>Hatley v. Stafford, </em>284 Or 523,533-34,588 P2d 603 (1978). <em>Moreover, while the cases referred to earlier in which the named beneficiary was denied recovery, contain language specifically directed to insurance or disclaimers of expectations, the present settlement agreement does not. Language used in property settlement agreements similar to that used in the present case has been held not to bar the named beneficiary\u2019s recovery.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 839-40 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">After analyzing a California case, <em>Grimm v. Grimm, </em>26 Cal 2d 173,157 P2d 841 (1945), we explained that Weatherford\u2019s interest was not a \u201cproperty interest\u201d but rather an \u201cexpectancy interest\u201d that was not addressed by the property settlement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">\u201cHere, [Weatherford\u2019s] interest in the policy was not a property interest, but a mere expectancy, and it was not specifically dealt with by the terms of the property settlement agreement. By the terms' of the policy itself that expectancy was subject to termination by the decedent,without the beneficiary\u2019s consent', by filing written notice of change of beneficiary. We conclude that [Weatherford\u2019s] claim here as named beneficiary under the policy is not a claim arising from the marital relationship of the parties, nor is it a property demand against the separate property of the decedent. As in <em>Grimm </em>and <em>Mullenax [v. National Reserve Life Insurance Co., </em>29 Colo App 418, 485 P2d 137 (1971)], <em>the policy here was not expressly dealt with in the written settlement agreement and thus could have been awarded to the named beneficiary on that basis.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">49 Or App at 841 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">In our view, <em>Prudential Ins. </em>does not, as the trial court determined, \u201cprovide[ ] clear authority for finding in favor of [Norma].\u201d As <em>Prudential Ins. </em>itself provides, whether a dissolution settlement precludes recovery by a named beneficiary is a case-by-case inquiry that \u201cturns on the degree of specificity of the language employed in the property settlement agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 838. Here, unlike <em>in. Prudential Ins., </em>the dissolution settlement actually addresses the insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>policies, and that language (in paragraph 5 of the agreement) must be analyzed to determine whether the parties intended to address Norma\u2019s beneficiary interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The trial court\u2019s related legal conclusion \u2014 that \u201c[a] beneficiary designation in a life insurance policy is not a claim or interest arising from the marital relationship of the parties\u201d \u2014 overstates our holding in <em>Prudential Ins. </em>We concluded that the claim in that case did not arise from the marital relationship of the parties because of the particular language in that property settlement agreement. However, as explained above, the settlement in this case contains different language that must be examined to determine the intent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"Ath\">In short, the trial court erred in relying on this court\u2019s holding in <em>Prudential Ins. </em>rather than analyzing the specific language of the dissolution settlement to determine whether Norma and Roy <em>intended </em>to terminate Norma\u2019s beneficiary interest in Roy\u2019s life insurance policies or otherwise bar her future claim to those insurance proceeds. And under these circumstances, we conclude that the best course is to remand for the trial court to consider the parties\u2019 intent in the first instance. In analyzing the parties\u2019 agreement, and in determining whether it is ambiguous, the trial court may consider the text in light of the circumstances underlying the formation of the contract. <em>Batzer Construction, Inc. v. Boyer, </em>204 Or App 309, 313, 129 P3d 773, <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 366 (2006). As we have previously observed, \u201cwhen, after being presented with evidence of the circumstances of contract formation, the trial court concludes that a disputed term is unambiguous, [t]hat conclusion is pregnant with implicit factual findings,\u2019 which we review for any evidence.\u201d <em>Shogun\u2019s Gallery, Inc. v. Merrill, </em>229 Or App 137, 145, 210 P3d 920 (2009) (quoting <em>Batzer Construction, Inc., </em>204 Or App at 319). Where the trial court has not addressed the contractual language in the first instance, our review in that respect is hampered.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>and remand the supplemental judgment for the trial court to interpret the marital settlement agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Supplemental judgment on contempt reversed and remanded; supplemental judgment for attorney fees vacated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-8\"> For readability, we refer to Norma Keller and Roy Keller by their first names.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b380-5\"> Although this court has, at times, described the standard in terms of \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d we disavowed that language in <em>Polygon Northwest </em>to the extent that it suggests anything other than the \u201cany evidence\u201d standard under Article VII (Amended), section 3.194 Or App at 670.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b384-13\"> The Honorable Elizabeth Welch ruled on the motion, but the supplemental judgment memorializing that ruling was signed by the Honorable Thomas M. Ryan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b387-5\"> We further note that, on appeal, the parties disagree as to whether, given the structure of the marital settlement agreement, the language of the agreement that describes the award to Roy as \u201cfree and clear of any interest\u201d of Norma even applies to the life insurance policies. Holdner contends that it does, and that any ambiguity in that regard is attributable to a scrivener\u2019s error. That, too, is an issue for the trial court to resolve in the first instance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\"> Given our remand, we express no opinion regarding Holdner\u2019s remaining assignments of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b388-5\">EDMONDS, P. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A9R\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">I agree that the trial court erred in not analyzing the specific language of the dissolution settlement agreement to ascertain whether Norma and Roy intended to terminate Norma\u2019s beneficiary interest in Roy\u2019s insurance policies. I write separately, however, to observe that the personal representative seeks to hold Norma in contempt for disobeying the terms of the dissolution judgment. My understanding of the law of contempt is that he must demonstrate that Norma is in willful disobedience of the judgment in order for the trial court to find her in contempt; in other words, that Norma was aware that she was not entitled to any of the proceeds from the life insurance policies at the time that she entered into the settlement agreement and thereafter attempted to assert her beneficiary interest despite that knowledge. At least on the record before us, the evidence does not appear to satisfy that requirement.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
