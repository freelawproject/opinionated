The Industrial Commission found that by reason of the accident, claimant suffered total temporary disability and awarded compensation accordingly. Lubritorium, Inc., and its insurance carrier bring the case here for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">The contention of respondents is that there is no sufficient competent evidence to support the award. This contention is based on the theory that claimant offered no expert or medical evidence tending to establish his contention that the injury complained of resulted from the accident. Considering the nature of tile injury, we are of the opinipn that such evidence is not necessary in this case. Claimant testified that he was able to work prior to the injury, and unable ttCwdi\u2019lc'1 thereafter; that his injury was due to the accident. Other lay witnesses testified as to the accident. Respondents offered medical evidence to the effect that the injury complained of was the result of disease \u00e1nd not of the accident. This conflict in the evidence presented a question of fact for the determination of the Industrial Commission, and its finding is binding upon us.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-16\">Petition for review should be denied, and the award of the Industrial Commission affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b250-18\">BENNETT,, DIFFENDAFFER, HALL, and EAGLETON, Commissioners, concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b250-19\">By the Court: It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
