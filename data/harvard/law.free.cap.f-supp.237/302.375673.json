Grasso, Donald J. Irwin and Raymond S. Thatcher, their privies and their successors in office, are enjoined from doing any act or taking any steps in furthex'ance of nominating or holding elections of senators or representatives to the Senate or House of Representatives of the State of Connecticut, and said defendants are further enjoined fx'om certifying or in any other manner declaring that the results of any such nominations or elections are valid or that the legislature of the State of Connecticut is properly or legally constituted, unless all senators and representatives, are nominated and elected to the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Connecticut pursuant to a redistricting of the Senate and a reapportionment of the House to be effected promptly by the General Assembly so that the voting rights of plaintiffs in the choice of members of both houses as guaranteed by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution will not be impaired; such redistricting of the Senate and reapportionment of the House by the General Assembly to be done in such manner as to achieve substantially equal weighting of the votes of all voters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>in the choice of members of both houses and in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">(6) That execution of the injunction in the foregoing paragraph (5) of this Judgment is stayed so long as the following schedule is adhered to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">(a) A special session of the Connecticut General Assembly convenes no later than during the week commencing on August 3, 1964.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">(b) The special session by September 10, 1964, enacts constitutional temporary reapportionment legislation providing for the election of the 1965 General Assembly pending adoption of state constitutional provisions relating to legislative apportionment which comport with federal constitutional requirements, the 1965 General Assembly to convene in January 1965.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">(e) This special session by September 10, 1964 enacts an appropriate statute for the convening by November 5, 1964 of a Constitutional Convention, the membership in which shall be determined by November 3, 1964, in accordance with the standards required by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, to formulate, as its first order of business, constitutional provisions for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">(1) Districting the Connecticut Senate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\">(2) Apportioning the Connecticut House of Representatives;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-11\">(3) Mandatory revision of the structure of the General Assembly no less than decennially on the basis of the most recent federal census or federal census data to insure continued compliance with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-12\">(4) Appropriate provision for amending the state constitution not in contravention of the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-13\">(d) The Constitutional Convention by March 1, 1965 formulates the amendments to the Connecticut Constitution specified in paragraph 6(c) and reports such action to the 1965 Connecticut General Assembly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-16\">(e) The 1965 General Assembly submits such amendments to the Connecticut Constitution to vote of the people of Connecticut by April 5, 1965.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-17\">(7) The jurisdiction of this action is retained for the entry of such further orders by this Court, including ordering of elections at large, as may be necessary and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-18\">SEPTEMBER 24, 1964 MEMORANDUM RE FURTHER AMENDMENT TO JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b401-19\">On June 22, 1964, in Pinney v. Butterworth, 378 U.S. 564, 84 S.Ct. 1918, 12 L.Ed.2d 1037, the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of this Court entered March 26, 1964 (Butterworth v. Dempsey, 229 F.Supp. 754, 790-792 (D.Conn.1964) ), which declared unconstitutional the present districting of the Connecticut Senate and the present apportionment of the Connecticut House of Representatives; enjoined any further elections to the Senate or House except elections from the state at large or pursuant to a constitutional redistricting of the Senate and reapportionment of the House; and retained jurisdiction for the entry of further orders \u201cincluding any order required in the absence of prompt action by the General Assembly\u201d in redistricting the Senate and reapportioning the House following Supreme Court review of this Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-20\">In affirming the judgment of this Court, the Supreme Court remanded the case to this Court \u201cfor further proceedings, with respect to relief, consistent with the views stated in our opinions in Reynolds v. Sims [377 U.S. 533, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506] and in the other cases relating to state legislative apportionment decided along with Reynolds.\u201d Pinney v. Butterworth, supra. In Reynolds v. Sims, supra at 585, the Supreme Court, on the subject of relief to be granted by the district courts in state legislative apportionment cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>\u00a1stated, \u201cIt is enough to say now that, -once a State\u2019s legislative apportionment .scheme has been found to be unconstitutional, it would be the unusual case in -which a court would be justified in not \u25a0taking appropriate action to insure no \u2022further elections are , conducted under -the invalid plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Upon receipt of the mandate of the .'Supreme Court and following conferences with counsel, this Court on July 29, 1964, with the consent of all parties to this .action, entered an order amending its judgment of March 26, 1964 so as to .stay execution of the injunctive provisions thereof provided a special session \u2022of the General Assembly would convene the week of August 3, 1964 and by September 10, 1964 would enact (i) consti-tutional temporary x-eapportionment legislation for the election of the 1965 \u25a0General Assembly to convene in January 1965, and (ii) an appropriate statute for the convening by November 5, 1964 \u2022of a Constitutional Convention to formulate state constitutional provisions for \u2022districting the Senate, apportioning the House, revising decennially the structure \u2022of the General Assembly and amending the state constitution by a procedure not in contravention of the United States \u25a0Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">A special session of the General As.sembly did convene August 3, 1964. It .adjourned September 10, 1964, however, without enacting any of the legislation referred to above.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The Court was informed on September 11, 1964 at a conference with counsel \u25a0for all parties, attended by some of the -parties as well, that substantial progress was made at the special session in attempting to enact the legislation contem-plated by this Court\u2019s order of July 29, 1964: agreement was reached on the terms of a Constitutional Convention .statute and near-agreement was reached \u2022on temporary reapportionment legislation for the election of the 1965 General Assembly.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">The stumbling block, so the Court was informed, to the enactment of legislation in either area was the date upon which election of the 1965 General Assembly should be held. Certain parties, relying on Article Third, Section 7, of the Connecticut Constitution, insisted such election could be held only on November 3, 1964. Other parties, relying on provisions of the Connecticut statutes governing elections and primaries, insisted such statutory provisions could not be complied with if the election were held November 3; 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\"> We recognize the desirability of complying with existing state constitutional and statutory provisions with respect to the time and methods of holding elections. Whatever may have been the feasibility of complying with such provisions when our order of July 29, 1964 was entered or while the General Assembly was in speci\u00e1l session, we are now confronted with a situation where x'elief ordered by this Court on March 26, 1964 and affirmed by the Supx*eme Court on June 22, 1964 is operating to deprive the people of Connecticut of a constitutionally valid legislature because of disagreement among the parties as to a date for electing the 1965 General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">It is fundamental that state limitations \u2014 whether constitutional, statutory or decisional \u2014 cannot bar or delay relief required by the federal constitution. This Court, in Valenti v. Dempsey, 211 F.Supp. 911, 913 (D.Conn.1962), held that \u201c * * * under Baker v. Carr [369 U.S. 186, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663] * * * [plaintiff] is pressing a federal constitutional right; and if he is correct in his federal constitutional claim, the state constitutional limitation need not be construed as a bar, for no state limitation on legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>tive action can prevent relief which the Federal Constitution, as construed by the Supreme Court, requires.\u201d Accordingly, we rejected the claim that the Connecticut Senate could be redistricted only by the legislature next after the federal decennial census as provided in Article Third, Section 5, of the Connecticut Constitution, and we reaffirmed that holding in Butterworth v. Dempsey, supra at 760 n. 10: \u201cWe hold that the decision of the Supreme Court of Errors in Cahill v. Leopold, 141 Conn. 1, 103 A.2d 818 (1954), cannot bar or delay prompt redistricting of the Senate to comply with federal constitutional requirements.\u201d And of course it is elemental that if we have the power to enjoin an election to the General Assembly pursuant to an unconstitutional plan of districting and apportionment, we certainly have the power to approve a special election pursuant to a constitutional redistrieting and reapportionment and to allow such election at the earliest practicable date without delay because of state constitutional or statutory limitations. Compare Maryland Committee for Fair Representation v. Tawes, 377 U.S. 656, 84 S.Ct. 1442, 12 L.Ed.2d 595 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">We recognize that the short time now remaining before November 3, the heat of a national election campaign, and the current Congressional debate on the role of the Courts in legislative reapportionment make it a practical impossibility to establish a legal districting and apportionment and provide sufficiently for workable nominating procedures in time for election on November 3. If the present Assembly, however, is reconvened either before or preferably promptly after November 3, it is to be expected that legislation may be enacted to provide a legal Assembly by late January, and a Convention to draw up a permanent constitutional Assembly structure for the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Accordingly, in view of the commendable efforts of all parties and their counsel in endeavoring to implement the judgment of this Court as amended July 29, 1964, in view of the substantial expenditure of public funds already incurred by the General Assembly in reaching an agreement on the terms of a Constitutional Convention statute and near-agreement on temporary reapportionment legislation and in view of the vital interest of the people of Connecticut in bringing promptly into being a constitutionally valid legislature, we will amend the judgment of this Court entered March 26, 1964 providing for a further stay of execution of injunctive relief under that judgment upon conditions similar to those set forth in this Court\u2019s order of July 29, 1964, including the convening of a further special session of the General Assembly for the purposes stated in our order of July 29, 1964 and the holding of a special election of the 1965 General Assembly and delegates to a Constitutional Convention in the light of this memorandum. Injunction against the November 3 Assembly election under the old provisions remains in effect. Proposed dates to be inserted in the amended provisions of the judgment may be submitted by counsel within 10 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">OCTOBER 29, 1964 MEMORANDUM RE RELIEF PURSUANT TO MANDATE OF SUPREME COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">This Court is today entering orders designed to assure compliance with the Judgment of this Court, affirmed by the Supreme Court, requiring redistricting of the Senate and reapportionment of the House of Representatives of the State of Connecticut to meet federal constitutional requirements. This Court\u2019s mandate is to insure that plaintiffs\u2019 right to equal protection of the laws is upheld. This can only be done at this time by redistricting and reapportioning the General Assembly in compliance with the opinions of the Supreme Court. Our action today still affords opportunity to the legislature to perform what is primarily the duty of the legislature \u2014 to reapportion itself. Our action today, however, provides for reapportionment by the Court, if legislative action fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number> The permanent structure of the \u25a0General Assembly, to assure the people \u25a0of the state a legislature that will meet the state\u2019s needs for the future and guard .against recurrence, through long inaction, \u2022of the denial of constitutional rights to some of its people, is a matter for the people to determine. The proposed Constitutional Convention, to be structured in accordance with constitutional principles by the General Assembly, appears to be an appropriate method for developing and submitting to the people a proposal, or indeed alternative proposals, for such a permanent structure. Matters to be decided by the Convention include the number of houses of the legislature, number of members, length of terms, age and other qualifications \u2022of members and frequency of sessions - \u2014 all of which are political judgments in the end to be made by the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">It has been determined that the \u25a0courts must use their powers as courts of equity to enforce the rights of the plaintiffs and those similarly situated \u2022even though it involves the deciding of political questions by the courts. Such determinations will be made when necessary, but only when the political branches fail to make them and then only to the extent necessary to enforce the plaintiffs\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Today\u2019s further amendment to the Judgment of this Court is in accordance with our decision of September 24, 1964. It provides for a further partial stay of execution of the injunctive provisions of our Judgment upon conditions similar to those set forth in our order of July 29, 1964 which was entered with the consent of all parties to this action. It contemplates that a further special session of the General Assembly will convene no later than November 16, 1964 and by January 30, 1965 will enact (i) constitutional temporary reapportionment legislation for election of the next General Assembly at a special or regular election to be held in 1965, and (ii) an appropriate statute for election of delegates to a Constitutional Convention at a special or regular election to be held in 1965 to formulate state constitutional provisions for districting the Senate, apportioning the House, revising decennially the structure of the General Assembly and amending the state constitution by a procedure not in contravention of the United States Constitution, such proposed constitutional amendments to be submitted to a vote of the people of Connecticut in 1965.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">So long as the foregoing schedule is adhered to, the 1963 General Assembly, pursuant to Article Third, Section 9, of the Connecticut Constitution, is authorized to hold over with full power to perform all legislative functions until the next General Assembly convenes.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">Our order that a special master be appointed to formulate a plan for redistricting the Senate and reapportioning the House is to enable the Court itself temporarily to reapportion the legislature, if legislative action is not completed, or to have available an alternative plan if legislative action results in a plan of reapportionment which does not comply with federal constitutional requirements. The report of the special master which is to be filed should enable the Court to enter an appropriate decree, if need be, providing for the election of a constitutional legislature in 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">This Court has repeatedly stressed its preference that reapportionment of the legislature be done by the legislature it<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>self rather than by the Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We still prefer it that way. But the hour is late. And we now believe, in view of the ample and repeated opportunities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>which have been afforded to the legislature to perform what is primarily its function of reapportioning itself, that we as a Court must act if the legislature does not succeed in doing so. Hence our appointment of a special master to aid the Court in discharging its duty if further opportunity to the legislature to perform the task proves fruitless.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Finally, we have entered an order joining Fred J. Doocy, Peter P. Mariani, J. Tyler Patterson, Jr. and William T. Shea, who are members and leaders of the majority and minority parties of the present Senate and House of Representatives, respectively, as parties defendant, to represent all members of the Senate and House, respectively, as classes herein. This is to enable the Court effectively, if necessary, to enjoin action by the unconstitutionally districted Senate and the unconstitutionally apportioned House.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The action by the Court today grants, to the extent indicated in the amended judgment and orders entered, certain of the relief sought by the parties. To the extent not granted and not withdrawn in open court, plaintiffs\u2019 motion and defendants\u2019 motion for immediate relief and stay are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">OCTOBER 29, 1964 FURTHER AMENDMENT TO JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of the Judgment of this Court entered March 26, 1964 are further amended to read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">(5) That defendants John Dempsey, Ella T. Grasso, Donald J. Irwin and Raymond S. Thatcher, their privies and their successors in office, are enjoined from doing any act or taking any steps in furtherance of nominating or holding' elections of senators or representatives to the Senate or House of Representatives of the State of Connecticut; said defendants are further enjoined from certifying or in any other manner declaring that the results of any such nominations or elections are valid or that the legislature of the State of Connecticut is properly or legally constituted; and defendants Fred J. Doocy, Peter P. Mariani, J. Tyler Patterson, Jr. and William T. Shea, their privies and their successors in office, including all members of the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Connecticut, are enjoined from doing any act or taking any steps in furtherance of the legislative functions of the General Assembly of the State of Connecticut unless all senators and representatives are nominated and elected to the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Connecticut pursuant to a redistricting of the Senate and a reapportionment of the House to be effected promptly by the General Assembly so that the voting rights of plaintiffs in the choice of members of both houses as guaranteed by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution will not be impaired; such redistricting of the Senate and reapportionment of the House by the General Assembly to be done in such manner as to achieve substantially equal weighting of the votes of all voters in the choice of members of both houses and in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">(6) That execution of that portion of the injunction in the foregoing paragraph (5) of this Judgment restraining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>General Assembly from carrying on its legislative functions is stayed and the 1963 General Assembly, pursuant to Article Third, Section 9, of the Connecticut Constitution, is permitted to hold over with full power to perform all legislative functions until the next General Assembly convenes as herein provided, so long as the following schedule is adhered to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">(a) A special session of the Connecticut General Assembly convenes no later than November 16, 1964.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">(b) The General Assembly by January 30,1965 enacts constitutional temporary reapportionment legislation providing for the election of the next General Assembly at a special or regular election to be held in 1965, pending adoption of state constitutional provisions relating to legislative apportionment which comport with federal constitutional requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">(c) The General Assembly by January 30, 1965 enacts an appropriate statute for the convening of a Constitutional Convention, the membership of which shall be determined at a special or regular election to be held in 1965, in accordance with the standards required by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution; the Constitutional Convention to formulate, as its first order of business, constitutional provisions for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">(1) Districting the Connecticut Senate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">(2) Apportioning the Connecticut House of Representatives;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\">(3) Mandatory revision of the structure of the General Assembly no less than decennially on the basis of the most recent federal census or federal census data to insure continued compliance with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-11\">(4) Appropriate provision for amending the state constitution not in contravention of the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-12\">(d) The Constitutional Convention formulates the amendments to the Connecticut Constitution specified in paragraph 6(c) and reports such amendments to the Secretary of the State who shall submit such amendments to a vote of the people of Connecticut in 1965.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-13\">(7) The jurisdiction of this action is retained for the entry of such further orders by this Court, including ordering of elections at large, as may be necessary and proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">OCTOBER 29, 1964 ORDER JOINING LEADERS OF SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AS PARTIES DEFENDANT</p>\n<p id=\"A16\">The Court being of the opinion that, in order effectively to enjoin action by the unconstitutionally districted Senate and the unconstitutionally apportioned House of Representatives, it is necessary to join members of both houses of the General Assembly as parties defendant in this action; and</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">The Court being further of the opinion that the members of each house of the General Assembly constitute a class so numerous as to make it impracticable to bring them all before the Court and that two members of each house who are the leaders of the majority and minority parties in each house will fairly insure the adequate representation of all members of each house for purposes of this action; it is</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">Ordered that Fred J.

In addition, the special master shall be reimbursed for all reasonable expenses necessarily incurred by him in the discharge of his responsibilities under this order. The compensation and expenses of any computer personnel shall be authorized by this Court before such personnel is engaged. All compensation and expenses of the special master and of any computer personnel shall be taxed as costs in this action against the defendants John Dempsey, Ella T. Grasso, Donald J. Irwin and Raymond S. Thatcher, or their successors in office, in their official capacities.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">JANUARY 22, 1965 MEMORANDUM ON MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF ACTION OF GENERAL ASSEMBLY</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Defendants and Intervenors have moved for approval of the constitutionality of Public Acts 1 and 2, so far as they provide for reapportioning the House of Representatives and redistricting the Senate. No party has pointed out any respect in which these Acts fail to comply with the requirements of the Constitution of the United States. V/e have therefore amended the judgment to terminate the restraint on the carrying on of the legislative functions of the General Assembly. The 1963 legislature is free to function fully as a legal General Assembly, its successor to be elected at the regular election in 1966. The special master has been instructed to suspend any further action on his part. Jurisdiction is retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-7\">. So far as we were advised, the provisions under discussion appeared generally to meet federal constitutional requirements with the probable exception of those which gave consideration to minority representation which varied between communities of different populations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-6\">. A further special session of the General Assembly did convene November 10, 1964. On January 5, 1965 the General Assembly enacted and the Governor approved a constitutional convention statute (Public Law No. 1). On January 22, 1965 the General Assembly enacted and the Governor approved a statute redistricting the Senate and reapportioning the House (Public Law No. 2). See January 22, 1965 Memorandum On Motion For Approval Of Action Of General Assembly, infra p. 313.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b405-4\">. On December 20, 1902 in Valenti v. Dempsey, 211 F.Supp. 911, 913 (D.Conn. 1962), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">\u201cAnd wo trust the court can also count on the co-operation and assistance of the Chief Executive and the General Assembly in reaching for the correct solution. Indeed we are happy that, under the settled principles of law we are following, we need not view the state organs of government as adversaries to be given harsh mandates, but can instead look for their co-operative effort toward solving probably the most difficult governmental problem of our age.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">On February 10, 1964 in the instant case, Butterworth v. Dempsey, 229 F.Supp. 754, 765 (D.Conn.1964), aff\u2019d sub nom. Pinney v. Butterworth, 378 U.S. 564, 84 S.Ct.1918, 12 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1964), we renewed the invitation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">\u201cFor obvious reasons we would prefer to have the necessary redistricting of the Senate and reapportionment of the House done by or under the direction of the General Assembly than by the Court. But the hour is late. And we cannot blind ourselves to the deadlock of many years within the legislature over the issue. Hardly a year ago this Court invited the Governor and General Assembly to cooperate with and assist the Court \u2018toward solving probably the most difficult governmental problem of our age.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">\u201cThe 1963 session of the legislature adjourned without acting on the problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-9\">\u201cWe therefore feel constrained to proceed without further delay with the schedule outlined above to formulate and execute our decree, absent prompt legislative action. We shall continue, however, to hope for legislative action. And if at any time the Governor should \u25a0call the General Assembly into special session for the purpose of formulating plans to redistrict the Senate and reapportion the House, and if the General Assembly gives evidence satisfae\u25a0tory to this Court of its intention to act to bring the representation in both houses within federal constitutional dimensions, we shall gladly stay further proceedings in this Court to give the legislature a reasonable opportunity to perform the duty which is rightly that \u2022of the legislature to perform. In this \u2022connection we renew the invitation -which Judge Clark extended on Dccem'.ber 29, 1902.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">On March 26, 1964 in our memorandum on the form of judgment in the instant case, Butterworth v. Dempsey, supra at 792, we again urged the General Assembly to act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-11\">\u201cWe repeatedly have stated our hope and preference that the necessary redistricting of the Senate and reapportionment of the House be done by the General Assembly rather than by this Court. We still entertain that hope and preference. If confronted, however, with a persistent refusal on the part of the General Assembly to act, we certainly have the power, and may well be under a duty, affirmatively, by a plan formulated by this Court if necessary, to order a redistricting of the Senate and a reapportionment of the House. We devoutly hope it will not be necessary for us to exercise that power. If it becomes necessary, we will not hesitate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">Still again, on July 29, 1964, following a conference held at the express request of the Governor and with the consent of all parties to this action, we entered an order staying execution of the injunctive provisions of our Judgment to permit a special session of the General Assembly to reapportion itself and to convene a Constitutional Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">On September 24, 1964, following another conference held at the express request of the Attorney General and attended by the Governor on the day following the adjournment of the special session without enacting any legislation, we filed a per curiam opinion in which we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-14\">\u201cIf the present Assembly, however, is reconvened either before or preferably promptly after November 3, it is to be expected that legislation may be enacted to provide a legal Assembly by late January, and a Convention to draw up a permanent constitutional Assembly structure for the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-15\">\u201cAccordingly, in view of the commendable efforts of all parties and their counsel in endeavoring to implement the judgment of this Court as amended July 29, 1964, in view of the substantial expenditure of public funds already incurred by the General Assembly in reaching an agreement on the terms of a Constitutional Convention statute and near-agreement on temporary reapportionment legislation and in view of the vital interest of the people of Connecticut in bringing promptly into being a constitutionally valid legislature, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>we will amend tlie judgment of this Court entered March 26, 1964 providing for a further stay of execution of injunctive relief under that judgment upon conditions similar to those set forth in this Court\u2019s order of July 29, 1964, including the convening of a further special session of the General Assembly for the purposes stated in our order of July 29, 1964 and the holding of a special election of the 1965 General Assembly and delegates to a Constitutional Convention in the light of this memorandum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">The Further Amendment To Judgment which has been entered today constitutes, therefore, at least the sixth formal invitation by this Court to the Governor and the General Assembly to perform their duty of providing the people of Connecticut with a constitutionally valid legislature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-20\"> Mr. Morris S.
