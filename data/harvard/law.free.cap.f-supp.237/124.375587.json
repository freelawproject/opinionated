Where, as here, plaintiff\u2019s attack is directed to the conclusion reached by the Commission upon the evidence, the Commission\u2019s order may only be set aside if it can be said that the order is not supported by substantial evidence, or is arbitrary or capricious. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Jersey City, 322 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>U.S. 503, 64 S.Ct. 1129, 88 L.Ed. 1420 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Plaintiff in this case has failed to make the evidence before the Commission a part of the record before this court, and the court must therefore accept the findings of the Commission as conclusive. Mississippi Valley Barge Line v. United States, 292 U.S. 282, 290, 54 S.Ct. 692, 78 L.Ed. 1260 (1934). The findings in the report thus accepted as true, the only remaining question is whether they support the Commission\u2019s order. It is our conclusion that they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The Commission\u2019s order is affirmed and the complaint dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
