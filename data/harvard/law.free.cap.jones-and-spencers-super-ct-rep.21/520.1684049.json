No objection to the proof of such verbal agreement was made; no motion was made for judgment at the end of defendant\u2019s case, and there was no exception to the charge of the court, or request to charge which was refused. Under such circumstances, defendant loses his right to insist that the facts were not sufficient to sustain the verdict, and the question cannot be raised on the motion for a new trial (Rich <em>v. </em>Solomon, <em>court of appeals, MSS. Opinion). </em>The appellant insisted on but two exceptions. First, that the verdict was against the weight of evidence; second, that the court erred in admitting evidence of the interest of the witness Chase in the cause of action. As to the first, as before stated, we do not think that the record presents the question, as there was no exception taken at the trial which raises the point; but if it did, an examination of the evidence has satisfied us that the verdict was sustained by the evidence. ... As to the evidence of the interest of Chase in the claim in suit, it is difficult to see on what ground it could have been excluded. A mere admission that he was interested in the recovery would not preclude the evidence of the interest of the witness being shown to affect his credibility. The witness was put on the stand to prove a transfer of the claim from himself to plaintiff, and the questions asked were legitimate cross-examination.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>John Brooks Leavitt, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aqv\"><em>Lewis Sanders, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AdO\">Opinion</p>\n<author id=\"Avi\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
