In this case that fact has not been established by satisfactory proof. It is true that the defendant alleges that the sum mentioned in the first undertaking is not sufficient, but no facts are shown that will warrant the court in concluding that that sum is insufficient. The defendant suggests that he may obtain an extra allowance, but that is altogether too contingent a supposition to warrant us to reverse the order. The stenographer\u2019s fee on the trial of an action before a referee is not a disbursement within the meaning of the law regulating the adjustment of costs, and cannot be taxed without a stipulation between the parties to that effect (Newhall <em>v. </em>Appleton, 4 <em>Law Bui. </em>5). And where the parties on a trial before a referee employ a stenographer to take the minutes, and agree that each party shall pay half the fee, the successful party cannot tax as a disbursement the amount paid by him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>(Colton <em>v. </em>Simmons, 14 <em>Hun, </em>75; Mark <em>v. </em>City of Buffalo, 87 <em>N.
