Beginning the adventure at the port or place named in the <em>indorsement. </em>\u201d It was also provided by the policy, that no ship<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>ment shall be considered as insured until approved and \u201c <em>indorsed </em>\u201d thereon by the company. Upon the printed policy in suit, was a written \u201c indorsement,\u201d containing these words, among others : Against \u201c risks of fire and inland navigation and transportation, while on vessels, steamboats, or railroads, or in hotels, stores or depots . . . and while in custody of the assured or his traveling salesman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s goods were packed in trunks, and in custody of his travelling salesman, who was attempting to convey them in a two-horse wagon across a bay or a creek in Louisiana, when they were thrown into the water and damaged to the amount claimed in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">It will be noticed that the word <em>\u201c </em>carriage \u201d used in the policy, is not found in the indorsement, and the question here is, whether the loss of the goods, while being transported in a carriage, is a risk insured against by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The printed policy is incomplete and ineffective as a contract, until made definite and certain by the indorsement, which in each case fixes the amount and nature of the risk (Chadsey <em>v. </em>Guion, 97 <em>N. Y. </em>333). The printed clauses in a policy are subject to restriction and modification, by such as are written (Merchants\u2019 S. S. Co. <em>v. </em>Mutual Ins. Co., 51 <em>Super. Ct. </em>444).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In this instance, the scope of the risks as set forth in the printed policy is both modified and restricted by the indorsement. Goods, while in hotels, depots and stores, not covered by the terms of the printed policy, are covered by the indorsement; and goods, in <em>carriage, </em>which are covered by the terms of the written policy, are excluded in the indorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">In each instance the indorsement must be treated, in my opinion, as expressing the latest intention and agreement of the insurer and insured, and therefore, the loss of the plaintiff\u2019s goods, while laden in a carriage, is not one of the risks covered by this insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s argument is, that the words in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>indorsement, \u201cand while in the custody of the assured or traveling salesman,\u201d were intended to enlarge the scope of the insurance, and add to the number of risks insured against in the printed policy, every loss, from any cause, of the goods, if they were at the time \u201cin custody of the assured or his traveling salesman.\u201d This position can be sustained only by substituting the word \u201cor\u201d for the word \u201cand\u201d in the sentence, a process which may, no doubt, be sometimes resorted to when necessary to avoid a manifest contradiction or ambiguity. But there is no occasion for it here. The meaning of the words used can be ascertained without any violence to the language. The goods insured here, must, in addition to the requirements of the printed policy, be also, when lost, in custody of the assured or his traveling salesman.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The word \u201c custody \u201d does not necessarily mean physical and tangible possession of the insured property, but such possession and dominion over it as belongs to any ordinary traveler using ordinary care of his baggage.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Judgment should be entered for the defendant, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Sedgwick, Oh. J., and Truax, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
