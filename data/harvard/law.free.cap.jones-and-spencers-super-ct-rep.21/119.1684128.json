The bill of particulars served alleged, u The said defendant also paid to the plaintiff\u2019s assignor in cash from time to time, the same being one half primage collected from carriers of freight; in many instances the said prim-age was collected by the plaintiff\u2019s assignor himself, who would thereupon appropriate his portion thereof; no account was kept of these small payments, and the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>ant is unable to specify the total amount; but the amounts so paid or collected constituted full payment for all services rendered, except in the case of commission sales, when the defendant had agreed to pay the plaintiff\u2019s assignor a brokerage or commission.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-5\">This bill was verified by the affidavit of one of the attorneys for defendant, that the bill is true as he verily believes, and that the reason the affidavit is not made by the defendant is that he is not within the city and county of New York.

The verification by the attorney does not show that the defendant himself has not the means of making a competent bill, and it does appear that by correspondence the defendant could control the form of the bill and could himself verify it, or show why he is unable to be exact. For that purpose, twenty days were given by the order appealed from, and under proper circumstances that time could be enlarged.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to be taxed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
