J., Truax and O\u2019G-orman, JJ.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b145-8\"><em>Decided March </em>1, 1886.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-9\">Appeal by defendant from judgment entered on verdict for plaintiff, as directed by the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b145-10\"><em>Guggenheimer &amp; Untermeyer, </em>attorneys, and <em>Samuel Untermeyer, </em>of counsel, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b145-11\"><em>Oliver M.

There was some proof or presumption of negligence in not loading the cart so that the ice should not fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">At the end of plaintiff\u2019s testimony, the defendant asked the court to direct a verdict in its favor, on the ground that no negligence had been shown on the part of the defendant or its servants. If the cart from which the ice fell were the property of defendant, there was sufficient evidence of negligence in allowing the ice to fall. If the name of defendant were on the ice-cart, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>there was evidence as to the ownership of the cart being in defendant. It appears that the judge assumed that there was evidence on the second point. The testimony proved that upon the cart were the words \u201cBrewery Ice Wagon, No.'l,\u201d and it is apparent that the judge believed that the witness to this had given the name of the defendant. The judge told the defendant\u2019s counsel on the trial that he might go to the jury if he pleased, but this he declined. The counsel must have perceived that the judge was under a misapprehension as to the exact words upon the cart, and should then have given the exact ground of the motion, or have gone to the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"Aq7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
