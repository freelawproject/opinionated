The case, as settled by him, must be presumed to correctly set forth what happened at the trial so far as it is necessary to properly review the questions presented. It is very evident, however, that the envelope not being in evidence, and there being no exception by defendant to its rejection, is no part of the case. The defendant also moved to have inserted in the case the remarks of counsel in summing up. It does not appear that any excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>tion was taken to the remarks of counsel, or that the attention of the court was called to the fact that what the counsel said was improper. It is evident, therefore, that the remarks of counsel were no part of the case.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b556-5\"><em>Waldo Hutchins, Jr., </em>for appellant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AD5q\">that the order was appealable, cited Marckwald <em>v. </em>Oceanic Steam Nav.
