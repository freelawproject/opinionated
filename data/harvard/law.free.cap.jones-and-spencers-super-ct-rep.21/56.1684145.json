Stafford, </em>attorney, and of counsel for appellant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AGb\">on the questions considered in the opinion, argued :\u2014I. A libel is not privileged by the mere fact that a legal pleading is the medium of publication. Libelous words in a legal pleading are not privileged unless they are material and pertinent to questions involved in the suit (Gilbert <em>v. </em>People, 1 <em>Den. </em>43 ; Ring <em>v. </em>Wheeler, 7 <em>Cow. </em>730 ; Hastings <em>v. </em>Lusk, 22 <em>Wend </em>410). The language complained of here was not material or pertinent as a plea in justification of the libel complained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>original suit. Six things are indispensably requisite to constitute a plea in justification of a libel. (1) Publication of the libel by the defendant must be admitted in direct and unqualified terms (An\u00edbal <em>v. </em>Hunter, 6 <em>Cow. </em>255 ; Sayles <em>v. </em>Wooden, <em>Ib. </em>84 ; Lewis <em>v. </em>Kendall, <em>Ib. </em>59 ; <em>Moak\u2019s Van Santvoord\u2019s Pl. </em>[3d ed.] 572). (2) There must be a specific averment that the matters are alleged as justification. Every allegation must be taken as made in bar of the action unless it is expressly stated to be alleged as justification or in mitigation of damages .(Fink <em>v. </em>Justh, 14 <em>Abb. N. S. </em>110 ; Fry <em>v. </em>Bennett, 5 <em>Sandf. </em>75 ; Mathews <em>v. </em>Beach, <em>Ib. </em>256; Hagar <em>v. </em>Tibbets, 2 <em>Abb. N. S. </em>102 ; Ayres <em>v. </em>Covill, 18 <em>Barb. </em>260 ; Newman <em>v. </em>Otto, 4 <em>Sandf. </em>668 ; Meyer <em>v. </em>Shultz, <em>Ib. </em>664; <em>Odgers on Libel, </em>177; <em>Townshend S. &amp; L. </em>\u00a7 354). (3) The justification must be as broad and as extensive as the libel. Anything short of this will not do. There are no degrees of justification. It must be the whole or nothing (Boot <em>v. </em>King, 7 <em>Cow. </em>619 ; Fry <em>v. </em>Bennett, 5 <em>Sandf. </em>69 ; <em>Odgers on Libel, </em>177; <em>Townshend S. &amp; L. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 212, 355, 359). (4) It must cover and consist of the precise charge made in the libel. Something near it, or something of a similar nature, will not do (Barthelemy <em>v. </em>People, 2 <em>Hill, </em>257; Andrews <em>v. </em>Vanduzer, 11 <em>Johns. </em>42; <em>Odgers on Libel, </em>177, 178 ; <em>Townshend S. &amp; L. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 212, 355). (5) The facts must be so stated as to show that the charge is true. An averment in general terms that it is true will not suffice. Conclusions, inferences, rumors or arguments will not do. There must be such a clear, direct, plain statement of facts as to make it manifest that if the statements are true the libel was justified (Fink <em>v. </em>Justh, 14 <em>Abb. N. S. </em>110; Annibal <em>v. </em>Hunter, 6 <em>How. </em>255; Sayles <em>v. </em>Wooden, <em>Ib. </em>84 ; Wachter <em>v. </em>Quenzer, 29 <em>N. Y. </em>547 ; Billings <em>v. </em>Walter, 28 <em>How. </em>97 ; Tilson <em>v. </em>Clark, 45 <em>Barb. </em>178 ; Maretzek <em>v. </em>Cauldwell, 2 <em>Rob. </em>715 ; <em>Townshend S. &amp; L. </em>\u00a7 357 ; <em>Odgers on Libel, 177, </em>178). (6) It must appear that the justifying facts were known to the defendant at the time of publishing the libel (Bush <em>v. </em>Prosser, 11 <em>N. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>Y. </em>360; Fry <em>v. </em>Bennett, 5 <em>Sandf. 69 </em>; Root <em>v. </em>King, 7 <em>Cow. </em>619).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-5\">There is nothing in the original suit that meets a single one of these six indispensable requisites of a plea in justification of the libel complained of in that suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-6\">II. The language complained of here was not material or pertinent in mitigation of damages in the action in which they were used, (a.) There me but two general ways in which a defendant in a libel suit can possibly mitigate damages. These two ways are due to and dependent upon the fact that the damages themselves in such an action are of two kinds\u2014one punitive or exemplary, the other compensation for actual damages sustained. The first may be mitigated by showing that facts known at the time of publishing the libel induced a belief that the charge was probably true and therefore naturally made the defendant less cautious in publishing it. This affects the question of malice and tends to mitigate damages on that score. The second may be mitigated by showing that plaintiff\u2019s general reputation on the subject to which the libel relates was bad. This affects the question of actual damages sustained by injury to the reputation. (5.) The words complained of here could not be material or pertinent on the question of malice to reduce punitive damages. There is no allegation that the facts which they charge were known at the time of publishing the original libel and so induced a belief that it was true. Hence, the words complained of manifestly were not material or pertinent to mitigate punitive damages by affecting the question of malice (Bush <em>v. </em>Prosser, 11 <em>N. Y. </em>360). (c.) The words here complained of could not be material or pertinent in mitigation of damages to reputation. (1.) Damage to reputation can be mitigated only by proving that the plaintiff\u2019s reputation was bad in the particular respect to which the libel pointed (Root <em>v. </em>King, 7 <em>Cow. 629). </em>There is nothing\u2014no allegation\u2014anywhere to show that when the original libel spoke of <em>\u201c </em>decent character,\u201d it referred to \u201c chastity.\u201d Drunkenness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>lying, thieving, gambling, being a procuress, an abortionist, a thieves\u2019 \u201cfence,\u201d and a hundred other moral traits and qualities have quite as much as \u201cchastity\u201d to do with making \u201cdecent character,\u201d and are quite as frequently meant when that phrase is used. Hence, without an averment that \u201c chastity \u201d was what was meant when the original libel spoke of \u201cdecent character,\u201d unchastity could not be shown as a fact tending to mitigate actual damages. There being no such averment as to the meaning of the original libel, the allegations here complained of were clearly immaterial and impertinent to prove that plaintiff\u2019s reputation was bad in the particular trait to which the libel pointed. (2). But bad reputation in general or in any particular respect, can be proved only in general terms,\u2014that is, by asking what is the general reputation as to any.trait or moral quality. Specific acts of misconduct can never be proved to establish bad reputation (1 <em>Greenl. Ev. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 25, <em>27, </em>55, 424-426 ; <em>Odgers on </em>Libel, 305 ; Hatfield <em>v. </em>Lasher, 81 <em>N. Y. </em>256). The reason of this rule is that the question or inquiry is, not as to the character in fact, but as to reputation. The two things are entirely distinct. A man\u2019s actual character, in gen: eral or in any particular respect, may be much better or much worse than his reputation ; but it is to the reputation alone and not to actual character that the law allows inquiry to be directed on the question of mitigating damages for libel. Even if his reputation is much better than he deserves, the law protects him in that reputation and will allow him damages for its injury by a libel. Hence, even if the original answer had shown that \u201cchastity\u201d was what was referred to in the original libel, still, specific acts of unchastity could not be shown to establish bad reputation for chastity. The words here complained of, therefore, being charges of specific acts of unchastity, were totally irrelevant and immaterial. No evidence whatever could be given under them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-5\">III. The fact that the libelous allegation is found in a bill of particulars served under an order of court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>immaterial, (a.) The order was an alternative one. It did not compel defendants to serve a bill of particulars. They were at liberty not to serve it, and a failure to do so would only have precluded them from giving proof in support of an allegation which was itself immaterial. The order of the court was, in effect, that if defendants desired to attempt to prove the immaterial allegation they must furnish a bill of particulars. Parties to an action must always take the responsibility of their own pleadings . They cannot shift that responsibility upon the court, which always presumes that the allegations to be made under its order will be pertinent and material, and not recklessly libelous. Ev\u2019enif an order of court could shield a libelous allegation under any circumstances, an order which leaves a party the alternative of making the allegation or not, cannot have such effect. The responsibility of exercising the option rests upon the party who selects. (6.) The step was designed either to have the allegation abandoned as irrelevant, or else get facts which would enable plaintiff to know what it meant, and prepare to meet it. This is the practice allowed and commended by tins court (Dowdney <em>v. </em>Volkening, 37 <em>Super. Ct. </em>313).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b85-5\"><em>F. H. Spooner, </em>attorney, and <em>William Fullerton, </em>of counsel for respondents,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AMB8\">on the questions considered in the opinion, argued :\u2014I. It is so clear that the allegation, which is the subject of this action, was pertinent and material, as pleaded in the former action, in justification of the charge that Marie Prescott <em>\u201c </em>became a certain man\u2019s mistress,\u201d that it would hardly seem to admit of argument. What could be a more perfect justification of that charge than to name the man whose mistress Marie Prescott became, and state when she became, and how long she continued to be his mistress ? The objection did not in terms state that its allegations were in justification of the libels on which this action was brought, is not well founded. Attention is called to the said third defense. Its opening words are : <em>\u201c </em>For a further and third defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>to said amended complaint, and in mitigation of damages, defendant alleges,\u201d &amp;c. It is not necessary to characterize the defense ; as to whether it contains a justification must be determined by its averments, and it cannot be aided, enlarged or improved by a clause characterizing it, or expressing its purpose (Kelly <em>v. </em>Waterbury, 87 <em>N. Y. </em>179 ; Halsted <em>v. </em>Nelson, 24 <em>Hun, </em>395). It is only when the defense is partial that the defendant must state it to be in mitigation of damages ; otherwise plaintiff might suppose it to be intended as a complete defense, and demur to it (Fry <em>v. </em>Bennett, 5 <em>Sand. </em>54 ; <em>Code, </em>\u00a7 536).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-5\">II. <em>(a.) </em>The allegation which is the subject of this action was also pertinent and material, and well pleaded in mitigation or reduction of damages as to every part of the original libel which related to plaintiff\u2019s chastity (1 <em>Wharton\u2019s Law of Ev. \u00a7 </em>51 ; Bush <em>v. </em>Prosser, 11 <em>N. Y. </em>347 ; Kniffin <em>v. </em>McConnell, 30 <em>N. Y. </em>285 ; Verny <em>v. </em>Watkins, 7 <em>Cox &amp; </em>Payne, 308 ; Johnson <em>v. </em>Calkins, 1 <em>John. Cas. </em>116; Willard <em>v. </em>Stone, 7 <em>Cow. </em>22; Palmer <em>v. </em>Andrews, 7 <em>Wend. </em>142 ; Boynton <em>v. </em>Kellogg, 3 <em>Mass. </em>189 ; Wendell <em>v. </em>Edwards, 25 <em>Hun, </em>498). (b.) The allegation sued on in this action was pleaded in mitigation, or reduction of damages, not only on the authority of the cases above cited, but by reason of the phrase \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>or otherwise \u201d studiously introduced into section 536 of the Code of Civil Procedure. No argument is necessary to show that the legislature intended to enlarge the old rule by the introduction of this phrase. We now suggest the extent to which that object has been accomplished. It is certain that the words \u201c or otherwise \u201d were introduced for a purpose, and in seeking therefor, we find that a rational meaning and purpose can only be found on the theory that the legislature used the word \u201cmitigate\u201d in the phrase \u201ctending to mitigate \u201d in a limited sense, and intended thereby to cover such defenses only as bear on the question of defendant\u2019s malice ; and intended by the words \u201c or otherwise\u201d to include and authorize all other partial defenses which will have the effect to reduce dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>ages; and among which are included the partial defense that plaintiff\u2019s general character is bad; the partial defenses in cases for breach of promise of marriage, and for a seduction, and such a partial defense as was made by the defendant in the original action of Prescott <em>v. </em>The American News Co., and on which this present action is brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-5\">III. It is not necessary that the facts contained in all partial defenses should be known to defendant at the time of the publication of the libel. This is necessary only when the facts are pleaded in mitigation for the purpose of showing an absence of malice on the part of defendant. This was the case in Bush <em>v. </em>Prosser (11 <em>N. Y. </em>347), and in the case of Hartfield <em>v. </em>Lasher (81 N. <em>Y. </em>246). But the partial defenses in mitigation which a defendant may make, are not confined to such as have the effect to show an absence of malice on his part. There are several which have no such effect, among which may be mentioned the partial defense that plaintiff\u2019s general character is bad; the partial defense in actions for breach of promise of marriage, and for seduction, that plaintiff has been guilty of specific acts of Unchastity ; and defendants claim that among them is also included the partial defense in mitigation of damages, that defendant, in the original action of Prescott <em>v. </em>Tousey, made, namely, that plaintiff was guilty of various acts of unchastity. These allegations were pleaded for the purpose of mitigating or reducing plaintiff\u2019s damages by showing that she was an unchaste woman, and, therefore, not entitled to the same damages in an action brought by her on charges affecting her chastity, that she would be if she were virtuous ; the authority therefor being the words, \u201cor otherwise \u201d in \u2022 section 536 of the Code, and the cases above cited. It is obvious that defendants\u2019 right to plead such facts for the purpose of reducing damages, can no more depend on the facts having been known to them at the time of the publication of the libel, than would their right to plead plaintiff\u2019s general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>bad character for the same purpose, depend on their having known the same to be bad at the time of the publication of the libel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-5\">IV. If the allegation in the third defense in the original action, that \u201cshe lived with various men in the city of New York and elsewhere as a mistress, \u201d was not material, yet plaintiff, by obtaining a bill of particulars of the same, made both it and the bill of particulars material. If plaintiff in the original action intended to take and maintain the ground that the allegation in the defendant\u2019s third defense above quoted was irrelevant and immaterial, she should have moved the court, when the answer was served, to strike out the objectionable allegation, or else have refrained from any action concerning it. But plaintiff did neither. If the allegation was immaterial, she elected to treat it as material and properly made, and to litigate the issue which it presented ; and to that end she procured from the .court an order for a bill of particulars. The interpretation of the plaintiff\u2019s act in moving for a bill of particulars was, that the original allegation in the third defense was good as far as it went, but that it did not go far enough. The result of this request or application to the court, was the order compelling the defendant to put into his bill of particulars the very allegation now sued on in this present action. And defendant had a right to put such allegation into his bill of particulars as being material and proper ; plaintiff having elected to treat as material the allegation in the third defense, of which the allegation in the bill of particulars was an amplification.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b88-6\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqk\">Upon a full consideration of the pleadings in this action, we reach the conclusion that the supposed libelous matters contained in the answer of the defendant Tousey, 'and in the bill of particulars and supplemental answer, were absolutely privileged, and are, therefore, not actionable. The complaint in the original action, in setting up the libelous matter, for the publica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>tion. of which it was sought to make the defendant, The News Company, liable, contains the statement, \u201cHe was instructed chiefly to ascertain if your character was decent.\u201d When such words are applied to a woman, they reasonably include the question of her chastity. If she was unchaste in action, she could not have a character for decency. The matter of which complaint is made in this action as contained in the defendant\u2019s pleading and bill of particulars, related to that very subject, as it also did to the matter contained in the original libel, and these words, \u201che had been already written to, to inquire if your children were illegitimate,\u201d andas to the \u201cstigma of bastardy \u201d on her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">If the plaintiff had been the inmate of a house of prostitution, if she had become pregnant by a man not her husband, such facts were proper to be pleaded and to be offered in evidence in the action by way of justification or in mitigation of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Although not formally pleaded as a justification, the matter in question may, when contained in an answer, be regarded as alleged for that purpose, as well as in mitigation (Kelly <em>v. </em>Waterbury, 81 <em>N. </em>Y. 119).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">While not accepting to its full extent the statement \u201c that for any defamatory matter contained in a pleading in a court of civil jurisdiction, no action for libel can be maintained \u201d <em>(Townshend Libel &amp; Slander, </em>\u00a7 221), the authorities do clearly establish the proposition, that when the matter pleaded was material and pertinent, it is absolutely privileged <em>(Odgers Libel &amp; Slander, </em>190, 191, and cases cited). The learned author last cited, reaches the same conclusion as that announced by Mr. Townshend in his treatise, with respect to the rule upon this subject, that \u201cpleadings\u201d are absolutely privileged. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Be that, however, as it may, in cases of doubt as to whether matter pleaded, and which has been suffered to remain in a pleading, is material and pertinent, and properly pleaded, the party pleading should have the benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>of the doubt, in determining the question of liability in an action for libel (Warner <em>v. </em>Paine, 2 <em>Sand. </em>195).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Irrelevant and impertinent matter in a pleading may be expunged on the application of a party aggrieved. Where a party does not seek an opportunity to get rid of objectionable matter in his adversary\u2019s pleading, it maybe because he is not satisfied that it is either immaterial or impertinent; and we conclude, that the matter in question was neither the one, nor the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
