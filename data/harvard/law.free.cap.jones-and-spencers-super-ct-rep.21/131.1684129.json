B. Wilmot, as attorney, to be written in the blanks therefor, and said assignment indorsed on said certificate ; that thereafter plaintiff presented- said certificate with said assignment on the back thereof having the blanks therein filled up as aforesaid, to the defendant, and offered to surrender said certificate and assignment, and demanded a transfer to him of said stock on the books of defendant, and demanded that defendant should issue a new or other certificate of stock to him in place of the certificate as offered to be surrendered ; that defendant refused to comply with such demands, and refused to recognize the plaintiff as the owner and holder of the stock, and prayed, (1) That defendant be directed, upon the surrender of said certificate, and the assignment thereof, to transfer said stock upon the books of said defendant to this plaintiff; (2) That the defendant also issue to this plaintiff a new certificate of the like amount of shares of its capital stock as is mentioned in the certificate now held by said plaintiff ; (3) That the plaintiff recover the costs of this action, and have such further and other relief as to the court may seem proper and just.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-5\">Defendant before answering, and on November 9, 1885, procured an <em>ex parte </em>order directing that plaintiff be examined and his deposition taken pursuant to sections StO-S'TS of the Code of Civil Procedure, and that for that .purpose he attend before one of the judges of this court, on March 25, 1885, at an hour and place therein specified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-6\">This order was obtained upon the affidavit of the defendant\u2019s treasurer setting forth the organization of the company, its place of business, its appearance in the action, the name of its attorney and his office address, the residence of the plaintiff in the action, the name of plaintiff\u2019s attorneys in the action, and their office address, the pendency of the action, its general nature, the place of business and residence of the affiant, and then proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>ing : \u201cAs an officer of the defendant I desire to be examined George Campbell, the plaintiff herein, who resides, I am informed and believe, at No. 130 West loth street, city, county and state of New York, and is of full age.

I believe that such examination will disclose facts material and necessary to enable the defendant to frame his answer, all of which are peculiarly within the knowledge of the plaintiff, and not within that of either defendant or deponent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-5\">\u201c6.

The time to answer herein expires to-day, November 9, 1885, and no extension of time has been had.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-7\">Plaintiff on the complaint and the affidavit on which the order for examination was made, and an affidavit showing that the original time to answer had expired, and that an extension of time obtained by defendant was procured without presenting, filing, or serving an affidavit of merits, moved to vacate or set aside the order. This motion was denied, and from the order entered upon its denial, the present appeal was taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b158-8\"><em>Wilmot &amp; Gage, </em>attorneys, and <em>Be B. Wilmot, </em>of counsel for appellant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkL\">argued :\u2014I. The defendant was in default\u2014the time in which to serve an answer having expired. This objection was made upon the return of the order to show cause, and the order for the examination. In the order of examination, dated November 9, 1885, a provision was made extending time to answer, but, as no affidavit of merits had been presented, served or filed, the extension was a nullity <em>(Gen\u2019l Rule, </em>24 ; \u00a7 782 <em>Code).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-9\">II. The affidavit upon which the order was granted is defective, <em>(a) </em>It fails to state the nature of the defense sought to be interposed, <em>(b) </em>It fails to show the facts sought to be elicited are necessary and material <em>(General Rule, </em>83; Schepmoes <em>v. </em>Bousson, <em>Abb. N. C. </em>481; Rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>ertson <em>v. </em>Russell, 20 <em>Hun, </em>243; <em>Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 872). Mere averment of necessity and materiality is insufficient (Crooke <em>v. </em>Corbin, 23 <em>Hun, </em>176 ; Robertson <em>v. </em>Russel, 20 <em>Ib. </em>243 ; Matter of Bryan, 3 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>289 ; Corbett <em>v. </em>De Comeau, 44 <em>Super. Ct. </em>306 ; Shethar <em>v. </em>Babcock, 1 <em>Civ. Pro. </em>83). (c) It does not set out what facts, if elicited, would constitute a defense (Shaw <em>v. </em>Van Rensselaer, 60 <em>How. </em>143 ; Williams <em>v. </em>Harden, 1 <em>Barb. Ch. </em>298 ; Beach <em>v. </em>Mayor, 14 <em>Hun, </em>79 : Green <em>v. </em>Allen, 7 <em>Week. Dig. </em>250).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-5\">III. The facts alleged and set forth in the affidavit as necessary and material, and those which it alleges the examination may disclose, would not constitute a defense to the action (Cushman <em>v. </em>Thayer Manf. Co., 76 <em>N. </em>Y. 365 ; McNeil <em>v. </em>Tenth National Bank, 46 <em>Ib. </em>331; N. Y. &amp; N. H. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Schuyler, 34 <em>Ib. </em>30, 80). It makes no difference, and it is wholly immaterial whether or not Campbell gave adequate consideration for the stock, or \u201cwhat were the circumstances attending the sale of the stock . . . who offered the same for sale ; upon what notice such sale was .held ; where it was held ; who were present ; who sold such stock; . . . the notice plaintiff may have had of any equities of said Felt in said certificate,\u201d etc (Cushman <em>v. </em>Thayer Manf. Co., 76 <em>N. </em>Y. 365 ; McNeil <em>v. </em>First National Bank, 44 <em>Ib. </em>331 ; N. Y. &amp; N. H. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Schuyler, 34 <em>Ib. </em>30, 80). The case of Hutchinson <em>v. </em>Lawrence (29 <em>Hun, </em>450), differs materially from this. There Hutchinson was not able to ascertain what transpired which produced his dismissal, or whether or not the rules and regulations relating thereto had been complied with; he asked for an order to examine the president of the exchange, who knew what had taken place, in order that he might ascertain the facts which were clearly material and necessary to properly frame his complaint, while, as we have shown, the facts sought to be inquired into under the affidavit and order appealed from, are not material to any defense which the defendant seeks to or could interpose.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number><em>Charles Howard Williams, </em>attorney, and of counsel for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b160-5\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Ab0\">We think the affidavit sufficiently alleges the nature of the defense. The defense as indicated is. that E. M. Felt was the owner of the stock that plaintiff claimed and which he asked to have transferred to him. Sufficient appears to show that an examination of plaintiff is necessary to enable defendant to properly prepare its answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The plaintiff and Felt claim the stock, and in order to properly plead Felt\u2019s title to the stock, it is necessary to allege the circumstances under which plaintiff acquired his title. These circumstances must be within plaintiff\u2019s knowledge, and the treasurer of the defendant alleges that the facts are not within the knowledge of the deponent or of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The defendant, so far as appears, has no interest in the ownership of this stock except to protect itself, and under the circumstances it should have an opportunity to investigate plaintiff\u2019s title before it is compelled to answer the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">An examination of the affidavit on which the order was granted, has satisfied us that the facts alleged were sufficient to bring the case within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The order extending the time to answer was not a nullity because of the absence of the affidavits of merits. It was a mere irregularity which could be cured by allowing such an affidavit to be filed, and until such order was vacated by the court or the judge who granted it, it was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
