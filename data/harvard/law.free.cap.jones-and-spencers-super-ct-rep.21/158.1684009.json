At this time ninety days had not elapsed since the filing of the notice. Before the ninety days expired the mechanics\u2019 lienor answered setting up various matters as defenses. \u2019 After the ninety days had expired, an order referring the issues was made. The defendant claiming the mechanics\u2019 lien did not, within the ninety days, file a notice of the pendency of an action to foreclose his <em>lieu.\u2014Reid, </em>that he had no standing in court to litigate.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b182-10\">The mortgage under foreclosure was a builder\u2019s loan mortgage\u2014the builder, before the filing of the notice of lien conveyed to a third person for the benefit of the mortgagee.

The bond and mortgage were executed in August, 1883. Kelly commenced to build on the lots, and continued to do so, until November <em>T, </em>1883, when he ceased, and conveyed the lots to defendant Maschke, the conveyance being for the benefit of the plaintiff. On April 18, 1884, defendant Simonson filed a lien on the lots against Maschke, as owner, and Kelly, claiming that he had furnished materials on the \u25a0 employment of Kelly, on a verbal contract with him. No notice of <em>It's pendens </em>was ever filed by Simonson. The action was commenced May 12, 1884. Simonson demurred January 14, 1884. The issues were, on August 1, 1884, referred to a referee, who reported in favor of plaintiff, writing as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-6\">\u201c Edward Patterson, referee :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-7\">\u201cThis is an action to foreclose a mortgage. The defendants Simonson and the \u2018 A. Hall Terra Cotta Company,\u2019 were made parties, because they had filed liens against the mortgaged premises upon sub-contracts for supplies used in the construction of the buildings, which contracts they had made with Kelly, the principal contractor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-8\">\u201c It appears affirmatively that neither of these defend ants filed a notice of <em>lis pendens </em>within the ninety days required by the mechanics\u2019 lien law, and by the failure to do so they lost whatever rights in the mortgaged premises they might otherwise have acquired (Bones <em>v. </em>N. Y. Christian Home, 64 <em>How. </em>509). The filing of the lien and the subsequent filing within the statutory limitation of time of a notice of <em>lis pendens </em>were absolutely necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>to give the defendants above named a standing in court to litigate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-5\">\u201c The Act of 1882, as amended in 1883, does not in this respect differ from the act of 1875. Unless the liens are perfected, the court has no power to consider the claims of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-6\">\u201c These defendants seek to establish their liens in this action and possibly they might if notices of <em>Us pendens </em>had been filed, have set up their demands as counterclaims. I do not consider it necessary in this action to pass upon this, except to say that under the form of the respective answers of the defendants referred to, counterclaims are not pleaded as the Code requires. But even considering that counter-claims are properly pleaded, the defendants then virtually occupy the positions of plaintiffs seeking to enforce their respective liens against the property\u2014that is to say, the affirmative is with them to establish their rights under the mechanics\u2019 lien law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-7\">\u201cI think, therefore, that the reasoning of Judge Rapallo, in Weyer <em>v. </em>Beach (79 <em>N. Y. </em>409), covers this case. He says, speaking of the enforcement of a lien by proceedings under the act. \u2018 The proceeding is statutory, and can only be resorted to in a case falling within the statute\u2014that is, where a mechanic\u2019s lien exists. The main object of the proceeding is to enforce the hen, and the power to render a personal judgment is merely incidental to the main purpose, and to avoid the necessity of resorting te a separate action. But where no lien exists, this form of proceeding cannot be resorted to for the purpose of enforcing a mere personal contract between parties, and the unfounded allegation of the existence of the lien does not authorize the substitution of this proceeding in place of the proper common law action.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-8\">\u201cSection 1813 of the consolidation act, as amended in 1883, does not apply to a case of this kind, <em>i. e., </em>to an action for the forclosure of a mortgage. But if a mortgage is to be regarded as an \u2018 other lien \u2019 within the meaning of the section, then the defendants should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>filed notices of <em>lis pendens, </em>for that is expressly required to be done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-5\">\u201cThe fact that this is an action to foreclose a mortgage and that the defendants named are made parties, cannot affect the nature and character of their rights. If they have no claim upon or interest in the premises, they cannot under their pleadings enforce, on a failure of their liens common law demands against Danziger.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-6\">\u201cAs to the other propositions urged by the counsel for the defendants, mentioned above, it is sufficient to say there are no issues raised by the pleadings giving them place in the litigation. The nature and validity of the conveyance to Maschke cannot be inquired into here for obvious reasons, and the alleged merger of the mortgage in a fee simple estate in the plaintiff, is also a matter outside of the legitimate scope of this action. The law furnishes a different and appropriate and effective remedy to said defendants if their rights have been invaded by fraudulent transfers of the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-7\">\u201c The defendants are not judgment creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-8\">\u201c The plaintiff is entitled to judgment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-9\">From the judgment entered upon the report of the referee, defendant Simonson appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-10\"><em>H. D. Van Orden, </em>attorney, and <em>W. II. Arnoux, </em>of counsel for appellant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A8g\">on the questions considered in the opinion, argued :\u2014I. The referee erred in holding that the appellant\u2019s lien had expired ; and he erred in rejecting the testimony offered by appellant to sustain his answer. The filing of <em>lis pendens </em>by the plaintiff within ninety days from the time of filing lien by the appellant, inures to the benefit of all other defendants who have filed liens ; and, therefore, the filing of <em>Us pendens </em>by the appellant herein was unnecessary (McDermott <em>v. </em>McDonald, 50 <em>Super. Ct. </em>153 ; <em>Laws </em>1880, \u00a7 1813 ; Gildersleeve <em>v. </em>Landon, 13 <em>N. Y. </em>609 ; Mack <em>v. </em>Phelan, 93 <em>Ib. </em>20). The plaintiff\u2019s action is a foreclosure of the defendant\u2019s lien, and this <em>Us pendens </em>filed by plaintiff embraced in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>templation of law all liens of the defendants. Plaintiff can only file same (\u00a7 1631 of <em>Code).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-5\">II. The Act of 1880, \u00a7 1813, also provides : \u201c But the neglect to file such notice shall not abate any action which may be pending to enforce the lien, such- action may be prosecuted to judgment against the persons liable for the debt.\u201d The appellant claims that by this provision it was not necessary for him to file a <em>Us pendens </em>as to his lien, because the plaintiff was liable for the debt, and therefore, the action did not abate. This agreement by plaintiff with Kelly, and request by plaintiff that appellant furnish materials, makes the plaintiff liable for the debt, and so he becomes an original debtor. And if it were otherwise the plaintiff must be liable (Lawrence <em>v. </em>Fox, 20 <em>N. Y. </em>268 ; Ramy <em>v. </em>Mullen, 5 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>246). This agreement was excluded by the referee, and appellant excepted. The plaintiff being by law an original debtor the action does not abate under section 1813 of Laws of 1880.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-6\"><em>Max </em>Gross, attorney, and <em>Lewis Sanders, </em>of counsel for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b186-7\">By the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"Ai_\">O\u2019Gorman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-1\">This is an action <em>in rem, </em>and defendant Simonson, in his answer, claims as lienor, relief in his favor <em>in rem, </em>and that he be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the lots under the foreclosure, the amount due on his lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">His right to that relief, or to any relief in this action, depends on the existence of his lien as a statutory incumbrance on the land, and on his compliance with all the statutory requisites, to give to the lien full binding force and effect. Moreover, his lien, even if valid and of full binding force, could only protect him, as to materials furnished on the employment of Kelly and under the verbal contract with him, and pould only be effective, to the extent of any money due by the plaintiff, the mortgagee, to Kelly oil the contract between them and unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">It is in evidence that no money was due by the plaint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>iff to Kelly under that contract: The referee, however, held, that by the failure of the defendant Simonson to file a notice of <em>lis pendens </em>within the ninety days required by the mechanics\u2019 lien law, he lost whatever rights in the mortgaged premises he otherwise might have acquired, and that this omission was fatal to his claim to any relief in this action. There is ample authority to sustain that conclusion (Bower <em>v. </em>N. Y. Christian, &amp;c. Home, 64 <em>IIow. Pr. </em>509 ; Potter <em>v. </em>Rowland, 8 <em>N. Y. </em>448; Weyer <em>v. </em>Beach, 19 <em>Ib. </em>409).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">The defendant, Simonson, has also excepted to findings of the referee, as to items of costs and disbursements allowed in his second report, and has appealed from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In my opinion none of the exceptions to the findings of facts and conclusions of law of the referee, is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Sedgwick, Oh. J., and Truax, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
