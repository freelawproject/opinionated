This motion was proper if plaintiff could make no further claim for a conveyance of the property in this action. The provision of Code Civ. Pro. \u00a7 1614, as to <em>final judgment </em>is new, and has not previously been construed. But it need not be construed to require a final judgment terminating the whole litigation, as distinguished from the particular <em>Us, </em>which is referred to in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the notice as <em>pendens. </em>A statute is to he construed according to its intent\u2014to the mischief aimed at, and the remedy sought. The mischief aimed at by the new provision of the Code, was that no provision existed for removing <em>Us pendens </em>notices after they had become useless to plaintiff, while still harmful to defendant, and this <em>Us pendens </em>is useless to plaintiff in any sense recognized by the law, if he can never have specific\" performance. The language of the statute does not restrict the court to a needlessly narrow application of it. When an action is divisible, there may be more than one final judgment in it, as we shall see ; and the Code does not in terms call for <em>\u201c the </em>final judgment therein terminating the <em>whole </em>action.\u201d As against anything but the most precise verbiage, the intent governs (Smith <em>v. </em>People, 47 <em>N. Y. </em>330). Especially \u201cthe statutes regulating the mode of procedure, like all rules of practice, should be liberally construed in furtherance of justice \u201d (Hartnet <em>v. </em>Wandell, 60 <em>N. Y. </em>346).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-5\">II. Plaintiff could make no further claim for a conveyance of the property in this action. This motion was opposed, and apparently denied, on the ground that plaintiff could raise the question of specific performance on the new trial, which has been ordered by the court on defendants\u2019 appeal. But that portion of the judgment which denied specific performance, not having been appealed from by defendants (See Willis <em>v. </em>Bellamy, 52 <em>Super. Ct. </em>373), was not before the court; and the court did not have any jurisdiction to consider it (Kelsey <em>v. </em>Western, 2 <em>N. Y. </em>500). Nor did the court consider it. Their order was \u201c that the said judgment, <em>so far as appealed from by said defendants, </em>be reversed, a new trial ordered,\u201d &amp;c. The plaintiff and the court below apparently fell into the error of following the cases which hold that a new trial ordered in an action <em>at law, </em>must be a new trial of all the issues. See Story <em>v. </em>N. Y. &amp; Harlem R. R. Co. (6 <em>N. Y. </em>85).. -This is because a judgment <em>at law </em>is a unit; for the same reason, such a judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>cannot be partially reversed, and <em>cannot be partially appealed from </em>(Cromwell <em>v. </em>Burr, 12 <em>Week. Dig. </em>120). If this technical rule applied to all judgments, the Code Would not expressly provide for partial appeals (\u00a7 1300),' and for partial reversals (\u00a7 1317). The rule is so technical and arbitrary that it is not to be extended. It is not extended even to judgments at law covering several causes of action, which have frequently been affirmed as to one cause of action, while a new trial is ordered as to another. See Lawson <em>v. </em>Pickney (40 <em>Super. Ct. </em>187) ; Goodsell <em>v. </em>Western Union Tel. Co.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> It has never been carried further than to deny the right to split a single legal cause of action involving various items, as in Wolstenholme <em>v. </em>Wolstenholme File Manufacturing Co, (64 N. <em>Y. </em>272). And the opinion in that case concedes the propriety of a partial reversal of an equitable judgment. When the reversal is partial, the new trial is, of course, partial also (Adair <em>v. </em>Brimmer, 95 <em>N. Y. </em>35). The fact that the question was still open in this court, whether the <em>whole </em>complaint shall be dismissed as against the defendants Anna M. Bellamy and Katharine B. Johnson, cannot affect the decision of the present motion. That question turns upon plaintiff\u2019s claim to make the amount of his $500 deposit a lien upon their land, and recover it from them ; which claim is so totally inconsistent with specific performance, that entering judgment for the one relief waived the other (Murphy <em>v. </em>Spaulding, 46 <em>N. Y. </em>556). It may be suggested that the special term held it proper under the complaint to grant specific relief against the land\u2014namely, to make the $500 a lien upon it. It would be proper to consider such a suggestion if the notice were a notice of that claim. Such a notice would be not only inconsistent with, but vastly less harmful to defendants f.ha.n the present notice of claim for the whole land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-5\">III. The court below has not exercised its discretion, one way or the other, denying the motion as premature.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number><em>William Settle, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Reported <em>supra, </em>46.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b121-5\">By the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"A5N\">O\u2019Gormax, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxEv\">The question in dispute in this case is whether a notice of <em>lis pendens, </em>duly filed, should be cancelled before the entry of final judgment in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">A motion by defendants for cancellation of the <em>lis pendens </em>here, was made at the special term of this court and denied, on the ground that the motion was premature, and from this decision the defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">It was a matter resting in the discretion of the court, and the decision should not be disturbed without manifest cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The action was to compel specific performance of an agreement to convey title to real estate, or for the return to plaintiff of $500 paid on account of the purchase money. The action was tried at special term, and the court adjudged that the defendants were unable to convey, and that the plaintiff was not entitled to specific performance, but had a lien on the premises in question for the money so paid by him, with interest. From this judgment, the defendants appealed to the general term of this court, by whom the judgment was reversed and a new trial was ordered as to some of the defendants. An application was afterwards made to the general term for re-argument, which has not yet been decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">The Code of Civil Procedure provides in section 1674 that after the action is settled, discontinued, or abated, or final judgment is rendered therein against the party filing the notice of <em>lis pendens </em>and the time to appeal has expired, . . . the court may, in its discretion, on motion, direct that the notice of <em>lis pendens </em>be canceled of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">None of these events has taken place in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">The right to file a notice of <em>Us pendens </em>is statutory <em>(Code, \u00a7 </em>1670), and the provisions of the statute should be strictly followed in all their essential requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>, The order appealed from must be affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Sedgwick, Oh.
