Subsequently an action for the partition of the premises was commenced in the supreme court and the property sold under the judgment in that action, the grantor of the plaintiff purchasing No. 152 Leonard street, and James Boyd, through whom the defendants claim, purchasing No. 150 Leonard street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-10\">\u201cThe deed to James Boyd was dated April 1, 1865, and was acknowledged and recorded April 3, 1865. The deed to Peter Pia, through whom the plaintiff claims, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>dated on the same day, but was not acknowledged until April 4, 1865, and was not recorded until June 16, 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-5\">\u201c The grantees in said deeds mentioned, respectively took possession of the premises .purchased, and they or their grantees or devisees have continued in such possessian as now occupied by them, from the time of the delivery of the deeds down to the time of the trial. Neither of the deeds, purports to give the exact number of feet of the rear line of the lots conveyed. The deed to Boyd, which was first recorded, describes it as about twenty feet to a certain party-wall or partition now on said premises. The party-wall, rear building, is twenty-five feet eleven, inches, while the continuation of the center of the party-wall of the front building would make the rear lot nineteen feet eleven and one-half inches.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-6\">\u201cIt appears that in the partition suit the referee reported that the premises could not be actually partitioned because the pieces of property known as Nos. 150 and 154 Leonard street comprise two buildings in front and two buildings in the rear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-7\">\u201cThe report of sale states that No. 150 Leonard street was sold to James Boyd. This would, of course, be the front and rear building, and the court directed the referee to complete the sale and execute the necessary conveyance to the purchaser, and in pursuance of such direction the referee executed and delivered the deed hereinbefore described.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-8\">\u201cTaking into consideration the foregoing facts, it must have been.the intention to convey to Boyd the front and rear buildings known as No. 150, and this is confirmed by the undisputed possession of the premises for nearly twenty years, which, while not sufficient to give defendants title by adverse possession, is strong evidence of the construction of the 'deeds by the parties interested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-9\">\u201c On the whole case I think the defendants are entitled to judgment.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number><em>Kauffman &amp; Sanders, </em>attorneys, and <em>Lewis Sanders, </em>of counsel for appellant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ahy\">argued :\u2014I. If, in the description of the dividing line of the premises conveyed, the words, <em>\u201c </em>and on a line in continuation thereof \u201d be rejected as surplusage, the descriptions, by measurements and monuments, coincide and supplement each other and are in exact accord with themselves and the facts. That this is the rule and its proper application the authorities are unanimous (Jackson <em>v. </em>Marsh, 6 <em>Cow. </em>283 ; Wagner <em>v. </em>Hodge, 34 <em>Hun, </em>524 : affirmed, 98 <em>N. Y. </em>654 ; Jackson <em>v. </em>Clark, <em>7 Johns. </em>222: Peck <em>v. </em>Mallams, 10 <em>N. Y. </em>532 ; Bookman <em>v. </em>Kurzman, 94 <em>Ib. </em>212). There is no ambiguity in the description, and in an action for specific performance a purchaser would be bound to take. There being nothing to construe, there could be no <em>\u201c </em>construction \u201d of the deeds. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A90\">II. A practical construction by <em>\u201c </em>practical location \u201d is indicative of a controversy settled by an agreed location. A simple occupation by one party and non-interference by the other gives title by possession when claimed adversely after twenty years, but not before. The decision below shortens the statute of limitations of twenty years by an indefinite quantity, and leaves the law of adverse possession entirely <em>in nubibus. </em>The statute requires twenty years of adverse possession ; the opinion says any time short of twenty years will give a title to the occupant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-6\">To establish a practical location, affirmative acts on both sides recognizing the correctness of boundary are essential. To call the negative act of a failure to bring suit an affirmative act fixing the boundaries by mutual agreement, is utterly destructive of the sense of the words. A title by practical location does not ripen sooner than that by adverse possession: <em>\u201c </em>The doctrine as to the practical location of a boundary line, is well settled by the courts ; it was adopted as a rule of repose, with a view of quieting titles, and rests upon the same ground as the statute in reference to adverse possession which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>has continued for a period of twenty years \u201d (Sherman <em>v. </em>Kane, 86 <em>N. Y. </em>73). In the above case, the \u201cpractical location \u201d was from 1812 to 1866, and the boundary line D D was shown on a map and on the soil. In Baldwin <em>v. </em>Brown (16 N. <em>Y. </em>364), for \u201cmore than forty years.\u201d In Jackson <em>v. </em>Bowen (1 Caines, 358), for thirty, six years. In Jackson <em>v. </em>Dysling (2 <em>Ib. </em>198), for forty years. In Jackson <em>v. </em>Vedder (3 <em>Johns. </em>8), forty years. In Jackson <em>v. </em>Dieffendorf <em>(Id. </em>269), thirty-eight years. In Jackson <em>v. </em>McCall (10 <em>Johns. </em>377), forty-one years. In Jones <em>v. </em>Smith (64 <em>N. Y. </em>180), for more than fifty years. In the case at bar there has been no practical location by both parties, or by one party, and acquiescence by the-other. Neither James Boyd nor his grantees have ever done anything to locate a boundary ; they have by their tenants, simply occupied the rear building to the party-wall, claiming adversely. James Boyd did not put up the party-wall, nor was it put up by Anthony Crown, the owner of both lots, as a boundary line between the lots ; first, it was not as matter of fact such boundary; second, the front party-wall already marked the actual boundary; third, there would have then been two boundaries, irreconcilable ; fourth, it would have impaired the sale of his property. The rear building is an accident, and defendants occupation mere adverse possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-5\">III. The rule that monuments control distances is subject to two qualifications : 1st, the monuments must be natural, not artificial; 2d, the quantity must be subordinate to the description, 1 \u2018 but when it appears from the designation of quantity or other elements of description that the courses and distances from a. fixed and determined line were intended to control monuments, then the latter shall be disregarded\u201d (Higinbotham <em>v. </em>Stoddard, 72 <em>N. Y. </em>99). It is clear that a lot twenty-four feet six inches by ..ninety-one feet, was intended to be conveyed ; that quantity was the primary consideration. No. 152 Leonard street would mean a full lot without accompanying qualification, \u2022\u201c The rule applies with less force to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>monuments which am artificial than to natural and permanent objects; and when there is anything in the description which shows that the courses and distances are right in themselves, they will prevail, because the primary object is to carry out the intention of the parties \u201d (Higinbotham <em>v. </em>Stoddard, <em>supra). </em>Here the intention of the parties was plain, as expressed in both the deeds, the one to James Boyd, the other to Peter Pia. Peter Pia was to get Ho. 152 Leonard street, as it appeared in front\u2014a full lot, a parallelogram. That the party-wall of the rear building is not in fine with that of the front building, neither alters the intention, nor defeats the description. Tear down the rear building, which finds no mention in the deeds, and which does not square with either Leonard or Centre streets, and there is no difficulty in running the lines both by distance and monument named in each deed--the lines running by distance as well as by call through the center of the party-wall of the buildings fronting on Leonard street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-5\">IV.

The construction of the buildings on both premises, and their occupation ever since their erection, show a practical and actual location of the boundary line between the rear buildings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-7\">II. The descriptions given in the deeds give a monumental point for the location of the boundary line between the premises 150 and 152. <em>(a.) </em>They started from a point on the rear fine at or opposite to the center of a party-wall or partition, and it is perfectly evident that the party-wall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>referred to was that between the rear buildings, <em>(b.) </em>The line of division which runs through a party-wall must have been the line running through the party-wall between the rear buildings, for the reasons not only that this was the party-wall upon or immediately contiguous to the rear line, but certainly because it was necessary to find a party-wall so located that, after the dividing fine had passed through it, such line will have a continuation before reaching the southerly side of Leonard street. This certainly designates the party-wall between the rear buildings as the one intended, for the front buildings stood on the very line of Leonard street, and it follows, as a mathematical demonstration, that there could be no continuation of any line to reach Leonard street after it had passed through the center of the party-wall between the front buildings. It would end as soon as it had passed through this wall, without any continuation, as is required by the description in the deed, <em>(c.) </em>It would be simply ridiculous to claim that the party-wall through which the division line was run was that between the front buildings, for the reasons above stated, and for the further reason that this wall did not correspond even in location to any distance given for the dividing line. In fact, as to location by distances (if \u201cabout\u201d is to be considered as thus locating), neither the wall between the rear or the front building was on line.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-5\">III. As to description of premises, <em>(a.) </em>\u201cWhere the descriptions in a deed several particulars, all of which are necessary to ascertain the land to be conveyed, nothing but what will correspond with all these particulars can pass by the grant; but if there be certain particulars sufficiently ascertained to locate the land, the additional, false or mistaken particulars may be rejected \u201d (Hathaway <em>v. </em>Power, 6 <em>Hall, </em>543; Wendall <em>v. </em>People, 8 <em>Wend. </em>189 ; Loomis <em>v. </em>Jackson, 19 <em>Johns. </em>452). (5.) \u201cIt is a settled rule that a conveyance is to be construed in reference to its distinct and visible locative calls as marked or appearing upon the land in preference to quantity, course, distance, map or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>anything else \u201d (Van Wyck <em>v. </em>Wright, 18 <em>Wend. </em>157). (c.) \u201c It is a rule of construction as to the description of premises in a deed that what is most material and most certain shall control that which is less material and less certain; courses and distances yield to natural, visible and ascertained objects \u201d (Doe <em>v. </em>Thompson, 5 <em>Cow. </em>371). <em>(d.) </em>\u201cPermanent and visible monument referred to in a deed will control course, distance and quantity\u201d (Drew <em>v. </em>Swift, 46 <em>N.

Y. </em>147). (f.) \u201cThe long established rules in reference to the construction of descriptions contained in conveyances require courts to adopt such an interpretation thereof as shall give effect to the instrument, according to the intentions of the parties if that is discoverable from legitimate sources of information \u201d (Bookman <em>v. </em>Kurzman, 94 <em>N.

Y. </em>561; 16 <em>Wend. </em>285).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-5\">IV. As to practical location, <em>(a.) \u201c </em>Practical location and long acquiescence in a boundary line are conclusive, not upon the ground that they are evidence of a parol agreement establishing the line, but because they are of themselves proof that the location is correct and of so controlling a nature as to preclude evidence to the contrary\u201d (Baldwin <em>v. </em>Brown, 16 <em>N. Y. </em>359). (6.) \u201cWhere there has been a practical location of the dividing line between the lands of adjoining owners, and a long acquiescence therein, the line so established will not be disturbed\u201d (Avery <em>v. </em>Empire Woolen Co., 82 <em>N.

(c.) \u201cA practical location of the boundary line between two lots, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>and an acquiescence by the adjoining owners, is conclusive upon them and their successors in interest \u201d (Sherman <em>v. </em>Kane, 86 <em>N.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"At1\">The common source of title was one Crown. After his death and in an action of partition between persons claiming under him by inheritance or by his' will, part of the real estate indicated by the accompanying diagram, was conveyed to the plaintiff and part to the defendant. It is evident from the case, that the intention of the two deeds that will be construed was to give to the plaintiff all eastwardly of a dividing line between the premises of both parties as they were intended to be conveyed, and to the defendant all westwardly of that line. The controversy will be determined by placing that, line according to the proper construction of the two deeds. The exterior lines of the plot comprising the two pieces, indicate the real estate as it was held before the conveyances. And the measurements are those given by the conveyances. The dividing line which runs about south from Leonard street, is not indicated on the diagram.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The description in the conveyance of the referee in partition, of the piece which the plaintiff afterwards Required, is as follows : Beginning at a point on the southwesterly side of Leonard street, distant ninety feet, three inches, more or less from the south-easterly corner of Leonard and Centre streets, running thence south-easterly along Leonard street twenty-four feet, four inches, thence south-westerly parallel with Centre street ninety-one feet, eight inches, <em>thence north-westerly parallel with Leonard street twenty-four feet, or thereabout, to or opposite to the centre of a party-wall or partition, and thence north-easterly through the centre of the said party-wall or partition and on a line in continuation thereof ninety-one feet, or thereabout, to the south-westerly side of1 Leonard street, the place of beginning.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The description in the referee\u2019s deed to defendant\u2019s land. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>is : Beginning at a point an the south-westerly side of Leonard street, distant forty feet south-easterly from the south-easterly corner of Leonard and Centre streets, running thence south-westerly parallel with Centre street fifty-seven feet and six inches, thence south-easterly parallel with Leonard street thirty feet, three inches ; thence south-westerly parallel with Centre street thirty-two feet and six inches; <em>thence south-easterly and parallel with Leonard street about twenty feet to or opposite to the center of a party-wall or partition now on said premises, thence north-easterly through the center of said party-wall or partition and on a line in continuation thereof, parallel with Centre street ninety feet, six inches, or thereabout, to the south-westerly side of Leonard street, aforesaid </em>fifty feet, three inches more or less to the point or place of beginning.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The words in italics, are the only words in the two deeds that specifically touch the matter of the dividing line that has been mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">A deed of conveyance of real estate operates through its granting and conveying parts as an actual delivery of land from grantor to grantee, of which the parties to the deed give an account or description in the words of the deed. In construing the deed, the land is viewed as it is in fact, and the question is, what has the grantor delivered, if the terms of the deed are considered altogether ?</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">It has been assumed that the easterly line of defendant\u2019s land, and the westerly fine of plaintiff\u2019s, were meant to be coincident. Such was the fact, excepting that the lengths were differently described. In the plaintiff\u2019s deed, so to call it, the fine was described as in length ninety-one feet,,or thereabout. In the defendant\u2019s it was ninety feet six inches, or thereabout. This would only show, disregarding the word \u201c thereabout,\u201d that plaintiff\u2019s fine continued six inches southwardly beyond defendant\u2019s line, as the north ends of both lines were at Leonard street. This prolongation is not material to the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>The line or lines in dispute must be held to be straight lines. In the defendant\u2019s deed it is said to be parallel with Centre street, which runs in a straight unbroken line. There is nothing to indicate a curved line, or one composed of two or more lines, forming angles. It is further clear, that the end of the dividing line at Leonard street is ninety feet three inches from the south-easterly corner of Leonard and Centre streets, because the next course from that end of the line, and to the place of beginning, is said to be fifty feet three inches along Leonard street to the place of beginning, which the description begins by stating to be on Leonard street forty feet from the corner of Leonard and Centre streets. The end of the line in dispute is therefore the center of the party-wall, marked \u201c B \u201d on the diagram. It is found, moreover, that plaintiff\u2019s land begins at the center of this party-wall, for the description begins at a point distant ninety feet three inches, more or less, from the corner of Leonard and Centre streets referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Again, by tfie defendant\u2019s deed, the course, from which the disputed fine begins to run, is parallel to Leonard street, and is about twenty feet. Both the surveys, made for the parties respectively, show that this twenty feet ends at about ninety feet three inches from Centre street, or the same distance that defendant\u2019s land extends from Centre street on Leonard street at the party-wall \u201cB.\u201d If there were no words in the deed to the contrary, the inference would be inevitable, that the eastern boundary would be a straight line drawn between the two points, each ninety feet three inches from Centre street. This straight line would go through the center of the party-wall \u201cB.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">It is, however, argued, that the words of the deed necessarily call for the extension of the twenty feet course to the center of party-wall \u201cA.\u201d The words and \u201cThence south-easterly, and parallel with Leonard street about twenty feet to or opposite to the center of a party-wall or partition now on said premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>The rule is invoked that a visible monument referred to will control courses, distances and quantities (Drew <em>v. </em>Swift, 46 <em>N. Y. </em>204). The course is intended to go to the monument, and the incorrect\" statement of the length of the course yields to the fact that it runs to the monument. The ground of this rule and its proper application appear in the opinion in Baldwin <em>v. </em>Brown (16 <em>N. Y. </em>359). \u201c The reason is that mistakes are deemed more likely to occur with respect to courses and distances than in regard to objects which are visible and permanent. This, however, is by no means an inflexible rule. When there is anything in the description which shows that the courses and distances are right, they will, of course, control, because the primary object in all cases is to arrive at the real intent of the parties. For instance, when it is apparent upon the face of the deed that the intention was to convey a specific quantity of land, if the courses and distances given would include that precise quantity, but the description by fixed monuments would embrace more or less, it is clear that the former should be followed. To do otherwise would be to defeat the plain intent of the parties.\u201d This was approved in Higinbotham <em>v. </em>Stoddard (72 <em>N. Y. </em>94), and in Brookman <em>v. </em>Kurzman (94 <em>Ib. </em>272). In the last case it was said : \u201cIn giving effect to such intention, it is also their duty to reject false or mistaken particulars provided there be enough of the description remaining to enable the land intended to be conveyed to be located (Hathaway <em>v. </em>Power, 6 <em>Hill, </em>453 ; Wendell <em>v. </em>People, 5 <em>Wend. </em>189 ; Loomis <em>v. </em>Jackson, 19 <em>John. </em>449). It was said in Robinson <em>v. </em>Kime (70 <em>N. Y. </em>147), that a conveyance is to be construed in reference to its visible locative calls, as appearing upon the land .... and any particular may be rejected if inconsistent with other parts of the description and sufficient remains to locate the land intended to be conveyed. The rule that a monument controls other positions of the description in a deed is not inflexible ; when the monument is repugnant to another of like character, or a map gives other results, the truth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>is to be ascertained from all the facts of the case (Townsend <em>v. </em>Hayat, 51 <em>N. Y. </em>656 ; Higinbotham <em>v. </em>Stoddard, 72 <em>Ib. </em>94).\u201d The principle is again recognized in Hussner <em>v. </em>Brooklyn <em>City </em>Railroad Co. (96 <em>N. Y. 18) </em>; Mott <em>v. </em>Mott (68 <em>N. Y. </em>246), and the cases cited there.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">That the party-wall, to which or opposite to which the line of twenty feet is said to run, is the party-wall \u201cA,\u201d seems to be clear. The use of the alternative refers to the fact that there was doubt whether the party-wall ran quite to the rear line of the lots. The phrase is applicable to party-wall \u201cA,\u201d but not \u201c B,\u201d for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">In considering whether the course or the party-wall <em>\u201cA\u201d </em>controls, it must be noticed that the party-wall is distant from the last point of departure twenty-five feet, nine and a half inches. This is a difference from the course of twenty feet, more or less, of great importance and not likely to occur from imperfect surveying. The words \u201cmore or less\u201d are not to be taken to intend to comprize such a possible mistake. These words are not meant to convey an indefinite quantity. They are a guard against inaccuracy (Brady <em>v. </em>Hennion, 8 <em>Bosw. </em>528). It would be one consequence of extending the line to twenty-five feet and more, that the next or disputed line, would end at a point on Leonard street, that would give the defendant five more feet there, than it is certain the deed intended to give.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The description in the defendant\u2019s deed will not allow the disputed line to run in this way. That line is claimed to run parallel to Centre street, and through the center of party-wall \u201cA\u201d and on a continuation of that center-line, but it is made to end at ninety feet three inches from the corner of Centre and Leonard street. If it does so end and if it be a straight line, beginning at the center of party-wall \u201cA\u201d it will be a diagonal line, leaving the party-wall \u201cA\u201d at a short distance from the point of beginning, running through an alleyway on Leonard street, cutting through beams above that alley and entering party-wall \u201cB\u201d at a short distance from Leonard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>street. No conceivable state of facts would present a motive for a division of this kind, which, if by chance it had been made at a former time, would have brought about a re-arrangement for convenience of occupation and of sale, that would have been settled in the partition action.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Eunning the line as proposed by plaintiff would give to him possession of the whole of party-wall \u201cA.\u201d And of a part of defendant\u2019s house, indicated along its beams by no supporting partition. Yet if it be run as proposed by defendant it will give him the whole of party-wall \u201cB\u201d and a part of plaintiff\u2019s house on Leonard street. Such a division would be eccentric and inconvenient, but not so eccentric and inconvenient as would be the division made by running the diagonal line, that has been imagined.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">All the inferences that have been drawn from the terms of defendant\u2019s deed would be repeated in an analysis of the description of plaintiff\u2019s deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The difficulty is solved and the incoherent made coherent by holding that the following are the dominant certainties of the conveyances: On Leonard street the dividing point is the center of party-wall \u201cB,\u201d ninety feet three inches east from the corner of Centre street and Leonard street. The dividing line runs southwardly from that point and parallel with Centre street ninety feet six inches, or ninety-one feet or thereabout, until it meets the rear line of defendant\u2019s premises. The result is, that rear line is found to be twenty feet long more or less, as given in defendant\u2019s deed. If these things are certain, then the deed as a whole does not give the defendant to party-wall \u201cA.\u201d It is certain that the words \u201cto or opposite to \u201d the party-wall is a mistake in the description of the line of twenty feet, and not the reverse. The former is to be rejected and not the latter. The cases that have been cited say, in substance, that when no other parts of the description should be considered, then simply as between the statement of a length of a line and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>of the fact that such line runs to a monument, the latter is to be deemed the more certain evidence of the intention, but that other parts of the description may show that the statement of length is the more certain. If the parties were on the land and went over the lines, it would be clear that a declaration or supposed perception that the point referred to was opposite the party-wall, was a mistake in words or of the senses, was an error or inadvertence, shared by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Judgment should be reversed, new trial ordered, with costs to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Van Vorst and Freedman, J'J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
