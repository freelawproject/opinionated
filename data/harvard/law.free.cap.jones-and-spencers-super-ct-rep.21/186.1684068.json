Plaintiffs sent thirteen pieces, of which twelve contained over fifty yards each, and one contained thirty-nine and one-half yards,- in all one hundred and eighteen and three-quarter yards more than the greatest number which defendant had ordered in fourteen pieces. Plaintiffs sent the invoice and bill of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>lading to their agent in New York, with instructions to present them to defendant, and insure performance of his agreement to pay cash on receipt of invoice.

The goods shipped by plaintiffs were in accordance with the requirements of' the contract. 1st. The goods were ordered to be sent \u201c as samples.\u201d 2d. The only direction as to length was the expression, \u201c Say, thirty to forty yards to a piece,\u201d and these words were words of expectation and estimate only;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-10\">II. The correspondence set out in the complaint shows that the defendant had not before purchased this sort of goods of plaintiff, and ordered these goods as samples. He was not familiar with the usual weights, widths or prices, and in his first letter asks for information on these points. He says nothing about lengths, however, and it is everywhere evident that he did not consider that element as important or of the essence of the contract. The plaintiffs\u2019 order was for \u201cpieces\u201d of the goods. It appears by the complaint that pieces of West of England cloth, of the quality ordered by defendant, always average from forty to fifty-six yards a piece, and are always sold by the piece. If the plaintiffs were to send \u201c pieces \u201d of goods \u201cas samples\u201d they were surely to send them of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>lengths which they were always manufactured. It appears that they did send the shortest that they had. This was the only thing that they could do. Had they sent goods of any shorter lengths they would not have been 1 c sample pieces \u2019 \u2019 but only part of pieces.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-5\">III.

The plaintiffs are copartners engaged in the manufacture and sale of cloths in England. The defendant is a dealer in carnage cloths in New York. The plaintiffs shipped the gc ds by steamship from Liverpool and by the bill of lac. ng consigned the goods to the defendant at New York. But instead of sending the bill of lading to the defendant with the invoice, they sent both the bill of lading and the invoice to their agent in New York with instructions to present the same to the defendant and to insure the performance by the defendant of his agreement to pay cash on receipt of the invoice. After the arrival of the goods at the port of New York, they were taken from the hold of the vessel and placed upon the dock. While there, they were destroyed by fire before the bill of lading and the invoice were presented to the defendant, and consequently before the defendant could get possession of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">At the trial, the compiamt o^ une plaintiffs was dismissed, and their exceptions were ordered to be heard at general term in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">Upon this disposition of the case the first and funda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>mental question which presents itself, is whether the plaintiffs complied with the order of the defendant as given.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">It clearly appears that in the course of a lengthy correspondence the defendant ordered the plaintiffs to send fourteen pieces of goods of thirty to forty yards to a piece. The plaintiffs sent thirteen pieces, of which twelve contained over fifty yards each, and the thirteenth of which contained thirty-nine and one-half yards. The total number of yards amounted to six hundred and seventy-eight and three-quarters, or one hundred and eighteen and three-quarter yards more than the greatest number of yards which the defendant had ordered in fourteen pieces. For this deviation from the order the plaintiffs present reasons which would be quite satisfactory if the defendant had in some way assented. But they must be disregarded because they were never made known to the defendant in any way, and he in no wise sanctioned the deviation. His order was in writing, it was clear and explicit, it spoke for itself, and he had a right to stand upon it, whether the goods were or were not ordered as samples. In sending pieces which did not comply with the order, without having procured defendant\u2019s assent to the change, the plaintiffs sent them at their own risk. This is fatal to plaintiffs\u2019 action in every aspect of the case, and renders a consideration of the other questions unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The exceptions taken by the plaintiffs should be overruled, and judgment should be ordered for the defendant, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Sedgwick, Oh. J., and Ingraham, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
