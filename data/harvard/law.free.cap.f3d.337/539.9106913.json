We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-28\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b561-29\">From 1989 to 1998, Brown worked for the City\u2019s Health and Human Services Department (\u201cthe Department\u201d) as a Sanita-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>r\u00edan II, which required her to conduct inspections of restaurants to ensure they complied with City ordinances on food storage, preparation, and handling. On March 20, 1998, Chirag Bhatt (\u201cBhatt\u201d), Division Manager of the Department, received a report from another Department employee that she saw Brown conducting personal business in a City vehicle during the work day.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The City prohibits its employees from using City vehicles on City time to conduct personal business.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Brown\u2019s conduct violated this prohibition. Brown attempted to hide her misconduct by falsely stating that she had conducted two inspections during the time she was seen conducting personal business. This conduct violated other City policies and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">On June 30, 1998, the Mayor placed Brown on indefinite suspension.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Houston, Tex., Code of ORDINANCES \u00a7 14 \u2014 182(a) (2002) (\u201cThe Mayor may, for just cause, indefinitely suspend, demote, reduce in pay, or temporarily suspend any civil service employee, which action shall be subject to review by the commission\u201d). In accordance with City procedure, Brown appealed her indefinite suspension to the Civil Service Commission for Municipal Employees (\u201cthe Commission\u201d). See <em>id. </em>\u00a7 14-182(c) (\u201c[T]he employee shall retain the right of appeal to the commission.... After hearing the appeal, the commission shall either sustain the action, lessen the penalty, increase the penalty, or reject the action of the mayor, and the decision of the commission shall be final\u201d). After holding a hearing, the Commission decided to permanently discharge Brown from employment with the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Brown filed suit in Texas state court, alleging that the City discriminated and retaliated against her for prior lawful conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Subsequently, Brown amended her suit to include claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1967, the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. In response, the City removed the action to federal court. The district court dismissed all of Brown\u2019s claims except her cause of action under \u00a7 1981. The district court later granted summary judgment to the City on Brown\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claim, finding that: (1) the Commission, not the Mayor, was the policymaker because its decision to terminate Brown was final and unreviewable; and (2) Brown failed to show that the Commission terminated her because of her race or her complaints to the Mayor and the EEOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Hodges v. Delta Airlines, Inc., </em>44 F.3d 334, 335 (5th Cir.1995) (en banc). Summary judgment is properly granted only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. 56(c). We view the evidence and the inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Daniels v. City of Arlington, </em>246 F.3d 500, 502 (5th Cir.2001). Unsubstantiated assertions, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation are not sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. <em>Bridgmon v. Array Sys. Corp., </em>325 F.3d 572, 577 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Hugh Symons Group, plc v. Motorola, Inc., </em>292 F.3d 466, 468 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">On appeal, Brown argues that the Mayor, not the Commission, was the policymaker. In particular, Brown alleges that she was terminated by the Mayor, and the Commission did not perform a meaningful review of his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Under the City\u2019s Code of Ordinances, the Mayor only has the power to \u201cindefinitely suspend, demote, reduce in pay, or temporarily suspend\u201d City employees, not to terminate them. Houston, Tex., Code of ORDINANCES \u00a7 14-182(a) (2002). All such actions taken by the Mayor are \u201csubject to review by the [C]ommission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Commission makes the \u201cfinal\u201d decision to \u201csustain the action, lessen the penalty, increase the penalty, or reject the action of the mayor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 14-182(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">In <em>Worsham v. City of Pasadena, </em>a construction-site inspector who was indefinitely suspended by the mayor and later reinstated by the city council sued the city under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, arguing that his suspension violated his constitutional rights. 881 F.2d 1336 (5th Cir.1989). This Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">[N]o matter how much power an official has, no municipal liability exists if that official does not set the policy at issue .... [T]he employee must have <em>final </em>policymaking authority in that area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1340. The Court found that the mayor did not have final policymaking authority because a meaningful procedure existed for the review of the mayor\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1341 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">Similarly, the Mayor in this case did not have final policymaking authority to terminate Brown. Only the Commission had the authority to make the final decision to terminate her. For this reason, Brown\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">In <em>Hitt v. Connell, </em>this Court found that a constable who terminated a deputy constable had final policymaking authority, even though the constable\u2019s decision was subject to review by a civil service commission. 301 F.3d 240, 247-49 (5th Cir.2002). Brown relies on <em>Hitt </em>to argue that the Mayor had final policymaking authority. However, the facts of this case and <em>Hitt </em>differ significantly. First, the constable in <em>Hitt </em>terminated the deputy constable, but the Mayor did not terminate Brown. <em>Id. </em>at 244-45. Instead, the Commission terminated her. Second, the civil service commission in <em>Hitt </em>was not designated as the final decision-maker, but the Commission is designated as the final decision-maker by the City\u2019s Code of Ordinances. <em>Id. </em>at 248. Third, the Code gives the Commission \u201csuperintending responsibility over individual employment decisions\u201d of the Mayor. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, the civil service commission in <em>Hitt </em>had no such responsibility. <em>Id. </em>In sum, our decision in this case is consistent with <em>Hitt. Stimpson v. City of Tuscaloosa, </em>186 F.3d 1328 (11th Cir.1999) (holding that civil service board was the final policymaker because Alabama law designated it as such); <em>Hitt, </em>301 F.3d at 248 (contrasting the facts in <em>Hitt </em>with the facts in Stimpson).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">Brown also argues that the review procedure in this case was not meaningful because the Commission refused to consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>er any evidence regarding her complaints to the Mayor and the EEOC. The Commission based its refusal on the fact that Brown\u2019s complaints had no bearing on whether she was guilty of the alleged misconduct. During Brown\u2019s hearing, a member of the Commission stated that \u201cif she didn\u2019t do [it], it doesn\u2019t matter whether she has EEOC complaints or not. She should keep her job.\u201d Brown has provided no evidence that the review procedure was not meaningful; therefore, her second argument is also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-5\">. Specifically, Brown was seen shopping at a McFrugals store from 2:45 pm to 3:20 pm on March 19, 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b562-6\">. The City uses electronic devices known as \"trackers\u201d to ensure the proper use of City vehicles. Brown normally drove a City vehicle that had a tracker, but on March 19, Brown was driving a vehicle that did not have a tracker.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\">. The Mayor suspended Brown after Bhatt\u2019s investigation revealed the full extent of Brown's misconduct and Dr. Mary Kendrick recommended that Brown be placed on indefinite suspension.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b562-13\">.Specifically, Brown filed two complaints of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in 1995 and 1997, and she complained to the Mayor about her supervisor and alleged discrimination during a public meeting in April 1998. Neither Brown nor the City discuss her complaints to the EEOC and the Mayor in depth.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
