He afterwards became the guardian of Martha Burton, the plaintiff, and gave bond with the other defendants, his sureties. He never passed any guardian account; but was removed, and Ben. Burton appointed in his place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-11\">This suit was brought against him as former guardian, to recover the balance so'distributed to the plaintiff, as her share of her father\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-12\">\n<em>Cullen</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsL\">moved a nonsuit.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b434-13\"><em>By the </em>Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AOZ\">\u2014This question was decided in the old Court of Errors and Appeals. <em>(State use Owens </em>vs. <em>Luff, M. S.; </em>5 <em>Mason Rep. </em>95; <em>Pratt </em>vs. <em>Northam, </em>1 <em>Kinne Comp. </em>388; 1 <em>Dana\u2019s Rep. </em>514; 4 <em>Mason Rep. </em>131, <em>Taylor </em>vs. <em>De Blois.) </em>In order to charge the guardian and his sureties, for money which comes into his hands as administrator, he must do some act signifying his purpose to change the fund into the guardianship; such as passing an account charging himself as guardian. Or, without such actual change of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>of the fund, if by his neglect to do so, which in his case, would be equivalent to neglecting to collect a debt due from another, the money should be lost by the insolvency of sureties in the administration bond, a breach of the condition of the guardian bond founded on this neglect, might, perhaps, warrant a recovery. But in the present case, the single breach is, that the money being in defendant\u2019s hands as guardian, he did not pay, \u00e1se. We think he cannot recover on this breach. If he were, it would not prevent a recovery again on the administration bond. There cannot be a doubt, that-if this action were on the administration bond, the plaintiff would recover on the proof now offered; for it shows an admission of the money in defendant\u2019s hands in that character.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b435-5\"><em>Houston </em>and <em>M\u2018Fee, </em>for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b435-6\"><em>Cullen, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Judgment of nonsuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
