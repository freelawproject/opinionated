The defendant entered into possession under a contract of purchase which fie failed to comply with; and the question was whether he could be held liable for rent whilst he occupied. There was some evidence offered of admissions by the defendant that he was liable for rent, or of his payment of taxes which he said he should deduct from the rent.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>Houston </em>and <em>Wootten, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-9\"><em>Cullen, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-3\"><em>Cullen, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ac9t\">\u2014Where one enters into the possession of land as a purchaser, he cannot be liable for rent in an action for use and occupation. . There is no promise implied by the law arising from such a relation, to pay the rent. If Barker went into the possession under any contract or agreement express or implied with Redden to pay rent, he is liable in this action; but if he entered as a purchaser and owner, he is not liable for the rent though he never paid the purchase money.

It proceeds on the idea of a contract of renting, either express or implied. A contract for the payment -of rent may be implied from circumstances. The relation of landlord and tenant must exist. If the defendant enter under an agreement to purchase, he is not H\u00e1ble for rent; for the character of purchaser excludes that of tenant; except perhaps, in a case similar to the present, where the defendant enters under a conditional contract for the purchase, and there is an express agreement to pay rent in case such purchase should not be carried out; the defendant might be liable on proof of such express agreement. If the jury think this is such a case, and the agreement is sufficiently proved, the plaintiff ought to have a verdict; otherwise, not.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Verdict for defendant</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
