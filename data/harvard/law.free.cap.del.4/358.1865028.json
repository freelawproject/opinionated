The declaration set out the bond, and assigned the following breaches: 1. Averring\u2019that theretofore, to wit, on the 20th of April A. D., 1838, at, &amp;c., before J. C.'Esq., one of the justices of the peace, &amp;c., the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>said Israel Coverdale, by the judgment of said justice, recovered against a certain Nelly Redden, the sum of $38 05, for a cause of action within the jurisdiction of said justice, &lt;fec., upon which judgment afterwards, to wit, on the 6th of May A. D., 1841, at,- &amp;c., execution was issued by said justice, directed, &amp;c., and duly placed in the hands of the said Warren Fowler, then being one\u2018of the constables, &amp;c., to be executed. Breach, that although there was sufficient goods of the defendant in said execution, the said W. F., constable as aforesaid, would not levy the said execution as he was commanded, &amp;c., but neglected, &amp;c. <em>2. </em>That the said W. F., constable, &amp;c., would not make due return of said execution as commanded, &amp;c., but neglected, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-4\">The defendants pleaded among other pleas: 2. Performance; 4. That the judgment in said declaration mentioned, was rendered in favor of- said Israel Coverdale against the said Nelly Redden, on the 20th of April, 1838, and the said pretended execution was issued on the 6th- of May, 1841, a period of more than three years from the rendition of the judgment, without the same having been revived by a scire facias against the said Nelly Redden.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-5\">The plaintiff demurred to the 2d. and 4th. pleas, and took issue on the others.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-6\">\n<em>Cullen,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQys\">in support of the demurrer. 1st. A plea of performance to a declaration setting out a breach is bad. 2d. Every matter set out in the fourth plea is set out in the same terms in the declaration. The defendant should then have taken issue or demurred to the declaration, and not pleaded. A party cannot plead that which is already admitted by the previous pleading: for the other party can answer it no otherwise than as he has before stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-7\">But the plea assumes that it is a good defence for the constable\u2019s default of levying this execution, that it issued irregularly; as if the officer could set up this defect, or the writ itself could be avoided in this action. A public officer cannot dispute his authority except for want of jurisdiction. This execution was only voidable at the instance of the defendant. It was a <em>good authority for the officer </em>levy or sell upon. (8 <em>Johns.
