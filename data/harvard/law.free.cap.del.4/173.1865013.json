For an unexplained interlineation in the body of the instrument sued on of the words clear of wharfage and expense. <em>(Shep. Touch. </em>66, <em>ch, 4</em>; 1 <em>Pet. Rep. </em>364; <em>2 Phil. Ev. </em>88; 5 <em>Co. Rep. </em>23; 1 <em>Chit.

The defendant said yes; but he was not bound to produce it.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-10\">2. For a variance between the deed declared on, and the instrument ..given in evidence. 1. The declaration states a contract by Henry May: the contract itself is in the plural number \u201c We,\u201d meaning Henry May and Jonathan May, trading under the firm of H. May &amp; Son. <em>2: </em>The contract specifies about two hundred cords of wood: the narr., has it two hundred cords, more or less. There is a manifest difference between two hundred cords <em>more cm less, </em>and <em>about </em>two hundred cords. 3. The declaration states that May agreed to <em>accept </em>and pay plaintiffs\u2019 drafts: the contract is, that they shall pay the plaintiff\u2019s drafts. 4. The declaration states a contract for payment at sixty and ninety days: whereas, the contract offered is to pay by three instalments, <em>in June, November and April, </em>by drafts at sixty and ninety days. 5. The contract was for wood, such as was cut in C. S. Layton\u2019s woods: there is no averment that the wood sent was <em>such </em>wood..</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-11\">If there is a material variance, advantage may be taken of it on a motion for a nonsuit, on the plea of non est factum. (1 <em>Saund. Pl. &amp; Ev. </em>457; 9 <em>East </em>188; 11 <em>Ibid. </em>632.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-12\"><em>Houston, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUc\">\u20141st. It does not appear that the interlineation was made after the execution of the deed. The contrary is the fact. And it is too late after the contract is admitted in evidence, to ask a nonsuit for an alteration not proved to be made after execution. Thfe defendant has a counterpart which he refuses to show. 2d. The narr., sets out the contract by its legal effect, and there is no variance.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b185-13\">A majority of the'court refused the nonsuit. Judge Harrington <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>differed on the ground that the contract as alledged was of a purchase of twelve hundred cords of wood, of which two hundred cords <em>more or less, </em>should be seasoned wood; whereas the contract was for one thousand cords of wood, of which <em>about </em>two hundred cords should be seasoned.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b186-5\"><em>Houston, </em>for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b186-6\"><em>Layton </em>and <em>Cullen, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The plaintiffs had a verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
