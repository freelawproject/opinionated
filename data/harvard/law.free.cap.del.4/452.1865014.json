Narr., in assumpsit, on the usual counts, and pn a special contract of affreightment. Pleas, non-assumpsit, payment, set-off, discount and act of limitation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-9\">The ship Walter was wrecked near Indian river, in Oct. 1844, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Wm. Andrews for Nahum Andrews, who had a contract to save the goods, employed captain Allen of the schooner General Harrison, to convey goods from the ship to Philadelphia for $125, and $10 a day for demurrage. Captain Allen was detained at Philadelphia by the revenue officers several days. The consignee paid the freight, and referred the matter of demurrage to Andrews himself.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-4\">Layton, for defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0p\">moved a nonsuit, 1st. Because the action was brought against an agent, where the principal was known. Where the agent discloses his principal, the only remedy is against the principal. (1 <em>Chit. Pl. </em>25, 74; 15 East 62-6; 15 <em>Ves. </em>352; <em>Paley P. &amp; A. </em>246; 3 <em>Camp. </em>817; 2 <em>M. </em>&amp; <em>S. </em>438.) 2d. Because the evidence showed a <em>joint </em>contract of Wm. and Nahum Andrews. 3d. Because the contract was in writing, and could be proved only by the bill of lading, which fixes the freight at $125, without any reservation for demurrage. (17 <em>Law Lib. </em>103-5; <em>Smith on Merc. Law </em>173-5.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b463-5\">\n<em>The Court</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Aj-N\">refused the motion: 1st. An agent contracting personally, is personally liable, though his agency be known, and the principal be disclosed. (2 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>630; 1 <em>Saund. Pl. &amp; Ev. </em>82, 72.)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">2d. If this be a joint contract, it is not a ground for a non-suit. That must be pleaded in abatement. It is no less the contract of W. D. Andrews because it is also the contract of N. Andrews. And if a defendant would object, that not only he, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>but others, made the contract, he must plead it. Not so of a plaintiff. He knows with whom the contract was made.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b464-6\"><em>Houston, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b464-7\"><em>Layton, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">3d. The third ground depends on evidence yet to be produced by the defendant, and cannot be any reason for a nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
