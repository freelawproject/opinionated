S. Bishop, the appellant, and Jas. Clark and Chas. <em>W. </em>Smith, for the debt of $27 95, with costs, on the 24th of February, 1830; which said Clark and Smith have died, leaving the appellant to survive them. Demand <em>$50. The </em>justice\u2019s transcript showed that an execution issued directed to S.

That an alias execution issued Sept. 17, 1836, to John Woodall, returnable the 2d of Jan., 1837, and was returned endorsed with a further payment of $5, made to the plaintiff, June 26, 1839. Scire facias issued May 19, 1842, by Wm. Ringgold, Esq., against Wm. S.

It is dated February 24th, 1830, returnable April 12, 1830. It was returned <em>by plaintiff. </em>While an execution is out, unreturned, I admit the judgment may be considered satisfied; or rather, that no proceedings can be had until the execution is returned; for until then it cannot appear whether the judgment is satisfied or not. This execution was returned by plaintiff. Is that a sufficient return?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b125-6\">Bates.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4W\">\u2014This execution was delivered to Wools, constable, returnable April 12, 1830. Before its return there were payments, in 1830 and 1832. It is returned by the plaintiff, as appears by the record. The return is an official act, and the defendant has a right to know by the return of the officer, whether the officer has received the money, or what has been done on the execution. Plaintiff endorsed the execution with the credits. There is no return under the hand of the constable, which is essential. (18 <em>Com. Law </em>307, <em>Wilson </em>vs. <em>Kingston; </em>2 <em>Tidd </em>933; 1 <em>Salk. </em>318.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Ordered, that judgment be entered for Bishop, the appellant, on the ground that the party could not issue other execution process whilst the former remained unreturned, the presumption of law being that the judgment was satisfied on the first execution, until the contrary appeared <em>by the return of the officer.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
