The court overruled the question.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-14\"><em>Cullen </em>and <em>Saulsbury, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOb\">\u2014The action is in case for deceit; not in assumpsit on the warranty. In the latter action, if the warranty enter into the contract the plaintiff will recover on proof of the warranty, whether the defendant <em>knew </em>the defect or not. Not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>so in the action of deceit. There the plaintiff must prove the <em>scienter; </em>that the defendant knew the defect, and <em>intended </em>to cheat plaintiff by the false representation. In either form of action plaintiff must prove the unsoundness, or that the representations were not true; which is not proved here. Defects open to view are not within the warranty. <em>(Ross on Vend. </em>174, <em>338; 2 Steph. N. P. </em>1285.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b436-11\"><em>Layton, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b436-12\"><em>Cullen </em>and <em>Saulsbury, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-4\">Neither will trover lie as on a rescinding the contract; for the property in the horse is changed by the exchange. (2 <em>Steph. N. P. </em>1296-7.) The first count affirms the contract, and seeks damages on account of it; the second seeks to disaffirm the contract, and recover back the oxen. These are improperly joined.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b436-5\"><em>Layton, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AW7a\">\u2014Whatever the vendor represents at the time of sale is a warranty. (2 <em>Steph. N. P. </em>1289; 3 <em>Stark. Ev. </em>1261.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-6\">As to the joinder of the count in trover, with case for the deceit, it is proper; (1 <em>Ch. Pl. </em>201;) and, if it were defective, objection cannot be taken now.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b436-7\"><em>By the </em>Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AiR\">\u2014A mere assertion by the seller that a horse is sound, is not a warranty, <em>unless intended as such. </em>(3 <em>Stark. Ev. </em>1661, <em>n.;) </em>and the only remedy for such misrepresentation is in <em>case </em>for the deceit; where it must be proved that the seller knew of the falsehood of his statement, and intended to deceive. (2 <em>Steph. N. P. </em>1286; 3 <em>Stark. Ev. </em>1660; 1 <em>Wh. Selw. </em>647.)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">A mere affirmation is a warranty, <em>if so intended; </em>in which case, or where there is an express warranty, it enters into the contract; and the best action is assumpsit for breach of the contract, though case for breach of warranty will still lie. (2 <em>East\u2019s Rep. </em>446.) And where the action is for a breach of warranty, whether its form be assumpsit or case, it matters not whether the seller <em>knew </em>his statement to be untrue o'r not.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Where the action is case for deceit, a count in trover may be added, (3 <em>Chit. Plead. </em>390.)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">Verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
