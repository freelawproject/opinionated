By the death of a party, no suit <em>where the cause of action survives, </em>shall abate, &amp;c. <em>(Const., art. </em>6, \u00a7 18.) Actions of tort are not within this saving, but fall under the common law principle, actio personalis moritur, &amp;c. <em>(Parke on Dower </em>308-9; 1 <em>Cruise\u2019s Dig. </em>17; <em>Tit. Dower, ch. </em>4, \u00a7 41; 1 <em>Lev. </em>38; 1 <em>Salk. Rep. </em>252; 1 <em>Show. Rep. </em>97, S. <em>C.; </em>3 <em>Mod. </em>282; 3 <em>Lev. </em>275, <em>S. C.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-10\">The action of dower sounds in damages; it is for a tort; ex delicto, not ex contractu; goes for damages for wrongful detention. If the tenant die, pending the action for dower, the action abates; if the demandant die, pending action, the suit cannot proceed; and, even after judgment for dower, if she die, no remedy survives for the damages. Damages are no \u00bfluty until assessed. (3 <em>Mod. 282; 2 Brown Ch. Cases </em>629-32.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b437-11\">Houston.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aky\">\u2014Damages for arrears of dower are recoverable only under the statute of Merton, which gives the action of scire facias for damages, after recovery of dower. Our own act, <em>Dig. </em>164, gives damages for detention of dower, \u201c in satisfaction of any demand on account of rents and profits,\u201d treating this as as a debt, and indeed, a favored demand in law. I see not why it should abate.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b437-12\">Wootten.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amy\">\u2014The right to damages for arrears of dower, is given <em>by </em>our act as expressly in the name and character of damages, as by the statute of Merton. It is a remedy for a tort sounding in damages, and as distinctly apart from any contract, as any other personal action which dies with the person. This is not a suit for rent, but for <em>damages </em>for a wrongful detention of dower.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b437-13\"><em>By the </em>Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AHX\">\u2014This is a real action. It is a demand of the land; and the damages are a mere accident given by the act of assembly. It is not even a mixed action. It is purely a claim for the land. The damages for demotion can in no case be recovered without recovery of the dower; and as this is impossible after the death of the dowress, the damages fall with her death. Nonsuit granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
