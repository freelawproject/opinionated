T. Gibbons addressed a letter to the court from Baltimore, through Mr. Ridgely, his counsel in this case against Arcada Gibbons, stating that he had compromised that matter with her, and was \u201c entirely satisfied and compensated;\u201d and that he had no claim against his father\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-3\">On the other page of this letter was the following.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-4\"><em>City of Baltimore, </em>Sept. 29th, 1843.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-5\">Gentlemen,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-6\">Whereas a certain power of attorney given by me to a certain William Hazzard, to adjust a difficulty then existing between myself and William Laws, impowering him to act as my agent until the same should be settled, and then, to be null and void. I wish to be specially noticed, as he wishes to extend the same to my general business; such, gentlemen, is not, nor never was my <em>intent, wish, </em>or <em>desire, </em>and since my return from Missouri, I have repeatedly and, often verbally cancelled it, and I now wish it officially and legally so ; and do not countenance or authorize any act or will of his, in any shape, to be my <em>intent, wish, </em>or <em>desire.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-7\">Respectfully,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-8\">Francis T.

Hazzard, as the attorney in fact of F. T. Gibbons, to prosecute this suit further , against Arcada Gibbous, as administratrix of John Gibbons, after his revocation of the attorney\u2019s authority. A nonsuit had been entered on account of the failure of Wm. Hazzard to procure evidence at the last term; but on his affidavit, he now satisfied the court that he had used due diligence to procure the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-11\">Rule to show cause, why the nonsuit should not be taken off.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-12\"><em>Frame, </em>in support of the rule.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai2\">\u2014The question is, whether Wm. Hazzard has the right to prosecute this suit, notwithstanding the order of Francis Gibbons, to discontinue it. If the court find that Wm. Hazzard has an interest in the suit, they will protect it. He has such interest under the order of October 12th, 1840. It is true that order is to pay W m. Hazzard \u201c my attorney in fact,\u201d but this is a mere description of the person, and does not show the want of interest which Hazzard has in the order.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-13\">Wootten.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acn\">\u2014The terms of the order are conclusive.
