He served the replevin, and delivered the horse to plaintiff. Manlove Johnson, was not there. His wife said it 'was her horse. M. Johnson did\" not refuse to give him up, but said he was not his. No demand was made for the horse before\" or after the sale. M.

There may be rights growing out of the marriage contract, which might be enforced in a court of equity; but in a court of law, and where there are no trustees in whom the legal title to the wife\u2019s property is vested to assert that right of property, a wife cannot set up any separate claim to her husband\u2019s property, or pretend to any independent action in relation to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">On the rule to show cause, <em>Mr. Layton </em>cited 10 <em>Johns.

We hesitated at the trial on account of the reference to Hazzard <em>vs. </em>Burton, but'it appears by that case, that there was a demand and refusal to give up the goods, and therefore an unlawful detention, if not an unlawful taking from the sheriff by relation as a trespass ab initia.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Judgment for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
