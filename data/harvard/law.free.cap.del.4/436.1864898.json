He appointed Jonathan Bee his executor. The farm, &amp;c., was sold by the executor as directed by the will, and the proceeds invested.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b446-9\">Wales.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiV\">\u2014An attachment will lie wherever a suit will. Here is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>sum certain in the hands of an administrator subject to distribution, for which assumpsit will lie. (3 <em>Harr.

Money cannot be attached in the hands of an administrator. (2 <em>Harr. Rep. </em>349.) This fund is in the hands of J. B., as a trustee. It is a pure trust; as such, a court of law would not interfere with it, even if a court of chancery would. Property held in trust is not the subject of an execucution, or attachment. (1 <em>Com. Dig. Attachment; Doug. </em>380.) Jonathan Bee cannot be called on in this irregular way, in a court of law, to account for his trust; this can be done only in a court of equity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-5\">Wales.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ag1\">\u2014The property is converted into money; the estate settled; the funds in the garnishee\u2019s hands belonging to Elizabeth Le Huray; which she could recover annually from him by action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-6\">The authorities cited are English authorities, which regard an administrator as a trustee merely; but our act of assembly, and decided cases, make him a mere debtor, after settlement of the estate, as to the residue; or as to a legacy; and he may be sued at law or attached.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b447-7\">Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A9Z\">\u2014The rule must be made absolute. The fund is in the garnishee\u2019s hands, strictly as a trustee; and he may be called to account for it in a court of equity. The case of a distributive balance in the hands of an administrator, after the estate is fully settled, stands on special grounds, under the provisions of the act of assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Rule absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
