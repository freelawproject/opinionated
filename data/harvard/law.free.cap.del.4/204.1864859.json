Pie brought the money into court and <em>Mr. Gray, </em>for the defendant, moved for leave to take it out. The application was opposed by <em>Mr. Wales, </em>for Abel Jeans, and <em>Mr. Chandler, </em>for the Reader judgment. The defendant alledged that these judgments were paid; and moreover, that the Reader judgment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>illegally entered against him on a bond and warrant of attorney given by him jointly with another. On his affidavit <em>Mr. Gray </em>also moved to vacate this judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-4\">On the first judgment of Jeans, which was entered the 1st of April, 1826, for $224, with a credit endorsod of $70, a fi. fa., was issued to May term, 1826, which was-returned, levied on goods as per inventory amounting to $417; and on land subject, &amp;c.; and there were no subsequent proceedings. The second judgment was entered on the 15th of April, 1826, for $191 66, a fi. fa., issued to May term, 1826, which was levied; alias fi. fa., to May term, 1836, the return to which showed payment of all but $11.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-5\">\n<em>Mr. Gray</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ap7\">contended, that the levy on Jeans\u2019 executions to the amount was a legal payment, unless it be shown to have been otherwise disposed of. This presumption was strengthened by the lapse of eighteen years, during which no proceeding had been had on the first judgment; and by the proceedings on the second judgment to the extent, nearly, of satisfying it in fact, as it was satisfied in law. With regard to the judgment of Reader for the use of Chandler, it was no judgment lawfully entered. It was confessed by virtue of a warrant of attorney, authorizing the confession of judgment against Smyth and another jointly. The judgment was against Smyth alone.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-6\">On the separate affidavit of Smith now filed, he moved the court to strike off this judgment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-7\"><em>Mr. </em>Wales.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXr\">\u2014As to the Jeans judgments the question is not whether the presumption of payment by a levy to the amount should exist as between creditors; but it is whether the defendant himself, without affidavit, that the money had been made under the levy, or any proceeding to get rid of the judgment; availing himself of a mere presumption; shall be allowed to consider the judgment as paid in fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-8\">The Court here arrested the discussion, and ordered an issue to-try if any thing, and what, was due to Jeans on his judgments; and,, by consent, this was referred to C. D. Blaney; and, as to Reader\u2019s judgment, rule to show cause why it should not be vacated as not authorized by the warrant. It appeared by the bond and warrant of attorney to confess judgment, that the bond was joint and several, and the warrant joint, and the judgment was against the defendant, Smyth, alone.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-9\">\n<em>Mr. Chandler</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ame\">asked leave to amend the judgment by inserting the name of William J. Reader, a co-obligor in the bond.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b215-10\">Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AGIx\">\u2014The motion is to amend the judgment against Smyth by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>adding the name of Wm. J. Reader. The- judgment is a several judgment against Smyth, on a joint warrant to confess judgment against Reader and Smyth. The court has no authority to authorize a judgment different from the power of attorney; and the entry of a judgment different from the power is unauthorized, and cannot in any form be cured. The application to amend by inserting a new defendant is an application <em>after </em>judgment, not merely to amend, but <em>to </em>make a judgment, including the making new parties. Such an\u00bb amendment cannot be allowed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b216-6\"><em>Gray, </em>for the motion.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b216-7\"><em>Wales </em>and <em>Chandler, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Amendment refused; and judgment stricken out.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The parties now compromised; and the rule was made absoluto for the payment of the balance in court to the defendant, Smyth..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
