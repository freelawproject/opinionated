One partner cannot bind another, under seal, without proof of- authority. (1 <em>Wend. Rep. </em>326; <em>2 Harr. Rep. </em>147.) A note extinguishes the remedy on the simple contract. The only remedy is on the security taken. (1 <em>Kinne Comp. </em>99; <em>Chit. Cont. </em>782; 3 <em>East </em>257; 10 <em>Com. Law Rep. </em>54; <em>2 Johns.

This did not bind the firm; and did not merge the simple contract remedy against Jones &amp; Spence. The declaration is both on the note, and in general assumpsit. If a party declare on a special agreement, and fail to prove it, he may recover on the common counts. <em>(Ros. Ev. </em>175.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-12\">The first count is on a single bill under seal, by Jones &amp; Spence, which we have failed to prove, as it is only the deed of Spence. We fall back then on the common counts to recover the consideration of the note. <em>(Ros. Ev. </em>175; 1 <em>East </em>55; 1 <em>Ch.

That the plaintiff could not recover on the special count on the single bill of Jones &amp; Spence, because the bill being under seal was obligatory on Spence alone, and was not the deed of Jones; as Spence had no authority to bind his partner by such an instrument. 2d. That he could not recover on the count for money lent, because the taking the single.bill of Spence for the money' so lent, extinguished the remedy on the simple contract against the partners; and the plaintiff\u2019s remedy was against Spence alone on the bill. Whereupon the plaintiff suffered a nonsuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
