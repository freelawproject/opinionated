The district court dismissed Durnford's action as preempted by the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20301\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 399i, reasoning that any declarations of protein content anywhere on a product label could not be false or misleading if the listed amount of protein reflected measurements made in accordance with federal regulations concerning the federally mandated nutrition panel. We disagree. As here relevant, the FDCA and its implementing regulations concern only the calculation and disclosure of protein\n   <em>\n    amounts\n   </em>\n   . They say nothing about the source or composition of protein, factors which underlie one of Durnford's several theories of consumer deception. Durnford's claims are therefore not preempted to the extent they arise under that theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   MusclePharm is a Nevada corporation that produces a line of nutritional supplements\n   , including the \"Arnold Schwarzenegger Series Iron Mass\" supplement (\"the Supplement\") here at issue. Durnford is a California citizen who purchased the Supplement from a sports nutrition retailer in 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Supplement is marketed as a muscle-building or weight-gain product, with a focus on its \"revolutionary 5-stage mass delivery system.\" According to the Supplement's label,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   this \"system\" consists of \"advanced protein technology, elite complex carbs, healthy fats, cutting-edge performance ingredients and a balanced digestive blend.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The label describes the \"stages\" of the Supplement's \"system\" in some detail. In particular, the second stage is described as \"Muscle plasma protein technology: 40g of a potent blend of hydrolyzed beef protein and lactoferrin protein.\" The fourth stage is described as \"Performance growth &amp; muscle volumizer: Creatine and BCAA nitrates help promote muscular strength, size and endurance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The nutrition panel at the back of the label also reflects the \"five-stage system.\" For example, in listing the Supplement's ingredients, the front of the label divides ingredients according to the \"five stages.\" The nutrition panel then repeats the five stages in the same order they appear on the front of the label, and repeats the same jargon in describing them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As should be apparent, the second group of ingredients listed on the nutrition panel corresponds to the second stage of the Supplement's \"system.\" This group of ingredients is described as the \"Muscle Plasma Protein Matrix,\" consisting of \"Hydrolyzed Beef Protein, Lactoferrin.\" The fourth group of ingredients listed on the nutrition panel corresponds to the fourth stage of the Supplement's system. This group of ingredients is described as the \"Performance Growth &amp; Muscle Volumizer,\" consisting of \"Creatine Monohydrate, L-Glycine, BCAA Nitrates (Leucine, Iso-Leucine, Valine) ... , D-Ribose.\" The nutrition panel states that a single serving of 95 grams of the Supplement contains 40 grams of protein, or 72% of the recommended daily value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In January 2015, Durnford brought an action alleging that MusclePharm had engaged in \"protein spiking\" or \"nitrogen spiking\" - the practice of inflating measurements of a supplement's protein content using non-protein substances - thereby rendering the Supplement falsely or misleadingly labeled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Durnford alleged that MusclePharm used creatine monohydrate and free-form amino acids (l-glycine, leucine, iso-leucine, and valine) to inflate protein figures. These are the substances that appear at stage four of the Supplement's \"system.\" Durnford also alleged that an independent study of the Supplement demonstrated that its true protein value was not 40 grams per serving, but 19.4 grams per serving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Durnford brought claims under California's Unfair Competition Law (\"UCL\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    Cal.

Civ. Code \u00a7\u00a7 1750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1784 ; and for breach of express warranty. The express warranty claim was premised on the theory that the Supplement's \"labeling, marketing and advertising constitute express warranties and became part of the basis of [the] bargain\" - a bargain struck, according to the complaint, \"at the time [consumers] purchased the Product.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Durnford also alleged that, at some point, an individual \"tweeted at\" MusclePharm's official Twitter account to ask about the truth behind product reviews accusing MusclePharm of nitrogen spiking. MusclePharm responded via Twitter: \"Those [reviews] are fake then. We don't do anything like that. All products legit and scientifically backed[.]\" The individual who tweeted at MusclePharm identified himself on Twitter as \"Jacob Henderson.\" The complaint did not explain who Jacob Henderson was, what relationship he had to Durnford or to this case, when the Twitter interaction took place, or whether Durnford was aware of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Durnford did not explain his reasons for purchasing the Supplement. For example, he did not allege that he purchased the product intending to gain weight or add muscle, the likely reason for most purchases of the product. He did state, however, that he \"would not have purchased the Supplement had [he] known the true nature of the protein content.\" And he alleged that he \"purchased the [Supplement] in reliance on [MusclePharm's] labeling and marketing claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   MusclePharm moved to dismiss the complaint on preemption grounds, for failure to plead reliance adequately, and for failure to plead fraud with particularity. In granting the motion to dismiss, the district court divided Durnford's four legal claims into three theories of misrepresentation, each tied to one of MusclePharm's \"claims\" about its product. The \"Protein Content Claim\" referred to the theory that Durnford was misled by the 40-gram figure on the Supplement's nutrition panel, as independent testing allegedly revealed that figure to be heavily influenced by nitrogen-rich\n   <em>\n    non\n   </em>\n   -protein substances such as free-form amino acids. The \"Protein Composition Claim\" referred to the theory that Durnford was misled by the label's suggestion that the product contained 40 grams of protein derived entirely from hydrolyzed beef protein and lactoferrin rather than nitrogen-spiking agents. The \"Nitrogen Spiking Claim\" referred to the theory that Durnford was misled by the statement MusclePharm made on its Twitter account in response to a direct question about nitrogen spiking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The district court ruled for MusclePharm on preemption grounds with respect to the \"Protein Content Claim.\" Specifically, the court noted that Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") regulations allow a manufacturer to use nitrogen content as a proxy for protein content, thus permitting the practice of nitrogen spiking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the FDCA expressly preempts state-law requirements that are \"not identical to\" those in the FDCA itself,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20343-1\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5), the district court concluded that even if the label might be considered misleading, California consumer law could not be used to create liability for an FDA-compliant measurement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court ruled for MusclePharm on the \"Protein Composition Claim\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   on preemption grounds as well, but on narrower reasoning. The court accepted the theory that MusclePharm's label falsely or misleadingly suggested that the Supplement contained 40 grams of protein derived entirely from hydrolyzed beef protein and lactoferrin and therefore not from nitrogen spiking. The court also accepted that a misbranding theory of that kind went beyond a claim based purely on the FDA's approved methods of calculating protein content. Nonetheless, the district court concluded that Durnford's claims, \"as currently pled, are preempted,\" as Durnford did not allege that his independent study demonstrating a lack of true protein \"conformed to the [FDA] requirements\" for measuring protein content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Finally, the district court ruled for MusclePharm on its \"Nitrogen Spiking Claim\" for failure to plead reliance adequately, a problem the court described as a lack of statutory standing under California's consumer protection laws. The court noted that it could be \"reasonable to presume that consumers read and rely on product labels when purchasing a supplement.\" But the court was unable to draw such an inference regarding the comment made on Twitter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice to repleading to cure the preemption and reliance problems. Durnford allowed the period for amendment to lapse, and the court entered judgment. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We begin with a review of federal preemption under the relevant provision of the FDCA.

Durnford misreads the FDA's protein regulation as precluding the use of nitrogen as a benchmark when calculating a percentage of recommended daily value. The regulation provides only that, if a percentage of recommended daily value is declared on the nutrition panel, it should be calculated using the \"corrected amount of protein per serving.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.9\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(7)(i). The corrected amount of protein per serving \"is equal to the actual amount of protein ... per serving [in grams] multiplied by the amino acid score corrected for protein digestibility.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.9\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(7)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The \"correction\" is therefore not to remove nitrogen-spiking agents, as Durnford suggests, but to account for digestibility. This\n   <em>\n    digestibility\n   </em>\n   correction has no apparent impact on the validity of the MusclePharm label, nor has Durnford suggested any. And although Durnford notes that a separate regulation states that \"[p]rotein shall not be declared on labels of products that, other than ingredients added solely for technological reasons, contain\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   individual amino acids,\" the Supplement is not such a product.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.36\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(i) (emphasis added). It contains more than just individual amino acids.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In sum, federal regulations allow nitrogen to be used on the nutrition panel as a proxy for protein content. Accordingly, a state-law misbranding claim premised on nitrogen spiking - that is, a claim that would permit a state to impose requirements for the measurement of protein for purposes of the federal mandated nutrition panel different from those permitted under the FDCA - is preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Durnford's \"protein composition\" theory of misbranding is that the Supplement's label misled him into believing the Supplement's protein came entirely from genuine protein sources - hydrolyzed beef protein and lactoferrin - rather than nitrogen-spiking agents. The district court accepted the possibility that the label created a false or misleading impression in this respect. The district concluded, however, that Durnford's claims were nonetheless preempted because he did not allege that he had any independent study contradicting the label that used the FDA's elaborate 12-sample testing protocol.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.36\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   This reasoning misapprehends Durnford's protein composition theory. That theory rests not on the misleading nature of nitrogen spiking but on the label's misleading suggestion that all of the protein in the Supplement, in whatever amount it exists, comes from specific protein sources. In other words, Durnford's argument goes not to the amount of protein, but to its composition. The FDA's testing protocol is relevant only to the former.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As an initial matter, the premise behind the protein composition theory is correct. The label - separately from the mandatory nutrition panel - twice identifies hydrolyzed beef protein and lactoferrin as\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   protein sources in the Supplement. The label then apparently distinguishes those protein sources from nitrogen compounds, which are listed and identified separately not as protein, but as \"performance growth and muscle volumizer.\" The label further states that the Supplement's proteins are present in the amount of \"40g of a ... blend of ... beef protein and lactoferrin\" - the same amount of protein claimed per serving on the nutrition panel. Finally, in its ingredients list, the label repeats the distinction in nomenclature between true proteins and other substances, referring to hydrolyzed beef protein and lactoferrin part of the Supplement's \"protein technology,\" and calling the free-form amino acids \"muscle volumizer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Under Durnford's theory of misbranding, whether or not there was compliance with the FDA's 12-sample testing protocol does not matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The disputed\n   testing protocol is a requirement for \"[c]ompliance with this section,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.36\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1) - that is, for compliance with the section of FDA regulations determining the proper means of calculating protein\n   <em>\n    content\n   </em>\n   in dietary supplements.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.9\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). But Durnford's protein\n   <em>\n    composition\n   </em>\n   theory is not concerned with the total amount of protein in the Supplement; it is concerned with the source of that protein. Durnford argues that, whatever the true protein amount in grams per serving, the label falsely or misleadingly suggested that that protein is entirely composed of two kinds of actual, genuine protein. In other words, according to Durnford, the label falsely disclaims nitrogen spiking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In sum, Durnford's complaint adequately alleges facts necessary to support a consumer claim premised on his protein composition theory of misbranding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As noted, Durnford brought three California statutory claims, as well as a claim for breach of express warranty. MusclePharm has made no attempt on appeal to distinguish between the elements of these nominally distinct legal claims for purposes of the protein composition theory, and there is no evident difference. Durnford's protein composition theory is therefore ground for reversal as to all claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, the so-called \"Nitrogen Spiking Claim\" refers to the theory that Durnford was misled by a tweet from MusclePharm stating that it did not use nitrogen-spiking agents to inflate its protein figures. But nothing in the complaint connects this tweet to Durnford's purchase of the Supplement. To the extent Durnford intended the tweet as an independent basis for his claims - rather than simply as illustrative evidence of the way MusclePharm intended its consumers to understand the composition of the Supplement - the complaint is inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The FDCA, in light of its implementing regulations, preempts a misbranding theory\n   premised on the Supplement's use of nitrogen-spiking agents to inflate the measurement of protein for the nutrition panel. It does not, however, preempt a misbranding theory premised on the label's allegedly false or misleading implication that the Supplement's protein came entirely from two specifically named, genuine protein sources. The district court's order of dismissal is\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED\n   </strong>\n   , and this case is\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    We refer to the product's packaging as a whole as the \"label.\" We refer to the federally mandated declaration of nutritional content within the label as the \"nutrition panel.\" As will be explained, the latter is subject to a unique set of stringent federal regulations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    According to the complaint, because nitrogen is used as marker for protein, manufacturers seeking a low-cost way of inflating their protein figures are known to \"spike\" their formulations with nitrogen-rich additives that provide little or none of the benefit of actual protein.
