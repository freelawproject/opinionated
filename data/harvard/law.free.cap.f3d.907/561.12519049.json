He began a five-year term of supervised release in 2011. His supervision was transferred to the Eastern District of Arkansas in 2015. The government filed a superseding petition to revoke his supervised release in 2017. The petition alleged that Dang had pleaded guilty in state court to first degree computer child pornography and computer exploitation of a child (first offense). According to the petition, the victim of his offense was a minor female in his care. She claimed that he took nude pictures and videos of her without her knowledge, sent her nude photos of herself, made sexual advances toward her, and touched her inappropriately. The state court sentenced Dang to 20 years' imprisonment. The United States Probation Office filed a violation memorandum with the district court that substantially tracked the language in the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the revocation hearing, Dang admitted that he \"violated the crimes of computer child pornography and computer exploitation of a child in the first degree, first offense. All the other information contained in that paragraph [in the petition alleging commission of a criminal offense], we deny.\" Tr. of Revocation Hr'g at 2,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The government declined to put on any further proof of the allegations, stating, \"I think the conviction itself is satisfactory, Your Honor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The court held that revocation was mandatory, as Dang was charged with a Grade B violation. The court also acknowledged that Dang had a criminal history category of III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dang requested a Guidelines sentence to run concurrent with his state sentence. The government asked that any sentence run consecutive to the underlying state sentence. The district court stated, \"After a complete review of the facts, the violation memorandum, which is the basis for this revocation, and after considering the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. Section 3553, I am imposing [a prison sentence] ... of five years with no term of supervised release to follow.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. In explaining the basis of the sentence, the court stated the following regarding Dang's conduct:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Dang's current term of supervised release commenced on September the 21st of 2011. He was under federal supervision and believed to be in compliance at the time of his arrest for the above-referenced new criminal conduct in which he exploited a minor in his care. Without the victim's consent, Mr. Dang took nude photographs and videos and later used them in an attempt to coerce the forced sexual conduct of the victim. The harm Mr. Dang caused his victim is immeasurable and long-lasting. Considering Mr. Dang was willing to commit this egregious act while under federal supervision indicates pervasive criminal thinking and sexual deviancy. Mr. Dang's technical compliance may have served as cover to avoid closer oversight of the probation office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f), the court ordered the sentence to run consecutive to the state term of imprisonment. The district court determined that it was prohibited from imposing a term of supervised release. Nonetheless, it announced terms of supervised release to take effect if its authority on the matter changed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dang objected on the basis that the court had varied or departed upward \"for reasons that [h]e d[id] not know or agree with\" and that the sentence was based on facts not supported by evidence presented\n   to the court.

We have previously held that a district court's failure to consider the recommended sentencing range set forth by Chapter 7 when imposing a revocation sentence did not constitute reversible error under the circumstances.

In addition, the \"record convince[d] us that the district court was firm on [the sentence imposed] because of [the defendant's] history of supervised release violations and flouting of authority, as well as his need for rehabilitation and to be incapacitated to protect society.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6057919\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/218/543/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Here, the district court found that Dang had admitted to a Grade B violation and that his criminal history category was III.

Moreover, the court's language at sentencing, including the lengthy discussion of restrictive, hypothetical conditions of supervised release, reflect the court's assessment that Dang's offense warranted revocation and a substantial prison sentence. The court imposed the maximum available sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203583\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3).

Though the government concedes that a court may not rely on unproven, disputed facts in fashioning a revocation sentence, it contends that the statutes under which Dang was convicted provided a sufficient basis for the district court's factual findings. Dang preserved his objection on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"It is well established that a district court commits procedural error under\n   <em>\n    Gall\n   </em>\n   by basing a sentence on unproven, disputed allegations rather than facts.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To have been convicted under \u00a7 605, Dang had to have been involved in putting a child in or allowing a child to be in a sexual situation and memorializing it or showing it to others. The conduct prohibited by \u00a7 603 requires a finding that a person used a computer to seek sexual conduct or visual representation of such conduct with a child or someone believed to be a child. Unquestionably, the commission of acts sufficient to support a conviction for these offenses satisfy the requisite misconduct to warrant revocation of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Seriousness of Offense\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Dang asserts that the district court gave too much weight to the seriousness of the conduct forming the basis of his violation.

The seriousness-of-the-offense argument is essentially a restatement of that which we addressed in Part II.A.3 of this opinion. Regarding the nature of circumstances of the offense, Dang maintains that if this factor is considered in a revocation proceeding, it is to be applied to \"the original offense of conviction,\" not the conduct that is the basis of the revocation. Appellant's Br. at 20 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4204797\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/195/#p203\">\n    640 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   203 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As stated in the previous section, this circuit has not prohibited sentencing courts' consideration of the seriousness of the conduct underlying a petition to revoke. Even accepting the Sixth Circuit's interpretation in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , a district court is not forbidden to consider the severity of the offender's violation of his conditions of supervised release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4204797\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/195/#p203\">\n    640 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   204 ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Dang asserts that \"[t]he revocation sentence is also far greater than necessary to satisfy the goals of sentencing. The district court imposed a sentence in excess of 400 percent above the high end of the recommended range of 8-14 months' imprisonment. Such a substantial upward variance is not supported by the record.\" Appellant's Br. at 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   However, we have previously rejected this percentage-based argument, noting that deviations from the Guidelines range will always appear more extreme-in percentage terms-when the range itself is low and concluding that the percentage of the variance is thus not sufficient in and of itself to find a defendant's sentence substantively unreasonable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Further, the district court had \"considerable discretion\" in weighing the sentencing factors.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Under these facts, the court's decision to weigh them in favor of the statutory maximum is a \"permissible exercise\" of that discretion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3331063\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/655/#p658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, we conclude that Dang's sentence was not substantively unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The Honorable James M.
