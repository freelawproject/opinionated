We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2012, Brende was tried in South Dakota state court on two counts of first-degree rape and two counts of sexual contact with a child under the age of 16. All four counts were based on sexual abuse against the son (C.I.) of Brende's friends. C.I. was six or seven years old\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   when the acts occurred. At the time of trial, C.I. was nine years old. The trial evidence included\n   testimony from C.I.; a video interview of C.I. conducted shortly after the allegations surfaced; and the testimony of Colleen Brazil, the person who conducted the video interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Brazil is a trained forensic interviewer with expertise in child sex crimes. She worked for Child's Voice, a child abuse advocacy and evaluation center. The court admitted the video of Brazil's interview of C.I. for its substantive value, and the jury viewed it. The videotaped conversation lasted about an hour. In the video, Brazil discussed C.I.'s understanding that he was not to lie or offer an answer to a question if he did not know the answer. Brazil and C.I. discussed the boy's life generally and spoke specifically about his allegations against \"Uncle Steve.\" C.I. claimed that Brende had shown him pornography and discussed sex with him. C.I.'s allegation went much further and included Brende masturbating in front of him. According to C.I., Brende placed C.I.'s penis into Brende's behind, penetrated C.I. anally, and performed oral sex on C.I. Despite having spent nights at Brende's house on multiple occasions, C.I. recalled that all the abusive acts occurred on a single night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When C.I. took the witness stand at trial, he partially recanted his statement in the video. He clarified that Brende did not penetrate him anally but instead had actually placed his penis into the crack of his behind. He also recanted his statement that Brende had made him place his penis into Brende's behind. Additionally, C.I. testified that Brende had touched C.I.'s penis. C.I. made no mention of oral sex when he was on the witness stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Brende was convicted on all four counts. One rape conviction was based on the allegation that Brende had performed oral sex on C.I. The other was based on Brende's anal sexual contact with C.I. Brende received 50 years for the rape convictions and 15 years for the sexual contact convictions, to be served concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On direct appeal, Brende made three claims: (1) that the indictment was duplicative; (2) that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions; and (3) that his sentence was cruel and unusual.\n   <em>\n    State v. Brende\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7056624\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/835/131/#p137\">\n    835 N.W.2d 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 137 (S.D. 2013). The South Dakota Supreme Court denied two of his claims, but it reversed the anal rape conviction, holding that there was insufficient evidence of penetration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7056624\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/835/131/#p137\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7056624\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/835/131/#p137\">\n    at 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court entered an amended judgment reflecting acquittal on that count in October 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Brende filed a pro se habeas petition in state court in November 2013. Though stated somewhat inartfully, Brende's petition appeared to raise three main points. He asserted that (1) his remaining rape conviction lacked forensic evidentiary support; (2) C.I. and his family lied; and (3) someone tampered with the Child's Voice DVD. Counsel was appointed and subsequently filed an amended petition with different assertions of error. Specifically, counsel alleged that the jury should have been given a unanimity instruction, Brazil's testimony improperly vouched for the veracity of the statements C.I. made in the interview, and trial counsel should have requested a bill of particulars. Brende also filed a pro se supplement to his attorney's petition. Following an evidentiary hearing in December 2014, the state habeas court entered an order denying relief on all claims in February 2015. The South Dakota Supreme Court summarily affirmed this decision.\n   <em>\n    Brende v. Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=881%20N.W.2d%20257\">\n    881 N.W.2d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Brende filed his pro se federal habeas petition in June 2016. The state moved to dismiss. Brende made a number of claims, but the magistrate judge\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to whom the\n   matter was referred determined that it was empowered to rule on only one of them: Brende's argument challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction for oral rape. The magistrate judge acknowledged that this was a close case, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   There are numerous facts in the record which make this court hesitate: the fact that the child witness testified at trial he regularly sees ghosts and talks to them, that a knife appeared under his pillow while he was sleeping and he did not place it there, that he hits himself sometimes at school, screams, calls himself \"stupid\" and has \"fits.\" At least some of this behavior pre-dated the allegations of abuse against Mr. Brende.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The inconsistencies in the child's description of events both during his live trial testimony and during his videotaped statement also give one pause. In the videotaped interview, the child often changes details of his description such as which order events happened in, where each event happened, and the state of undress of the child and Mr. Brende at various times. He clearly stated in the videotaped interview that Mr. Brende placed his penis on the inside of the child's butt. But in response to a question from the interviewer whether anything Mr. Brende did to the child was painful or hurt, the child answered \"no.\" Even at trial, his testimony varied significantly. During his direct testimony, the child testified Mr. Brende placed his penis inside the child's butt. On cross-examination, the child testified Mr. Brende's penis was only on the outside of the child's butt in the butt crack.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   There are other aspects of the child's testimony that differ significantly from testimony typically received in child molestation cases. Whereas most pedophiles spend time \"grooming\" their victims, gradually coaxing the victim into allowing more and more invasive, intimate contact, here the child testified Mr. Brende only made advances on him a single time and never tried touching him offensively either before or after that one event. The child spent the night at Mr. Brende's house approximately 30 times. This lack of any grooming behavior by Mr. Brende in light of ample opportunity to do so also gives one pause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Brende v.

The magistrate judge contrasted her unease with Brende's guilt with the state habeas court's confident statement that it was \"utterly convinced of the verity of what is portrayed\" on the video.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    at *14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ultimately, the magistrate judge recommended denial of habeas relief without an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The district court adopted the report and recommendation in full. It granted a certificate of appealability \"as to the finding that Brende failed to state a claim that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his first-degree rape conviction and the dismissal of that claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Brende v.

Brende's principal contention is that the video interview was inadmissible hearsay and an improper basis for the jury's verdict. Brende contends that the prosecution's case would have failed on sufficiency grounds had the state court excluded it. He avers that admitting the video interview violated South Dakota law and Brende's rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Under South Dakota law, in a sexual abuse trial, a child's out-of-court statement describing rape or sexual contact is admissible only if the trial court determines that it \"provide[s] sufficient indicia of reliability\" and the child either testifies at the trial or \"[i]s unavailable as a witness.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.D.%20Codified%20Laws%20%C2%A7%2019-19-806.1\">\n    S.D.

Appellant's Br. at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   First, we note that Brende's claim that the video's admission violated South Dakota law is not a question we address in a habeas petition. Our objective is to determine whether the South Dakota prosecution infringed upon Brende's federal constitutional rights. We review \"only to determine whether an alleged error infringes upon a specific constitutional protection or is so prejudicial as to be a denial of due process.\"\n   <em>\n    Rousan v.

Brende did not present this issue to South Dakota's courts. He thus failed to exhaust his remedies before seeking habeas relief. Therefore, the video's admission is not properly before us.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Sullivan v.

Though the magistrate judge briefly considered the Confrontation Clause issue, apparently sua sponte, she determined that Brende had not raised it. \"Issues not properly preserved at the district court level and presented for the first time on appeal ordinarily will not be considered by this court as a basis for reversal unless there would be a plain error resulting in a miscarriage of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Fritz v.
