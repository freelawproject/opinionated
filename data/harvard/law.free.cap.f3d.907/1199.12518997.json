During Carter's trial, one of the victims, J.C., testified against him from Minnesota by two-way video, as she was seven months pregnant and unable to travel. Carter contends that permitting J.C. to testify against him remotely by two-way video, rather than in person, violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We agree. Criminal defendants have a right to \"physical, face-to-face confrontation at trial,\" and that right cannot be compromised by the use of a remote video procedure unless it is \"necessary\" to do so and \"the reliability of the testimony is otherwise assured.\"\n   <em>\n    Maryland v.

Because alternatives were available for obtaining J.C.'s testimony that would have preserved Carter's right to physical confrontation, the use of a remote video procedure was not necessary in this case. We therefore vacate Carter's convictions on the two counts involving J.C. and remand to the district court for resentencing on the remaining counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Carter was convicted of forcing seven minor girls into prostitution and trafficking them across state lines. The crimes took place over a ten-year period from 2003 to 2013. For each of the seven victims, Carter was charged with one count of violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201591\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (sex trafficking\n   of a minor or by force, fraud, or coercion), and one count of violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202423\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (transportation of a minor in interstate commerce to engage in prostitution), for a total of fourteen counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   One week before Carter's April 2016 trial, the government filed an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   application regarding the anticipated testimony of J.C., the victim for Counts 13 and 14. J.C., who was by then an adult living in Minnesota, was seven months pregnant with a due date in June. The government explained that J.C. had been hospitalized for complications with her pregnancy and that her doctor had instructed her not to travel from Minnesota to California. Accordingly, the government sought either to take J.C.'s deposition in Minnesota pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 15, or to have her testify during trial from Minnesota via live two-way video conference. With respect to the out-of-court deposition, the government proposed that the parties would fly to Minnesota in the middle of trial and suggested that it would try to secure, but could not guarantee, Carter's physical attendance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Carter opposed both options on Confrontation Clause grounds. He objected to the deposition because the logistics for securing his attendance at the deposition could not be arranged on such short notice, and because counsel would have to forgo preparation for trial to attend the deposition. He objected to the live two-way video procedure based on his \"constitutional rights to personally confront his accuser at trial.\" He concluded by noting that, if he were forced to select one of the two alternatives, he would choose the two-way video procedure. The district court granted the government's application to use two-way video, and the case proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the second day of trial, Carter again objected to the two-way video procedure. He argued that under\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   , permitting J.C. to testify by two-way video would violate his right to confrontation unless the court found that J.C.'s absence was \"necessary to further an important public policy.\" The district court overruled Carter's objection. Despite the government's failure to provide any \"direct evidence from [J.C.'s] physician,\" the court concluded that J.C. was \"unavailable\" because \"she had been advised by her doctor not to travel, given the advanced state of her pregnancy.\" The court also concluded that J.C.'s \"testimony [was] necessary\" to the government's case, and that the two-way video procedure would \"satisfy all the requirements of the Confrontation Clause\"-J.C. would testify under oath, she would be subject to cross-examination, and the jury would be able to observe her demeanor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   J.C. testified by two-way video at trial. At the start of her testimony, the court instructed the jurors that, although J.C. was testifying \"via live video feed,\" they were \"to treat the testimony the same as a witness who is physically present in the courtroom.\" J.C. was then sworn in by the courtroom deputy and asked to identify Carter while the camera scanned the courtroom. She responded: \"Um, is that him right there next to - I can't really see that well on you guy's thing, but I believe that's him next to these two gentlemen right there. I can't really see that well.\" After she described Carter's clothing, the court \"note[d] that the witness has identified the defendant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   J.C. proceeded to testify about her relationship with Carter. She stated that she met Carter in 2013, when she was 16 years old. She was living in Minnesota at the time, and Carter bought her a bus ticket to Los Angeles under an alias because she was underage. When she arrived in Los Angeles, Carter picked her up and took her to a motel room. There, he photographed her in lingerie and used the photographs in an advertisement on Backpage,\n   a website used to advertise sexual services. She then worked as a prostitute for Carter for approximately two weeks. She testified that Carter kept all of her earnings, dictated how much she should charge and what she should wear, and threatened to beat her if she did not comply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In addition to J.C.'s testimony, the government introduced as evidence her birth certificate, which confirmed that she was 16 years old when the conduct took place, as well as a record of the bus ticket J.C. used to get to Los Angeles, which confirmed that Carter purchased it. The government also introduced the Backpage advertisement, evidence showing that the credit card used to pay for this advertisement was the same credit card used to pay for an advertisement of another prostitute who worked for Carter, and evidence showing that the Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address used to access Carter's Facebook account matched the IP address used to create the Backpage advertisement. That IP address was traced to a Travelodge motel, the decor of which matched the background in the Backpage advertisements featuring J.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Aside from J.C., five of the other victims testified in person at trial, and one of the victims did not testify at all. Carter was ultimately convicted on all fourteen counts and sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment. Because the group of counts involving J.C. (Counts 13 and 14) carried the highest offense level under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\"), those counts served as the base for calculating his final sentencing range.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3D1.2, 3D1.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Carter argues that permitting J.C. to testify by two-way video violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause. \"We review claims of a violation of the Confrontation Clause de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

These important components of confrontation are lost when the witness is not testifying in court, regardless of the witness's age or ability to see the defendant on a screen from a distant location. Any procedure that allows an adverse witness to testify remotely necessarily diminishes \"the profound [truth-inducing] effect upon a witness of\n   <em>\n    standing in the presence\n   </em>\n   of the person the witness accuses.\"\n   <em>\n    Coy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774862\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/1012/#p1017\">\n    487 U.S. at 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774862\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/1012/#p1017\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   There are also important practical differences between face-to-face confrontation and virtual confrontation. From the remote witness's point of view, the courtroom will necessarily be defined by the angle and quality of the courtroom camera as well as the size and quality of the screen on which the video is projected. These variables can distort any effort to approximate in-person testimony. The record in this case bears this out. When asked to identify Carter in the courtroom, J.C. hesitantly did so after testifying that she \"c[ould]n't really see that well.\" Moreover, unless the defendant has multiple attorneys, such that one could travel to the witness's remote location while the other remains in the courtroom, the defendant would be unable to ensure that, for example, \"the witness is not being coached or influenced during testimony, and that the witness is not improperly referring to documents.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

There is no suggestion of such misconduct in this case; we point this out only to show that physical confrontation serves purposes other than permitting cross-examination and allowing the jury to see the witness's face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   It also bears noting that no procedural mechanism exists for employing a video procedure in the manner it was employed here. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26 requires that, absent certain circumstances, \"[i]n every trial the testimony of witnesses must be taken in open court.\" The Judicial Conference once suggested a revision to Rule 26 that would have allowed testimony by two-way video in special circumstances, but the Supreme Court declined to transmit the proposed revision to Congress.\n   <em>\n    Order of the Supreme\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=207%20F.R.D.%2089\">\n    207 F.R.D. 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 91-92 (2002).
