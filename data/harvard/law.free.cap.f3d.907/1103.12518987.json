She appeals the district court's\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   imposition of a two-level sentencing enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(2), which applies if the defendant \"used violence, made a credible threat to use violence, or directed the use of violence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In several intercepted phone calls, Lewis-Zubkin stated that two of her co-conspirators, James Suggs and Dammon Charlton, were working with law enforcement and needed to be assaulted. At one point she said that Suggs should have the life beat out of him and that she would like to see Charlton at least get his front teeth knocked out. She later paid another co-conspirator $100 to carry out the assaults. When days passed without the attacks taking place, Lewis-Zubkin demanded the return of her $100 and said she had found someone else to do the job. At sentencing, Lewis-Zubkin did not contest any of these facts but argued they were insufficient to show her threats were credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We find no clear error in the district court's application of the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(2) enhancement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
