She was brought into the Justice Center, Cleveland's downtown city jail. After spending the night in the downtown jail, Williams was driven to the HOC in a van with several other inmates. She was placed in a holding cell for three to four hours with approximately ten other female detainees. A female correctional officer took her to a back room with two\n   other female detainees and gave them uniforms. The officer then provided the detainees with lock bins in which to store their street clothes and ordered the detainees to remove their clothing, including their bras and underwear. The detainees were then ordered to get into the shower, which had three separate stalls, and they were given about one minute to shower. The women were ordered to exit the shower, which left them standing approximately one foot from each other in the nude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The correctional officer then proceeded to spray the detainees with a delousing solution, one at a time. Williams stated during her deposition that they were sprayed \"over the whole body,\" from head to toe, with a \"body mist.\" The solution \"smelled like bug spray\" and was sprayed on the detainees through a nozzle attached to a jug. Williams asserted that the officer was only standing six inches away from the inmates when they were sprayed. After delousing their front sides, the officer asked them to turn around, with their arms out and legs spread. Williams testified that she was ordered to \"squat\" during the delousing, but she was unaware of whether everyone who underwent the intake process was asked to squat while being deloused. Williams claimed that the spray \"penetrated [her] anus.\" Williams admitted, however, that the spray was a \"light mist,\" which did not \"hit [her] with any kind of force.\" She only felt the mist because \"it was a liquid and cold.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The officers then directed the detainees to put on their uniforms, without being given the opportunity to shower again. Williams waited for ten to fifteen minutes in the holding cell before being escorted to the pod: a large room with several bunks. She was then immediately released on bail, at approximately 6:00 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Later in 2009, Williams brought this class action against the City, arguing that she and similarly situated pretrial detainees were deprived of their Fourth Amendment rights when they were subjected to mandatory strip searches and delousing upon entry at the HOC without individualized suspicion of lice or concealed contraband. She sought monetary damages, a declaration that the City's policies were unconstitutional, and an injunction precluding the City from continuing its allegedly unconstitutional practices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The district court granted the City's motion to stay Williams's class action until the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Florence\n   </em>\n   . The Court handed down its decision in 2012 and held that \"undoubted security imperatives involved in jail supervision override the assertion that some detainees must be exempt from the more invasive search procedures at issue absent reasonable suspicion of a concealed weapon or other contraband.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 330,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189139\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/318/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court clarified, \"[t]here also may be legitimate concerns about the invasiveness of searches that involve the touching of detainees[,]\" but it did not reach that issue in\n   <em>\n    Florence\n   </em>\n   because\n   no such facts were alleged in that case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 339,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189139\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/318/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, as noted by the Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Cantley v. West Virginia Regional Jail &amp; Correctional Facility Authority\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]he Supreme Court did not expressly reach the delousing issue in [\n   <em>\n    Florence\n   </em>\n   ], simply commenting that '[t]he danger of introducing lice or contagious infections' into a detention facility 'is well documented.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292309\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/201/\">\n    771 F.3d 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 206 n.3 (4th Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court lifted the stay in Williams's case in August 2012 and granted Williams's motion to amend her complaint to add a class representative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City moved for judgment on the pleadings, and Williams responded in opposition with a proposed second amended complaint. Williams alleged in her proposed complaint that the City employed a policy of directing correctional officers to \"use pressurized metal spray cans to spray caustic delousing solution over the naked bodies and genitals of detainees.\" She took issue not only with \"the use of delousing on all detainees, but also about the manner in which the delousing occurs.\" Williams alleged that the City directed correctional officers to \"[f]orcibly spray[ ] the genitals of detainees, versus allowing detainees to apply the delousing solution themselves.\" Williams specifically claimed that the \"delousing solution was sprayed all over her body, including into her anus when she bent over.\" The district court granted the City's motion for judgment on the pleadings and denied Williams's motion for leave to amend her complaint based on futility of the proposed amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Williams I\n    </em>\n    Ruling\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Williams appealed to this court, which affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n   <em>\n    Williams I\n   </em>\n   , 771 F.3d at 956. In\n   <em>\n    Williams I\n   </em>\n   , we considered a single issue: whether Williams's proposed complaint plausibly alleged a violation of the Fourth Amendment by claiming that the City's jail, \"instead of using less invasive procedures, compelled pretrial detainees who were being processed into the facility to undress in the presence of other detainees and to have their naked genitals sprayed with delousing solution from a pressurized metal canister.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 947. We found that Williams's proposed amended complaint had stated a claim for relief because it alleged facts indicating that the City conducted searches in an unreasonable manner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 952 (stating that, \"although\n   <em>\n    Florence\n   </em>\n   permits the jail to conduct a suspicionless search of plaintiffs upon their entrance to the jail, the search must be conducted in a manner that is reasonably related to the jail's legitimate objectives in discovering contraband and preventing the introduction of lice to the facility\" (citations omitted) ). Thus, we previously concluded that, unless the City demonstrated a \"good reason\" for delousing inmates rather than allowing them to self-apply, such a decision would be a \"needless intrusion into the detainees' constitutional rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 955. Such a determination was left for trial or summary judgment, and we remanded Williams's matter to the district court for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Summary Judgment Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Back in the district court, both Williams and the City moved for summary judgment. Counsel filed the deposition transcripts of Mary Bounds, David Carroll, Lieutenant Stella Clark, Reginald Flowers, Jacqueline Lewis, Lieutenant Joseph Stottner, and Lieutenant Rufus Williams. The testimony of these officials partially\n   confirmed Williams's experience in October 2009 and partially contradicted Williams's account of the HOC intake procedure at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to these correctional officers, in the fall of 2009 the HOC had a policy of strip searching and delousing inmates upon arrival. Because large groups of detainees were often transported to the HOC at once, officers would sometimes conduct this procedure with two or three inmates at a time, in order to expedite the intake process. An officer of the same sex would bring the inmates into a shower room and instruct them to undress and put their clothing inside a lock box. The officer would then conduct a quick \"visual observation\" of the detainees \"to ensure that contraband or anything illegal [wa]s not transformed over or transported over into a pod.\" According to Acting Commissioner Bounds, the visual observation was performed \"for the safety of that inmate, other inmates, and even the correction officers.\" Moreover, officers checked for medical problems and health concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The officer would then order the detainees to stand in a vestibule, and would spray a delousing solution on the inmates, one at a time. The delousing solution was administered via a pressurized canister, through a nozzle on the end of a hose attached to the can. The liquid was sprayed lightly, like a fine mist, from a distance of approximately three or four feet. The officer would ask the detainee to spread her legs shoulder width apart and raise her arms. After spraying the front of the detainee's body, the officer would ask her to turn, while keeping her legs spread and arms in the air, and spray the back of the detainee's body. Inmates were not asked to bend at the waist or to squat as part of this process. After the officer sprayed detainees with the delousing solution, they were typically permitted to shower and dry off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The HOC's delousing policy \"was instituted for health and safety reasons\" in order \"to prevent lice, crabs, bugs, insects from coming in there and spreading.\" \"It was brief, painless and necessary to prevent an infestation in the dormitories at the workhouse.\" According to these correctional officers, inmates never objected to being deloused or to undressing in front of other inmates of the same sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The correctional officers stated that they did not allow detainees to self-apply the solution because they could not trust the detainees to follow the procedure properly. Inmates did not always follow instructions, and unlike an inmate's decision not to eat or shower, an inmate's decision not to apply the solution could \"compromise the whole institution.\" The correctional officers contended that, if given the opportunity to self-apply, an inmate could pour the solution down the drain, only apply the solution to part of her body, or throw the solution on the officer or other detainees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Commissioner Lewis discontinued the HOC delousing procedure in April 2010. After suspending the delousing procedure, correctional officers at the HOC began sending infected detainees to the medical unit. Lewis questioned this decision later, after a jail manager informed her that they had experienced a few lice outbreaks. \"I felt like we would have more outbreaks more often if we discontinued it,\" stated Lewis, \"and that has come true.\" According to some of the correctional officers, this procedure had worked well thus far, as no serious cases of lice infestations had occurred. Others believed, however, that they had just \"been fortunate so far.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. District Court Orders\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The district court granted Williams's motion in part, awarding summary judgment to Williams on her Fourth Amendment claim challenging the manner in\n   which the City conducted delousing and strip-search procedures. The district court acknowledged that, post-\n   <em>\n    Florence\n   </em>\n   , \"there is no longer any question that individualized suspicion is unnecessary to conduct blanket strip searches and to delouse prisoners at intake.\" It correctly noted, in light of our ruling in\n   <em>\n    Williams I\n   </em>\n   , that \"[t]he method of the strip search and the delousing are, however, still subject to constitutional evaluation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The district court considered facts such as Williams's allegation \"that the delousing solution penetrated her anus\" and found that the City's delousing policy was unconstitutional. Although the City argued that its delousing procedure was justified because \"corrections officers could not 'trust' inmates to perform the procedure properly,\" the district court found that this method was not \"reasonably related to the legitimate end of preventing the dissemination of lice.\" In short, the district court concluded, \"The application of the delousing solution in this manner is not a rational response to the jail's legitimate interest in preserving health and well-being within the facility, given other less humiliating and invasive alternative methods to eradicate lice, such as permitting detainees to self-apply the delousing solution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   With regard to Williams's strip-search claim, the district court found that the City's policy of strip searching multiple detainees at a time \"did not strike a reasonable balance between [Williams's] privacy interests and the need to provide safety and security at the jail.\" The court rejected the City's provided justification \"that the jail was 'busy,' and corrections officers need to strip search multiple detainees for expediency.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The district court also issued a permanent injunction forbidding the City from conducting: (1) \"the physical delousing of detainees ... by utilizing a pressurized spray canister\" except \"in instances of purposeful avoidance or misapplication of a delousing solution by a detainee\"; and (2) \"the showering of detainees in the jail booking area absent detainees being allowed to enter and use those showers in the absence of any other detainees.\" If the City chose to conduct strip searches during the intake process in groups of two or more, the district court ordered that the City \"must install a privacy partition/curtain between the detainees being searched to completely preclude each detainee from seeing the other in a state of partial and/or complete undress.\" If the City did not install such partitions, the strip searches had to be \"conducted individually and privately.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The City now appeals the district court's decisions partially granting summary judgment in favor of Williams, partially denying summary judgment to the City, and issuing a permanent injunction against the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We review a district court's grant of summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , utilizing the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) standard.\n   <em>\n    V&amp;M Star Steel v.

As noted by this court in\n   <em>\n    Sumpter\n   </em>\n   , \"Conducting individual searches in [busy, time-pressed] circumstances not only impeded the facility's interest in expeditiously processing incoming inmates, it compromised the health and safety of those inmates caught up in the delay.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264965\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/473/#p491\">\n    868 F.3d at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is undisputed that officers conducted strip searches of detainees not only to find contraband but to identify medical issues. It was in the best interest of the City and the detainees to treat such health problems as quickly as possible.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264965\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/473/#p491\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (outlining the health and safety implications of a delay in intake procedures at a facility similar to the one at issue).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Williams has not provided evidence questioning the legitimacy of the City's proffered justification.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264965\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/473/#p491\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Indeed, processing detainees in groups of two or three during high-volume hours would presumptively speed up the intake process. We find that the City's policy of allowing strip searches to be conducted in groups of two or three during busy periods, such as Williams's time of intake, was reasonably related to the City's legitimate penological interest of expediting the intake procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stoudemire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658673\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/705/560/#p572\">\n    705 F.3d at 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Delousing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Next, we must balance the intrusive nature of the City's prior delousing policy against its stated penological justification. As to the nature of the intrusion, there is no doubt that being sprayed with a liquid dispersed from a pressurized canister, while nude in front of a correctional officer and other inmates, is a serious intrusion of privacy. As we noted in\n   <em>\n    Williams I\n   </em>\n   , \"courts have uniformly recognized that a search in which officers intentionally contact a naked detainee causes still deeper injury to personal dignity and individual privacy.\" 771 F.3d at 952 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Williams, as required\n   when deciding the City's motion for summary judgment, we must also accept that she was ordered to \"squat\" during the delousing and that the solution \"penetrated [her] anus.\" Like in\n   <em>\n    Sumpter\n   </em>\n   , however, Williams has failed to submit evidence that the circumstances of her search-i.e., the solution's penetration of her anus-was not an isolated incident.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264965\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/473/#p491\">\n    868 F.3d at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, she admittedly was unaware of whether everyone who underwent the intake process was asked to squat while being deloused, and Williams submitted no evidence demonstrating that the City customarily asked detainees to squat during the delousing process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Thus, even accepting Williams's testimony as true, the City's official policy and customs are undisputed. Officers sprayed detainees from head to toe with a delousing solution while the detainees were nude and standing about one foot apart. Two to three detainees were sometimes deloused in the same room. The solution was administered through a pressurized dispenser from a distance of between six inches and four feet. The spray was a light mist and did not hit detainees with substantial force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   With regard to the City's justification for spraying detainees with the delousing solution in this manner,\n   <em>\n    Florence\n   </em>\n   observed that \"[t]he danger of introducing lice or contagious infections ... is well documented,\" 566 U.S. at 330-31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189139\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/318/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted), and in\n   <em>\n    Williams I\n   </em>\n   this court observed \"that a correctional facility's adoption of uniform delousing procedures is an acceptable prophylactic measure that may be administered even in the absence of individualized suspicion that any particular detainee is infected with lice.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams I\n   </em>\n   , 771 F.3d at 951 (citing\n   <em>\n    Florence\n   </em>\n   , 566 U.S. at 330-31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189139\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/318/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The City argues that it chose to spray the delousing solution on detainees rather than allow the detainees to self-apply the solution because they could not trust the inmates to follow instructions, and any failure to comply would potentially lead to community infestations. Although the City may not disregard \"obvious, easy alternatives\" if such alternatives accommodate inmates' rights \" 'at\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   cost' to the institution's valid penological interest underlying the search in the first place,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 954 (citation omitted), it need not ignore reasonable risks posed by alternative policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We conclude that, based on the undisputed facts, the City's delousing policy did not violate Williams's Fourth Amendment rights. The City's decision to delouse detainees with a fine mist was reasonably related to its interest in maintaining the cleanliness and habitability of the HOC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stoudemire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658673\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/705/560/#p572\">\n    705 F.3d at 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The need for delousing outweighed the admittedly substantial invasion of personal rights that resulted from the policy. The City has set forth \"good reasons\" for its decision to delouse detainees at the HOC with a fine mist-and consequently, its delousing procedure was not \"a needless intrusion into the detainees' constitutional rights.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams I\n   </em>\n   , 771 F.3d at 955 (\"In the final analysis, of course, the jail may have had good reasons for conducting these procedures in the particular manner in which it did. But that is a matter for resolution either at trial or on summary judgment, not on the pleadings.\" (internal citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Accordingly, we reverse the district court's partial grant of summary judgment in favor of Williams on her Fourth Amendment claim.

Specifically, it \"may refer simply to the instruction to remove clothing while an officer observes from a distance of, say, five feet or more; it may mean a visual inspection from a closer, more uncomfortable distance.\"\n    <em>\n     Florence\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189139\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/318/\">\n     566 U.S. at 325\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189139\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/318/\">\n     132 S.Ct. 1510\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Giving a detainee the opportunity to self-apply the delousing agent permits her to weigh the alternatives and choose the option that enables her to comply with the delousing requirement while protecting her self-dignity. Simply spraying the detainee with a hose as if she was an object or an animal treats her as if she does not have the capacity to make that choice.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n    Whether the particular manner in which the jail conducted the searches and seizures at issue here was \"justified\" depends on the facts, such as \"whether any exigent circumstances compelled [the officers] to strip search [plaintiffs] in view of other inmates\" or to disallow plaintiffs an opportunity to apply the delousing solution to themselves.\n    <em>\n     Stoudemire\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658673\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/705/560/#p572\">\n     705 F.3d at 573-74\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    771 F.3d at 955.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
