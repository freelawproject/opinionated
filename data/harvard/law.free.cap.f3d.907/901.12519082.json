Giving due deference to the district court's discretion in balancing the equities, we AFFIRM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Like most capital cases, this case presents a tangled procedural history. In 1984, a Tennessee jury convicted Edmund Zagorski of two first-degree murders and sentenced him to death. The Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed both the convictions and sentence on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Among numerous other claims, Zagorski alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate an alternative suspect, that the trial court erred by improperly instructing the jury on the meaning of mitigating circumstances, and that the jury could not constitutionally impose the death penalty because prosecutors originally offered a plea deal for two life sentences. Finding all three arguments procedurally defaulted, the district court denied habeas relief, we affirmed, and the Supreme Court denied certiorari.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zagorski v.

His concurrent requests for the stay in district and appellate court yielded contrary results: the district court denied Zagorski's motion, and a divided panel of this court granted it. Ultimately, the Supreme Court vacated our stay.\n   <em>\n    Mays v.

And with great power comes great responsibility; in deciding these motions, a district court must \"intensively balance numerous factors, including the competing policies of the finality of judgments and the incessant command of the court's conscience that justice be done in the light of all the facts.\"\n   <em>\n    McGuire v.

Out of deference to this highly fact-bound process, this court asks not whether we think that Zagorski presented extraordinary circumstances warranting relief, but rather whether the district court abused its discretion in deciding that he did not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tyler v.

Although the district court found all three claims procedurally defaulted on habeas review, Zagorski now argues that a combination of\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   overcomes all defaults. He also maintains that because this capital case involves \"significant and substantial\" constitutional claims that a court has never reviewed, the balance of the equities demands Rule 60(b)(6) relief. As did the district court, we evaluate each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A. Claims Raised on Habeas Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Although the district court denied habeas relief on Zagorski's ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim, he contends that\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   resuscitates it. In\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court delineated a very narrow exception to the\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   rule prohibiting a habeas petitioner from demonstrating cause for a procedural default by claiming ineffective assistance of trial counsel during state post-conviction proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188233\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/1/#p9\">\n    566 U.S. at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188233\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/1/#p9\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Coleman v.

But\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   did not change a criminal defendant's constitutional rights;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   it merely adjusted the equitable rules as to when he might avail himself of federal statutory relief.\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

And like most of our sister circuits, we have determined that changes in decisional law alone do not establish grounds for Rule 60(b)(6) relief.\n   <em>\n    Abdur'Rahman v. Carpenter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357028\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/805/710/#p714\">\n    805 F.3d 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 714 (6th Cir. 2015) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

A petitioner must present something more than just the availability of statutory relief from which he was previously barred. Recognizing this, the district court rightly discounted this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The district court also denied relief for Zagorski's procedurally defaulted\n   <em>\n    Lockett\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   claims. In his Rule 60(b) motion, Zagorski took a new tack, arguing ineffective assistance because his trial counsel failed to object to both the jury instructions and the imposition of death. But these brand new ineffective assistance of counsel claims-presented for the very first time in this motion-are themselves procedurally defaulted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hodges v. Colson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077340\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/727/517/#p530\">\n    727 F.3d 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 530 (6th Cir. 2013). To excuse this default, Zagorski points to\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   , which \"require[s] a prisoner to demonstrate cause for his state-court default of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   federal claim, and prejudice therefrom, before the federal habeas court will consider the merits of that claim.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508696\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/446/\">\n    529 U.S. at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508696\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/446/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, Zagorski argues,\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   supports his contention that, under\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , the ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel establishes the cause and prejudice to excuse the newly raised and procedurally defaulted ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims, which in turn overcomes the procedural bar to the original\n   <em>\n    Lockett\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   claims that Zagorski raised in his habeas petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As the district court recognized, permitting a two-layer showing of cause to excuse the default of a substantive constitutional claim would detonate\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   's procedural default bar.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108153\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/722/#p752\">\n    501 U.S. at 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108153\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/722/#p752\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   ensures state courts the first opportunity to correct any constitutional violations stemming from their own mistakes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108153\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/722/#p752\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108153\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/722/#p752\">\n    at 730-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108153\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/722/#p752\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Zagorski's reading flouts the very principle of federalism that the Supreme Court took pains to protect, and would permit habeas petitioners to resurrect procedurally defaulted claims in a motion for Rule 60(b)(6) relief by newly invoking the phrase: \"post-conviction counsel ineffectively failed to raise an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim.\" We cannot read\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   as the exception that swallows this rule. \"If\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   's revetment is to be torn down, it is not for us to do it. Rather, we must follow the case which directly controls\" and leave the Supreme Court to overrule its own decisions.\n   <em>\n    Hunton v.

Taken together, Zagorski argues these holdings instruct that ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel \"supplies the 'cause' for the otherwise defaulted cause argument that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object, under\n   <em>\n    Lockett\n   </em>\n   , to the trial judge's instructions.\" Appellant Br. at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In my view, Zagorski is correct.

But unlike the claims at issue in\n   <em>\n    Hodges\n   </em>\n   , Zagorski's claims fall squarely within the scope of the\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   exception-to \"establish cause for [his] procedural default of a claim of ineffective assistance at trial\" (trial counsel's failure to object to the Eighth Amendment violation), Zagorski presented a claim of \"[i]nadequate assistance of counsel at initial-review collateral proceedings\" (post-conviction counsel's failure to spot trial counsel's error).\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188233\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/1/#p9\">\n    566 U.S. at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188233\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/1/#p9\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court has long held that failure to object to constitutional violations or other clear legal errors can constitute ineffective assistance within the meaning of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McPhearson v.

That trial counsel's error caused a substantive constitutional violation should not prohibit a criminal defendant from arguing his counsel's error constitutes ineffective assistance for\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Zagorski's reading of\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   is fully consistent with the reasoning underlying both cases.

But in\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , the Court carved out a \"narrow exception\" to that rule: \"Inadequate assistance of counsel at initial-review collateral proceedings may establish cause for a prisoner's procedural default of a claim of ineffective assistance at trial.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188233\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/1/#p9\">\n    566 U.S. at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188233\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/1/#p9\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In describing why the\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   exception to the general rule was necessary, the Supreme Court explicitly recognized the relationship between\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A prisoner's inability to present a claim of trial error is of particular concern when the claim is one of ineffective assistance of counsel.

Part of the reason the Court justified the need for the\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   exception was its concern that ineffective trial counsel may fail to preserve claims for habeas review-exactly what happened to Zagorski.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The majority argues that \"permitting a two-layer showing of cause to excuse the default of a substantive constitutional claim would detonate\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   's procedural default bar.\" Zagorski's approach would require this court to undertake a two-layer cause analysis to excuse procedural default. But the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   contemplated this result. Justice Scalia, writing for the majority in\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   , found that a claim of \"ineffective assistance adequate to establish cause for the procedural default of some\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   constitutional claim is\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   an independent constitutional claim,\" and that while such a claim \"generally must 'be presented to the state courts as an independent claim before it may be used to establish cause for a procedural default,' \" the procedural default of \"an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim asserted as cause for the procedural default of another claim\" may \"\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   be excused if the prisoner can satisfy the cause-and-prejudice standard with respect to\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   claim.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508696\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/446/\">\n    529 U.S. at 451-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508696\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/446/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, a two-layer showing is also consistent with Supreme Court precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Determining whether a defendant's two sets of ineffective counsel warrant excuse of two instances of procedural default is necessarily a thorny undertaking, and it would not warrant Rule 60(b)(6) relief every time a defendant invokes a simple \"phrase,\" as the majority suggests. Rather, the defendant will still have to overcome the unenviable hurdle of meeting the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   deficiency and prejudice requirements\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   substantiality requirement before his motion would be granted. As the Third Circuit has held, where a defendant facing the death penalty \"has navigated each twist of the habeas labyrinth\" and \"overcome every hurdle,\" \"we may review the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Richardson v.

The same should be true in the context of a Rule 60(b)(6) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Nor does Supreme Court precedent require us to construe Zagorski's claims as a successive habeas petition rather than a Rule 60(b) motion. As the majority notes, \"[a] movant is not making a habeas claim when he seeks only to lift the procedural bars that prevented adjudication of certain claims on the merits.

The district court was correct to reject any \"suggestion that 'a defendant is less culpable if he murders a vile person.' \" But a juror could have drawn other inferences-for example, that the victims were dangerous, and even if that did not \"tend to justify\" the crime as the district court instructed, it contributed to the circumstances of the crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lockett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769215\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/586/\">\n    438 U.S. 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 604,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769215\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/586/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that jurors must be permitted to consider \"any of the circumstances of the offense\" as mitigating evidence).

Zagorski's second ineffective assistance claim is premised on his attorney's failure to present mitigating evidence of another suspect. \"The Tennessee Supreme Court has stated that residual doubt is a nonstatutory mitigating circumstance[.] Such evidence 'may consist of proof ... that indicates the defendant did not commit the offense, notwithstanding the jury's verdict following the guilt phase.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sutton v.

If not for ineffective counsel, the jury would have received (a) evidence of another suspect's plot to kill the victim and (b) a jury instruction on mitigation broad enough to encompass the new evidence of an alternative suspect. With these two material changes in Zagorski's proceedings, the probability that at least one juror would not have imposed the death sentence is even greater.

In considering Rule 60(b)(6) motions in capital cases, we have held that \"the finality of the judgment against [a defendant] must be\n   <em>\n    balanced against the more irreversible finality of his execution\n   </em>\n   ,\" in addition to any constitutional concerns the defendant raises.\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

This balancing did not take place. Neither a defendant's \"interest in avoiding the death penalty\"\n   <em>\n    by itself\n   </em>\n   nor a \"change in decisional law\"\n   <em>\n    by itself\n   </em>\n   would create exceptional circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265540\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/691/#p698\">\n    879 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   701 ;\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278902\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/670/#p672\">\n    793 F.3d at 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the combined weight of the shift in decisional law, the death sentence, and the meritorious\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   claim creates an extraordinary circumstance that warrants granting Zagorski's Rule 60(b)(6) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   I would reverse the district court's order and grant Zagorski's motion for relief.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The dissent suggests that Zagorski's newly-raised ineffective assistance of counsel argument presents a procedural hurdle and not a substantive claim. This cannot be true. Zagorski's theory of\n    <em>\n     Martinez\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Edwards\n    </em>\n    permits us to reach the underlying\n    <em>\n     Lockett\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Jackson\n    </em>\n    claims only through an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim. This ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim raises substantive concerns about Zagorki's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Thus, though the dissent correctly states that Zagorski seeks \"to lift the procedural bars that prevented consideration of his\n    <em>\n     Lockett\n    </em>\n    claim,\" he attempts to do so with a substantive claim.

Yet the Third Circuit's more flexible approach presents a minority position within the circuits.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    12 J. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice \u00a7\u00a7 60.48[5][b]-[c] (3d Ed. 2018). Most circuits-including our own-require something much more \"extraordinary\" than the change in a law that an appellant originally decided not to appeal, but now seeks to benefit from.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ackermann v.
