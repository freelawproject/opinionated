When the union fell apart, Monasky took A.M.T., their two-month-old daughter, from Italy to the United States. Taglieri filed a petition under the Hague Convention to return A.M.T. to Italy. The district court granted the petition after finding that Italy was A.M.T.'s country of habitual residence. Monasky appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Who wins turns on who decides. The Hague Convention places the child's habitual residence front and center in trying to achieve its goal of discouraging spouses from abducting the children of a once-united marriage. The Convention and our cases establish that the inquiry is one of fact. Judge Oliver held a four-day hearing about the point, after which he wrote a 30-page opinion that carefully and thoughtfully explained why Italy was A.M.T.'s habitual residence. No part of that decision goes awry legally, and no part of his habitual-residence finding sinks to clear error. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Taglieri, an Italian, and Monasky, an American, met in Illinois. Taglieri, who was already an M.D., was studying for his Ph.D. and worked with Monasky, who already had a Ph.D. They married in Illinois in 2011. Two years later, the couple moved to Italy to pursue their careers, with Taglieri arriving in February and Monasky arriving in July. At first, the couple lived in Milan, where they each found work-Taglieri as an anesthesiologist, Monasky as a research biologist. The marriage had problems, including physical abuse. Taglieri struck Monasky in the face in March 2014. After that, Monasky testified, he continued to slap her, making her increasingly afraid of him, and \"forced himself upon [her] multiple times.\" R. 88-4 at 201.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Monasky became pregnant with A.M.T. in May 2014, after one of the times Taglieri forced her to have sex, she claims. In June 2014, Taglieri took a job at a hospital in Lugo, about three hours from Milan. Monasky stayed in Milan, where she worked at a different hospital. Monasky had a difficult pregnancy, which, when combined with the long-distance separation, strained the relationship further. To make matters worse, she didn't speak Italian or have a valid driver's license, increasing her dependence on Taglieri for help with basic tasks. Monasky began investigating health care and child care options in the United States and looking for American divorce lawyers. But the couple also looked into child care options in Italy and prepared for A.M.T.'s arrival at the same time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In February 2015, Monasky emailed Taglieri about seeking a divorce and investigated a move back to the United States. The next day, Monasky and Taglieri went to the hospital in Milan for a pregnancy checkup. The doctors recommended that they induce labor. Monasky refused because she preferred a natural birth, upsetting Taglieri and prompting more verbal sparring. On the ride home from the hospital, Monasky asked Taglieri to turn the car around because she felt contractions. Taglieri refused. Back at their apartment, the arguments continued, with Taglieri calling her \"the son of a devil.\" R. 88-4 at 113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Later that night, Monasky took a taxi to the hospital. Once Taglieri realized she had left, he went to the hospital and was there, along with Monasky's mother, during the labor and at A.M.T.'s birth by emergency cesarean section. After Monasky and A.M.T. left the hospital, Taglieri returned to Lugo, and Monasky stayed in Milan with A.M.T. and her mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In March 2015, after Monasky's mother returned to the United States, Monasky told Taglieri that she wanted to divorce him and move to America. A few days later, however, Monasky left Milan to stay with Taglieri in Lugo. While Taglieri said he thought this would help them \"clarify any existing issues,\" R. 88-1 at 39, Monasky said she went to Lugo because she couldn't recover from her cesarean section and take care of A.M.T. alone. Monasky and Taglieri dispute whether they reconciled in Lugo. Taglieri says they did. Monasky says they didn't. During this time, the two jointly initiated applications for Italian and American passports for A.M.T.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In late March, Taglieri and Monasky had another argument. As the dispute escalated, Monasky slammed her hand on the table. Taglieri raised his hand as if he were going to hit her. But he didn't. He instead went into the kitchen. Monasky thought she heard Taglieri pick up a knife, but he came back into the room carrying ice cream. Soon after, Taglieri went to work and Monasky took A.M.T. to the police, seeking shelter in a safe house. She told the police that Taglieri was abusive. After Taglieri returned home and found\n   his wife and daughter missing, he went to the police to revoke his permission for A.M.T.'s American passport. Two weeks later, Monasky left Italy for the United States, taking eight-week-old A.M.T. with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Taglieri filed an action in Italian court to terminate Monasky's parental rights. The court ruled in Taglieri's favor ex parte. Then Taglieri filed a petition in the Northern District of Ohio seeking A.M.T.'s return under the Hague Convention. The district court granted Taglieri's petition. Monasky appealed. After this court and the United States Supreme Court denied her motion for a stay pending appeal, Monasky returned A.M.T. to Italy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, a divided panel of this court affirmed the district court.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265990\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/868/\">\n    876 F.3d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). We granted Monasky's petition for rehearing en banc. No. 16-4128 (Mar. 2, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ninety-nine countries, including the United States and Italy, have signed the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, Oct. 25, 1980, T.I.A.S. No. 11,670, 1343 U.N.T.S. 89.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Status Table, HCCH, https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/status-table/?cid=24 (last updated Sept. 12, 2018). The treaty addresses a pressing and never-ceasing policy problem-the abductions of children by one half of an unhappy couple. The Convention's mission is basic: to return children \"to the State of their habitual residence,\" to require any custody disputes to be resolved in that country, and to discourage parents from taking matters into their own hands by abducting a child. Hague Convention pmbl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Federal law, namely the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, implements the Hague Convention and hews to the treaty's language.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209001\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7 9001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   .

The Hague Convention defines wrongful removal as taking a child in violation of custodial rights \"under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal.\" Hague Convention art. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The key inquiry in many Hague Convention cases, and the dispositive inquiry here, goes to the country of the child's habitual residence. Habitual residence marks the place where a person customarily lives.\n   <em>\n    See Webster's New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1122, 2119 (2d ed. 1942) (defining \"residence\" as a place where a person \"actually lives\" and \"habitual\" as \"customary\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Building on our cases in the area,\n   <em>\n    Ahmed v. Ahmed\n   </em>\n   offers two ways to identify a child's habitual residence.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275373\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/682/\">\n    867 F.3d 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2017).

District courts ask these sorts of questions in determining a child's acclimatization: whether the child participated in \"academic activities,\" \"social engagements,\" \"sports programs and excursions,\" and whether the child formed \"meaningful connections with the [country's] people and places.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275373\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/682/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   But the acclimatization inquiry, as\n   <em>\n    Ahmed\n   </em>\n   appreciated, may prove difficult, sometimes impossible, for young children. An infant \"never forms\" \"or is incapable of\" forming the kinds of \"ties\" to which the acclimatization standard looks.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275373\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/682/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275373\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/682/\">\n    at 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unwilling to leave infants with no habitual residence and thus no protection from the Hague Convention,\n   <em>\n    Ahmed\n   </em>\n   adopted an alternative inquiry for infants incapable of acclimating.

He presided over a four-day bench trial and heard live testimony from several witnesses, including most essentially the two parents: Monasky and Taglieri. After listening to the witnesses and weighing their credibility, Judge Oliver issued a 30-page opinion finding that Italy is A.M.T's country of habitual residence.\n   <em>\n    Taglieri v. Monasky\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:15 CV 947,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%2010951269\">\n    2016 WL 10951269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D.

Some evidence, as he pointed out, supported the finding that Monasky and Taglieri intended to raise A.M.T. in Italy. For example: Monasky and Taglieri agreed to move to Italy to pursue career opportunities and live \"as a family\" before A.M.T.'s birth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. The couple secured full-time jobs in Italy, and Monasky pursued recognition of her academic credentials by Italian officials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Together, Monasky and Taglieri purchased several items necessary for raising A.M.T. in Italy, including a rocking chair, stroller, car seat, and bassinet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. Monasky applied for an Italian driver's license.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And Monasky set up routine checkups for A.M.T. in Italy, registered their family to host an\n   <em>\n    au pair\n   </em>\n   there, and invited an American family member to visit them there in six months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Some evidence, as the trial court acknowledged, pointed in the other direction. For example: Monasky at times expressed a desire to divorce Taglieri and return to the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She contacted divorce lawyers and international moving companies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2, *8-9. And Monasky and Taglieri jointly applied for A.M.T.'s passport, so that she could travel to the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Faced with this two-sided record, Judge Oliver had the authority to rule in either direction. He could have found that Italy was A.M.T.'s habitual residence or he could have found that the United States was her habitual residence. After fairly considering all of the evidence, he found that Italy was A.M.T.'s habitual residence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10.

She claims that the district court's determination of habitual residence is a finding of \"ultimate fact\" that we review de novo. Appellant's Supp. Br. 20. Whatever Monasky means by\n   <em>\n    ultimate\n   </em>\n   fact, our cases lack such ambiguity: So long as the district court applies the correct legal standard, as Judge Oliver did here, the determination of habitual residence is a question of fact subject to clear-error review, sometimes characterized as abuse-of-discretion review, as the Convention's explanatory report says and as our cases confirm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ahmed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275373\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/682/\">\n    867 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   686 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pullman-Standard v.

Monasky agrees with that standard; she just disagrees with the trial judge's finding under it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Any further concerns about the point can be resolved by recalling this reality.\n   <em>\n    Ahmed\n   </em>\n   itself\n   <em>\n    affirmed\n   </em>\n   the district court in that case. It saw no need to ask the district court to make any more findings or do anything more than it already had done. What was good for that case is good for this one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Monasky argues that she and Taglieri never had a \"meeting of the minds\" about their child's future home. Appellant's Br. 34. But that possibility offers a sufficient, not a necessary, basis for locating an infant's habitual residence. An absence of a subjective agreement between the parents does not by itself end the inquiry. Otherwise, it would place undue weight on one side of the scale. Ask the products of any broken marriage, and they are apt to tell you that their parents did not see eye to eye on much of anything by the end. If adopted, Monasky's approach would create a presumption of no habitual residence for infants, leaving the population most vulnerable to abduction the least protected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Monasky claims that Judge Oliver placed too much weight on the fact that Monasky and Taglieri established a matrimonial home in Italy and the fact that Monasky lacked definite plans to leave Italy.\n   <em>\n    Taglieri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%2010951269\">\n    2016 WL 10951269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7-8. But if clear-error review entitles an appellate court to rebalance the\n   <em>\n    relative weights\n   </em>\n   assigned to these sorts of details, that would indeed create a de novo standard of review, which is just what our cases prohibit. The question remains one of habitual residence. All agree that both facts-the location of the matrimonial home and any plans to leave it-bear on the riddle and thus were relevant considerations. Nothing in Judge Oliver's opinion suggests that he considered either one of them dispositive. That an \"infant will normally be a habitual resident of the country where the matrimonial home exists\" is a fact of life that we cannot change.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   That does not mean that an infant's place of birth\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   will be the habitual residence if she remains there up to the abduction. That approach would create problems of its own. Imagine an American couple who gives birth to an infant during a brief stay in Italy, perhaps during a vacation or month-long residency, after which one of them takes the child before the vacation (and marriage) ends. In those instances, it would be difficult to maintain that the child habitually resides in Italy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   That leaves one last argument for reversing Judge Oliver's decision: a preference for creating a presumption\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   finding a habitual residence for infants. But that is the worst of all possible worlds because it turns the Convention upside down. It would deprive the children most in need of protection-infants-of any shelter at all and encourage self-help options along the way, creating the risk of \"abduction ping pong\" at best,\n   <em>\n    Ovalle v. Perez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12397313\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/681/777/#p784\">\n    681 F.

As often happens with child-abduction disputes, the issues are fraught, the fact patterns unfortunate. Escalating acrimony between parents often severs a relationship beyond repair. And that usually results in conflicting testimony as to how things fell apart. But we will not make this case easier, and we are sure to make the next case harder, by assuming the role of principal decision maker. As with other fact-bound inquiries, so with this one. We must trust those with a ring-side seat at the trial to decide whose testimony is most credible and what evidence is most relevant. And to do that, we must treat the habitual-residence inquiry as we always have: a question of fact subject to deferential appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Because the district court applied the correct legal standard and made no clear errors in its habitual-residence finding, and indeed quite carefully considered all of the competing evidence in its 30-page opinion, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCURRENCE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-48\">\n   BOGGS, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   I join the majority opinion and concur in its conclusion that the habitual residency inquiry is a question of fact and that the district court made no clear error in its factual findings in this case. I take issue, however, with the characterization that all Hague Convention cases are to be governed by a strict two-part test attributed to our recent case,\n   <em>\n    Ahmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For cases such as this one, there exists a simple standard consistent with precedent: absent unusual circumstances, where a child has resided exclusively in a single country, especially with both parents, that country is the child's habitual residence. An excessive reliance solely on the two-part test, one that will often turn exclusively on \"shared parental intent,\" could jeopardize that simple conclusion for young children, leaving them without a habitual residence and therefore unprotected by the Hague Convention. In such circumstances, either parent will be free to grab the child and go, leaving no law, only self-help, as the remedy for the abduction. This is contrary not just to case law and the purposes of the Convention, but also common sense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   When a child has a habitual residence, the Hague Convention generally requires that a determination of custody rights must be made in that country.

On the other hand, when a child has\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   habitual residence, either parent is free, so far as the Convention is concerned, to take the child to, or to retain the child in,\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   country, without fear of legal process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friedrich v.

After all, in most circumstances where the inter-family tension is so great that one parent has abducted a young child, it is very likely that the parents will have quarreled about many things, most especially about their hopes and plans for where the child will be raised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   There is a better way to handle cases like this. Where, as here, a child has lived in only one country with his or her parents, and the child's parents do not intend their stay there to be temporary, then that country is the child's habitual residence, absent unusual circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holder v.

Such circumstances might be present, for instance, in cases of \"birth tourism,\" where, for medical, legal, or financial reasons, a child is born in a country where at least one of the parents has few ties and no intent to remain after the birth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delvoye v.

They should not preclude the common-sense conclusion that a young child who has resided exclusively in an established, albeit inharmonious, living arrangement with his or her parents in a single country has a habitual residence in that country. There is no reason to permit the exceptional to outweigh the ordinary, but in many cases adhering to the two-part test at the exclusion of all else will not just allow, but dictate, that result. While I agree that the habitual-residence inquiry is and should remain fact-intensive, most cases in which a child has lived in just one country should result in the conclusion that that country is the child's habitual residence, a determination that will bring the child within the protections of the Hague Convention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Indeed, this court's precedent has always been in keeping with the common-sense view that children who have known but one country generally are habitual residents of that country.

Thus, for example, the purchase of a bassinet or a car seat for a newborn does not definitely indicate the parents' shared intent to raise the child in a particular country; the parents may merely wish to bring the child home from the hospital safely and not have him sleep on the floor. In contrast, if the parents' purchase of the bassinet and car seat is in conjunction with their decoration and outfitting of an entire nursery with other supplies that are not essential to an infant's immediate needs, this objective evidence points towards a shared parental intent to raise the child in that place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   It is possible that, after the district court analyzes the facts under the shared parental intent standard, the court will conclude that it is unclear whether the parents shared an intent.

For example, every party will have an immigration status in the country of purported habitual residence, whether it be citizenship, permanent residency, a work visa, a tourist visa, or a lack of any legal status. Furthermore, every party will have some kind of living situation.

R. 70 (Dist. Ct. Op. at 21) (Page ID #1885). But because the district court issued its decision prior to our adoption of the shared parental intent standard in\n   <em>\n    Ahmed\n   </em>\n   , the district court was forced to hypothesize about the contours of this standard. Consequently, in its analysis the district court focused on two circumstantial facts, almost to the total exclusion of other direct evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   First, the district court emphasized that Monasky lacked definitive plans to leave Italy when A.M.T. was born; in other words, she did not yet have a plane ticket to the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22 (Page ID #1886). But even assuming, counterfactually, that Monasky and Taglieri were in perfect accord that Monasky would travel to the United States with A.M.T. shortly after the child's birth, Monasky needed to wait until A.M.T.'s passport was issued. Therefore, the lack of a specific departure date is relevant, but not dispositive. There is reason to be cautious in overly emphasizing this factor: In some situations, there may be logistical obstacles preventing a child from traveling across international borders that mean that the child's continued presence in a country is not suggestive of the parents' shared parental intent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Maxwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495983\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/245/#p253\">\n    588 F.3d at 248-49, 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the mother and children's continued residence in Australia did not indicate that the mother agreed with the father that their children should be raised in that country, as the father had hidden the children's passports and refused to provide consent when the mother tried to apply for new travel documents). Conversely, a parent's travel plans may be a poor proxy for the parents' agreement to raise their child in a particular locale. The fact that one parent plans to leave the country with the child-and may even have bought plane tickets to do so-cannot alone demonstrate that the parents' shared parental intent was to raise the child in that destination country or that the parents\n   lacked the intent to raise the child in the originating country.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Second, the district court's conclusion that the parties had established a marital home in Italy at some point in time appears to have been the predominant factor in its analysis. R. 70 (Dist. Ct. Op. at 20-21) (Page ID #1885-86). The district court's almost total reliance on a marital home that existed for less than a year in its evaluation of the parties' shared parental intent is somewhat confusing, especially considering that the parties resided approximately three hours apart from shortly after Monasky conceived A.M.T. until her final trip to Lugo in March 2015. R. 47 (Jt. Stip. at \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 26) (Page ID #1018, 1020). More importantly, although any existence of a marital home is relevant evidence of parties' shared parental intent, it cannot be dispositive. The key inquiry under the shared parental intent standard is where the parents \"intended the children to live.\"\n   <em>\n    Ahmed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275373\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/682/\">\n    867 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   690 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holder\n   </em>\n   , 392 F.3d at 1016-17 (\"In analyzing [the parents'] intent, we do not lose sight of the fundamental inquiry: the\n   <em>\n    children's\n   </em>\n   habitual residence. Parental intent acts as a surrogate for that of children who have not yet reached a stage in their development where they are deemed capable of making autonomous decisions as to their residence.\" (footnote omitted) ). Certainly, if the parents resided together in a particular locale prior to and after the birth of an infant this is evidence that they shared an intent to raise their child in that place. But the existence of a marital home is still only proxy evidence, and thus cannot be the overriding factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ahmed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275373\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/682/\">\n    867 F.3d at 690-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that, even though the parties \"had a settled mutual intent to live\" together in the United Kingdom before their twins were conceived, there was no shared parental intent to raise the children in that country).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The lead opinion argues that, as an appellate court, we should not \"rebalance the relative weights\" of the various facts, as considered by the district court. Lead Op. at 410 (emphasis omitted). But here the district court was speculating about the contours of the shared parental intent standard because we had not yet adopted that test. Indeed, our prior case law left open the question of whether the acclimatization standard was the appropriate test to determine a very young or developmentally disabled child's habitual residence.\n   <em>\n    Robert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5541839\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/507/981/\">\n    507 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   992 n.4 ;\n   <em>\n    Simcox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066761\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/511/594/\">\n    511 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   602 n.2.

I offer the following separate dissenting remarks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   If there is one point on which we all seem to agree, it is that child-abduction cases are difficult and contentious. Such cases are highly fact-intensive yet often involve tangled and conflicting accounts from the opposing sides. That is why these cases are best resolved by the district judges, who engage directly with the testimony and other evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   I write separately to address the issue raised by the majority: whether Judge Oliver's opinion contains reversible error. Because I believe that the district court is the better forum in deciding the weight of the evidence under our newly-adopted standard, I dissent from the majority and argue that we should remand the case and allow the district court to evaluate A.M.T.'s habitual residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Although a district court's habitual residence determination is based on factual findings that we review for clear error and the determination itself is reviewed for abuse of discretion, \"[t]he question of\n   <em>\n    which standard\n   </em>\n   should be applied in determining a child's habitual residence under the Hague Convention is one of law, and is reviewed de novo by this Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Ahmed v.

At the time of his decision, Judge Oliver did not have the benefit of our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Ahmed\n   </em>\n   articulating the proper shared parental intent standard. While the holding in\n   <em>\n    Ahmed\n   </em>\n   follows from existing precedent, it also, at a minimum, defines the shared parental intent standard in a way not previously provided by our court. Judge Oliver therefore had no choice but to try and predict the standard's precise dimensions. As a result, rather than focusing on where the parents \"intended the child[ ] to live,\"\n   <em>\n    Ahmed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275373\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/682/\">\n    867 F.3d at 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Judge Oliver incorrectly centered his inquiry on whether the parties had established a \"marital home\" in Italy\n   and on Monasky's failure to immediately leave that marital home for the United States after the child's birth,\n   <em>\n    Taglieri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%2010951269\">\n    2016 WL 10951269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The majority is correct in finding no error in Judge Oliver's factual findings but errs in appraising his application of those factual findings to an incorrect legal standard-one that focused on the parents' relationship rather than on their intent for the child's home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friedrich v. Friedrich\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Friedrich I\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11649406\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/983/1396/\">\n    983 F.2d 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1401 (6th Cir. 1993) (\"To determine the habitual residence, the court must focus on the child, not the parents ....\"). Accordingly, because we review the application of the correct legal standard de novo and Judge Oliver did not apply the correct standard, there was reversible error. Reviewing the court's determination in that regard does not strip the district courts of their ability to rule as the facts of each specific case dictate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The majority is concerned that an inquiry focused on the shared intent of the parents for the child would create a legal presumption against finding a habitual residence for infants, because parents will so often disagree on such aspects of their child's life. Similarly, Judge Boggs, in his concurrence, worries that a strict two-part test would run the risk of leaving very young children, who do not have the capacity to acclimate, unprotected by the Hague Convention. Yet, I agree with Judge Moore that district courts have the ability to rule as the facts of each specific case dictate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dissent\n   </em>\n   at 416 (\"[H]abitual residence is not an inquiry governed by technical rules, but rather '[t]he facts and circumstances of each case should ... be assessed without resort to presumptions or presuppositions.' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Friedrich I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11649406\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/983/1396/\">\n    983 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1401 );\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 417 (\"The question of when a child is developmentally unable to acclimatize 'is not a bright-line rule, and the determination of when the acclimatization standard is impracticable must largely be made by the lower courts, which are best positioned to discern the unique facts and circumstances of each case.' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ahmed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275373\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/682/\">\n    867 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   690 );\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 418 (\"This is necessarily a fact-intensive inquiry.\"). I thus advocate that the case be remanded back to the district court to make that determination. Determining habitual residence is a fact-intensive inquiry. But, determining whether the district court applied the right standard in appraising those facts is a legal determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In determining whether parents had a shared intent, Judge Oliver, as well as future district judges faced with this question in similar cases, may very well find that an infant has an established habitual residence despite her young age. But such a finding should follow from the application of the shared parental intent standard, not from a district court's previous best attempt to divine the correct standard on its own. The deference owed the district court entails letting it decide how the facts apply following\n   <em>\n    Ahmed\n   </em>\n   and the opinions here. Affirmance without the opportunity to place its factual findings within the proper legal framework takes the decision away from the district court. Accordingly, the proper result in this case is to reverse and remand with instructions for Judge Oliver to apply the shared parental intent standard as it is now defined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    DISSENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   JANE B. STRANCH, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   I join fully in the dissents of Judge Moore and Judge Gibbons. I write separately because I find perplexing the lead opinion's conclusion that the dissent would surely \"make the next case harder[ ] by assuming the role of principal decision\n   maker.\" Lead Op. at 411. It is the lead opinion that usurps the role rightly belonging to the district court by determining how that court should apply our newly created standards to the facts the district court found from its \"ring-side seat at the trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The lead opinion implies that it can say how the district court would rule because that court predicted the standard we would subsequently adopt in\n   <em>\n    Ahmed\n   </em>\n   . It did not. The district court addressed parental intent based on its assumption that \"ordinarily a court would conclude that the intent of the parties\" is to remain in the \"marital home.\"\n   <em>\n    Taglieri v. Monasky\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:15 CV 947,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%2010951269\">\n    2016 WL 10951269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (N.D. Ohio Sept. 14, 2016). That presumption is not the test we formulated in\n   <em>\n    Ahmed\n   </em>\n   or that the lead opinion re-affirms today. As the lead opinion explains,\n   <em>\n    Ahmed\n   </em>\n   asks the court to \"identify the location where the parents 'intended the child[ ] to live.' \" Lead Op. at 408 (citing\n   <em>\n    Ahmed v.

The district court has not had the opportunity to assess the facts of this case in light of the standards we developed after its 2016 decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   We cannot presume what the district court would do under our new standards.

We accordingly remand to permit the district court to consider the facts explicitly in light of this opinion.\"). The principle underlying this procedure applies even more so here. Since the district court's 2016 decision, our court has addressed the legal standards applicable to Hague Convention disputes not once but twice, resulting in the\n   <em>\n    Ahmed\n   </em>\n   panel decision and ultimately the several opinions now emerging from the en banc court. We have struggled to choose and to articulate our standard, which suggests to me that our sister circuit has it right. We should remand this case to the district court to \"do what district courts do best,\" Lead Op. at 408, and exercise its right and ability \"to consider the facts explicitly in light of\" the legal standards as we have now articulated them.\n   <em>\n    Gitter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9033558\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/396/124/#p129\">\n    396 F.3d at 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Since the two-part test also applies to developmentally disabled children, it is worth noting that such children, depending on the extent of their disability and the degree of rancor in their home, may\n    <em>\n     never\n    </em>\n    acquire a habitual residence at all.
