Because the permanent passenger ramp in this case is an extension of the land, and the Admiralty Extension Act (AEA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030101\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , does not apply to an injury caused by land-based equipment, we affirm the district court's ruling that maritime law does not apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   AMHS, an entity of the State of Alaska, currently operates commercial ferries at 36 ports that it owns or leases. In 1988, the Port successfully submitted a proposal to AMHS to construct a marine terminal for AMHS's use in Bellingham, Washington. The Port designed the Bellingham Cruise Terminal (BCT) to meet AMHS's requirements. Per AMHS's specifications, the BCT included a passenger ramp and a vehicle ramp to load and unload ferries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As part of the BCT's design, the passenger ramp is an integral part of the structure of the ferry berth facilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appendix, p.2. The passenger ramp is built into the terminal building, with one end extending approximately 75 feet over the dock.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appendix, p.2. A retractable \"apron\" connects the end of the ramp to a vessel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appendix, p.1. The ramp is controlled by 3/4-inch thick wire cables, which extend from a steel tower on the BCT dock to the far end of the ramp. The ramp is locked in place by pins that slot into two long bars. In order to change the ramp's position, an operator uses the ramp's control panel to unlock the pins and then raise and lower the cables. Attempting to lower the ramp when it is in the locked position creates slack in the cables. If the operator creates such slack and then unlocks the pins, the ramp will drop until the cables catch the slack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Port leased portions of the BCT facilities to AMHS under a 20-year lease agreement, beginning in 1989 when the BCT was completed. In 2009, the Port and AMHS renewed the lease for another 15 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 2, 2012, Shannon Adamson was working as a crew member on the AMHS ferry M/V Columbia, which had docked at the BCT that morning. Adamson was asked to lower the passenger ramp to load passengers from the terminal to the ferry. While she was operating the ramp, it fell 15 feet, breaking the cables and collapsing all the way to the pier. Adamson suffered serious injuries from the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Adamson filed this suit against the Port in federal district court under diversity jurisdiction, alleging that the Port negligently caused her injuries under maritime law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its answer, the Port asserted as an affirmative defense that negligent supervision and training by AMHS personnel, including the crew of the M/V Columbia, was partly responsible for Adamson's injuries. The Port then moved for partial summary judgment, arguing in part that maritime law did not apply to Adamson's claims. The district court agreed, and subsequently denied Adamson's motion for reconsideration. The case proceeded under Washington state law. After a ten-day trial in March and April 2016, a jury found the Port liable under various Washington law theories of negligence. The district court denied the Port's post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Port timely appealed the jury verdict and the district court's denial of its post-trial motions. Adamson timely cross appealed, arguing that the district court's ruling that maritime law did not apply was erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Pursuant to Adamson's cross appeal, we consider here whether the district court correctly applied Washington law rather than maritime law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We review de novo a district court's determination that maritime jurisdiction, and therefore substantive maritime law, does not extend to a tort claim.\n   <em>\n    H20 Houseboat Vacations Inc. v.

First, our conclusion is consistent with Supreme Court precedent, which has not indicated that every case involving a structure or piece of equipment used for access to a vessel falls within admiralty jurisdiction. Specifically, in\n   <em>\n    T. Smith &amp; Son v.
