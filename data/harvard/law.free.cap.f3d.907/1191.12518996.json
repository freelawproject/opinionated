So technical and so complex are the INA's requirements that unlucky petitioners may find themselves in removal proceedings without ever realizing that their status was in jeopardy to begin with. As a result, avoiding removal often hinges on the skill and knowledge of one's employers and their lawyers, whose hands-like those of Ariadne's-may or may not hold the red thread out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Xiao Ma, the beneficiary of an H-1B visa, petitions for review of his final order of removal. Ma's employer filed for an extension of his H-1B visa, but it was denied, and his employer failed to file an application for status adjustment within 180 days of the expiration of his H-1B visa. Because the application to extend the H-1B visa was denied, Ma was without lawful status in this country for 331 days before he applied to adjust his status-well over the 180 days permitted by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k)(2)(A), which would have otherwise protected him from removal. He was, however, legally authorized to work in the country during the months between the expiration of his H-1B visa and the denial of his application for an H-1B extension pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.12(b)(20). Nonetheless, because\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201245.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) does not recognize regulatory employment authorization as conferring lawful immigration status for purposes of status adjustment under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k)(2)(A), the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") correctly concluded that Ma is ineligible for status adjustment. We therefore must deny Ma's petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Nowhere is the complexity of the INA's worker visa, employment authorization, and status adjustment process more evident than in the facts undergirding Ma's removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2003, Ma, a citizen of the People's Republic of China with a bachelor's degree in computer science and technology, accepted a job offer from the Law Offices of Qiang Ma (\"Ma Law\"), a small law firm based in Alhambra, California, for the position of computer analyst. Ma Law successfully applied for an H-1B specialty occupation visa on Ma's behalf. The visa was valid from September 10, 2003 to August 4, 2006. At some point in July 2006, shortly before the visa was set to expire, Ma Law applied for an extension of Ma's H-1B status by filing a form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker. Half a year later, on January 9, 2007, the Director of the California Service Center of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") denied Ma Law's I-129 petition, because Ma Law had failed to submit \"suitable evidence to justify that [Ma's] continued duties would be in line with that of a specialty occupation worker.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ma Law appealed the Director's determination to the Administrative Appeals Office (\"AAO\") on February 2, 2007, a month after the Director denied his petition. While that appeal was pending, Ma Law filed three concurrent applications on Ma's behalf on July 2, 2007: (1) an I-485 application for adjustment of status to permanent resident; (2) an I-140 petition for an alien worker; and (3) an I-765 application for employment authorization with the Nebraska Service Center. The USCIS approved the I-765 application for employment authorization on September 26, 2007. By this point, Ma had been working in the country without a valid visa for 417 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 9, 2008, the AAO dismissed Ma Law's appeal of the Director's decision to deny its application to extend Ma's H-1B visa. Citing that dismissal, the Director of the Nebraska Service Center denied Ma Law's I-485 application to adjust Ma's status on September 25, 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Director concluded that because Ma had been \"engaged in unauthorized employment\" for 418 days\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   -well over the 180 days permitted by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k)(2) -he was ineligible for status adjustment. The Director also concluded that Ma was ineligible to be grandfathered in as the beneficiary of an immigrant visa petition or labor certification application filed on or before April 30, 2001, because no one had filed a visa petition on his behalf on or before April 30, 2001. Ma Law filed a motion to reopen the decision on October 29, 2009, which the USCIS denied on December 29, 2009. Ma Law's appeal of the denial was dismissed on January 29, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") initiated removal proceedings against Ma on May 3, 2010 for overstaying his H-1B visa. That year, Ma left Ma Law and joined MGM Resorts Corporation as a senior business analyst, having successfully earned his MBA at San Diego State University two years prior. At his hearing on February 3, 2014, Ma denied that he had remained in the United States past August 4, 2006 without authorization from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") or DHS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also requested adjustment of status as relief from removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Counsel for Ma argued at the removal hearing that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.12(b)(20), which authorizes petitioners to \"continue employment with the same employers for a period not to exceed 240 days beginning on the date of the expiration of the authorized period of stay\" while a timely application\n   for an extension is pending, conferred lawful status on Ma for the period between August 4, 2006, when his H-1B visa expired, and January 9, 2007, when the Director first denied Ma's I-129 application for an extension. Under this theory, Ma would have been without lawful status for only 174 days before he applied for adjustment of status, which would fall within\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k) 's 180-day threshold. The IJ rejected Ma's argument. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Matter of Rotimi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20567\">\n    24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA 2008), the IJ concluded that employment authorization was not the same as lawful status and that even though Ma had maintained valid employment up to January 9, 2007, that did not mean that Ma had \"maintained a lawful nonimmigrant status while the request for employment authorization was pending.\" By the IJ's calculations, Ma had been living in the United States without lawful status from August 5, 2006, when his H-1B visa expired, to July 2, 2007, when he filed his application for status adjustment with the USCIS-a period of 331 days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the IJ denied Ma's application for adjustment of status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The IJ further concluded that although Ma's parents were granted political asylum in 2012 for dissident activity, Ma was over 21 years old at the time his parents' asylum applications were filed. As a result, Ma was ineligible for asylum as a dependent. Lastly, the IJ concluded that Ma was ineligible to be grandfathered in as the beneficiary of an immigrant visa petition or labor certification application filed on or before April 30, 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The removal hearing revealed that Ma was an exemplary employee at MGM resorts and had recently been voted employee of the year for his work as a senior business analyst. Moreover, as the only child in his family, Ma had been the sole source of support for his parents-neither of whom speak English-ever since they were granted asylum in the United States. Removal would bar Ma from returning to this country to reunite with his parents for at least a decade.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(9)(B). Recognizing the \"sympathetic\" facts in Ma's case, the IJ nonetheless concluded that his hands were tied by the \"frustrations and technicalities concerning the very technical requirements for applying for adjustment of status.\" Thus, even though there was evidence that Ma was the recipient of \"numerous approvals of requests for employment authorization from USCIS continuing to [the date of the removal hearing],\" the IJ ordered Ma removed to the People's Republic of China because 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.12(b)(20) 's grant of employment authorization did not confer lawful status for purposes of status adjustment under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The BIA dismissed Ma's appeal from the IJ's order. The BIA agreed with the IJ that employment authorization under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.12(b)(20) does not confer lawful nonimmigrant status for purposes of status adjustment. Accordingly, the BIA concluded that Ma was without lawful status from August 5, 2006 to July 2, 2007, a period of over 180 days, which precluded Ma from establishing his eligibility for adjustment of status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ma timely petitioned for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to review the BIA's final\n   order of removal. \"We review the BIA's determination of issues of law\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , deferring to the BIA's interpretation of an immigration statute where that interpretation is 'based on a permissible construction of the statute.' \"\n   <em>\n    Rebilas v.

This is a reasonable agency interpretation because it fits within the framework, which restricts the availability of adjustment for those whose lawful status had elapsed and provides a limited grace period through section 1255(k). To hold otherwise would render section 1255(k) superfluous. Accordingly, we hold that section 1245.1(d)(1) is entitled to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference and controls.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   We next address whether section 274a.12(b)(20) 's grant of employment authorization falls within one of the six enumerated categories.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Of the six categories, only the second has any relevance to this case. Section 1245.1(d)(1)(ii) clearly extends lawful status to persons admitted \"in nonimmigrant status as defined in section 101(a)(15) of the [INA] whose initial period of admission has not expired or whose nonimmigrant status has been extended.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is undisputed, however, that Ma Law's application to extend Ma's H-1B visa was ultimately denied at all levels of review. It is also undisputed that Ma's H-1B visa expired long before he applied for adjustment of status. Moreover, section 1245.1(d)(1)(ii) clearly limits its recognition of employment authorization to visas (or visa extensions) obtained under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(15), which does not include employment authorization under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.12(b)(20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The law, then, is clear: While nonimmigrant workers like Ma may legally continue working in this country for up to 240 days while they wait to hear back from the USCIS on their extension applications, they do not have lawful status during this period of time for purposes of status adjustment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The margin for error under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k) is very slim. Had Ma's employer filed the I-485 application for status adjustment shortly after the I-129 petition was denied instead of waiting for over five months, Ma would likely be within the 180-day grace period. Alternatively, if Ma's employer had filed the I-129 petition for an extension months before his H-1B visa was set to expire, rather than weeks before, fewer days would have elapsed between the denial of the I-129 petition and the expiration of his H-1B visa, which would have saved Ma precious days from counting towards the 180-day threshold. Instead, the delays in filing mean that Ma was in this country for well over 180 days without lawful status before Ma Law applied for status adjustment on his behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The INA's opaque and, at times, inflexible requirements inevitably produce painful outcomes. Ma had every reason to believe that he was in compliance with the law. No doubt, he expected that his employer's application to extend his H-1B visa would be granted, and when it was not, he likely thought his appeal would be successful. When his separate application for employment authorization was later granted in 2007, there was even less reason to think that he would be at risk of removal. In the decade since, Ma has excelled at his job and settled into the role of caring for his parents, both of whom were forced to flee China in 2012. Removal would bar Ma from returning to this country-and his parents-for ten years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   But these considerations, as moving as they may be, do not factor into the calculation for status adjustment. In light of the law, we are left with no choice but to deny Ma's petition for review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    PETITION DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The USCIS specifically requested that Ma Law provide evidence demonstrating that there would be sufficient qualifying work for Ma to warrant extending his H-1B visa. When Ma Law failed to provide a satisfactory response, the Director denied the I-129 petition.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The USCIS initially denied Ma Law's I-485 application on February 24, 2009, based on its denial of Ma Law's I-140 Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker six days before. The Director, however, granted Ma Law's request to reopen the adverse I-140 decision and approved the petition on April 2, 2009. This necessitated reopening the I-485 proceedings, which the Director did on April 10, 2009.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The Director relied on section 1255(k)(2)(B) (unauthorized employment) to deny Ma Law's application. In contrast, the IJ and the BIA relied on section 1255(k)(2)(A) (failure to maintain lawful status) to deny Ma's request to adjust status during his removal proceedings. The Director's calculation of the dates, however, appears to be incorrect in two ways. First, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.12(b)(20) authorizes H-1B visa holders like Ma whose visas have expired but who have timely filed for an extension to \"continue employment with the same employer\" for up to 240 days or until a service center director denies the application for an extension, whichever comes first. In which case, Ma worked without valid employment authorization from January 9, 2007, the day his application for an extension was denied, until September 26, 2007, the day his I-765 application was approved-a period of 260 days. Second, even if the Director correctly excluded section 274a.12(b)(20) 's period of valid employment authorization from his calculation-which he did not-Ma's H-1B visa was valid up to and including August 4, 2006, which meant that Ma was without status beginning August 5, 2006. This results in a period of 417 days, not 418 days. These errors only highlight the difficulties facing petitioners who wish to apply for status adjustment and who are expected to track relevant dates as closely as Copernicus once tracked the movements of the sun.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Nicolaus Copernicus,\n    <em>\n     De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium\n    </em>\n    [On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres] (1543).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Ma admitted the other allegations contained in his Notice to Appear, which were (1) he was not a citizen or national of the United States; (2) he was a native and citizen of the People's Republic of China; and (3) he was admitted to the United States as an H-1B worker \"for a temporary period not to exceed August 4, 2006.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Both the IJ and the BIA correctly used July 2, 2007 as the end date when calculating the time Ma was without lawful status.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gazeli v.
