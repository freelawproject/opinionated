The United States Sentencing Commission has the power to promulgate the Sentencing Guidelines. But Congress has limited how it may exercise that power. Those limits are important-not only because Congress thinks so, but because they define the Commission's identity in our constitutional structure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Jeffery Havis claims that the Commission has disregarded those limits. And he may have a point. But a prior published decision of our court requires that we reject this part of his argument. Following that precedent and finding Havis's other arguments unavailing, we affirm his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Jeffery Havis pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). As it turns out, he had a lengthy criminal record. And at sentencing, the district court concluded that his twenty-year-old state conviction for selling or delivering cocaine amounted to a \"controlled substance offense\" under the Guidelines and increased his base offense level accordingly. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) (U.S. Sentencing Comm'n 2016);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-17-417\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-17-417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)-(3) (2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Havis objected to the increase. He argued that delivering cocaine does not qualify as a \"controlled substance offense\" and that it was unclear whether his state conviction was for delivery or sale. The district court found this argument unavailing on account of this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Alexander\n   </em>\n   , which held that any violation of the Tennessee statute at issue is a controlled substance offense.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12399948\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/686/326/#p327\">\n    686 F. App'x 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 327-28 (6th Cir. 2017) (per curiam). The district court thus reasoned that it did not matter whether Havis was convicted of selling or delivering cocaine since both qualified as a basis to increase his sentence. Havis now appeals, and we review the district court's decision de novo.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3632039\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/858/#p862\">\n    699 F.3d 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 862 (6th Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   To determine whether delivering drugs in violation of Tennessee law is a controlled substance offense, we apply the categorical approach.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, our job is to match up the elements of Tennessee drug delivery with those of a \"controlled substance offense\" under the Guidelines and see if Tennessee criminalizes a broader range of conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p600\">\n    495 U.S. at 599-600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p600\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Woodruff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722113\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/445/#p449\">\n    735 F.3d at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If so, no match, and the district court erred by increasing Havis's base offense\n   level. But if Tennessee drug delivery criminalizes the same (or a narrower) range of conduct, we have a match and the district court was right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Havis first argues that Tennessee drug delivery does not match up with a controlled substance offense under the Guidelines because the former includes\n   <em>\n    attempting\n   </em>\n   to transfer drugs, while the Guidelines only include\n   <em>\n    completed\n   </em>\n   controlled substance offenses. The problem for Havis, however, is that this court has already interpreted the Guidelines's definition of \"controlled substance offense\" to include attempts.\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3632039\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/858/#p862\">\n    699 F.3d at 866-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To get there, the court relied on the Guidelines's commentary, which explicitly states that a controlled substance offense \"include[s] 'the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such offenses.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3632039\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/858/#p862\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3632039\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/858/#p862\">\n    at 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 cmt. n.1).

To understand his challenge to the Sentencing Commission's use of commentary, one must take a closer look at the Commission itself.

Unlike the\n   <em>\n    text\n   </em>\n   of the Guidelines, the Commission does not have to give Congress a chance to review commentary it publishes along with the Guidelines's text, nor must the Commission float commentary through notice and comment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stinson v.

But according to Havis, what constitutes a \"substantial step\" is different under Tennessee and federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Key to Havis's argument is the Tennessee Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Reeves\n   </em>\n   , the court interpreted a new statute that redefined the state's law of attempt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10022953\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/916/909/#p912\">\n    916 S.W.2d at 910-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, he suggests that a \"merely preparatory\" action can constitute an attempt under Tennessee law but not under federal law. But this argument misreads\n   <em>\n    Reeves\n   </em>\n   . Havis is right that Tennessee's substantial-step test captures conduct that might not have been an \"overt act\" under the state's old approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10022953\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/916/909/#p912\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10022953\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/916/909/#p912\">\n    at 913-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But this does not mean that Tennessee now criminalizes conduct that is\n   <em>\n    merely\n   </em>\n   preparatory; rather, preparatory conduct must amount to a substantial step, which must be \"strongly corroborative of the actor's overall criminal purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10022953\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/916/909/#p912\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-12-101\">\n    Tenn.

And so while preparatory conduct can amount to an attempt in Tennessee, that conduct must still be a substantial step, just as under federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Next, Havis takes issue with the line at which conduct becomes a substantial step under Tennessee and federal law. Tennessee requires conduct that is \"\n   <em>\n    strongly\n   </em>\n   corroborative\" of a defendant's criminal purpose.\n   <em>\n    Reeves\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10022953\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/916/909/#p912\">\n    916 S.W.2d at 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Without more, Havis's argument comes up short.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On to Havis's final argument. As Havis points out, \"dispensing\" a drug is a controlled substance offense under the Guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). And under federal law, one can \"dispense\" a drug by \"administering\" it, but only in certain circumstances.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20802\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10). Now recall that Havis's state conviction was for\n   delivering a controlled substance.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-17-417\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-17-417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Havis argues that under Tennessee law, delivery encompasses\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   act of administering a drug, such that someone could be convicted of delivering a drug by administering it in Tennessee in a manner that would not constitute \"dispensing\" under the Guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Havis articulates a plausible theory that the Tennessee statute covers a broader range of conduct than the Guidelines. But again, he does not show that it could realistically occur. First, the plain text of Tennessee's statute does not command Havis's interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lara\n   </em>\n   , 590 F. Appx at 584. Havis would have us infer that delivery under Tennessee law includes any type of administering a drug. He suggests that we draw this inference from Tennessee's definition of \"distribute,\" which is \"to deliver\n   <em>\n    other than by administering\n   </em>\n   or dispensing a controlled substance.\" Tenn. Code. Ann. \u00a7 39-17-402(9) (emphasis added). So, Havis reasons, if one can deliver drugs\n   <em>\n    other than by administering\n   </em>\n   them (at least in the context of distributing), delivery must be the broader genus of administering's species. But Havis does not find much support for this argument in Tennessee's separate definitions of \"deliver\" and \"administer.\" If every act of administering was a delivery, one would expect some sort of reference to administering in Tennessee's definition of \"deliver\" or some reference to delivery in Tennessee's separate definition of \"administer.\" There is none.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-17-417\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 39-17-402(1), (6). And even if delivery includes\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   administering, Havis also fails to explain why we would not read Tennessee's definition of \"deliver\" to include administering drugs only to the extent specified in Tennessee's definition of \"dispense\" (which happens to match that under federal law).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-17-417\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 39-17-402(6) - (7) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20802\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Agencies do not get to decide within a vacuum: they operate within a complex system of checks and balances. To begin with, agency power is derivative of the statutory grant that creates the entity and defines the scope of its power. Our deference doctrines are thus an application of the authority that the legislature chose to grant in particular circumstances. And while the scope of the granted authority may be broad, it operates within specified limits. An agency's rulemaking must comply with the statute, and the agency's interpretation must comply with the rule.

That claim assumes a world of political continuity and agency longevity that we would be hard pressed to find today. It also ignores multiple incentives and constraints. Consider the internal pressures within the agency and throughout the governing executive branch to implement the agency's program and the external pressures from those regulated and their lobbyists to obtain predictability, both of which encourage clear regulations. These stakeholders are focused on bringing their own expertise to bear on highly complex, policy-driven issues that play out on a very practical level. This argument relies on one more dubious assumption-that agency action is driven by the views of the courts on\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference. It seems to me that the immediate pressures listed above are far more salient. Research supports this conclusion.

Though we write separately, the judges on this panel agree that the Sentencing Commission exceeded its rulemaking power by seeking to add offenses to the Guidelines through commentary rather than through the procedures for amendment. And we agree that our prior published decision in\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   was incorrect on that issue. The dissent makes a fair argument that we may put aside\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   and take up the issue in the first instance. That is a close call, but I end up with the analysis in the lead opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The lesson here is that the existing system works. This case provides no reason to question the wisdom of our longstanding deference to agencies' interpretations of their own rules.

Such deference is found nowhere in the Constitution-the document to which judges take an oath.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   And allowing such\n   deference would allow the same agency to make the rules and interpret the rules.
