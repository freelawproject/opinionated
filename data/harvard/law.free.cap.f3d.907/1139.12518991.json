During his investigation, McMullen secretly videotaped Whalen both outside and inside her home. No criminal charges were ever lodged against Whalen, but the Washington Disability\n   Determination Services division (\"DDS\") of the Washington Department of Social and Health Services (\"DSHS\") used at her social security hearing the footage surreptitiously filmed inside her home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Whalen brought suit against McMullen under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging that McMullen's entry into her home without a warrant and under false pretenses violated her Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. She appeals a grant of summary judgment in favor of McMullen based on qualified immunity. We conclude that McMullen violated Whalen's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, but we agree with the district court that McMullen has qualified immunity from suit because the right was not clearly established. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. THE FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2011, Kathleen Whalen applied for Social Security Disability and Supplemental Security Income benefits for cervical dystonia, a neurological disorder that causes tremors. DDS referred Whalen's application to the Cooperative Disability Investigations Unit (\"CDIU\"), a joint task force that investigates potential social security fraud,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for investigation due to \"inconsistencies\" between Whalen's allegations of severe functional impairments and her medical records. Whalen claimed difficulties with standing and walking, and she reported severe memory loss, weakness, and loss of motor skills. The referral to CDIU noted that Whalen's medical evidence did not support her reported diagnoses, including Parkinson's disorder, and that she appeared to use a wheelchair inconsistently. According to CDIU's report, the referral noted that Whalen's primary care physician prescribed her an electric wheelchair, \"so there will be wheelchairs in the household,\" and asked for investigation of \"how wheelchair accessible the house was, were the wheelchairs used, [were] clothes on them, etc.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   John McMullen is a detective with the Washington State Patrol who was, at the relevant time, detailed to CDIU. CDIU investigations may lead to criminal fraud prosecutions or to civil or administrative penalties. McMullen explained that from the outset, CDIU designates investigations as either criminal, civil, or administrative, and the CDIU team leader informs the assigned investigator of the designation when the case is assigned. He testified that criminal investigations are \"approached differently\"-CDIU does not seek warrants before conducting civil or administrative investigations, but it may seek warrants for criminal investigations. McMullen further testified that he believed that if evidence from a civil investigation triggered a criminal investigation, the evidence gathered during the civil investigation would be inadmissible as \"fruits of the poisonous tree.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   McMullen declared, \"When conducting investigations, I do not enter a person's home in order to conduct a search of the residence. The purpose of my communication with any individual is to speak with and observe them in order to obtain information regarding their physical, mental and emotional faculties/responses.\" To do so, McMullen and other CDIU investigators commonly employ a ruse: they introduce themselves as law enforcement officers but conceal the purpose of their encounter from the benefits claimant. McMullen testified that CDIU investigators use this ruse to engage with the subject of their investigation \"the majority of times\" and that it is \"[v]ery seldom\" they do not. He also testified that he enters a claimant's home \"a lot,\" estimating that\n   he did so in \"70, 80 percent\" of the investigations. CDIU investigators conceal the purpose of the investigation to observe the subject's \"functioning outside of the clinical and/or examination setting\" while she is \"not aware that ... functioning [is] actually being scrutinized.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   CDIU assigned Whalen's case to McMullen on October 11, 2012, and he visited her home that same day to observe her functional abilities. Because the investigation was not designated a criminal investigation, McMullen did not obtain a warrant. Wearing his state patrol badge, McMullen knocked on Whalen's door, and her mother answered. He identified himself as a detective with the Washington State Patrol. McMullen was equipped with two hidden cameras, which recorded video (but not audio) of the encounter. After Whalen came to the door, McMullen invited her to speak with him outside.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whalen agreed and walked out to McMullen's truck. McMullen told Whalen that he was investigating a potential identity theft ring, but he assured her that she was neither under suspicion nor in danger of having her identity compromised. There was no identity theft investigation or case; rather, this was a typical \"identity theft ruse\" the officers use to engage subjects in conversation. An officer would tell the subject that he found her name and address \"handwritten on a piece of paper\" and was looking for further information. McMullen used the ruse to engage Whalen in conversation, asking her to complete a questionnaire and look through some photographs of \"suspects.\" Whalen informed McMullen that she was, in fact, a recent victim of identity theft. McMullen stated in his declaration that he informed Whalen he was not investigating the theft of her identity. He designed the conversation and physical tasks, which included walking to the truck, writing, and turning over the photographs, \"to observe her responses and bodily movements\" in light of the referral's information about Whalen's medical claims. During the conversation, Whalen discussed her daily activities, which included occasionally driving or using an Access bus, shopping, cooking, and caring for her child and home. She also mentioned her recent application for a shipping, receiving, and stocking job on a loading dock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The conversation then continued inside Whalen's home. According to McMullen, Whalen wanted to provide him with the contact information for the friend she suspected of committing identity theft, which she had on her cellphone. He stated that Whalen suggested going inside and that he entered the home \"only to continue the conversation and not to conduct a search of Ms. Whalen's home.\" According to Whalen, after she thought she recognized one of the individuals in the photo array, McMullen requested the individual's contact information, which was inside on her cellphone. The parties agree that Whalen gave McMullen permission to enter her home. McMullen continued to speak with Whalen and her family inside the home for approximately fifteen minutes, during which time Whalen provided the contact information from her cellphone. He observed a wheelchair inside the home, which held folded blankets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   McMullen did not think a warrant was necessary to enter the home because he \"was only going to Ms. Whalen's home to speak with and observe her\" and \"did not intend to search her home, or anything else, nor did [he] actually conduct a search of Ms. Whalen or her home.\" McMullen did not look through Whalen's \"personal\n   effects\" or leave her presence; he \"simply recorded what [he] was otherwise able to observe.\" The entire encounter lasted approximately one hour. Although one of the hidden cameras only captured the first forty-five minutes of the interview, the other camera recorded the entire visit. At no time was Whalen aware that McMullen was videotaping her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   CDIU sent a summary report of McMullen's investigation to DDS for review and adjudication. The report focused on Whalen's abilities and comfort with walking, standing, sitting, reaching, and grasping, and it included McMullen's observations of Whalen's speech patterns, focus, finger dexterity, and writing ability. The report noted McMullen's observations inside Whalen's home, including that Whalen's wheelchair was \"being used as a blanket holder,\" that \"[t]he arms on the chair were not creased or indented from frequent use,\" and that \"[i]t did not appear that the machine was used very often.\" According to the report, Whalen limped inconsistently and exhibited \"no obvious pain related behaviors ... unless she had a chance to think.\" \"McMullen found her posturing to be very antiquated and [it] came across as an act. At no time during this investigation did [Whalen] ever exhibit any kind of debilitating behavior.\" CDIU reported that Whalen \"was much more active than she alleged to SSA/DDS and her own personal medical care providers\" and that \"[n]either the medical records, nor the investigation found [her] to suffer from any significantly limiting mental or physical functional impairments.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   DDS denied Whalen's benefits claims in part but determined that she did not commit fraud. The government never prosecuted Whalen for criminal fraud, nor did she face any civil or administrative action. She became aware of the surveillance tapes and McMullen's deception during the appeal of her denial of benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Whalen filed this\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   action for damages and injunctive relief against McMullen and DSHS. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court denied Whalen's motion and granted McMullen's motion, holding that McMullen was entitled to qualified immunity because as a matter of law it was not clearly established prior to this incident that McMullen's conduct amounted to a Fourth Amendment violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court dismissed Whalen's related state-law claims, declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. Whalen timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.

Because of the important questions presented in this case, we address both prongs of the qualified immunity analysis. We first discuss whether McMullen's warrantless entry into Whalen's home under false pretenses was an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment, and we then turn to consideration of whether it was clearly established that such an entry was a Fourth Amendment violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Whether the Conduct Violated the Constitution\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We turn first to the question whether McMullen's actions violated Whalen's constitutional rights. Whalen does not contest the constitutionality of her encounter with McMullen at her door or outside her home-her Fourth Amendment claim is limited to McMullen's entry into her home and his observations of areas inside her home not visible from the threshold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Fourth Amendment, made applicable to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, instructs that \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\" U.S. CONST. amend.

Benefits applicants and beneficiaries in\n   <em>\n    Wyman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   were informed that a home visit was a condition of receiving benefits, and they were given the option to consent or refuse entry. The claimant in this case was given no notice that a home visit would be conducted in connection with her benefits claim, because a home visit is not a condition of receiving benefits. She had no opportunity to consent to or refuse the visit. Of course, as McMullen testified, the subject of an investigation could refuse to speak with him or\n   refuse him entry at the door. But in that scenario, the subject would believe she was refusing to assist a law enforcement officer in the investigation of a crime. She would have no idea of any connection to or potential effect on her application for benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Once we add to this the fact that McMullen videotaped his entire visit, any illusion that this was not a Fourth Amendment search evaporates. McMullen had two cameras running while he was talking with Whalen, and at least one of the cameras captured his entire visit inside her home. Of course it was a search: not only was McMullen there to observe Whalen, but he had also been asked specifically to seek evidence concerning Whalen's use of an electric wheelchair, \"how wheelchair accessible the house was, were the wheelchairs used, [were] clothes on them, etc.\" McMullen's report faithfully fulfilled his charge from CDIU. He reported that the wheelchair was \"being used as a blanket holder\" and that \"[t]he arms on the chair were not creased or indented from frequent use.\" This evidence could only have been obtained inside Whalen's house, and McMullen secured it through an unconsented, warrantless search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As for the purpose, while the visits in\n   <em>\n    Wyman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   were \"both rehabilitative and investigative\" in nature,\n   <em>\n    Wyman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047000\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/309/\">\n    400 U.S. at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047000\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/309/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and involved \"looking for inconsistencies between the prospective beneficiary's application and her actual living conditions,\" their \"underlying purpose\" was \"the determination of welfare eligibility,\"\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3730402\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/916/\">\n    464 F.3d at 921-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

McMullen's purpose was to gather evidence for the fraud investigation, which he did by making observations and video recordings of Whalen and her home.

Whalen does not have to identify a controlling case finding a constitutional violation on the exact facts of her case for her asserted right to be clearly established, but she relies only on\n   <em>\n    Bosse\n   </em>\n   and other criminal ruse entry cases. In light of\n   <em>\n    Wyman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bosse\n   </em>\n   would not have provided McMullen with notice that his actions-which were common practice for CDIU investigators-violated the Fourth Amendment. McMullen knew he was conducting a civil investigation, not a criminal investigation, and that it was related to Whalen's eligibility for social security benefits. Additionally, McMullen did not initially seek to enter Whalen's home but rather to engage her in front of her house; Whalen limited her constitutional challenge to McMullen's actions once he crossed the threshold. As the district court noted, there was no authority \"requiring McMullen to retreat from [Whalen's] home\" as the conversation moved inside, nor was there authority \"clearly proscribing McMullen's conduct in this situation.\" We agree that it would not have been clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct, in the context of this civil investigation related to a determination of benefits eligibility, was unlawful. The right Whalen asserts was not clearly established, and McMullen is entitled to qualified immunity from this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   III. STATE CLAIMS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   After holding that McMullen was entitled to qualified immunity on Whalen's federal claim, the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Whalen's related state-law claims. This was not an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   IV.
