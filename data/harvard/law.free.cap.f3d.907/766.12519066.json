All of the claims in this case stem from actions taken by Dr. Wheeler and his colleagues as part of the agency's adversary process. Day's proceedings began in 2004, while Barr filed for benefits four times between 1981 and 2010. Dr. Wheeler, along with his radiology unit at Johns Hopkins University, provided expert opinions to coal mine operators that opposed the miners' claims. He offered his opinion in both Day and Barr's hearings, concluding that neither suffered from black lung disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This appeal comes to us on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). We therefore \"accept as true all well-pled facts in the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    SD3, LLC v. Black &amp; Decker (U.S.) Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341066\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/412/#p422\">\n    801 F.3d 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 422 (4th Cir. 2015). According to the appellants, Wheeler's expert opinion was biased toward industry. Specifically, they allege that Dr. Wheeler concluded that the X-ray results in each case were not consistent with black lung disease and could instead be explained by other conditions, even when proper application of medical standards would lead to a contrary opinion. Appellants further allege that he misled the tribunal and the miners as to which standards he was applying. Appellants acknowledge that they were afforded an opportunity to present contrary evidence and did in fact submit competing medical opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellants contend, however, that Dr. Wheeler's systemic violation of international\n   standards was not apparent until the Center for Public Integrity (CPI) published a critical report on the Johns Hopkins radiology unit in 2013. According to the CPI report, which is the foundation for the complaint in this case, Dr. Wheeler and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins were much less likely to find cases of black lung disease than other doctors. This made the unit a favorite of coal companies, which routinely used these opinions to defeat miners' claims. As asserted by CPI, Wheeler reviewed more than 1,500 cases and never once concluded that a claimant suffered from a severe case of black lung.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chris Hamby et al., Ctr. for Pub. Integrity, Breathless and Burdened: Part 2 (Oct. 30, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Department of Labor acted following the CPI report's publication. In 2014, the agency instructed its staff not to credit any evidence based on Dr. Wheeler's expert opinion in the absence of persuasive evidence challenging CPI's conclusions. DOL also encouraged coal miners who had been adversely affected by his testimony to refile for benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Dep't of Labor, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, BLBA Bulletin, No. 14-09 (June 2, 2014). Both Day and Barr were awarded posthumous benefits after the report was published. The survivors of both men allege that these benefits are less than would have been awarded if their claims had not been denied on the basis of Dr. Wheeler's testimony. This civil suit followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In their complaint, plaintiffs raised a federal RICO claim and state law claims for fraud, tortious interference with economic interests, negligent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment. The district court dismissed each of their claims on the same ground-the Witness Litigation Privilege. In the view of the district judge, the privilege shielded the defendants from civil liability for their actions as expert witnesses during BLBA proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Our law affords absolute immunity to those persons who aid the truth-seeking mission of the judicial system.

Immunity for witnesses-commonly known as the Witness Litigation Privilege-is a longstanding and necessary part of the common law's approach to adversarial adjudication. In fact, \"the immunity of parties and witnesses from subsequent damages liability for their testimony in judicial proceedings was well established in English common law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Briscoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193330\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/325/#p330\">\n    460 U.S. at 330-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193330\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/325/#p330\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When a witness takes the oath, submitting his own testimony to cross-examination, the common law does not allow his participation to be deterred or undermined by subsequent collateral actions for damages. The vital protection afforded all participants in litigation is unwavering. It is a bedrock of our law today just as it was centuries ago.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rehberg v.

In a public benefits setting like this one, moreover, the legislature or agency may also provide avenues of redress to those who believe they have been wronged by false testimony.

The Witness Litigation Privilege is part of both federal common law and the state law of Maryland.

As an initial matter, the appellants do not question that the administrative proceedings here are quasi-judicial in nature.

The proceedings administered by the Department of Labor under the BLBA clearly bear the essential hallmarks of the judicial function. The scheme positions coal miners and coal companies as adverse parties, allowing for briefing, clashing evidence, and cross-examination. The hearings are overseen by neutral arbiters, who are tasked with finding the facts and ensuring procedural fairness. A functional test would have little relevance if it were not satisfied here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The allegations against Dr. Wheeler relate to testimony and opinions that he offered in the appellants' BLBA proceedings. Appellants offer several bases for finding that Dr. Wheeler's testimony in these proceedings was nonetheless outside the privilege. First, appellants suggest that Maryland law limits the absolute privilege to claims for defamation, while adopting a balancing test for other claims. This misreads the Maryland courts. The privilege for witnesses undoubtedly emerged from early defamation actions brought against witnesses for statements made during trial. This does not mean, however, that the privilege has less force in other contexts. The Maryland courts apply the privilege to any \"words spoken or written in the course of or in connection to a judicial proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Brien v. Gere Eng'rs v.

As such, \"the precise theory of recovery is not dispositive\" of whether the immunity applies.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Maryland's highest court has agreed that \"the privilege would be 'valueless' or 'meaningless' if the opposing party could bar application of the privilege just by drafting the claim with a non-tort label.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265554\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/394/\">\n    135 A.3d at 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That sort of gamesmanship cannot be allowed. The purposes of the privilege-encouraging uninhibited and unchilled witness participation-do\n   not suddenly disappear when the collateral attack on witness testimony does not take the precise form of a defamation action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Appellants insist, however, that expert witnesses who appear voluntarily are less entitled to protection than eye witnesses or government agents. They also assert that witnesses who engage in deliberate fraud are less worthy of immunity than those who simply misstate the facts. No relevant citations are offered for these arguments because none are likely to exist. The dearth of authority is yet another indication that once the privilege attaches, it bars all civil claims stemming from the witness's participation before the tribunal. The fact that Dr. Wheeler appeared as an expert witness has no effect whatsoever on the question of witness immunity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. Bernet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8407577\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/218/628/\">\n    218 W.Va. 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8407577\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/218/628/\">\n    625 S.E.2d 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 713 (2013) (\"[W]e therefore hold that an adverse expert witness enjoys civil immunity for his/her testimony and/or participation in judicial proceedings where such testimony and/or participation are relevant to said judicial proceedings.\"). Moreover, while the alleged conduct in this case, if true, would be morally reprehensible, that is simply not dispositive of the legal question before us. Any balancing or sliding-scale test that varies with the type of witness testimony in the initial trial or the form of the claim in the later collateral action would guarantee the vexatious litigation that the privilege was designed to prevent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The cases offered by the appellants as support for a claim-specific balancing approach do nothing to advance their argument. The decision of the Maryland state court in\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   , for instance, actually expanded immunity to statements made \"for possible use in connection with a pending judicial proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

This circuit reached a similar conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Mangold\n   </em>\n   , finding that the common law immunity should apply to statements made by government contractors \"in response to queries by government investigators engaged in an official investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Mangold v.

Both cases reinforce the simple fact that state and federal courts alike are willing to invoke the common law's protections when the values that animate a historic immunity are at issue. Neither citation advances a case-by-case public policy test. To the contrary, these decisions confirm that our system requires broad protection for those who offer judicial proceedings information, unaltered by the facts of a particular case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The statements made by Dr. Wheeler as an expert in the administrative proceeding are within the privilege's scope. This fact alone is enough to resolve the state law causes of action, which offer no basis for displacing the common law immunity. The federal claim, however, arises under statute and we must now consider whether appellants' statutory cause of action abrogates the traditional immunity afforded to witnesses under common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Appellants' sole federal claim arises under the civil cause of action created by the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), Pub.

The Witness Litigation Privilege is a part of federal common law.

But the particular nature or structure of the assertedly abrogating statute matters not. The dispositive point remains congressional intent and whatever the civil or criminal or \"hybrid\" nature of the statute, that intent must be clear. The point is especially salient with an issue like witness immunity when witness participation is essential in both civil and criminal proceedings. Courts have routinely addressed the question of whether a statute displaced common law protections without any suggestion that the principles of displacement varied with the nature of the statute the court was interpreting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Briscoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193330\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/325/#p330\">\n    460 U.S. at 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193330\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/325/#p330\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Cullinan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"977930\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/128/301/#p308\">\n    128 F.3d at 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Appellants argue, however, that RICO's cross-reference in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to a criminal prohibition on witness tampering, found at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201512\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , creates a civil remedy for obstruction of justice generally, including acts of false testimony. This, however, would be an exceptionally oblique way for Congress to have abrogated witness immunity. Section 1512 makes no reference to false testimony or to perjury. This absence of specificity is fatal to appellants' claim because, as the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Briscoe\n   </em>\n   , the litigation privilege is \" 'a tradition so well grounded in history and reason' that we cannot believe that Congress impinged on it 'by covert exclusion in the general language before us.' \"\n   <em>\n    Briscoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193330\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/325/#p330\">\n    460 U.S. at 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193330\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/325/#p330\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Tenney v.

Moreover, appellants make no claim of witness tampering. Witness tampering is of course a wholly distinct offense\n   from perjury.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201641\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201512\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Witness tampering can only demean the administration of justice. There has been no common law immunity, state or federal, for those who tamper with witnesses. The witness immunity privilege, by contrast, facilitates the administration of justice and it would make perfect sense for Congress in RICO to cross-reference one of those crimes and not the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The appellants' view finally misrepresents the intersection between RICO and the common law. With witness immunity fully intact, racketeering activities under RICO can still include acts to improperly influence witnesses, tamper with evidence, or bribe public officials. To the extent individuals are harmed in their \"business or property\" by these acts,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201964\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), they can seek redress. These claims are only limited when the injurious conduct is part of a core judicial process that the common law keeps uninhibited by the prospect of civil litigation. Common law immunities pose no general threat to RICO's effectiveness. To the contrary, RICO and witness immunity are complementary because it is that very immunity that allows RICO prosecutions and RICO civil causes of action, like all other judicial process, to proceed in an unfettered way. In other words, without the immunity, the entire RICO statute, both its civil and criminal provisions, would be impaired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We thank our friend and colleague for his dissenting opinion, and especially for its reminder of the contribution coal miners have made and continue to make in support of our nation's welfare.

The omnipresent prospect of collateral proceedings inherent in the dissent's fact-intensive standard is itself enough to undermine the very purpose of witness immunity.

Rather than reading these\n   cases for what they are, which is simply further support for the immunity afforded to participants in judicial proceedings, the dissent instead sees in these opinions an endorsement of its imprecisely diluted version of witness immunity.

The very case relied on by the dissent, however, forecloses such a limitation. As a unanimous Supreme Court wrote in\n   <em>\n    Rehberg\n   </em>\n   , witness immunity \"may not be circumvented by claiming that a ... witness conspired to present false testimony. ...

As the dissent understands it, the fact that some broad crimes included in RICO's definition of \"racketeering activities\"-such as mail fraud, bribery, or obstruction of justice-could conceivably reach witness conduct shows that the immunity has been abrogated in civil suits. These broad statutes, just like the open-ended language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at issue in\n   <em>\n    Briscoe\n   </em>\n   , fall well short of the clear statement that we are required to identify before taking such a drastic step. In concluding otherwise, the dissent ignores the Supreme Court's standard and fails to acknowledge that while the criminal and civil provisions of RICO may identify the same underlying conduct, they do not both implicate witness immunity. As the Supreme Court has recognized, the two prongs of RICO do not always have the same reach, especially where a clear statement of congressional intent is required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco, Inc. v.

In particular, the dissent fails to acknowledge the incentive that disconsolate losing parties would have to go after a prevailing party's witness; the added incentive for both collateral actions and \"settlement suits\" that RICO's treble damages provision might inspire,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201964\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ; the rise in expert witness fees that would inevitably result for both plaintiffs and defendants in anticipation of collateral liability; the shading of testimony from lay witnesses with an eye cast toward a retributive RICO action against them for monetary damages; the reluctance generally of witnesses of all kinds to participate in judicial proceedings that newly stretch beyond the normal point of conclusion; and the weight that has been afforded for many decades, indeed centuries, to the efforts of the civil justice system to protect from post-verdict burdens the jurors (e.g., Fed. R.

But it should at least persuade us to await a clear expression of intent to abrogate longstanding common law that is wholly absent from the statute as presently written. As we have noted in some detail above,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 776-77, RICO's list of proscribed acts fails to cross-reference\n   perjury, nor may its other provisions be read to defeat witness immunity.

My position is predicated on two primary propositions. First, the majority's treatment of the civil RICO claim is fatally flawed and lacks supporting authority. In my view, the RICO allegations are compelling and should go forward in the district court. The majority's decision will leave America's coal miners and their families with no civil remedy for the criminal activities of Dr. Wheeler and his racketeering partners. Put succinctly, the majority has - on an ultra-thin record - unnecessarily expanded the so-called witness litigation privilege (the doctrine of \"absolute witness immunity\"), and then misapplied its expanded immunity principles to affirm the dismissal of the civil RICO claim. Second, notwithstanding the reluctance of federal courts to expand state law, the majority has applied its broad view of absolute witness immunity to the state law claims in the complaint and endorsed their dismissal as well. In these circumstances, I must dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   According to the complaint - which we must accept as true - the civil RICO racketeering scheme carried on by the defendants was both sophisticated and complex.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It included the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \u2022 Wheeler and his fellow racketeers obtained B-reader accreditations under federal law, demonstrating workable knowledge of the International Labour Organization (\"ILO\") classification\n   system for radiology and an ability to accurately apply it;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \u2022 As B-readers, Wheeler and his coschemers knew they were obligated to interpret radiographs according to the ILO classification system;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \u2022 Wheeler and his partners in crime intentionally disregarded the ILO classification system for interpreting coal miners' radiographs for the federal black lung program, and they falsely attributed positive readings to other causes and diseases, instead of correctly reporting evidence of coal workers' pneumoconiosis ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \u2022 Wheeler has admitted that, notwithstanding his obligation to apply the ILO classification system as a B-reader, he purposefully rejected and ignored that system;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \u2022 Wheeler has asserted that he does not \"care about the law,\" and he does not think it was appropriate for coal miners to be paid benefits just \"because [miners had] masses and nodules,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. 21;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \u2022 In exchange for submitting their false and fraudulent expert opinions that miners' radiographs were negative for evidence of black lung disease - when those radiographs were actually positive - Wheeler and his racketeering associates were paid premium and excessive fees, that is, \"significant sums in excess of standard x-ray review fees,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. 34;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \u2022 Wheeler and his coconspirators used the mails to receive radiographs and to send their false and deceptive interpretations to various employer companies - including Peabody Energy and Eastern Associated Coal - their lawyers, and administrative adjudicators;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \u2022 Despite rendering and reporting roughly 1500 radiograph interpretations, Wheeler and his racketeering partners never identified the most serious and obvious form of black lung, called \"complicated coal workers' pneumoconiosis,\" for any claimant, even when other expert physicians found complicated coal workers' pneumoconiosis in approximately 390 of those 1500 radiographs ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \u2022 In at least 280 of those cases, Wheeler and his coconspirators successfully deceived the adjudicators into erroneously determining that claimant coal miners did not have coal workers' pneumoconiosis when they, in fact, had that disease.

That gloss, however, distorts what Wheeler and his fellow racketeers actually did. These defendants were actually engaged in a RICO scheme and conspiracy - carried out through a RICO enterprise - to provide false and fraudulent information to parties, their lawyers, and others involved in black lung proceedings. And that false evidence was always intended to be used to deprive sick coal miners and their families of their statutory benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The panel majority's analysis of absolute witness immunity suffers from faulty assumptions and untethered generalities, resulting in at least two fatal errors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, their analysis assumes that absolute witness immunity applies to the civil RICO allegations. Second, overlooking the principles and purposes of a civil RICO cause of action - which include the deterrence of criminal fraud schemes that impede the fair and proper functioning of commercial and governmental entities - the majority erroneously concludes that the RICO statutes do not abrogate the doctrine of absolute witness immunity in the context of this RICO claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The panel majority's decision rests upon an overly expansive definition of absolute witness immunity.

My friends of the majority, however, have ignored the Supreme Court's distinction and erroneously applied absolute witness immunity to the RICO claim pursued in this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Given the nature of this civil RICO claim, the doctrine of absolute witness immunity simply does not apply. In other words, the RICO claim is not a claim precluded by such immunity. It arises from a series of fraudulent activities in furtherance of a sophisticated plan to deprive our nation's diseased coal miners - and their families - of the black lung benefits to which they are entitled. Of great importance, the majority has not referenced any precedent of this Court or the Supreme Court that has applied absolute witness immunity against civil RICO liability. Without tethering its view of absolute witness immunity to some controlling precedent, the majority has erroneously expanded that doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In so ruling, the majority expresses its concern that, if the plaintiffs are allowed to pursue the RICO claim, that effort will somehow result in improper \"gamesmanship,\" with plaintiffs escaping an application of absolute witness immunity by alleging claims that do \"not take the precise form of a defamation action.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   775.

The RICO claim simply seeks a remedy for a statutorily outlawed fraudulent course of racketeering activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Specifically, the plaintiffs' RICO claim concerns Wheeler's and his coconspirators' acts of mail fraud and obstruction of justice that occurred prior to the submission of their false reports to black lung adjudicators. Even courts that have applied the more expansive principles of absolute witness immunity to \u00a7 1983 actions have recognized that such immunity does not \"relate backwards\" to non-testimonial acts occurring prior to testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spurlock v.

I am unable to fathom how the conspiratorial use of false and fraudulent expert reports - intended to mislead coal miners, coal companies, lawyers, and adjudicative bodies - can in any way contribute to the \"truth-seeking function\" of the adversarial process. Contrary to the majority's contention that permitting the RICO claim to proceed would distort the evidentiary process, it was Wheeler and his fellow racketeers who purposefully supplied falsehoods and misrepresentations about medical records in a concerted and repugnant effort to skew the adjudicatory outcomes of claims lodged by hundreds of coal miner victims. Those distortions should neither be sanctioned nor encouraged by the courts.

The plaintiffs predicate this civil RICO claim upon, inter alia, multiple acts of mail fraud and obstruction of justice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Congress has specifically provided that \"any act which is indictable under ... section 1341 (relating to mail fraud)\" constitutes racketeering activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(B).

The plaintiffs allege that Wheeler and his racketeering partners contravened \u00a7 1341 by utilizing the mail system to prevent diseased coal\n   miners and their families from receiving the black lung benefits they are due. And the defendants did so by falsely and fraudulently representing that Wheeler and his partners in crime had made radiograph interpretations that complied with the ILO classification system. The majority's decision to authorize Wheeler and his fellow racketeers to escape liability is directly counter to the clear statutory text of RICO, which attaches civil liability to the defendants - for treble damages - to compensate these plaintiffs for the defendants' racketeering activities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In addition to undermining the statutory text, the panel majority misapprehends the strong and compelling public interest supporting the use of a civil RICO claim in the federal courts. The majority contends that the prospect of a perjury prosecution will deter witnesses from knowingly making false statements. They also say that, because RICO does not reference the perjury statute, Congress neither intended for RICO to cover false testimony nor explicitly abrogated the doctrine of absolute witness immunity. But Congress created the civil RICO cause of action to provide aggrieved individuals - like these diseased and deceased miners and their suffering families - with a civil remedy for racketeering activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sedima, S.P.R.L. v.

I fully endorse the Second Circuit's view. It is thus apparent that the majority has misconstrued\n   <em>\n    Eisen\n   </em>\n   , which confirms that, although an act of perjury alone may not support a RICO claim, the use of perjured testimony - as part of the larger pattern of racketeering activity - will not undermine a civil RICO claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514420\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/974/246/#p254\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Instead of permitting Wheeler and his racketeering partners to jump through an absolute immunity loophole, the RICO statutes render them civilly accountable for racketeering activities committed in furtherance of the civil RICO claim.

To allay any concern about this standard, lawyers hiring expert witnesses - including lawyers opposing black lung claimants - need only instruct their prospective experts not to violate the law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Unfortunately, the panel majority has today expanded absolute witness immunity to an entirely new class of recipients - those expert witnesses who write false reports, but who never actually testify in any courts or adjudicative proceedings. This new class (Continued) of absolutely immune experts, however, today joins those public officials who have traditionally and properly been accorded absolute immunity by our judicial system, that is, legislators, judges, prosecutors, and the President. And those public officials are only protected by absolute immunity in those circumstances where they perform their official duties. Unlike the absolute immunity protecting such public officials, today's unwarranted extension of absolute immunity to criminal fraud schemes committed by so-called expert witnesses in no way \"serve[s] the greater public interest.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mangold\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7647169\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/77/1442/#p1449\">\n     77 F.3d at 1449\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    RICO requires the plaintiff to prove, inter alia, \"a pattern of racketeering activity,\" which must include \"at least two acts of racketeering activity,\" occurring within ten years of each other.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201961\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (5).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    The majority's application of absolute witness immunity likewise subverts other provisions of RICO.
