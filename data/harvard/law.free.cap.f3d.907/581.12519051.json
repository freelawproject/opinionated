We present them \"in the light most favorable to the verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Meeks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4200951\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/639/522/#p525\">\n    639 F.3d 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 525 (8th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2014, De La Torre had become a target of investigation for law enforcement in the Omaha, Nebraska area. De La Torre operated De La Torre Auto Repair, an auto repair shop at 4016 Hamilton Street in Omaha. Law enforcement suspected that he illegally distributed controlled substances from that location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In August 2014, Ryan Slavicek, an acquaintance of De La Torre's, delivered a car to De La Torre's shop for service. The two men decided that De La Torre would conduct a test drive of the car. De La Torre drove the vehicle, with Slavicek and Slavicek's young son as passengers. Soon, local police pulled them over for a traffic violation. Slavicek was removed from the car, while De La Torre and Slavicek's son remained inside. Slavicek consented to a search of the vehicle. The officers recovered about two ounces of methamphetamine from the car's center console. They also found several thousand dollars in cash on both De La Torre and Slavicek. Slavicek had a history of methamphetamine use. Both men were arrested, and Slavicek was subsequently charged in state court with possession of methamphetamine. State authorities later dismissed this charge, and federal authorities indicted Slavicek for drug possession. Slavicek claimed, from the time of his arrest through De La Torre's trial, that the methamphetamine was not his. At some point, Slavicek agreed to serve as an informant in assisting authorities in the investigation of De La Torre.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Early on the morning of July 1, 2015, police surveilled De La Torre, seeking evidence of illicit drug sales. At about 5:00 a.m., officers began monitoring De La Torre's auto repair business. This business shared a building with another business, Neo's Auto Repair and Collision. At about 6:30 a.m., police also went to De La Torre's home to ask him to consent to a search of it. De La Torre's brother, David, answered the door. David informed police that De La Torre was not at home and that he preferred to discuss the matter with De La Torre before consenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   With police permission, David called De La Torre and apprised him of the situation. Eventually, De La Torre spoke with the officers directly and granted permission\n   to search the house. \"[W]ithin a matter of a few minutes\" of the phone call's end, a car arrived at the shop. Tr. of Proceedings, Vol. II, at 257,\n   <em>\n    United States v. De La Torre\n   </em>\n   , No. 8:16-cr-00115 (D. Neb. Oct. 26, 2016), ECF No. 108. A man later identified as Miguel Diaz-Huizar, an associate of De La Torre, got out of the car. Diaz-Huizar worked at Neo's and, occasionally, did mechanical work for De La Torre. He was observed entering De La Torre's shop carrying nothing. When he left a short while later, he was carrying a bag containing a plastic container. Police stopped Diaz-Huizar's car for two minor traffic offenses (an expired license plate and failure to signal) shortly after he left the shop. The officers discovered about three quarters of a pound of methamphetamine in the container found in the car. However, the roughly contemporaneous search of De La Torre's house proved fruitless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In September 2015, acting as an informant, Slavicek initiated a conversation with De La Torre about Slavicek's legal troubles while wearing a wire. When asked about the conversation at trial, Slavicek stated, \"[T]he government wanted me to make contact with [De La Torre] about any drug involvement. My intention while I was there was to confront him about the drugs that he put in the vehicle.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 175.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In March 2016, De La Torre was indicted on Counts I, II, and IV. His father, Marcos De La Torre-Casas (\"Casas\"), was indicted on Count I and for possession with intent to distribute 5 grams or more of methamphetamine (\"Count III\"). Count I alleged that De La Torre and his father's conspiracy lasted from on or about January 2011 to July 2015. Count II alleged that the possession of methamphetamine took place on August 25, 2014, the date that De La Torre was stopped while with Slavicek. The offense date for Count IV was July 1, 2015, the date of the search of De La Torre's home and business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   De La Torre was arraigned on April 6, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The government moved for detention on that day, which De La Torre resisted. The district court held a detention hearing on April 21 and ruled in favor of the government. On April 26, De La Torre filed a motion to extend the pretrial motions deadline to May 17, which the district court granted. De La Torre filed a motion to suppress on May 17. The magistrate judge held a hearing on the motion on June 16. The magistrate judge first addressed whether it would consider a number of defense motions challenging the validity of the warrant used to search De La Torre's home. At the conclusion of the hearing, the magistrate judge determined that these motions, filed well after the pretrial motions deadline, were inexcusably untimely. The magistrate judge entered his order recommending that the district court deny the motion to suppress. De La Torre filed objections to the magistrate judge's findings and recommendation. The district court issued a written order adopting the magistrate judge's findings and recommendation on August 24. On August 25, the district court set trial for September 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On September 1, the government filed a motion to continue the trial date to enable the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) to secure witness Tammy Gall, who was incarcerated in a federal facility in Phoenix, Arizona. The magistrate judge granted the motion on September 6, referencing both the ends of justice and Gall's status as a necessary witness. De La Torre objected, but the district court noted that De La Torre did not dispute the government's\n   facts. It found the time needed by the USMS to secure the witness was reasonable. The district court overruled De La Torre's objection on September 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 19, De La Torre filed a motion to dismiss for Speedy Trial Act violations. The motion alleged that the district court had erroneously excluded the delay caused by the continuance to secure Gall's presence at trial. The district court denied the motion, concluding that the continuance promoted the ends of justice and, even if it did not, fewer than 70 non-excludable days would have run before trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court concludes that the delay resulting from the continuance served the ends of justice, thus, the time was properly excluded from the speedy trial clock.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(A). Nevertheless, as discussed below, even if the delay resulting from the continuance had not been excluded, 70 days will not have elapsed since Defendant's first appearance, taking into account other excludable periods under the Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    United States v. De La Torre\n   </em>\n   , No. 8:16-cr-00115,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206102338\">\n    2016 WL 6102338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (D. Neb. Oct. 19, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Also shortly before trial, De La Torre filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude the recording of his conversation with Slavicek. He argued that the poor sound quality destroyed its evidentiary value. Additionally, he sought the exclusion of pictures of text messages from Gall's phone that allegedly demonstrated that he supplied her with illegal drugs. He asserted the messages (1) were hearsay, (2) lacked sufficient proof of connection to him to qualify as the admissions of a party opponent, (3) necessarily included hearsay statements of Gall, and (4) were taken out of context of De La Torre and Gall's conversations. Finally, he argued that lack of forensic analysis on the phone, as well as the limited number of text messages, would mislead the jury and prejudice him in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 403. On the first day of trial, before voir dire commenced, the district court denied the motion as to the text messages and delayed ruling on the recording until later in the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At trial, the government presented the testimony of Omaha Police Department Officer James Holtmeyer. Officer Holtmeyer was one of the officers who conducted the August 2014 traffic stop of De La Torre and Slavicek. Holtmeyer testified that Slavicek spoke with the officers outside the vehicle and gave consent to search. During this time, De La Torre remained in the car alone with Slavicek's son. Holtmeyer acknowledged that either Slavicek or De La Torre could have been responsible for the methamphetamine found in the center console.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The next witness, DEA Agent Frank Feden, provided information regarding the use of informants in criminal investigations and Slavicek's cooperation with law enforcement. Agent Feden stated that he took part in Slavicek's proffer interview, which spurred the wired conversation. In this operation, law enforcement placed a hidden recorder and video camera on Slavicek and sent him to De La Torre's business to talk to him. They hoped that De La Torre would implicate himself in the sale of illegal drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   De La Torre's conversation with Slavicek was recorded with a hidden camera affixed to Slavicek's person and an audio recording device shaped like a key fob and placed on Slavicek's key ring. However, because the recording devices did not transmit contemporaneously, Slavicek was also given a device referred to as a \"Kel\" that allowed police to hear what was happening in real time. The government moved to admit a DVD of the conversation\n   during Agent Feden's testimony. The district court accepted it over a defense objection. The court gave a limiting instruction, ordering the jury not to accept anything Slavicek stated in the recording for the truth of the matter asserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The government then called Slavicek to the witness stand. Slavicek stated that he had used methamphetamine off and on for several years leading up to his August 2014 arrest. He said he had met De La Torre through work around 2010 and that De La Torre eventually became one of his sources for methamphetamine. He testified that he bought methamphetamine from De La Torre over 20 times, in amounts ranging from 1/4 ounce to 1/4 pound. In addition, he testified that he had purchased large quantities (over two pounds) of marijuana from De La Torre on several occasions. He also disclosed that he had entered into a conditional nonprosecution agreement to have his charges dropped in exchange for testifying at De La Torre's trial; his only instruction from the government was that he be honest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Slavicek stated that when he and De La Torre conducted drug deals they did so at another auto shop operated by De La Torre. He testified that he personally saw De La Torre in possession of \"[p]robably a couple pounds\" of methamphetamine in a Tupperware container. Tr. of Proceedings, Vol. II, at 170. According to Slavicek, they never conducted drug deals at the shop on Hamilton Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Douglas County Sheriff's Deputy Theresa Ogorzaly testified as to her role in the investigation. She and other officers monitored the drug buy between Casas and Gall. She also explained that after Gall's arrest, she consented to a search of her phone, which Ogorzaly conducted. Ogorzaly took pictures of drug-related text messages Gall exchanged with De La Torre and discussed them with Gall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Gall, who, like Slavicek, was subject to a cooperation agreement, testified about her relationship with De La Torre and his father. She said that she knew De La Torre supplied methamphetamine, that she purchased methamphetamine from him on several occasions for both personal use and for resale, and that Casas delivered drugs for De La Torre. She logged her transactions in a day planner and communicated with De La Torre through both phone calls and text messages. The court received Gall's planner and notebook into evidence during her testimony. The text messages between Gall and De La Torre were also admitted during her testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Diaz-Huizar also testified, claiming that he was not involved in narcotics. He represented that he only picked up the package because De La Torre asked him to and did not know that it contained a controlled substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After the government rested, the defense moved for a judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29, which the district court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   De La Torre testified in his own defense. He stated that he did not tell Diaz-Huizar to pick up a package from the shop; that he barely knew Gall; and that he never texted Gall, spoke to her on the phone, or sold drugs to her. He also categorically denied that he sold any drugs out of his shops. Moreover, he denied responsibility for the methamphetamine recovered in the August 2014 stop and said that he only spoke as he did with Slavicek to mollify him, as he seemed angry and dangerous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After about four and a half hours of deliberation, the jury found De La Torre guilty on all three counts. De La Torre moved for acquittal or, in the alternative, a new trial. The district court denied the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On appeal, De La Torre argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress, motion for acquittal, and motion to dismiss. He also contends the district court made reversible evidentiary errors. Finally, he argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by not timely moving for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Suppress\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   De La Torre seeks reversal of the court's denial of his suppression motion, averring that the search warrant application for his shop was invalid. He contends the warrant application should have disclosed that the search of his home yielded no contraband and that his business shared a building with another business. He also argues that the evidence did not sufficiently connect the \"cube shaped object\" the affidavit claims Diaz-Huizar possessed as he left the shop to the \"brown paper bag\" in which the police found drugs after stopping Diaz-Huizar. Appellant's Br. at 14.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the \"veracity\" and \"basis of knowledge\" of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place. And the duty of a reviewing court is simply to ensure that the magistrate had a \"substantial basis for ... conclud[ing]\" that probable cause existed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Illinois v.

The facts set forth in the affidavit support probable cause. Police observed a man, Diaz-Huizar, entering De La Torre's repair shop empty-handed. Moments later, the same man left carrying something with a noticeable shape. Authorities stopped this man and found him with methamphetamine and a scale. The police observance of contraband potentially originating from De La Torre's shop adequately supported the authorization of a search warrant for the shop. These facts support the finding of a fair probability that evidence of a drug crime would be found in the shop.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3501041\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/589/940/#p943\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, we affirm the denial of the motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Speedy Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   De La Torre argues that the time excluded for the continuance requested by the government should have counted\n   for Speedy Trial Act purposes.

However, the government filed a detention motion that day, and the district court did not rule on it until April 21. Therefore, the 70-day clock began to run on April 22. On April 26, De La Torre filed a motion to extend the pretrial deadline from April 27 to May 17 because his counsel needed more time to review discovery and determine whether to file any pretrial motions. The district court granted the motion after concluding that the extension served the ends of justice. The court thus excluded April 26 to May 17, the time period between the filing of the motion and the new deadline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   De La Torre filed his motion to suppress on May 17 and again stopped the clock.

For instance, he notes that Slavicek had a conditional plea agreement with the government. He also asserts that Slavicek's testimony that he did not appear nervous during the August 2014 stop contradicted Officer Holtmeyer's testimony that Slavicek\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   appear nervous. Additionally, he contends that the jury improperly ignored the possibility that the drugs found in the console might have belonged to Slavicek's child's mother, as the jury had heard evidence that the car was hers and that, like Slavicek, she had also been a user of methamphetamine. On the whole, De La Torre's sufficiency arguments consist of credibility challenges to the various government witnesses. Individually and collectively, these arguments do not show the jury lacked sufficient evidence to find him guilty of the charged offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   We defer substantially to a jury's findings at trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   We review de novo the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal based on the sufficiency of the evidence.

Therefore, even if the evidence adduced at trial rationally supports conflicting hypotheses, we will refuse to disturb the conviction.
