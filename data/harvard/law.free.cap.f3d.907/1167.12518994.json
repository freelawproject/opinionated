As part of her canvassing, Knox often encourages prospective voters to watch for their early ballot to arrive, to complete it, and to mail it back. Before the 2016 election cycle, Knox \"accepted and delivered at least one voted ballot for a voter that [she] met while canvassing [prospective voters], and who requested that [she] deliver their early ballot.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Knox states that \"[a]ssisting voters with the delivery of their early ballots was, and continues to be, a part of expressing [her] political belief that all registered voters have an opportunity to use their franchise.\" Through the act of collecting and delivering individuals' voted early ballots, Knox intends to communicate the message that she \"support[s] the continued and widespread use of voting by mail, and that the United States' postal system provides a secure and easy platform to exercise the franchise and conduct elections.\" Knox also intends her conduct to communicate the message that \"voting is the most fundamental right in a democratic society and that [she is] committed to helping qualified electors exercise their right to vote regardless of\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   they vote for.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Prior to the 2016 election cycle, Knox was willing to assist voters who asked her to deliver their voted early ballot to a United States mail receptacle or other appropriate ballot drop-off location. Since H.B. 2023 went into effect, she understands that she is \"prohibited from collecting and delivering another person's early ballot.\" Knox is now \"very careful not to offer to deliver or accept for delivery another person's early ballot, even if they ask for [her] assistance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After H.B. 2023 was enacted, Knox canvassed prospective voters for a candidate seeking election in the special election for Congressional District 8. During those efforts, Knox encountered several voters who had not yet mailed their early ballots. Knox felt compelled to \"censor [herself] by not offering to collect and deliver\" their early ballots. Instead, Knox encouraged them \"not to place their ballots in the mail because it was too late and, instead, to deliver their ballots to an appropriate location before the polls closed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Knox plans to canvass prospective voters again in the upcoming 2018 election and would like to collect and deliver voted mail-in ballots, but fears doing so because of H.B. 2023 and the state's \"threats to\n   strictly enforce H.B. 2023.\" But for H.B. 2023, Knox \"would affirmatively offer to deliver early ballots for voters ... or, at a minimum, [ ] would be willing to oblige a voter who requested that [she] deliver his or her ballot.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Knox filed this lawsuit in district court, claiming that H.B. 2023 is facially invalid because it: (1) was preempted by federal law under the Supremacy Clause; (2) violated speech rights protected by the First Amendment as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) was void for vagueness because of its failure to define when a person is deemed to have collected an early ballot in violation of the Due Process Clause. In her concurrent motion for a preliminary injunction, Knox asked the court for expedited relief and to consolidate the hearing on her motion for a preliminary injunction with a trial on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a)(2). After holding a consolidated preliminary injunction hearing and bench trial, the district court denied Knox's motion for a preliminary injunction and ruled against her on all three of her claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Knox timely appealed.

Therefore, our analysis must focus on whether Knox rebutted this presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We first consider Knox's field preemption claim.

Rev. Stat. \u00a7 16-1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (H). On its face, therefore, the Private Express Statutes do not implicitly preempt H.B. 2023 through field preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   To avoid this conclusion, Knox raises two arguments. First, Knox argues that\n   H.B. 2023 regulates the carriage of mail for hire because it does not prohibit election officials and caregivers from collecting ballots, and such individuals receive salaries for performing their jobs. This argument fails. H.B. 2023 does not regulate the ballot-collection activities of election officials or caregivers, but merely exempts them from the state statute's prohibition. Moreover, such individuals are not collecting ballots for a fee in competition with the Postal Service; rather, their collection of ballots is merely an incidental part of their jobs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, Knox urges us to read the Private Express Statutes as expressing a clear and manifest intent to occupy the broadly defined field of letter carriage and delivery generally, leaving no room for state regulation of compensated or uncompensated mail carriers. According to Knox, by declining to prohibit uncompensated carriage of mail, Congress intended to prevent regulation of any sort, state or federal, in this area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Isla Petroleum\n   </em>\n   , 485 U.S. at 500,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13909\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/495/#p500\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In support of this argument, Knox points to the regulatory exceptions to the Private Express Statutes that permit specified conduct, and claims that the language providing that certain conduct is \"permitted,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20310.2\">\n    39 C.F.R. \u00a7 310.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), or \"permissible,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20310.2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 310.3, indicates Congress's intent to leave the permitted conduct unregulated by the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We reject this argument. The Supreme Court made clear that Congress did not intend to regulate the uncompensated carriage of mail; Congress's sole concern was preventing competitors from reducing the Post Office's revenues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Regents\n   </em>\n   , 485 U.S. at 597-98,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13250\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/589/#p597\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The regulations cited by Knox are consistent with Congress's focus on competitors rather than on the field of mail carriage as a whole; they provide that the postal monopoly does not apply to a limited range of activities that do not pose a competitive threat to the Post Office. Carving out specified conduct from a broad prohibition is not equivalent to regulating that conduct or ensuring that such conduct may proceed unregulated. Given the presumption against preemption, the Postal Commission's regulations are best read as withdrawing from part of a field, rather than occupying it. Because Congress has not made a clear and manifest determination that uncompensated carriage of mail should be left unregulated by states as well as federal authorities,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ark.

Knox does not argue that compliance with H.B. 2023 and federal law is impossible.\n   <em>\n    Oneok, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588777\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1591/#p1595\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, she argues that H.B. 2023 stands as an obstacle to the operation of comprehensive federal postal laws.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588777\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1591/#p1595\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   First, Knox contends that H.B. 2023 obstructs Congress's objective of ensuring efficient delivery of the mail. We disagree. State laws may obstruct the federal postal monopoly \"where state regulation involved a direct, physical interference with federal activities under the postal power or some direct, immediate burden on the performance of the postal functions.\"\n   <em>\n    Corsi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6156306\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/88/#p97\">\n    326 U.S. at 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6156306\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/88/#p97\">\n    65 S.Ct. 1483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying this principle, we have held that a local ordinance that required postal letter carriers to \"obtain express consent from residents before crossing their lawns in the course of mail delivery\" was preempted by federal regulations that \"authorize[d] postal carriers to cross lawns unless the owner objects.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because the local \"ordinance interfere[d] with postal carriers' federal duty to deliver the mail efficiently\" it was therefore unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1181846\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/661/783/#p784\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1181846\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/661/783/#p784\">\n    at 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No such conflict is present here: H.B. 2023's prohibitions regarding the collection of voters' early ballots exempt federal postal officials and therefore do not interfere with any federal activities under Congress's postal power. Because H.B. 2023 exempts federal postal workers from regulation, it does not frustrate Congress's objectives in enacting the Private Express Statutes; namely, to protect the postal monopoly and its ability to generate revenue.\n   <em>\n    Air Courier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6231998\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/517/#p519\">\n    498 U.S. at 525-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6231998\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/517/#p519\">\n    111 S.Ct. 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Next, Knox notes that the Postal Regulatory Commission has promulgated regulations that suspend the postal monopoly for the delivery of \"extremely urgent letters,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20320.6\">\n    39 C.F.R. \u00a7 320.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which is relied on by private carriers such as FedEx and DHL. Knox argues that H.B. 2023 conflicts with federal law because it would prohibit such private carriers from accepting a ballot for delivery, despite the authorization under federal regulation. We reject this argument for substantially the same reason we rejected her similar argument in the field preemption context. Congress's purpose in enacting the Private Express Statutes was to protect the Postal Service's revenues, and a state statute that prohibits private carriers from collecting state ballots does not stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congress's purpose. Under the presumption against preemption, we decline to interpret a federal regulation withdrawing a federal prohibition on certain types of private carriage as conflicting with a state statute imposing a different prohibition on that carriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We also reject Knox's argument that H.B. 2023 obstructs Congress's goal of achieving \"national integration\" because it precludes individuals from offering more efficient methods of early-ballot delivery. This theory is directly contrary to the Supreme Court's analysis of the Private Express Statutes. According to the Supreme Court, Congress's goal of achieving national unity required the Postal Service to reach all the far-flung reaches of the nation.\n   <em>\n    Air Courier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6231998\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/517/#p519\">\n    498 U.S. at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6231998\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/517/#p519\">\n    111 S.Ct. 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In order to ensure the Postal Service could generate sufficient revenues to accomplish this mission, Congress decided to eliminate its competition.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6231998\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/517/#p519\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Congress did not consider whether private, uncompensated delivery of mail might provide more efficient delivery to remote areas; its only intent was to enhance the Postal Service's revenues so it could discharge\n   its duty of providing delivery to such areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, we reject Knox's argument that by imposing penalties on the uncompensated carriage of letters, H.B. 2023 is an obstacle to the regulatory system chosen by Congress in enacting the Private Express Statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   , 567 U.S. at 405-06,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
