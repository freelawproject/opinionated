At sentencing the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   determined that Eason had at least three prior convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense, making him subject to sentencing under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). The court determined that his advisory guidelines sentencing range was 262-327 months imprisonment and imposed a 300-month sentence. Eason timely appealed. With the appeal pending, the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

We affirmed Eason's conviction but, in light of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing because the record did not establish that, without the residual clause, he had at least three prior ACCA predicate convictions.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Code Ann. \u00a7 5-13-201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , are violent felonies under the ACCA's force clause. The district court considered this evidence, applying the modified categorical approach used to determine whether violations of these divisible statutes constitute violent felonies for ACCA purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The court again concluded that Eason is an armed career criminal with a 262-327 month advisory guidelines range. Taking into account his rehabilitative conduct after the initial sentence, the court imposed a reduced 262-month sentence. Eason appeals, raising three sentencing issues.

The district court overruled his objection to the residual clause and determined that Eason's Arkansas robbery and battery convictions were ACCA violent felony predicates, without explaining whether it was ruling under the residual clause, the force clause, or both. On appeal, Eason conceded his conviction for delivery of cocaine was an ACCA predicate drug offense. We concluded that his conviction for robbery under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%205-12-102\">\n    Ark.

Thus, whether Eason has three ACCA predicate convictions turned on whether his Arkansas convictions for third degree domestic battery and first degree battery are violent felonies under the ACCA force clause. We remanded for resentencing because the record did not include state court judicial records establishing which subdivision of the Arkansas third degree domestic battery statute Eason violated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340009\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/633/#p640\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340009\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/633/#p640\">\n    at 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 642 n.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On appeal, Eason argues the district court erred in allowing the government to supplement the record at resentencing with state court judicial records establishing that his prior third degree domestic battery conviction was for a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%205-26-305\">\n    Ark.

In these cases, we focused on whether the government and the district court had relied on a mistaken understanding of the governing sentencing principles and, in particular, whether we deemed the government's failure of proof at the initial sentencing to be excusable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Whether to allow either party to expand the sentencing record is of course an exercise of the court's substantial evidentiary discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Here, the district court carefully considered whether to reopen the record to admit state court records relevant to the force clause question. The court noted that Eason's resentencing took place in light of significant changes in the law that now required the government to establish that Eason's prior battery convictions were violent felony predicates under the force clause. \"It did not occur to me that the residual clause would be declared void for vagueness because other courts had upheld it,\" the court explained. The court concluded it was appropriate to reopen the record because this change in the law obliged it \"to consider evidence that I didn't think I had to consider before.\" This ruling was not an abuse of the court's discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Force Clause Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Even assuming the record was properly reopened on remand, Eason argues the district court erred in ruling that his 2006 convictions for third degree domestic battery under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%205-26-305\">\n    Ark.

The force clause defines violent felonies to include \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(i).

Eason argues that other circuits distinguish between the infliction of physical injury and the use of physical force, but our decision to the contrary in\n   <em>\n    Winston\n   </em>\n   is controlling. He further argues that either statute could be violated without the use of violent physical force, such as by poisoning, or with the use of minor force, such as inflicting a bruise. However, \"the proper inquiry is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, involves the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Eason has not cited, and we have not found, any Arkansas case in which the defendant was charged with violating either statute by the use of non-violent force. \"Before we conclude that a state statute sweeps more broadly than the federal definition of violent felony, there must be a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the statute encompasses conduct that does not involve the use or threatened use of violent force.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Eason's Presentence Investigation Report recommended these enhancements, noting a terroristic threatening charge pending in state court regarding his firearm possession offense, and noting that police responded to an aggravated assault in connection with the ammunition possession offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, Eason argues for the first time the district court erred in imposing these enhancements because Arkansas convictions for terroristic threatening and aggravated assault are not, categorically, crimes of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). We review this seriously defaulted claim, if at all, for plain error. We held that terroristic threatening is a violent felony in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This is not a categorical inquiry; it turns on the facts of defendant's offense of conviction. Here, as Eason did not contest the enhancement at sentencing, the district court did not identify a specific crime of violence as a basis for the enhancement. But this was not error, much less plain error, if the facts surrounding the offense of conviction support a charge that Eason's firearm or ammunition possession was in connection with conduct that constituted a crime of violence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Later, Kuykendall also found two .45-caliber shell casings in the area of the reported shooting, which he deemed to be from a gun like the one he had recovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"On April 9, 2013, while on pretrial release, Eason was involved in an incident at the residence of Hiawatha Williams .... Eason was engaged to Williams's daughter, Erica Davis, and he and Davis had a dispute. When Williams saw that Eason had a firearm, he ran next door and borrowed a .380 pistol. Williams returned to his home and fired a warning shot, which hit the ceiling immediately above him on the front porch. ... Eason then left the residence. As Williams returned to his bedroom, he heard a shot fired. Although he did not see the shooter, Williams believed it was Eason. ... Detective Gibbons of the North Little Rock Police found a 9-millimeter bullet in Williams's bedroom closet and a spent shell casing nearby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"The jury returned guilty verdicts on both counts -- Count 1, for possession of the .45-caliber pistol that Officer Kuykendall retrieved, and Count 2, for possession of the 9-millimeter ammunition found in Williams's closet.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Ample evidence supports a finding that Eason's firearm possession conviction resulted from his shooting at people in a domestic situation, and his ammunition possession conviction involved shooting at Hiawatha Williams while Williams's back was turned. It is irrelevant what state court charges were filed as a result of these incidents. The question is whether Eason could have been charged with a crime of violence for this violent conduct. The answer is obvious, as our prior cases upholding the enhancement when a defendant's firearm possession offense involved a shooting or an attempted use of physical force make clear.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daniels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799084\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/625/529/#p534\">\n    625 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   534 ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.
