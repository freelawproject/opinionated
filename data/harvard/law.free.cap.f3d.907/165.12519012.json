The district court dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, holding that because the payment was not a tax, exclusive jurisdiction for a suit for repayment lies with the Court of Federal Claims. The Fund challenges that ruling on appeal, and we now affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Fund is a self-administered, self-insured employee health and welfare benefit plan created under a collective bargaining agreement. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (\"ACA\") reformed several features of the health insurance industry, which collectively led to\n   more high-risk individuals entering the insurance market. The ACA therefore included a Transitional Reinsurance Program to stabilize the markets by requiring payments from \"health insurance issuers, and third party administrators on behalf of group health plans ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018061\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A). These payments would be collected and then reallocated to insurers who covered the new high-risk individuals. The ACA authorized the HHS Secretary to promulgate regulations defining who would pay into the Transitional Reinsurance Program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018041\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(C). The initial regulation required entities like the Fund to pay, but later amendments excluded them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Fund thus paid into the Transitional Reinsurance Program for 2014, but not thereafter, and in June of 2016 filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201346\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), seeking a refund of its 2014 payment on the grounds that the initial regulation's classification was an impermissible interpretation of the statute. The Fund argued that the payment was a tax under \u00a7 1346(a)(1) because it met a multi-factor test articulated in\n   <em>\n    In re Leckie Smokeless Coal Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650807,6460679\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/99/573/\">\n    99 F.3d 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 583 (4th Cir. 1996). The district court noted, however, that under\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Fed'n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/\">\n    567 U.S. 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), the Supreme Court's statutory test was controlling. Because the Fund's payment was described as a \"payment\" or \"contribution\" in the ACA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018061\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), it was not a tax. That conclusion meant that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The district court thus granted the government's Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss without prejudice, leaving the opportunity for the Fund to seek a refund in the Court of Federal Claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201491\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fund then separately filed an action with the Court of Federal Claims while also bringing this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Section 1346 grants district courts jurisdiction concurrent with the Court of Federal Claims for civil actions seeking a refund from the United States of an \"internal-revenue tax.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201346\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The Fund claims on appeal that its payment to the Department of Health and Human Services was an \"internal-revenue tax\" under \u00a7 1346, allowing it to proceed in federal district court. The statute's text is simply fatal to this claim. To see why, one must understand how \u00a7 1346 intersects with other relevant statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Suits seeking money payments from the federal government invoke the Tucker Act, which waives federal sovereign immunity for claims greater than $10,000 so long as the litigant proceeds in the Court of Federal Claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201491\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Another route exists for tax claims. Section 1346 creates a narrow exception that allows taxpayers to seek a refund in their home district rather than in Washington D.C. However, this jurisdictional grant comes with limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Section 1346 is part of the broader scheme of tax administration. This scheme is responsive to the unique governmental interests with respect to tax revenue. When a taxpayer challenges a collection, for instance, the Anti-Injunction Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207421\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), requires that he first pay the tax and then seek a refund, preventing disruption in revenue collection. In seeking this refund, a separate law, the Claim-for-Refund provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207422\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), requires that taxpayers first seek relief from the Treasury Department. Only after these twin hurdles of payment and administrative exhaustion are surmounted does \u00a7 1346 come into play, allowing a civil suit in the taxpayer's local federal district\n   court. The interlocking structure created by these statutes-the Anti-Injunction Act, Claim-for-Refund statute, and \u00a7 1346-works together to create an integrated system of administration, distinct from other claims for monetary relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When statutes function as parts of a greater whole, our canons of construction require reading them together,\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   . Here, that requirement is heightened because \u00a7 1346 uses the very same operative phrase as the Claim-for-Refund statute. That phrase is the one at issue in this litigation: \"internal revenue tax.\" Section 1346(a) reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction, concurrent with the United States Court of Federal Claims, of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) Any civil action against the United States for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority or any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected under the internal-revenue laws;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201346\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Supreme Court has instructed that \"[d]espite its spacious terms, \u00a7 1346(a)(1) must be read in conformity with other statutory provisions which qualify a taxpayer's right to bring a refund suit ....\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Claim-for-Refund statute, \u00a7 7422(a), is just such a qualification, and, as the Supreme Court noted, it \"track[s] the language of[ ] \u00a7 1346(a)(1).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5333\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/596/#p601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Section 7422(a) reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (a) No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Secretary, according to the provisions of law in that regard, and the regulations of the Secretary established in pursuance thereof.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207422\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Both provisions above come from the Revenue Act of 1921, and their textual connection compels the same construction.

Beyond that basic principle, the Supreme Court long ago observed that the \"essential language\" of \u00a7 1346(a)(1)\"seems to have been copied from ... the predecessor of the present claim-for-refund statute [ \u00a7 7422 ]\" and that \"[t]he meaning that has been ascribed to this language in the claim-for-refund statute provides the key to what Congress intended when it used that language in the jurisdictional provision.\"\n   <em>\n    Flora v.

The \"Secretary,\" of course, means the Secretary of the Treasury. That is the Department of which the Internal Revenue Service is a part. It would make little sense for \u00a7 7422 to require exhaustion with the IRS as a precondition to seeking a refund from HHS, another agency. Since the words in \u00a7 1346 are the same as those in \u00a7 7422, an \"internal revenue tax\" must be one for which requesting a refund from the \"Secretary\" is sensible. The ineluctable conclusion is that internal\n   revenue taxes are those collected by the IRS, under the authority of the Internal Revenue Code.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wyodak Res.

That conclusion disposes of this case: because the payment here was made not to the Treasury, but to HHS under the Transitional Reinsurance Plan, it was not an internal revenue tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Fed'n of Indep.

The Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over the Fund's action. The Fund argues, however, that the test is purely one of functionality, in which courts are to inquire whether a particular assessment, collection, exaction, or fee does or does not \"function\" like a tax. The Fund's view would create nothing but confusion in an area in which ease of application is important.

Fortunately, there is a simple answer here. For the reasons noted above, \u00a7 1346(a)(1) applies only to taxes and other sums collected by the Internal Revenue Service under the Internal Revenue Code. The judgment of the trial court is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <em>\n     In re Leckie Smokeless Coal Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650807,6460679\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/99/573/\">\n     99 F.3d 573\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (4th Cir. 1996), on which the Fund relies, is of no help to its position. It bears mentioning that the Coal Act premiums at issue in\n    <em>\n     Leckie\n    </em>\n    were enacted as an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, codified in Title 26, and administered by the Secretary of the Treasury,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Leckie\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650807,6460679\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/99/573/\">\n     99 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    583 &amp; n.12, and thus the case is of no assistance to the Fund's position. And, of course, in the event of any conflict between the mode of analysis there and that employed in\n    <em>\n     Sebelius\n    </em>\n    , the Supreme Court's instruction in\n    <em>\n     Sebelius\n    </em>\n    would control.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
