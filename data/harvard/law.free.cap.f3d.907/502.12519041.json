The district court compelled arbitration pursuant to an agreement between Herrington and Waterstone, but it struck as unlawful a waiver clause that appeared to forbid class or collective arbitration of Herrington's claims. The arbitrator conducted a collective arbitration over Waterstone's objection and ultimately awarded more than $10 million in damages and fees to Herrington and 174 similarly situated employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A recent Supreme Court decision has now put this award in doubt. In\n   <em>\n    Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611962\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1612/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611962\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1612/\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), the Court upheld the validity of waiver provisions like the one in Herrington's agreement with Waterstone. If imposing collective arbitration on Waterstone violated that waiver, we must instruct the district court to vacate the award, which would put Herrington back at square one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   But Herrington does not concede that the collective arbitration violated the waiver. In an attempt to save her award, she insists that her agreement with Waterstone affirmatively permits class or collective arbitration of her claims despite the presence of a valid waiver indicating otherwise. While this argument is weak, someone must evaluate it-and we must decide who has that job. If the availability of class or collective arbitration is a threshold question of arbitrability, the district court has to decide it. Otherwise, it falls to the arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For reasons we explain below, we conclude that the availability of class or collective arbitration is a threshold question of\n   arbitrability. On remand, the district court, rather than the arbitrator, must evaluate Herrington's contract with Waterstone to determine whether it permits class or collective arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pamela Herrington sued Waterstone Mortgage Corporation in federal court, asserting two claims. First, she alleged that Waterstone had failed to pay her minimum wages and overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act. She brought that claim as a collective action under the Act, which meant that other employees could opt in to the lawsuit.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Second, she claimed that Waterstone had breached its contract with her. She brought that claim as a class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, which meant that Herrington would represent a class of absent claimants unless they opted out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   But Herrington had signed an agreement to arbitrate employment disputes, and Waterstone moved to enforce it. Herrington's employment agreement with Waterstone contained an arbitration clause, which provided in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   In the event that the parties cannot resolve a dispute by the [alternative dispute resolution] provisions contained herein, any dispute between the parties concerning the wages, hours, working conditions, terms, rights, responsibilities or obligations between them or arising out of their employment relationship shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association applicable to employment claims. Such arbitration may not be joined with or join or include any claims by any persons not party to this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Based on this language, Waterstone asked the district court to either dismiss the suit for lack of jurisdiction or stay it and compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Herrington responded that the arbitration clause was unenforceable. She argued that the entire clause, which required her to pay half of the arbitration costs, was invalid because it imposed excessive costs on her. She also challenged the validity of the sentence waiving her right to join the claims of others in the proceeding. According to Herrington, this waiver violated both the Fair Labor Standards Act, which permits collective actions, and the National Labor Relations Act, which protects concerted activity. She did not contest Waterstone's position that her claims were within the scope of the waiver in the arbitration clause; indeed, her arguments under the Fair Labor Standards Act and National Labor Relations Act assumed that the waiver, if valid, would bar both class and collective arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court rejected Herrington's contention that the agreement to arbitrate was unenforceable. It said that Herrington had failed to show that the agreement imposed excessive costs on her because she \"failed to show that arbitration would be any more expensive than litigation in federal court.\" But it accepted her argument that the waiver in the arbitration agreement was unlawful. The Fair Labor Standards Act was not the problem; the court agreed with the many courts that have held that the Fair Labor Standards Act does not mandate the availability of collective arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Carter v. Countrywide Credit Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9264724\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/294/#p298\">\n    362 F.3d 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 298 (5th Cir. 2004). The National Labor Relations Act, however, was a different story. That Act gives employees the right \"to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and instructs employers not \"to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the\n   exercise of\" that right,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). At the time the court ruled on Waterstone's motion to compel arbitration, the National Labor Relations Board had just decided that the right \"to engage in other concerted activities for ... mutual aid or protection\" includes the right to pursue claims collectively; accordingly, employers who condition employment on accepting arbitration agreements that waive class and collective actions violate that Act.\n   <em>\n    In re D.R.

Relying on the Board's decision, the court struck the sentence waiving Herrington's right to bring a class or collective proceeding in arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   It sent the parties to arbitration with an order unequivocally instructing the arbitrator that Herrington \"must be allowed to join other employees to her case.\" The court left it to the arbitrator to determine whether to accomplish that through joinder, an opt-in procedure similar to a collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act, or an opt-out proceeding similar to a class action under Rule 23. Herrington asked for class arbitration, which is available only if the arbitration agreement contains evidence that the parties affirmatively consented to that procedure.\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds Int'l Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448443,3582279\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/662/\">\n    559 U.S. 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 687,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448443,3582279\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/662/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448443,3582279\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/662/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Because class arbitration \"fundamental[ly] changes\" the nature of the proceeding, \"the parties' mere silence on the issue of class-action arbitration\" does not signify assent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448443,3582279\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/662/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448443,3582279\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/662/\">\n    at 686-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448443,3582279\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/662/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The arbitrator had to find more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Waterstone argued that the waiver settled the question: the waiver prohibited class arbitration, so Waterstone had obviously not assented to it. The arbitrator rejected that argument, reasoning that he was bound to ignore the waiver because the district court had invalidated it. Yet even without the waiver, Waterstone contended, the agreement contained no evidence that the parties consented to class arbitration. The arbitrator rejected that argument as well, reasoning that the parties had agreed to class arbitration when they agreed to proceed under the rules of the American Arbitration Association \"applicable to employment claims.\" Waterstone maintained that this language incorporated only the general set of rules for employment claims, which are embodied in a rule-book titled \"Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures.\" But the arbitrator interpreted it to also incorporate the Association's \"Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations.\" By incorporating both sets of rules, he said, the agreement authorized class arbitration. In passing, the arbitrator added that even if the waiver were intact, the agreement's incorporation of the Association's rules created an ambiguity that he would construe against Waterstone. He decided to proceed with a class arbitration modeled on Rule 23 but later switched to a collective arbitration that required additional claimants to opt in.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Throughout the arbitration, Waterstone repeatedly asked the district court to reconsider its initial decision and to change various decisions that the arbitrator made along the way; those efforts were all unsuccessful. In the end, the arbitrator issued an award of over $10 million in damages and fees in favor of Herrington and 174 other claimants who had opted in to the proceeding. Waterstone appeals from the final judgment enforcing the arbitrator's\n   award,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , arguing that because the waiver is valid, the collective arbitration violated Waterstone's agreement with Herrington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Herrington agreed to arbitrate employment disputes with Waterstone and that any \"[s]uch arbitration may not be joined with or join or include any claims by any persons not party to this Agreement.\" The first issue in this appeal is whether the district court incorrectly struck this waiver from the parties' arbitration agreement. Had we issued this opinion a year ago, the answer would be a simple \"no.\" The district court interpreted the National Labor Relations Act to prohibit agreements that require single-claimant arbitration of employment claims, and we later reached the same conclusion in an unrelated case.\n   <em>\n    Lewis v. Epic Sys. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5918417\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/1147/#p1161\">\n    823 F.3d 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1161 (7th Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   But the Supreme Court reversed our decision while Waterstone's appeal was pending.\n   <em>\n    Epic Sys.

After examining both the Federal Arbitration Act and the National Labor Relations Act, the Court held that an arbitration agreement does not violate the National Labor Relations Act's protection of \"other concerted activities for ... mutual aid or protection\" when it requires plaintiffs to pursue employment-related claims in single-claimant arbitrations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611962\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1612/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611962\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1612/\">\n    at 1624-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Epic Systems\n   </em>\n   means that the district court was wrong to treat the waiver in Herrington's agreement with Waterstone as unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The lawfulness of the waiver is the easy part of this appeal. The hard part is a question that\n   <em>\n    Epic Systems\n   </em>\n   does not address: what happens next?\n   <em>\n    Epic Systems\n   </em>\n   makes clear that a waiver of the right to proceed in a class or collective arbitration is valid. But someone has to interpret the arbitration agreement-this time, including the waiver-to determine whether it authorized the collective arbitration that occurred. One could reasonably wonder why the availability of collective arbitration is in dispute, given that Herrington agreed that her \"arbitration may not be joined with or join or include any claims by any persons not party to this Agreement.\" Indeed, until recently, Herrington herself assumed that this waiver, if enforceable, would require her to proceed in a bilateral arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   But she has now changed her tune: she claims that not-withstanding the waiver, the agreement reflects the parties' affirmative consent to class and collective arbitration. As implausible as this argument may be, either the court or the arbitrator has to settle it. We must decide which.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The choice between them turns on whether the availability of class or collective arbitration is a question of arbitrability, which the court decides, or a subsidiary issue, which goes to the arbitrator. Questions of arbitrability involve \"gateway matters, such as whether parties have a valid arbitration agreement at all or whether a concededly binding arbitration\n   clause applies to a certain type of controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Oxford Health Plans LLC v.
