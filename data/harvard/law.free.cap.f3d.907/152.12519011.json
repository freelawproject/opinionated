The district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss all of these claims, and we now affirm its judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 1950, the federal government began to build Dulles Airport. Recognizing that access to the airport was as important as the airport itself, the government also acquired a right of way to begin building an access road, linking Dulles to two of the major highways serving the Washington, D.C. region. In 1962, the airport and the access road were opened under the management of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1983, the federal government gave Virginia an easement to build a toll road through the right of way previously acquired for the access road. The federal government determined that the new toll road would help mitigate increasing congestion in the vicinity of Dulles. The road\n   was opened one year later and was operated by the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By 1984, the federal government was concerned that needed capital improvements at Dulles, and its sister airport National, could not be funded. The solution, devised by a Commission created at the behest of the Secretary of Transportation, was to transfer control of both airports to an authority with the ability to raise money by selling tax-exempt bonds. The next year, Virginia and the District of Columbia passed reciprocal laws to create an interstate compact for the management of Dulles and National. Congress had already consented to the compact in 1959, when it gave advance approval to interstate compacts for the management of airports. Act of Aug. 11, 1959, Pub. L. No. 86-154,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Stat.%20333\">\n    73 Stat. 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1959). The result of this compact was the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority (MWAA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   MWAA was authorized by its organic state laws to acquire National and Dulles from the federal government. Additionally, MWAA was granted powers to operate, maintain, and improve National and Dulles airports, including the power to issue revenue bonds and collect various charges for the use of the airports.

The Transfer Act also specified the terms under which the Secretary could lease National and Dulles to MWAA, requiring that, as a condition of the transfer, MWAA must only use the property for \"airport purposes.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2049104\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 49104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B). \"[A]irport purposes\" were in turn defined to include \"activities necessary or appropriate to serve passengers or cargo in air commerce\" and \"a business or activity not inconsistent with the needs of aviation that has been approved by the Secretary.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2049104\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 49104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(ii), (iv).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Transfer Act also required MWAA to \"assume responsibility\" for the Master Plan developed by the federal government for National and Dulles.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2049104\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 49104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(A). The Plan was concerned with the management of the airports, and included provisions that were designed to ensure that passengers and cargo had access to them, in spite of increasing congestion. One of these provisions contemplated an eventual extension of metro service from Washington to Dulles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2006, metro service to Dulles was becoming a reality. The long-planned Silver Line, which would connect Dulles to Washington, was coming to fruition. In service of this project, Virginia agreed to transfer operation of the toll road to\n   MWAA, and MWAA agreed that it would use revenues from the road to finance construction of the Silver Line, as well as other transportation improvements near Dulles. In 2008, the Secretary of Transportation certified that this arrangement did not violate the terms of the Lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Virginia's agreement with MWAA inspired three legal challenges before this one. First was a state law challenge that unsuccessfully tried to have a state court declare MWAA's collection of tolls violated the Virginia Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Gray v. Virginia Secretary of Transportation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12641403\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/662/66/\">\n    276 Va. 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12641403\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/662/66/\">\n    662 S.E.2d 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 100, 107 (2008).

The third case,\n   <em>\n    Corr v.

Va. 2011). The district court rejected each one, finding that MWAA's structure did not violate the non-delegation doctrine, the Appointments Clause, or the Guarantee Clause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4155879\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/800/743/#p751\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4155879\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/800/743/#p751\">\n    at 756-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Appellants here (and plaintiffs below) bring a putative class action by users of the toll road and other airport facilities. Their lawsuit presented a bouquet of statutory and constitutional claims. Important for this appeal are the assertions that MWAA is a federal instrumentality, that MWAA violated Article I, Article II, and the Guarantee Clause of the Constitution, that MWAA violated the Administrative Procedures Act, and that MWAA violated the terms of the Transfer Act and the Lease by using toll revenues to build the Silver Line.

But of course, the federal government has an \"interest\" in a great many things. A federal interest does not convert an entity into a federal instrumentality. And, at the very least, the interest here is one that is shared by the residents of Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Interstate compacts-even those that envision a cooperative relationship with the federal government-are not federal entities. In an increasingly interconnected world, challenges which were once thought to be purely local are in fact regional in character. Single states are often ill-equipped to meet regional challenges like the reduction in marine fisheries,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (approved at Act of May 4, 1942, Pub.

These challenges demand a regional response, and interstate compacts allow states to act in concert to supply one. Multi-state endeavors such as MWAA are a creative means of meeting regional needs. And though they may entail sharing of responsibilities or cooperation among governments, they remain wholly constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Appellants' failure to meet the threshold of establishing MWAA as a federal entity is fatal to their claims under the Appointments Clause and the Administrative Procedures Act. Both these provisions apply to federal entities-\"Officers of the United States,\" U.S. Const. Art II. \u00a7 2, and \"author[ities] of the Government of the United States,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), respectively.

Because MWAA exercises no power assigned elsewhere by the Constitution, we conclude that it does not violate that principle.

At any time, the elected leaders of Virginia and Washington may amend the compact through reciprocal legislation. Va.

It was recognition of the incongruity of the federal government operating a commercial airport that led to the formation of MWAA in the first place.

Because we agree with the Secretary of Transportation's interpretation of the Lease and Transfer Act, we reject this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   MWAA leases Dulles and National from the federal government under terms specified by the Transfer Act. The Act and the Lease allow MWAA to levy certain fees but require that \"all revenues generated by the Metropolitan Washington Airports shall be expended for the capital and operating costs of the Metropolitan Washington Airports.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2049104\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 49104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). MWAA also has responsibility for the airports' Master Plan, which, since MWAA was created, contemplated the extension of metro service to Dulles. In 2006, MWAA took over the operation of the toll road leading to Dulles so that it could use the revenues from the road to finance construction of a metro line connecting the airport to Washington, D.C. The question presented by this suit is whether the Act and the Lease allow MWAA to spend those funds for that purpose. We conclude they do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The expenditures in no way violate the Lease terms. The Secretary of Transportation determined as much in 2008 when she certified MWAA's actions as compliant with the Lease. Her certification expressly contemplated improvements both on and off MWAA's property and concluded that these actions \"do not conflict with any terms in the lease[.]\" J.A. 416. The Secretary's approval in this case is entitled to \"great weight.\"\n   <em>\n    Consol. Gas Supply Corp. v.

As the D.C. Circuit explained, an agency, when interpreting contracts that it is authorized to approve or disapprove, is \"entitled to just as much benefit of the doubt in interpreting such an agreement as it would in interpreting its own orders, its regulations, or its authorizing statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Cajun Elec.

Cir 1991).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   It also makes good sense to defer to this determination because it is clear that Congress assigned the Secretary of Transportation a critical role in what, after all, is a transportation matter. The Transfer Act empowers the Secretary in a number of ways: she is responsible for entering into the Lease authorized by the Transfer Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2049104\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 49104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; she has the power to retake possession of MWAA property that is being improperly used,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2049104\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 49104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(C) ; and she decides which \"business or activity not inconsistent with the needs of aviation\" may be considered an \"airport purpose\" under the terms of the Lease.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2049104\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 49104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iv). It was pursuant to this critical role that the Secretary of Transportation approved MWAA's use of funds to build metro out to Dulles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Secretary's interpretation of the Act and the Lease is plainly a reasonable one, for two reasons. First, the Transfer Act and the Lease command MWAA to \"assume responsibility\" for the Master Plan for Dulles and National. The version of the Plan in effect at the time of the Act's passage contemplated the extension of metro service to Dulles. Second, the Act\n   and the Lease consent to MWAA's exercise of the power of eminent domain conferred upon it by Virginia.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2049106\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 49106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(D). Congress, therefore, must have imagined that MWAA would make improvements to land that is not owned or controlled by the Authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Secretary's determination conceives practically of an airport as more than just a terminal and runways. It also encompasses a broader infrastructure and critical adjunct improvements that facilitate access to Dulles. Excessive congestion can effectively strangle airport operations and require citizens to spend an ever longer portion of each day making a flight or returning from one. Efforts to alleviate congestion and expand access to facilities in major metropolitan areas often and understandably meet with challenges from those whose lives and properties may be affected by any given project proposal. But some improvements need to be made lest growth overwhelm the ability of the metropolis to deal with it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   There is no basis in law for finding that the dedicated funding mechanism here was impermissible. To find otherwise would throw longstanding airport expansion arrangements into turmoil. We decline to take that step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
