Here, San Diego County (County) social workers removed four children under the age of six from their family home under a suspicion of child abuse, took them (as was routine) to Polinsky Children's Center (Polinsky) for temporary shelter, and subjected them to\n   invasive medical examinations, without their parents' knowledge or consent and without a court order authorizing the examinations. The family sued the County and others, alleging violations of the parents' Fourteenth Amendment and the children's Fourth Amendment rights. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court concluded that the County's custom and practice of performing the medical examinations without notifying parents and excluding parents from those examinations violates the parents' Fourteenth Amendment rights. The district court further concluded, however, that the Constitution did not require the County to obtain the parents' consent or a court order. The district court did not address whether the children's Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the invasive medical examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   These cross-appeals require us to determine whether the County violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments when, absent exigent circumstances or a reasonable concern that material physical evidence might dissipate, it subjects children to medical examinations without first notifying parents and obtaining parental consent or judicial authorization for the examinations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mark and Melissa Mann are the parents of four children: N.G.P.M., born in 2004, and N.E.H.M., M.C.G.M., and M.N.A.M., triplets born in 2006. Mark is the director of the Wesleyan Center for 21st Century Studies at Point Loma Nazarene University. Melissa is a nurse midwife at Scripps Hospital. In April 2010, two incidents led to the removal of the Manns' children, then ages 6 and 4 (the triplets), from their family home and their admission to Polinsky.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On Monday, April 6, 2010, N.E.H.M.'s preschool director called Mark Mann after observing a red mark on her lower back. Mark went to the preschool and explained that he had struck N.E.H.M. with a wooden spoon the night before in a misguided effort to calm her. The preschool director told Mark that as a mandatory reporter, she was required to report the incident to the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA). With Mark in the room, the director reported the incident on HHSA's child abuse hotline and indicated that Mark was cooperative. In the following days, HHSA social workers interviewed Mark, Melissa, and the children at their home. Mark and Melissa agreed to receive supportive services and each signed a voluntary safety plan, which, among other things, prohibited Mark from using physical discipline on the children and required the presence of a third party when help was needed to adequately care for the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During one of these visits, social workers noticed that M.N.A.M. had a bruise on his forehead. Melissa explained that M.N.A.M. had hit his head on a kitchen countertop. When the social workers asked to photograph the bruise, however, Melissa protested that it felt \"manipulative,\" but later that day she apologized to the social workers and volunteered to take N.E.H.M and M.N.A.M. to Rady Children's Hospital for a \"Suspected Child Physical Abuse and Neglect Examination.\" The next day, the children's examining physician concluded that N.E.H.M.'s red mark was consistent with Mark's explanation, and that M.N.A.M.'s bruise was \"most likely accidental.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Despite Mark and Melissa's cooperation, the social workers decided to prepare a dependency application in order to remove the Mann children from their home. The social workers omitted exculpatory evidence from the application\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -evidence that the district court later concluded would have rendered the application insufficient to support a protective custody warrant. Relying on the flawed application, the juvenile court issued a warrant authorizing the removal of the children on April 12, 2010, and the County removed the Mann children from their home and took them to Polinsky later that day. Upon their admission to Polinsky, the children met with a nurse who performed a cursory examination, checking the children's vital signs and their heads for lice, as well as made sure they had no urgent medical needs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The next day, April 13, 2010, Mark and Melissa appeared at a detention hearing at the juvenile court, where the County asked them to sign a \"Consent for Treatment - Parent\" form. The standardized form authorized treatment only if the treatment was \"recommended by a licensed physician ....\" The form permitted the parents to indicate whether they preferred treatment by \"Private Physician\" or \"Other Licensed Hospital/Medical Facility.\" Mark Mann signed the form and indicated that, if treatment was necessary, they preferred it to be provided by the children's private physician at Scripps Health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Meanwhile at Polinsky, while the Manns were appearing in court, a doctor, Nancy Graff, performed a ten- to fifteen-minute medical examination of each of the Mann children that included a twenty-two point assessment of general appearance, behavior, mental status, and specific parts of the body (e.g., skin, head, and eyes). The examination also included a gynecological and rectal exam, which involved a visual and tactile inspection of the children. For the gynecological exam, Dr. Graff testified that she asked the girls to \"kind of drop their legs into a frog leg situation,\" and \"separate[d] the labia and look[ed] at the hymen ....\" Staff also administered tuberculosis tests, requiring pricks of the children's skin, and the children gave blood and urine samples for drug screening. If staff observed signs of abuse, the County required them to photograph the abuse for the children's records. No one notified Mark and Melissa that their children were examined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Since at least November 2003, the County routinely performed this medical examination on children admitted to Polinsky after a juvenile court order authorized it to \"obtain a comprehensive health assessment as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), including a mental status evaluation, for a child prior to the detention hearing ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The County, however, excluded from its examination practices verbal children re-admitted to Polinsky within a short period of time,\n   reasoning that such children are able to tell County officials about any abuse they experienced between their last discharge and their readmission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The day after the Mann children were subjected to this medical examination, they were released from Polinsky to the custody of their paternal grandmother, who resided in the family home until the dependency proceedings were resolved. Months later, after a trial, the juvenile court dismissed the dependency petition, concluding that it was unsupported by sufficient evidence. Mark and Melissa were never notified that their children had been examined, and did not suspect that any medical examinations had taken place until N.G.P.M. told Melissa that \"two ladies at the college [Polinsky] said they needed to touch me down there,\" and demonstrated what she was required to do for the gynecological and rectal exam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Mann family filed suit against the County in April 2011, alleging violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against the social workers and the County, as well as asserting state law claims. The Manns contended that the County violated their Fourteenth Amendment rights and the children's Fourth Amendment rights by: (1) performing the medical examinations in the absence of exigency, valid parental consent, or court order specific to the child examined, and (2) failing to notify the parents of the examinations so that they may be present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While the Manns' case was pending before the district court, the County settled a second case with a different Southern California family, not party to this suit, who had also alleged that the County's practices of conducting the Polinsky medical examinations without parental notice and outside the presence of parents violated the Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swartwood v. Cty. of San Diego\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290908\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/84/1093/#p1098\">\n    84 F.Supp.3d 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1098-104 (S.D. Cal. 2014).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   To settle that lawsuit, the County proposed \"modifying its consent forms, including to provide notification to parents and guardians of their right to be present at the exams;\" \"modifying the Polinsky Children's Center's facilities and procedures to allow for parental presence at examinations upon request;\" and \"modifying the Agency's requests to the Juvenile Court for child-specific orders authorizing exams and treatment of children, if parents refuse to consent to the examinations.\"\n   <em>\n    Swartwood v. Cty. of San Diego\n   </em>\n   , No. CV 12-1665 W (BGSx), Petition For Approval of Minors' Interest in Settlement of Action, Dkt. No. 98-1, at 6-7. The County did not appeal the judgment in the\n   <em>\n    Swartwood\n   </em>\n   case, and the district court's final order approving the minor's compromise omitted these remedial measures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., Dkt. Nos. 100, 101, 103.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Notwithstanding the\n   <em>\n    Swartwood\n   </em>\n   court-approved settlement, the County contested\n   the Manns' claims. In November 2015, the district court granted in part the County's motion for summary judgment and granted in part the Manns' cross-motion for summary judgment. The district court determined that the County had a policy of barring parents from the Polinsky medical examinations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, although the district court concluded that the Fourteenth Amendment required the County to notify Mark and Melissa of the Polinsky medical examinations and to include them during the examinations, it also concluded that the County was not constitutionally obligated to obtain the parents' consent or a court order to conduct the examinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Manns and the County then settled most of their claims and dismissed all claims against the social workers. This settlement did not include the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim concerning the Polinsky medical examinations. The County timely appealed this claim, contending that the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments did not require it to provide advance notice to the parents. The Manns cross-appealed, arguing that the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments required not only advance notice to parents but also consent or a court order to conduct the examinations. Thus the issue before us is whether the County's practice of not notifying parents and not obtaining either parental consent or judicial authorization in advance of the Polinsky medical examinations violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Manns contend that the Polinsky medical examinations violate their privacy rights, which are protected as a matter of substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Mann children, through guardian ad litem Bruce Paul, assert that the Polinsky medical examinations violate their constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We first address the parents' Fourteenth Amendment claims and then turn to the children's Fourth Amendment claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We conclude that the County violates parents' Fourteenth Amendment substantive\n   due process rights when it performs the Polinsky medical examinations without notifying the parents about the examinations and without obtaining either the parents' consent or judicial authorization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wallis v.

In our 2000 decision in\n   <em>\n    Wallis\n   </em>\n   , we agreed with the Second Circuit that the\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Constitution assures parents that, in the absence of parental consent, [physical examinations] of their child may not be undertaken for investigative purposes at the behest of state officials unless a judicial officer has determined, upon notice to the parents, and an opportunity to be heard, that grounds for such an examination exist and that the administration of the procedure is reasonable under all the circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1733443\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/189/808/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    van Emrik v.

We held that \"[b]arring a reasonable concern that material physical evidence might dissipate ... or that some urgent medical problem exists requiring immediate medical attention, the state is required to notify parents and to obtain judicial approval before children are subjected to investigatory physical examinations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The County counters by attempting to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Wallis\n   </em>\n   on the ground that its holding applies only to investigatory medical examinations. The County claims that the Polinsky medical examinations are not investigatory. Rather, it argues, the examinations are conducted to assess the child's \"mental health\" and are conducted in a \"light, pleasant atmosphere.\" But, as the district court found, there is no dispute here that the Polinsky medical examinations are investigatory because the \"physician is looking for signs of physical and sexual abuse.\" Dr. Graff, who examined the Mann children and was the co-medical director of Polinsky, testified that she and her staff \"look closely for any evidence of physical abuse\" and document any evidence they find. The Polinsky medical examinations are not routine pediatric exams. Notably, the County exempts verbal children from the Polinsky medical examinations under certain circumstances because they can adequately describe potential abuse, irrespective of their immediate medical needs. That these examinations may serve dual purposes does not negate the investigatory character of the procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The County's attempts to parse a purely non-investigatory purpose out of the Polinsky medical examinations are not persuasive, especially because medical examinations of young children are particularly likely to have dual purposes as the \"investigation of [ ] abuse for child protection purposes may uncover evidence of a crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Greene v.

Because of these legal obligations, a child's medical examination may turn investigatory even if the examination does not begin as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We conclude that the same rules apply to purely investigatory examinations as to dual-purpose examinations, where one of the purposes is investigatory. Thus under\n   <em>\n    Wallis\n   </em>\n   , the County is required to notify the parents and obtain parental consent (or a court order) in advance of performing the Polinsky medical examinations, and permit parents to be present for these examinations because, while the examinations may have a health objective, they are also investigatory. Parental notice and consent is even more warranted when examinations have dual purposes than when the purpose is purely for health reasons. Ironically, the AAP guidelines that the County uses to justify its practices state that \"[w]hen appropriate and as a part of the care plan of the child welfare agency, birth parents should be encouraged to be present at health care visits and to participate in health care decisions.\" Am.

Here, had the County wished to notify Mark and Melissa of the examinations and obtain their consent, it could have easily done so when they appeared in juvenile court and signed the form that provided parental consent to future, medically necessary treatments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the County's consent form adopted in response to the\n   <em>\n    Swartwood\n   </em>\n   litigation provides parental notice, belying any suggestion that a notice process would be administratively infeasible. Should a parent refuse to consent, the County may obtain judicial authorization for the examination. Because judicial supervision is almost always required to take a child into protective custody, the County will invariably have a set time and place to request such judicial approval for the medical examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Nor is the requirement that the County provide parental notice and obtain consent inconsistent with the County's obligation to provide routine or emergency medical care to children in its custody, or with the 2003 juvenile court order that specifically authorized the medical examinations.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sangraal v.

To the contrary, the County's current policy is to obtain parental consent and provide advance notice to the parents so that they can be present at the examination. The County's involvement with the juvenile court system throughout the dependency process provides it with ready access to request a warrant from the juvenile court if necessary. And as recognized by the AAP, the Polinsky medical examination may even benefit from the involvement of the parents, who can identify vaccines, medications, allergies, and chronic diseases that the child may not be able to communicate on her own. There is no reason to think that parental notice and consent is \"impracticable\" in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Mann children's experience underscores our conclusion. Here, the County removed the children from the family home, and could have sought Mark and Melissa's consent at that time. When the children were subjected to the Polinsky medical examination the next day, Mark and Melissa were present in court, at which time the County also could have sought their consent.

The Manns were deprived of their right to raise their children without undue interference from the government, the right to make medical decisions for their children, and the right to privacy in their family life.
