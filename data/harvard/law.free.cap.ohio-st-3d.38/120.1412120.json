Yet, legal sanctions on corporate criminal activity are difficult to enforce because a corporation is but an intangible, ethereal being created by the state. Its actions affect employees, assets, the economy, and finally, society; yet, it remains, in Lord Thurlow\u2019s words, a being that \u201chas no soul to be damned, and no body to be kicked.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Deterring and punishing corporate criminal conduct thus has become a difficult and sometimes elusive quest.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-14\">One of the most controversial aspects of enterprise criminal liability concerns the problem of identifying who represents the corporation for purposes of indictment and prosecution. We address this question today in the setting of a discovery dispute between the state and the criminal defendant, CECOS International, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-15\">We begin by noting that the trial court\u2019s decision to disclose grand jury testimony may not be disturbed unless we find an abuse of discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Greer </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St. 2d 139, 20 O.O. 3d 157, 420 N.E. 2d 982, paragraph one of the syllabus. With this in mind, we now analyze the arguments posed by the state and defendant, as well as the applicable statutes and case precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b173-17\">Crim. R. 16(B)(1)(a) permits disclosure of statements made by a \u201cdefendant\u201d during grand jury proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A corporation operates through its employees, officers, and directors. Logic dictates that the employees whose criminal conduct may be imputed to the corporation constitute the corporate defendant. The gravamen of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>this appeal, therefore, rests in the question of whose criminal conduct may be imputed to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The criminal liability of an enterprise has evolved through three phases. The early common-law view was that a corporate body could not be criminally liable because it was incapable of forming the requisite criminal intent to commit a crime and could not be imprisoned.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the revised common-law view, criminal conduct of any employee acting on behalf of the corporation and within the scope of employment was generally imputed to the business entity upon the theory of vicarious liability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The modern trend limits the revised common law by imputing criminal liability to high managerial personnel only.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">CECOS suggests Ohio follows the revised common-law view while the prosecution suggests Ohio subscribes to the modern trend. This issue is addressed, in part, by the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">R.C. 2901.03(A) states, in pertinent part, that \u201c[n]o conduct constitutes a criminal offense against the state unless it is defined as an offense in the Revised Code.\u201d Thus, in Ohio, criminal liability is rigidly and precisely limited to those situations that the General Assembly has specifically delineated by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">In R.C. 2901.23, the General Assembly carefully identified which employees may create criminal liability for a business entity. R.C. 2901.23 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-12\">\u201c(A) An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the following circumstances: * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-15\">\u201c(4) If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded, tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting on behalf of the organization and within the scope of his office or employment. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-16\">Appellee suggests <em>any </em>employee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>criminal conduct may be imputed to the corporation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> CECOS correctly notes there is no Ohio case law on point that construes the statute. In support of its position, appellee cites cases from several federal courts that have determined a \u201ccorporation may be criminally bound by the acts of subordinate, even menial, employees.\u201d <em>Standard Oil Co. of Texas </em>v. <em>United States </em>(C.A. 5, 1962), 307 F. 2d 120, 127. See, also, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Illinois Central Railroad </em>(1938), 303 U.S. 239 (corporation subject to penalty liable for acts of manual laborers); <em>United States </em>v. <em>George F. Fish, Inc. </em>(C.A. 2, 1946), 154 F. 2d 798 (corporation may be criminally liable for acts of salesman); <em>Riss &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>United States </em>(C.A. 8, 1958), 262 F. 2d 245 (criminal conduct of clerical workers imputed to corporation).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Appellee relies primarily on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hughes </em>(C.A. 5, 1969), 413 F. 2d 1244. <em>Hughes </em>applies the reasoning of <em>Standard Oil </em>to a dispute under former Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(3). The court observed at 1252:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">\u201cThe significance of a witness\u2019 testimony to the inquiry into potential corporate criminal liability, and to the defense in preparing its case, does not depend upon organizational charts. * * * If the door to Rule 16(a)(3) is to be open to corporations at all \u2014 and we are of the opinion that it must \u2014 its availability should not be based upon corporate titles.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-7\"><em>Hughes </em>dealt with Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(3) prior to its amendment. The amended rule, Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a) (1)(A), effectively overruled <em>Hughes </em>by requiring that the employee have authority to \u201clegally * * * bind the defendant.\u201d Nevertheless, the assertion that organizational charts and titles should not determine potential criminal liability remains viable in many jurisdictions. It is not the only viable argument on this subject, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">The state submits the corporate defendant, for purposes of criminal liability, is composed of those employees with the assigned authority and function to act on behalf of the corporation with regard to the matter that gave rise to the criminal offense. In support of its argument, the state relies on a strict construction of R.C. 2901.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">Inherent in the state\u2019s argument is that R.C. 2901.23(A)(4) requires authorization by \u201ca <em>high managerial </em>officer, agent, or employee * * while subsection (A)(1), which refers to misdemeanors, permits authorization by <em>\u201can </em>officer, agent, or employee.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Conspicuously absent in the description of the (A)(1) class are the adjectives \u201chigh managerial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">The state submits the language in subsection (A)(4), therefore, should be construed to mean \u201chigh managerial officers, high managerial agents, or high managerial employees.\u201d Although the state concedes there is no Ohio precedent to support such a view, it suggests that any other construction would read the phrase \u201chigh managerial\u201d out of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">Accordingly, the state contends the high managerial personnel directly responsible for the proper disposal of waste at the site are the only employees whose criminal conduct may be imputed to the corporation. Those individuals constitute the \u201ccorporate defendant,\u201d and, consequently, only their grand jury testimony may be discovered and inspected by CECOS, pursuant to Crim. R. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Both arguments may be maintained from a public policy standpoint. Nevertheless, a reasonable and appropriate construction of R.C. 2901.23 indicates a business entity may be found guilty of a criminal offense only if the criminal act or omission was approved, recommended, or implemented by high managerial personnel with actual or implied authority to approve, recommend or implement same. High managerial personnel are those who make basic corporate policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Consequently, we hold a corporate employee\u2019s grand jury testimony is discoverable under Crim. R. 16(B)(1)(a) when the statement concerns an alleged criminal act or omission performed on behalf of the corporation and within the scope of employment. The declarant must hold sufficient authority to impute criminal culpability to the corporation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">As noted above, we cannot disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling releasing the grand jury testimony unless we find an abuse of discretion. In <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Waste Management, Inc. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St. 3d 91, 521 N.E. 2d 1091, we noted a mere analytical error does not constitute an abuse of discretion, but \u201cwhere the trial court completely misconstrues the letter and spirit of the law, it is clear that the court has been unreasonable and has abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99, 521 N.E. 2d at 1099, fn. 10. In the case before us, the trial court\u2019s analysis went beyond mere analytical error. Indeed, we believe the court misconstrued the letter and spirit of the law. Hence, we reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">CECOS next contends it is entitled to the grand jury testimony of its employees under the particularized-need standard of Crim. R. 6(E).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The standard for particularized need is met where the defendant\u2019s need for the information outweighs the need to maintain the secrecy of the grand jury proceedings. <em>Greer, supra. </em>CECOS argues the need for the testimony outweighs that for secrecy because the employees called as trial witnesses could be impeached with their grand jury testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">The state agrees that grand jury testimony may be released if the defendant can show particularized need. To satisfy the particularized-need standard, the prosecution claims CECOS must show that it can only receive a fair trial if specific grand jury testimony is disclosed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1976), 50 Ohio App. 2d 237, 247, 4 O.O. 3d 211, 217, 362 N.E. 2d 1003, 1010. However, appellant submits that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>this court rejected the notion that particularized need can be established on the basis of pretrial allegations of potentially inconsistent testimony in <em>State </em>v. <em>Laskey </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St. 2d 187, 50 O.O. 2d 432, 257 N.E. 2d 65, vacated in part on other grounds (1972), 408 U.S. 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">Case precedent clearly indicates appellant\u2019s view is correct. CECOS demands across-the-board disclosure of all grand jury testimony solely on the basis that some of its witnesses could be impeached by testimony given before the grand jury. In <em>Laskey, supra, </em>we held that the determination of prejudice \u201ccan be made only after the witness testified at trial, and, generally, cannot be used by an accused for ascertaining the evidence of the prosecution for the purpose of trial preparation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, 50 O.O. 2d at 434, 257 N.E. 2d at 68. In <em>Greer, supra, </em>we recognized that the determination of particularized need is made at trial and that the court, <em>in camera, </em>reviews the transcripts and discloses only those portions of testimony that are relevant. <em>Id. </em>at 150-151, 20 O.O. 3d at 164, 420 N.E. 2d at 989. In light of the case precedent noted above, we believe disclosure at this time would be premature.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The final question we must address is whether the trial court abused its discretion by ordering discovery of the grand jury testimony under Crim. R. 6(E). Since its ruling directly conflicts with case precedent, we hold the court\u2019s decision was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b177-11\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Douglas and H.
