The specific question presented is whether the State Employment Relations Board\u2019s dismissal of an unfair labor practice charge is a final order which may be appealed to the court of common pleas under R.C. 4117.13(D). This important question has never been addressed by this court. As a result of today\u2019s decision dismissing the instant appeal, trial courts and courts of appeals must continue to struggle with the issue without any guidance from this court, a situation which will inevitably cause confusion and conflict. Moreover, the parties to this appeal, having expended much time, energy and expense in pursuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>their cause in this court, are denied the definitive answer which they have every right to believe is forthcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\">I cannot concur in the majority\u2019s decision to squander this opportunity to formulate an authoritative rule on the important question presented by this case. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b445-5\">Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
