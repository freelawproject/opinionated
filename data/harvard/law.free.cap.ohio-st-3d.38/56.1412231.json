[The victim then described the defendant\u2019s ejaculation.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>The victim\u2019s mother testified to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\">\u201cQ. * * * Tell us \u2014 tell us about what Loreain says <em>[sic] </em>to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">\u201cA.

She said, \u2018my father did the nasty.\u2019 * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">\u201cWhen I got in the car, I said, Loreain, what did your father do to you. \u2018He took my panties off, and laid me on the bed, and did nasty things.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">The victim\u2019s mother further testified that for several nights after the incident, the child cried in her sleep, and later was unwilling to go to her father\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">Two pediatricians who examined the victim testified that the victim had a redness in her vaginal area. One of the doctors testified that the hymenal ring bordered on abnormal in diameter. However, neither physician could state with a reasonable degree of certainty that penetration had occurred on the date in question. The absence of such evidence, one physician observed, is common in sexual abuse cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">While the record could have been more explicit on the amount of force involved, in light of all the circumstances, <em>i.e., </em>the child\u2019s testimony, the child\u2019s tender age, and the relationship of parental authority that defendant had with his four-year-old daughter, we find substantial evidence from which the trial court could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Eskridge committed the act with force. \u201cThe force and violence necessary in rape is naturally a relative term, depending upon the age, size and strength of the parties and their relation to each other; as the relation between father and daughter under twelve years of age. With the filial obligation of obedience to the parent, the same degree of force and violence would not be required upon a person of such tender years, as would be required were the parties more nearly equal in age, size and strength.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Labus </em>(1921), 102 Ohio St. 26, 38-39, 130 N.E. 161, 164. In the present case, the victim testified that Eskridge removed her panties and there was testimony that he laid her on the bed \u2014 both acts of compulsion and constraint that are independent of the act of rape. The victim\u2019s testimony also expressed her revulsion at her father\u2019s conduct. Further, we note the age difference and disparity in size between Eskridge, a twenty-eight-year-old man, and the victim, a four-year-old child. A four-year-old child cannot consent to sexual conduct. The victim here did not and could not have participated in the sexual conduct of her own free will.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">Even the court of appeals admitted that force was involved. \u201c* * * We recognize that the rape of a four-year-old is inevitably forcible, and that Eskridge\u2019s conviction under R.C. 2907.02(A)(3) and 2907.02(B) carries with it, under these facts, an implicit finding of some degree of force. We further believe that, given the parent-child relationship, an unspoken threat of force similarly pervades this scenario.\u201d The court of appeals, however, went on to conclude that \u201cR.C. 2907.02(B) clearly requires an additional quantum of force or coercion.\u201d We do not read the statute as the court of appeals applied it. R.C. 2907.02(B) requires only that minimal force or threat of force be used in the commission of a rape. As noted above, Eskridge used at least minimal force in committing the rape against the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">We also recognize the coercion inherent in parental authority when a father sexually abuses his child. \u201c* * * Force need not be overt and physically brutal, but can be subtle and psycho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>logical. As long as it can be shown that the rape victim\u2019s will was overcome by fear or duress, the forcible element of rape can be established. <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1946), 77 Ohio App. 553 [33 O.O. 364]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolfenberger </em>(1958), 106 Ohio App. 322 [7 O.O. 2d 73]. In the within case, we are confronted with a child being told to do something by an important figure of authority, and commanded not to tell anyone about it. In such a case, we find nothing unreasonable about a finding that the child\u2019s will was overcome. Consequently, the forcible element of rape was properly established.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fowler </em>(1985), 27 Ohio App. 3d 149, 154, 27 OBR 182, 187, 500 N.E. 2d 390, 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">In <em>Fowler, </em>the defendant, the stepfather of the fourteen-year-old victim, challenged his conviction for rape by force or threat of force on the grounds, among several, that the use of force or threat of force had not been proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\u201c* * * Sexual activity between a parent and a minor child is not comparable to sexual activity between two adults with a history of consensual intercourse. The youth and vulnerability of children, coupled with the power inherent in a parent\u2019s position of authority, creates a unique situation of dominance and control in which explicit threats and displays of force are not necessary to effect the abuser\u2019s purpose.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Etheridge </em>(1987), 319 N.C. 34, 47, 352 S.E. 2d 673, 681. In the present case, Eskridge was the victim\u2019s father and, at the time of the rape, was babysitting her. He therefore held a position of authority over her which did not require any explicit threats or displays of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">A reviewing court will not reverse a conviction where there is substantial evidence upon which the court could reasonably conclude that all the elements of an offense have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Eley </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St. 2d 169, 10 O.O. 3d 340, 383 N.E. 2d 132, syllabus. Given the substantial evidence of force presented in this case, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate Eskridge\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b111-10\">Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H.
