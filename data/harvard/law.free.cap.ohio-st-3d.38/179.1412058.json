Allied Wheel Products, Inc., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1956), 166 Ohio St. 47, 1 O.O. 2d 190, 139 N.E. 2d 41. Where the record con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>tains some evidence to support the commission\u2019s findings, there has been no abuse of discretion and mandamus will not lie. <em>State, ex rel. Burley, </em>v. <em>Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E. 2d 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Relator-appellant contends that the reports of Drs. Fallon and Steiman were defective and did not constitute \u201csome evidence\u201d on which the commission could rely. Her contention is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In <em>State, ex rel. Ramirez, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 630, 23 O.O. 3d 518, 433 N.E. 2d 586, this court held that temporary total compensation may be terminated upon evidence that a claimant is capable of returning to his former position of employment. Appellant herein argues that because Dr. Steiman\u2019s report contained lifting restrictions inconsistent with her job duties, it cannot be considered \u201csome evidence\u201d of an ability to return to her former position of employment. This point is well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">In <em>State, ex rel. Horne, </em>v. <em>Great Lakes Constr. Co. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St. 3d 79, 80, 18 OBR 117, 118, 480 N.E. 2d 753, 754, \u201cformer position of employment\u201d was defined as \u201cthe position the claimant held when he was injured.\u201d Where restrictions preclude a claimant from returning to some aspect of his former job, that report cannot be relied on as \u201csome evidence\u201d indicative of the ability to return to the former position of employment. <em>State, ex rel. Evans, </em>v. <em>Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St. 3d 116, 22 OBR 196, 489 N.E. 2d 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Dr. Steiman\u2019s report, however, was not the sole evidence on which the commission relied. Dr. Fallon stated that appellant \u201c* * * would be capable of returning to her former work activities as there are no objective findings to indicate restrictions in regards to her returning to her former work activity.\u201d Appellant attacks Dr. Fallon\u2019s report on two grounds: (1) As a physical medicine specialist, Dr. Fallon was impliedly unqualified to evaluate appellant\u2019s head injury, and (2) he did not consider all allowed conditions. Neither point is well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">As to the former point, appellant fails to provide evidence supporting her medical competency argument. As to the latter point, her reliance on <em>State, ex rel. Anderson, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 166, 16 O.O. 3d 199, 404 N.E. 2d 153, is misplaced. <em>State, ex rel. Anderson, supra, </em>was overruled in <em>State, ex rel. Burley, supra, </em>in which we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">\u201cThe commission alone shall be responsible for the evaluation of the weight and credibility of the evidence before it. This court\u2019s role in the review of mandamus actions challenging the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision as to the extent of disability in cases involving multiple allowed conditions shall henceforth be limited to a determination as to whether there is some evidence in the record to support the commission\u2019s stated basis for its decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20-21, 31 OBR at 72, 508 N.E. 2d at 938.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">In the present case, the commission did have \u201csome evidence\u201d before it \u2014 Dr. Fallon\u2019s report \u2014 to support a finding that appellant was capable of returning to her former position of employment and, hence, ineligible for further temporary total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the commission\u2019s order did not comply with <em>State, ex rel. Mitchell, </em>v. <em>Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 481, 6 OBR 531, 453 N.E. 2d 721, is not well-taken as the order specifically indicated that it was based on the reports of Drs. Steiman and Fallon. Pursuant to <em>State, ex rel. Hutt, </em>v. <em>Frick-Gallagher Mfg. Co. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St. 3d 184, 11 OBR 497, 464 N.E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>2d 1005, such specificity satisfies <em>Mitchell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">The judgment of the court of appeals denying the writ is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b233-6\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b233-7\">Locher, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
