Jacobs pleaded guilty to willfully failing to pay child support, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 228(a)(3). The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> declined to impose a split sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Cl.l(d)(2), sentenced Jacobs to 11 months imprisonment and 1 year supervised release, and ordered restitution of $67,979.39. On appeal, Jacobs\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw, and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), suggesting that the district court abused its discretion in not granting Jacobs a split sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">We find that the district court understood its authority to impose a split sentence, and thus its discretionary decision not to do so is unreviewable. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a); <em>United States v. Smotherman, </em>326 F.3d 988, 989 (8th Cir.) (per curiam) (appellate court lacks jurisdiction to review district court's exercise of discretion in setting sentence within properly determined Guidelines range), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 293, 157 L.Ed.2d 203 (2003); <em>United States v. Garcia-Ortiz, </em>310 F.3d 792, 793-94 (5th Cir.2002) (district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to impose split sentence under \u00a7 5Cl.l(d) does not fall within criteria listed in \u00a7 3742(a)). We also have carefully reviewed the record in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and have found no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-15\">Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-12\">. The Honorable Linda R. Reade, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
