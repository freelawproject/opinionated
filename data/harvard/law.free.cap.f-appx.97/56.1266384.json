The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reduced Clark\u2019s offense level by 2 levels for acceptance of responsibility, but denied an additional 1 -level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) because his notice of intent to plead guilty was untimely. The court sentenced him to 140 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release, and stated it would have imposed the same sentence if it had granted the additional reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-23\">Clark now argues that he qualified for the additional 1-level reduction, but we conclude that this issue is unreviewable. <em>See United States v. </em>Simpkins, 953 F.2d 443, 446 (8th Cir.) (where sentence imposed falls within Guidelines range urged by appellant and it is clear sentencing court would have imposed same sentence regardless whether appellant\u2019s argument for lower Guidelines range ultimately prevailed, matter is not reviewable), <em>cert. denied, </em>504 U.S. 928, 112 S.Ct. 1988, 118 L.Ed.2d 585 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-24\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-20\">.
