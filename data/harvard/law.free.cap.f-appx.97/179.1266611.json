We have held that the BIA can adopt the IJ\u2019s decision as its own. <em>Alaelua v. INS, </em>45 F.3d 1379, 1382 (9th Cir. 1995). The BIA did not abuse its discretion or violate due process by issuing an opinion that expresses agreement with the IJ\u2019s conclusions and reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Karkoond also asserts that the IJ abused her discretion in denying his motion to reopen when she found that his older brother\u2019s failure to maintain contact with Karkoond\u2019s attorney did not constitute \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d meriting the reopening of his case under Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) \u00a7 240(b)(5)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). The INA defines \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d as \u201cexceptional circumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e). Karkoond has not shown that his nonappearance at his removal hearing was due to circumstances beyond any control he might have exercised in the situation. Karkoond has not demonstrated that he exercised minimal diligence with regard to keeping track of his immigration proceedings. <em>See, e.g., In re J-P, </em>22 I &amp; N Dec. 33, 36 (BIA 1998) (lack of diligence in attempting to avoid an in absentia deportation order is \u201ca factor that undercuts\u201d alien\u2019s claim of exceptional circumstances). The IJ did not therefore abuse her discretion in denying Karkoond\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b213-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
