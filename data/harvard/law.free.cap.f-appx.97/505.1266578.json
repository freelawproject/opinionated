California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Ramirez has responded to counsel\u2019s motion and brief, asking the court to consider the issue raised by counsel, challenging the prior deportation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>upon which his 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 conviction is based, challenging the district court\u2019s use of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) in calculating his sentence, and arguing that he had ineffective assistance of counsel. Ramirez\u2019 ineffective assistance of counsel claim is not cognizable on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Brewster, </em>137 F.3d 853, 859 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and the issues raised by-Ramirez discloses no nonfrivolous appellate issue. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b539-10\">Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
