We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-18\">D.C. contends that her child, S.K., is eligible for special education services under the Hawaii Administrative Rules implementing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1411 <em>et seq. </em>The Department of Education of the State of Hawaii (\u201cDOE\u201d) has not yet made an initial determination regarding S.K\u2019s eligibility. The record indicates that the DOE has never been asked to make a determination regarding S.K\u2019s eligibility. However, the DOE has an independent obligation to \u201c[ijdentify all students with a disability residing in the State ... who are in need of special education and related services.\u201d Haw. Admin. Rules \u00a7 8-56-4(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-19\">On February 6, 2003, D.C. filed a request for a hearing before an impartial hearing officer regarding S.K.\u2019s eligibility for services. A hearing before an impartial hearing officer was scheduled for April 7, 2003. Before the hearing, D.C. moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>for a declaratory ruling that the hearing officer was authorized to make an initial determination regarding S.K.\u2019s eligibility for special education services. The hearing officer denied D.C.\u2019s motion on March 28, 2003, noting, \u201cIt is not disputed that in this matter, a \u2018team of qualified professionals [from the school district] and the parent of the student\u2019 have not yet made a determination of eligibility in accordance with Hawaii Administrative Rules (\u2018HAR\u2019) \u00a7 8-5610(a).\u201d The hearing officer\u2019s order indicated that \u201cappropriate remedies will be ordered\u201d after the scheduled hearing on April 7, 2003 should the hearing officer determine that the DOE had a duty to assess S.K.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Rather than waiting for the April 7, 2003 hearing, D.C. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii on April 3, 2003 pursuant to the IDEA and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. D.C. sought declaratory and injunctive relief ordering the hearing officer to make the initial determination regarding S.K\u2019s eligibility for special education services.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">We review de novo a dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the IDEA. <em>Doe v. Arizona Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>111 F.3d 678, 681 (9th Cir.1997). \u201cJudicial review under the IDEA is ordinarily available only after the plaintiff exhausts administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 680-81. The exhaustion requirement \u201callows for the exercise of discretion and educational expertise by state and local agencies, affords full exploration of technical educational issues, furthers development of a complete factual record, and promotes judicial efficiency by giving these agencies the first opportunity to correct shortcomings in their educational programs for disabled children.\u201d <em>Hoeft v. Tucson Unified Sch. Dist., </em>967 F.2d 1298, 1303 (9th Cir.1992). D.C. filed her federal complaint at the commencement of the state administrative process, four days before the scheduled hearing before an impartial hearing officer. She has thus failed to satisfy the exhaustion requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Exhaustion is not required, however, \u201cif it would be futile or offer inadequate relief, or if the agency has adopted a policy or pursued a practice of general applicability that is contrary to the law.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>111 F.3d at 681 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). The party alleging an exception to the exhaustion requirement bears the burden of proof. <em>Id. </em>D.C. cannot show that exhaustion would be futile or offer inadequate relief. The hearing officer indicated that she would order \u201cappropriate remedies\u201d if she determined at the April 7, 2003 hearing that the DOE improperly refused to assess S.K. D.C. has also failed to identify \u201csystemic\u201d or \u201cstructural\u201d flaws in the administrative process that create a potential exception to the exhaustion requirement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">D.C.\u2019s reliance on <em>Hacienda La Puente Unified Sch. Dist. v. Honig, </em>976 F.2d 487 (9th Cir.1992) in support of her argument that the hearing officer\u2019s preliminary decision was facially invalid is also misplaced. In <em>Hacienda, </em>a California special education hearing officer determined that a child required special education services and that the school district had wrongly denied him protection under the IDEA. The school district challenged the hearing officer\u2019s determination in federal court. We affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the school district\u2019s complaint. Unlike the present case, however, the child\u2019s mother had requested a school evaluation for special education services and requested an administrative hearing <em>after </em>the school tested the child and concluded that he did not qualify for special education. <em>Id. </em>at 489. <em>Hacienda </em>supports the position that D.C. should first be required to exhaust administrative</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>remedies before bringing a federal complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">D.C.\u2019s remaining argument that the district court erred by considering evidence outside the pleadings in support of the motion to dismiss is without merit. Nothing in the district court\u2019s order relied on any potentially disputed or unsupported facts. As a matter of law, the district court properly dismissed D.C.\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b771-20\"> phjg disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
