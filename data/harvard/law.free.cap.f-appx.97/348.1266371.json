The Honorable Sidney H. Stein of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b383-5\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, it is HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the district court\u2019s judgment entered on October 21, 2002, is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Defendant-Appellant David Brown, who pleaded guilty on March 20, 2002, to attempted reentry into the United States after deportation following conviction for an aggravated felony, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826(a), (b)(2), now appeals from that part of his judgment of conviction sentencing him to 77 months\u2019 incarceration. Specifically, Brown challenges a sixteen-level enhancement applied to the calculation of his Sentencing Guideline range pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). We assume familiarity with the facts relevant to the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 provides that a defendant convicted of unlawful reentry after deportation for an aggravated felony shall receive a sixteen-point enhancement to his base offense level if he was previously convicted of \u201ca felony that is ... a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Application Note 1 to this guideline defines \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d to include \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the ... distribution ... of a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to ... distribute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, Application Note l(B)(iv). Here, the district court imposed the challenged enhancement based upon Brown\u2019s September 10, 1993 New York State conviction for Criminal Possession of a Controlled Substance in the Third Degree, <em>see </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.16, an offense for which Brown was sentenced to one-to-three years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">Brown concedes his \u00a7 220.16 conviction and receipt of a sentence exceeding 13 months. He asserts, however, that because the evidence before the district court did not specify the subsection of \u00a7 220.16 under which he was convicted, and because intent to distribute is not an element of every subsection of \u00a7 220.16, <em>see generally United States v. Ramirez, </em>344 F.3d 247, 253-54 (2d Cir.2003), the district court erred in concluding that his \u00a7 220.16 conviction was a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d Rather, Brown submits, the court should have concluded that his prior conviction was merely for simple possession, an aggravated felony for which he would have received only an eight-level enhancement. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">An addendum to the presentence report, which was presented to the district court, verifies that the New York State indictment underlying Brown\u2019s September 10, 1993 conviction charged Brown with violating \u00a7 220.16 by \u201cknowingly and unlawfully possess[ing] a narcotic drug, to wit, cocaine, with intent to sell the same.\u201d Although Brown complains that no copy of this indictment was actually put before the district court, it does not appear that Brown raised any challenge to the accuracy of this information in the district court. Given that Brown admits to having pleaded guilty to -violating \u00a7 220.16, and that the only \u00a7 220.16 charge in the indictment involved an intent to distribute, the district court did not err in concluding that Brown\u2019s prior conviction was a \u201cdrug traf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>licking offense.\u201d <em>See United States v. King, </em>325 F.3d 110, 114 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that Brown properly received the 16-point enhancement to his guideline calculation and hereby AFFIRM the judgment of conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
