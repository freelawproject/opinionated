Palmer appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Postmaster General in this employment discrimination suit. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-21\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b557-22\">Palmer was a mail carrier who worked in the United States Postal Service\u2019s (USPS\u2019s) Okolona branch in Louisville, Kentucky. In 2000, he contacted Susan Arnold, the Okolona Station Manager, and demanded that she investigate an office rumor that he had received oral sex from Deborah Todorich in the post office parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-23\">Arnold confronted Todorich, who denied the specific rumor. She admitted, however, that she and Palmer had engaged in other sexual relations at different times, including having sex in Palmer\u2019s mail truck, at the union hall, and at his home and an apartment while out on their routes. She detailed an extended affair which, according to Todorich, she had attempted to end on several occasions. She alleged that Palmer would not let her end the affair, continuing to pressure her to have sex. She claimed that Palmer threat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>ened that, among other things, he would tell her husband of their relations and use his substantial union influence to have her demoted from \u201ctransitional\u201d to \u201ccasual\u201d employee. Todorich later submitted a detailed statement to Arnold outlining the chronology of her relationship with Palmer. She also supplied other evidence to substantiate her claims, including a copy of her cell phone, pager, and telephone bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Arnold next confronted Palmer, who denied everything. He later submitted a statement painting Todorich as the harasser and said that he had taken an interest in her but only because he pitied her and, as a union steward, wanted to help.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">An internal investigation into Todorich\u2019s claim of sexual harassment was thereafter initiated. The investigation culminated in a report by Postmaster Robert Lochhead outlining the evidence against Palmer and formally charging him with improper conduct. Thereafter Palmer was given an opportunity to challenge the Postmaster\u2019s report. Palmer stuck with his categorical denial, continuing to assert that his relationship with Todorich had been purely professional. In March 2001 the Postmaster issued a <em>Letter of Decision </em>\u2014 Removal, informing Palmer that he would be discharged effective April 2, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Todorich too was fired. Both she and Palmer grieved their removals. Todorich reached a settlement whereby she admitted guilt but accepted reinstatement without backpay. No settlement was reached in Palmer\u2019s case, however, and it proceeded to arbitration. The arbitrator ruled that Palmer was guilty of improper conduct but that there was insufficient proof to sustain a sexual harassment allegation. He therefore reinstated Palmer to a different branch of the post office.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Palmer subsequently brought this action against the USPS for gender discrimination under Title VII and retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. See, e.g., Smith v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>167 F.3d 286, 289 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">Palmer\u2019s Title VII claim must fail because Palmer and Todorich were not \u201csimilarly situated\u201d and because, even assuming that Palmer could establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination, he has submitted no evidence tending to prove that the USPS\u2019s proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for firing him was pretextual.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-14\"><em>1. Palmer and Todorich were not \u201cSimilarly </em>Situated\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-15\">The fourth element of Palmer\u2019s prima facie case requires that he show that he \u201cwas treated differently from similarly situated members of the unprotected class.\u201d <em>Gettings v. Bldg. Laborers Local 310 Fringe Benefits Fund, </em>349 F.3d 300, 306 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-16\">[T]o be deemed \u201csimilarly-situated\u201d in the disciplinary context, \u201cthe individuals with whom the plaintiff seeks to compare his/her treatment must have dealt with the same supervisor, have been subject to the same standards and have engaged in the same conduct without such differentiating or mitigating cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>cumstances that would distinguish their conduct or the employer\u2019s treatment of them for it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-5\"><em>Ercegovich v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>154 F.3d 344, 352 (6th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Mitchell v. Toledo Hosp., </em>964 F.2d 577, 583 (6th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Palmer and Todorich were not \u201csimilarly situated\u201d for two reasons. First, and most fundamentally, the conduct for which they were disciplined was not comparable. While both were found to have engaged in improper conduct, only Palmer was accused of sexual harassment. Such a qualitative difference in conduct renders futile any attempt to satisfy the \u201csimilarly situated\u201d element.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, Palmer\u2019s status as a thirty-year postal veteran wielding substantial union influence was very different from Todorich\u2019s status as a relative rookie recently promoted from \u201ccasual\u201d to \u201ctransitional\u201d worker. An employer is justified in disciplining offenders such as Palmer\u2014 veterans who hold elevated positions\u2014 more harshly than their junior colleagues. <em>See Pierce v. Commonwealth Life Ins. Co., </em>40 F.3d 796, 802 (6th Cir.1994) (rejecting the plaintiff\u2019s reverse gender-discrimination claim on the ground that he could not satisfy the \u201csimilarly situated\u201d element of his prima facie case in part because, unlike the female to whom he sought comparison, he \u201cwas a member of management\u201d and \u201chad authority over three offices and several subordinates\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">\n<em>2. Failure to Show Pretext</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AzI\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Palmer could establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination, his Title VII claim would still fail because he has not shown that the USPS\u2019s proffered legitimate, non-diseriminatory reason for firing him was pretextual. The so-called \u201chonest belief\u2019 rule stands in his way.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">[In arguing pretext,] the plaintiff must allege more than a dispute over the facts upon which his discharge was based. He must put forth evidence which demonstrates that the employer did not \u201chonestly believe\u201d in the proffered nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse employment action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">In order to determine whether the defendant had an \u201chonest belief\u2019 in the proffered basis for the adverse employment action, this Court looks to whether the employer can establish its \u201creasonable reliance\u201d on the particularized facts that were before it at the time the decision was made....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-11\">If there is no material dispute that the employer made a \u201creasonably informed and considered decision\u201d that demonstrates an \u201chonest belief\u2019 in the proffered reason for the adverse employment action, the case should be dismissed ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-12\"><em>Braithwaite v. Timken Co., </em>258 F.3d 488, 493-94 (6th Cir.2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Pa\u00edmer has put forth no evidence that would suggest that the USPS did not \u201chonestly believe\u201d that he had engaged in improper conduct with and sexually harassed Todorich.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, his voluminous submissions attempt to prove that he did not in fact harass her and that she is an incredible witness. As <em>Braithwaite </em>makes clear, this does not suffice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-7\">. This is an \u201cindirect evidence\u201d case, in which \"[t]he analytical framework ... is well-established. First, the plaintiff must set forth a <em>prima facie </em>case, which gives rise to an inference of discrimination.\u201d <em>Sutherland v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>344 F.3d 603, 614 (6th Cir.2003). \"Once the plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case, the burden shifts to the defendant to offer a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action at issue. If the defendant meets this burden, then the burden of production shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the proffered reason is a pretext.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614-15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b559-7\">. <em>See, e.g., Clayton v. Meijer, Inc., </em>281 F.3d 605, 612 (6th. Cir.2002) (finding the \"similarly situated\u201d element not satisfied where \"[the plaintiff's] infraction was qualitatively more serious\u201d than the co-workers to which he compared himself, and noting that an \"employer\u2019s more severe treatment of more egregious circumstances simply cannot give rise to an inference which would support the establishment of a prima facie case of discrimination\u201d); <em>Majewski v. Automatic Data Processing, Inc., </em>274 F.3d 1106, 1116 (6th Cir.2001) (holding that the plaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie case where she had \u201cproduced no evidence showing that [the other] employees were similarly situated with respect to the severity and frequency of their performance errors\u201d); <em>Gray v. Toshiba Am. Consumer Prods., Inc., </em>263 F.3d 595, 601 (6th Cir.2001) (noting that \"the employees [the plaintiff] seeks to cast as similarly situated differ[ed] from her in several important ways,\u201d not the least of which was that \"the male employees\u2019 conduct was different\u201d); <em>Braithwaite v. Timken Co., </em>258 F.3d 488, 497 (6th Cir.2001) (finding that the \"similarly situated\u201d element was not satisfied where the plaintiff broke a more serious company rule).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b560-14\">. Palmer notes the United States Postal Inspection Service\u2019s Report of December 2000, which concluded that \"if a relationship between Mr. Palmer and Ms. Todorich existed, it was a[sic] voluntary and any sexual activity was consensual.\u201d But this report was only part of an \"initial investigation,\u201d was not binding on the USPS, and was based only on the interviews of Palmer, Todorich and the Whispering Hill Apartments assistant manager. In any event, at best the report is evidence supporting Palmer\u2019s contention that he never had a relationship with Todorich; it is <em>not </em>evidence of pretext.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b560-25\">. There is ample support for the USPS's conclusion that Palmer sexually harassed Todorich. Among the most damaging evidence against him was a sexually-explicit and profane telephone message he left for her.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
