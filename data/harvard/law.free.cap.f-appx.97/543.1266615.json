She argues that the district court erred in re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>fusing to reduce her base offense level for her \u201cminor\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d role in the conspiracy. Because the district court applied the wrong legal standard and left pertinent factual matters unresolved, we vacate the sentence and remand so that the district court may make any necessary factual determinations in view of the correct legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">In October 2002, Kelso and three co-defendants-Edward and Wanda Vaughan (Kelso\u2019s parents) and Terry Vaughan (Kelso\u2019s brother)-each pleaded guilty of conspiring to engage in a variety of fraudulent activities. The conspiracy involved RaleyVaughan Motor Company, an automobile dealership owned and operated by Edward and Wanda Vaughan. Terry Vaughan was the dealership\u2019s vice president, and Kelso was an employee who performed accounting, sales and other duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">One prong of the conspiracy involved a scheme to defraud General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) by fraudulently manipulating the \u201cfloor plan\u201d financing arrangement that Raley-Vaughan had with GMAC. The defendants sold vehicles that they held in trust for GMAC. then concealed the sales in order to avoid or delay paying GMAC. To conceal the sales, the defendants arranged to have previously sold cars returned to the dealership during GMAC audits, delayed registering vehicles and created false bills of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">A second prong of the conspiracy involved a \u201cloan kite\u201d-obtaining false loans and using the proceeds to pay off earlier false loans before their falsity was discovered. To conceal the fraud from the lenders, the conspirators made monthly payments on the loans until some event forced them to pay off the loans (usually a demand by a lender for a certificate of title to the vehicle purportedly securing the loan). The false loans charged in the indictment involved 12 customers and 26 loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">A third prong of the conspiracy involved a traditional \u201ccheck kite\u201d-artificially and fraudulently inflating the numerical balances in checking accounts by drawing upon one account with insufficient legitimate funds to give the appearance of funding another account with insufficient legitimate funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">After the defendants pleaded guilty, the probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report for each of them. Kelso\u2019s report deta\u00f1ed several dozen overt acts committed by the defendants in furtherance of the conspiracy, but specified Kelso (as opposed to the other parties) as the party taking the action in only a few instances. The Government pointed to four specific acts: (1) in July 1996, Kelso \u201chelped her mother make a payment on a fraudulently obtained loan\u201d in a false name to deceive First Union National Bank as to the true nature of the loan: (2) in January 1997, Kelso \u201ccaused-to be made\u201d another payment in a false name on a fraudulently obtained loan: (3) Kelso \u201chelped prepare title documents\u201d to conceal a false loan in the name of Katherine K\u00fclian: and (4) Kelso \u201chelped prepare ... checks\u201d for payments to conceal the fraudulent nature of a loan obtained in the name of Brian Gflkey. Gov\u2019t Br. at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">In calculating Kelso\u2019s sentence, the report held Kelso responsible for the entire amount of losses caused by the conspiraey-$1.026,017.18. That amount was significant because, under the Guidelines, a defendant\u2019s offense level must be increased by 16 levels if the loss exceeded $1,000,000 (as opposed to, say. 10 levels for losses that exceeded $120,000). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l). The report included no reduction for Kelso\u2019s role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Kelso objected to both of these determinations. First, she claimed that she should not be held responsible for the entire amount of losses caused by the conspiracy, though she offered no specifics on that point. Second, she claimed that she was entitled to an adjustment based on her limited role in the conspiracy, asserting that: (1) she \u201cwas not an owner or officer in the Raley-Vaughan Motor Company\u201d; (2) \u201c[s]he did not initiate any of the various schemes alleged in the indictment\u201d; (3) she did not \u201csign loan documents or checks [or] ... have authority to do so\u201d; (4) she committed only \u201cminor or minimal\u201d acts in furtherance of the conspiracy as \u201ccompared to the size of the conspiracy and the acts of the other conspirators\u201d; (5) she acted only \u201cat the direction of ... the other co-conspirators\u201d; and (6) \u201cshe would have derived no financial benefit from [the conspiracy\u2019s] success\u201d had it succeeded. JA 180-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The Government responded to Kelso\u2019s (and her co-conspirators\u2019) objections, defending the report\u2019s calculation of the total loss and arguing that Kelso was not a \u201cminor participant.\u201d In particular, the Government argued that Kelso was not a minor participant because she and her co-defendants \u201ctold the probation officer that no one family member was an organizer or leader in the criminal conduct; rather, they stated they were all involved in the conduct.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. at 7-8. The Government also moved for a downward departure for Kelso and her parents because they had cooperated in the case against Terry Vaughan.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The district court issued a written order granting the Government\u2019s downward-departure motion for the three cooperating defendants but overruling all of the defendants\u2019 objections. The court gave no reason for overruling Kelso\u2019s objection to holding her accountable for the entire loss caused by the conspiracy. As for whether Kelso deserved a \u201cminor participant\u201d reduction, the following was the entirety of the court\u2019s determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">[Kelso] contends that she should receive a reduction in her offense level as a \u201cminor participant.\u201d However Ms. Kelso is reported to have told the probation officer that no one family member was an organizer or leader of the criminal conduct-they all were involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">JA 194-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Kelso then notified the court that she wished to offer evidence at her sentencing hearing to support her claim that she was a \u201cminor participant.\u201d The court granted the request, and an evidentiary hearing was held.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">Four witnesses testified at the hearing: Terry Vaughan. Edward Vaughan, Kelso and the probation officer. Terry testified that he and his parents were responsible for making all of the financial decisions that led to the indictment, that Kelso never made any decisions, that the three did not actively involve Kelso in making decisions, that Kelso was not in a position to question the decisions that were made and that Kelso played \u201ca support role at best.\u201d JA 214-15. Indeed, Terry testified that Kelso (unlike the others) never borrowed money or met with anyone about securing credit, lacked authority to act on behalf of Raley-Vaughan, and committed no acts in furtherance of the conspiracy that were not at the direction of the other three and that could not have been performed by any number of others. JA 215-16. Edward and then Kelso herself testified to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">Testifying on the Government\u2019s behalf, the probation officer recalled that in her separate interviews with the four conspirators, \u201c[t]hey basically stated that each one of them [was] part of the operation; that it was a very close family operation; [and] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>that each individual did whatever it took to keep the business going from day to day.\u201d JA 245. Her \u201cperception\u201d was \u201cthat they were all equal roles.\u201d JA 246. She also testified that none of the four defendants indicated to her in the interviews that they were directed by others or that they directed others. JA 246. Lastly, on cross-examination, the probation officer testified that she uncovered no other overt\u2019 acts attributable to Kelso other than the few discussed in her report. JA 248-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The court\u2019s ruling immediately followed. In its entirety, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">Okay. All right. I guess the first thing, all the objections that you all have made have been-were overruled by us, and by me; and Ms. Vaughan [Kelso], we\u2019ve given you another opportunity because you wanted it, and I\u2019m going to adhere to the same thing I decided before that was overruled, that you asked to be overruled, and I don\u2019t think it needs to be overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">JA 249. The court then imposed a sentence of 22 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered Kelso to pay restitution of $570,225.22. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s base offense level by four points if the defendant was merely a \u201cminimal participant,\u201d two points if the defendant was a \u201cminor participant,\u201d and three points if the defendant\u2019s participation falls somewhere between \u201cminimal\u201d and \u201cminor.\u201d To qualify for any reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2-whether on the basis of a \u201cminimal\u201d role, a \u201cminor\u201d role or something in between-a defendant must be both \u201c \u2018less culpable than most other participants\u2019 <em>and </em>\u2018substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>279 F.3d 392, 396 (6th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Lloyd, </em>10 F.3d 1197, 1220 (6th Cir. 1993)). The comment to this Guideline defines a \u201cminimal participant\u201d as someone who is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group,\u201d such as someone who \u201clack[s] knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise and of the activities of others.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 4. A \u201cminor participant,\u201d in partial contrast, is someone who \u201cis less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">In determining whether a defendant\u2019s role was \u201cminimal,\u201d \u201cminor,\u201d or something more, a court must examine \u201cthe role the defendant played in relation to the activity for which the court held him or her accountable.\u201d <em>United States v. Roper, </em>135 F.3d 430, 434 (6th Cir.1998). In other words, if a sentencing court holds a defendant accountable for less than the overall conspiracy in determining the defendant\u2019s base offense level, the court may not consider the defendant\u2019s role relative to the overall conspiracy for purposes of \u00a7 3B1.2, only her role relative to the activity for which she is held accountable. <em>See id.; United States v. Roberts, </em>223 F.3d 377, 380 (6th Cir.2000). Conversely, a court that holds a defendant accountable for a larger conspiracy (as the district court did here) should consider the defendant\u2019s role relative to the larger conspiracy for purposes of \u00a7 3B1.2. Kelso bore the burden of proving her entitlement to a reduction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">In measuring the district court\u2019s determination against these criteria, it is first appropriate to identify precisely what that determination was. After allowing Kelso to introduce evidence, the court overruled \u201call [of] the objections\u201d that she made and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>\u201cadhere[d] to\u201d its earlier decision. In issuing a blanket rejection of \u201call the objections,\u201d the court made no factual determinations and offered no explanation of its reasoning, which leaves us with the order that the court issued before hearing the evidence. We can only assume that, by \u201cadher[ing]\u201d to its earlier decision, the court was overruling Kelso\u2019s minor-participant objection for the reason stated in that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The earlier order, however, contains a significant legal flaw. In rejecting Kelso\u2019s motion for a reduction based on her role in the conspiracy, the court said that Kelso \u201cis reported to have told the probation officer that no one family member was an organizer or leader of the criminal conduct\u201d and said that \u201cthey all were involved.\u201d This analysis applies the wrong legal test. Assume, for the sake of argument, that Kelso had a conspicuously modest involvement in the conspiracy. Assume that the other three conspirators, though conspicuously involved in the conspiracy, were each equally involved. Even though in this hypothetical Kelso would be \u201cless culpable than most other participants\u201d and \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant,\u201d the district court\u2019s rule would deny her relief because (1) she was involved (she was convicted, so she had to have been involved) and (2) there was no one member of the conspiracy that was the organizer or leader. Such a rule is inconsistent with the Guideline and this Court\u2019s precedent, and indeed incorrectly suggests that in order for one participant in a conspiracy to receive a reduction for a minimal or minor role, another participant in the conspiracy must be eligible for an enhancement for a leadership role. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2; <em>Campbell, </em>279 F.3d at 396 (a defendant must be \u201cless culpable than most other participants\u201d and \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant\u201d to qualify for a \u201cminor participant\u201d adjustment) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Since the evidence before the district court may support a role reduction for Kelso and since the district court applied the wrong test and made no relevant factual findings, the district court should determine in the first instance whether Kelso was a minor or minimal participant. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CrimJP. 32(i)(3)(B) (\u201cAt sentencing, the court ... must-for any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter-rule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing.\u201d); <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>356 F.3d 719, 722 (6th Cir.2004) (Rule 32(i)(3)(B) \u201censure[s] that sentencing is based on reliable facts found by the court itself after deliberation, and thus, the district court cannot summarily adopt the factual findings in the presentence report or simply declare that the facts are supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate Kelso\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
