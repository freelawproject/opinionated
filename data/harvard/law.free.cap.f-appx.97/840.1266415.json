R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-17\">Defendant-Appellant Oswaldo Ramirez Barron pleaded guilty to one count of possessing with intent to distribute more than fifty grams of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(l)(A)(viii). Mr. Barron contends that the District Court erred in failing to grant him a downward adjustment due to his minor role in the overall drug trafficking endeavor. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3B1.2 (2002) (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d). We take jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b875-19\">In March 2001, Mr. Barron left Calexico, California for Atlanta, Georgia in a tractor-trailer, acting as translator for the driver, Mr. Lobatos. The truck contained 123.2 kilograms of cocaine and 2.431 kilograms of methamphetamine. Mr. Sierra, the presumed ring-leader of the operation, followed the truck in a separate car. Along the way, they entered the New Mexico Port of Entry in Gallup, New Mexico. Anticipating that law enforcement officers would discover the drugs, Mr. Barron fled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>on foot. Subsequently, the officers arrested Mr. Lobatos. Mr. Barron was arrested a day later. Apparently, Mr. Sierra remains at large and has not been charged regarding this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Mr. Barron pleaded guilty to possessing methamphetamine with intent to distribute, in exchange for the dropping of all other charges against him. Although Mr. Lobatos received a minor-participant reduction, the presentencing report (\u201cPSR\u201d) did not recommend granting Mr. Barron a similar reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. Mr. Barron\u2019s PSR justified this differential treatment because he \u201cmade the arrangements to transport drugs from Calexico, California to Atlanta, Georgia,\u201d while Mr. Lobatos did not \u201cdirect! ] any other participants.\u201d Mr. Barron filed an objection to the PSR, which the district court overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Defense counsel presented the thrust of this objection during the sentencing hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-6\">[Wje\u2019re contending that [Mr. Barron] was a minor participant.... There was another individual, ... Jose Luis Sierra, who is actually the overseer, or sort of the foreman ... of this particular trip---- It\u2019s our contention that [Mr. Barron] was working at the order of Mr. Jose Luis Sierra.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">Mr. Barron attempted to make this argument by proffer. The District Court, in rejecting this attempt, noted: \u201cThis is too important. I don\u2019t want your proffer, and I won\u2019t accept that, and I don\u2019t have reports to the effect of what you\u2019re saying. So if you want to put [Mr. Barron] on the stand, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Mr. Barron proceeded to testify that he was working under the direction of Mr. Sierra. Mr. Barron\u2019s testimony was the only evidence submitted of his minor role. The District Court discounted this testimony, stating: \u201cI do not find your testimony truthful.\u201d Instead, the District Court credited the facts as stated in the PSR as accurate. Mr. Barron filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">On sentencing appeals, we review the sentencing court\u2019s factual findings \u201cfor clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Shumway, </em>112 F.3d 1413, 1426 (10th Cir.1997). We interpret the Sentencing Guidelines \u201cas if they were a statute,\u201d <em>United States v. Plotts, </em>347 F.3d 873, 876 (10th Cir.2003) (quotations omitted), and the commentary to the Guidelines as \u201cauthoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of\u2019 the Guidelines, <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993). The defendant has the burden of proving his minor or minimal participation. <em>United States v. Harfst, </em>168 F.3d 398, 401-02 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-13\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b876-14\">On appeal, Mr. Barron argues that the District Court \u201cerred as a matter of law in failing to consider Mr. Barron\u2019s role in the context of other participants [i.e., Mr. Sierra] in the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable at sentencing.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-15\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 instructs courts to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if \u201cthe defendant was a minimal [or minor] participant in any criminal activity.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a)-(b). According to the commentary, \u201c[t]his guideline is not applicable unless more than one participant was involved in the offense,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, Application Note 2, and it provides a reduction only for \u201ca defendant who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>average participante]\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, Application Note 3(A). The court may-compare the defendant\u2019s conduct to that of a codefendant or that of an uncharged person who played a role in the criminal endeavor. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, Application Note 3(A); U.S.S.G. Supplement to Appendix C, Amendment 635 (2001) (amending U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, Application Note 3(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Accordingly, we have held that the minor-participant inquiry must \u201cfocus upon the defendant\u2019s knowledge or lack thereof concerning the scope and structure of the enterprise and of the activities of others involved in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon-Porras, </em>911 F.2d 421, 423 (10th Cir.1990). Given the nature of this focus, \u201c[t]he determination whether to apply [U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2] ... involves a determination that is heavily dependant upon the facts of the particular case.... [T]he court, in weighing the totality of the circumstances, is not required to find, based solely on the defendant\u2019s bare assertion, that such a role adjustment is warranted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, Application Note 3(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">The record belies Mr. Barron\u2019s assertion that the District Court did not consider whether Mr. Barron\u2019s role was minor compared to that of Mr. Sierra, as it is replete with in-court testimony regarding Mr. Barron\u2019s subservient role in relation to Mr. Sierra. The following questions asked of Mr. Barron by his counsel are indicative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-7\">Q. Who was Sierra, and what did he do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-8\">A. Sierra was in charge of the operation. He had the contacts in Los Angeles to receive the drugs, and had the contacts in Atlanta to deliver them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-9\">Q. Did you know the contacts in California?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-23\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-10\">Q. Did you know the contacts in Atlanta?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-11\">A. No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-12\">Q. Okay. Who were you working for during this particular\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-13\">A. Jose Luis Sierra.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-14\">Q. You were working by his orders?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-15\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-16\">Q. \u2014would it be fair to say that you were functioning as an interpreter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-17\">A. Yes. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-18\">Q. And who were you paid by?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-19\">A. Jose Luis [Sierra].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-20\">A similar discussion, albeit from a different perspective, occurred during the government\u2019s cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-21\">In the face of this record, Mr. Barron asserts that \u201cthe [district] court focused on the slight differences between [Mr. Barron\u2019s] role and that of his co-defendant, Lobatos, and did not consider the significant difference between Mr. Barron\u2019s role and that of Sierra.\u201d In so doing, Mr. Barron claims that the District Court failed to conform to the dictates of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, Application Note 3(A). <em>See id. </em>(a court \u201cis not precluded\u201d from considering an uncharged person who played a role in the criminal endeavor when determining whether the defendant played a minor role).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-22\">This contention misstates the record. As the record demonstrates, the District Court heard five testimony regarding the respective roles of Messrs. Barron and Sierra. The only reasonable conclusion one can reach from the record is that the District Court considered the distinctions between Messrs. Barron and Sierra, but did not find Mr. Barron\u2019s testimony credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>In a nearly identical U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 case, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-4\">The only evidence that [the defendant] was not himself involved in any of these [non-minor] roles is the appellant\u2019s own testimony, which the district court could quite reasonably have found not credible .... Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous. A defendant\u2019s own testimony that others were more heavily involved in a criminal scheme may not suffice to prove his minor or minimal participation, even if uncontradicted by other evidence. <em>United States v. Salazar-Samaniega, </em>361 F.3d 1271, 1278 (10th Cir.2004) (internal citations and quotations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">As <em>Salazar-Samaniega </em>makes clear, the District Court need not have found Mr. Barron\u2019s testimony credible; and, absent extraordinary facts not found in this record, we will not second-guess such a finding by the District Court. <em>See United States v. Onheiber, </em>173 F.3d 1254, 1258 (10th Cir.1999) (holding that the defendant\u2019s own testimony that he was \u201cmerely a middleman in the transaction, hired to bring the drugs to another contact, and that he had limited knowledge of and control over the transaction\u201d was insufficient to prove that he was a minor or minimal participant).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">Because the record demonstrates that the District Court heard testimony of Mr. Barron\u2019s role in relation to that of Mr. Sierra, but found it untruthful, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b875-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
