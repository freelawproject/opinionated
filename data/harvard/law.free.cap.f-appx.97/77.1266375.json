We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See Forsythe v. Hales, </em>255 F.3d 487, 490 (8th Cir.2001) (standard of review). Jarvis failed to respond to the complaint; thereafter, in violation of court rules, he attempted to submit by facsimile his response to the government\u2019s motion for a default order, and then did not cure the problem by submitting a proper filing after the court informed him that his fae<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>simile would not be accepted; and he did not respond to the court\u2019s two show-cause orders. Jarvis\u2019s arguments on the merits are thus irrelevant. <em>See Ackra Direct Mktg. Corp. v. Fingerhut Corp., </em>86 F.3d 852, 857 (8th Cir.1996); <em>Brown v. Kenron Aluminum, &amp; Glass Corp., </em>477 F.2d 526, 531 (8th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-13\">.
