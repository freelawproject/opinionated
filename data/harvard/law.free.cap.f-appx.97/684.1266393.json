Warren appeals asserting the evidence was insufficient to convict him. Having carefully reviewed the record in the light most favorable to the verdict, we conclude a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Warren distributed crack cocaine. <em>See United States v. </em>Davis, 357 F.3d 726, 728 (8th Cir.2004) (standard of review). Evidence included testimony by the cooperating witness, testimony by the surveillance officers, transcripts of telephone conversations between Warren and the cooperating witness, Warren\u2019s fingerprints on the plastic bag containing the crack cocaine sold to the cooperating witness, and Warren\u2019s possession of the prerecorded buy money in his pants pocket immediately after the transaction. Any questions about the cooperating witness\u2019s testimony was for the jury alone to decide, and other evidence supported the cooperating witness\u2019s testimony. <em>See id. </em>Contrary to Warren\u2019s assertion, the officers thoroughly searched the cooperating witness and his vehicle before the transaction occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-17\">We thus affirm Warren\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8th Cir.
