We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-23\">Tasby contends that the district court erred by imposing a 24-month sentence following the revocation of his supervised release where U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4 advises 5-11 months. Because the record demonstrates that the district court considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>the chapter 7 policy guidelines, rejected those guidelines for specific reasons and sentenced Tasby within the statutory maximum, it did not abuse its discretion. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3588(e)(3); <em>United States v. Tadeo, 222 </em>F.3d 623, 625-26 (9th Cir.2000) (stating chapter 7 policy statements \u201cmust be considered, but ... may be freely rejected by a district court without abusing its discretion, if the sentence actually imposed is within the statutory maximum\u201d); <em>United States v. Musa, </em>220 F.3d 1096, 1099-1101 (9th Cir.2000) (holding district court did not abuse its discretion when it found defendant was a danger to the community and imposed a 3-year term of imprisonment following the revocation of supervised release, even though the guideline recommendation was 3-9 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b796-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
