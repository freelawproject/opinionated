R.App. P. 34(f); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Defendant-appellant Ronald Todd Papa appeals the district court\u2019s decision denying him collateral relief from the sentence he received for conspiring to defraud the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court, on its own motion, ordered this appeal abated pending our en banc decision in <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315 (10th Cir.2004) (per curiam). Having decided <em>Hahn, </em>we now vacate our order abating this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Papa and his co-defendant were officers and directors of a medical supply company, Dest\u00edn Health Care, Inc. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) initiated an administrative proceeding to look into possible improprieties with Destin\u2019s Medicare claims for 1993 and the first part of 1994. As part of those proceedings, the HCFA held an administrative hearing in August 1999 to address a Medicare carrier\u2019s allegations that Dest\u00edn had filed four million dollars in fraudulent Medicare claims during that time period. <em>See </em>Aplt\u2019s App. at 18. At that hearing, Dest\u00edn challenged the method the carrier had used to calculate that loss. <em>See id. </em>at 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">A month after the administrative hearing, but while the HCFA\u2019s decision was still pending, the United States indicted Papa and his co-defendant on one count of conspiring to defraud the United States, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and one count of filing false or fraudulent claims with the United States, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287. In October 1999, Papa, as well as his co-defendant, agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy count, in exchange for the government\u2019s moving to dismiss the false-claims count. In his plea agreement, Papa apparently agreed, and never objected, to the government\u2019s calculation that Papa\u2019s criminal conduct resulted in the United States losing over eight million dollars. <em>See </em>Aplt\u2019s App. at 30, 31 (Dist.Ct.Order). Based upon that eight-million-dollar loss calculation, the district court sentenced Papa to thirty months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by three years\u2019 supervised release, and ordered Papa to pay over ten million dollars in restitution, representing the United States\u2019 eight-million-dollar loss plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">Several months after his sentencing, the HCFA issued its decision, based upon the earlier administrative hearing. The HCFA concluded that the Medicare carrier had failed to support all of its claims adequately, and reduced the alleged four-million-dollar loss to just over $16,000 for 1993 and just over $4,000 for the first part of 1994. <em>See id. </em>at 18-23 (HCFA decision). Based on that administrative decision, Papa then filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion challenging the length of his sentence and the ten-million-dollar restitution award.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">As an initial matter, we note that, as part of his plea agreement, Papa waived his right to appeal or to pursue any collateral relief. <em>See </em>Aplt\u2019s App. at 6 (Papa\u2019s amended mem. supporting \u00a7 2255 motion). That waiver, nevertheless, does not deprive this court of jurisdiction to consider this appeal. <em>See Hahn, </em>359 F.3d at 1320, 1324 (considering direct criminal appeal). Moreover, the government did not argue that Papa\u2019s plea-agreement waiver precludes these collateral proceedings. <em>See </em>Aplt\u2019s App. at 32. Because ultimately Papa\u2019s claims lack merit, we will assume the government has waived this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>Turning to the merits of Papa\u2019s claims, he first challenges the length of his imprisonment and supervised release, as based upon the government\u2019s eight-million-dollar loss calculation. The district court, however, held that Papa had proeedurally defaulted this claim by not objecting to the loss calculation until his \u00a7 2255 motion. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Papa argues that he has cause excusing this default, because his current claim rests on newly discovered evidence \u2014 the HCFA\u2019s administrative decision issued after his sentencing. But, while the HCFA did not issue its decision until after the district court had sentenced Papa, the administrative hearing underlying that decision occurred prior to the government even indicting, let alone sentencing, Papa. And during that administrative hearing, Dest\u00edn was able to challenge the Medicare carrier\u2019s method for calculating the government\u2019s loss. Before his criminal proceedings, therefore, Papa was aware, or should have been aware, of the grounds Dest\u00edn had already used to challenge the government\u2019s loss calculation at the administrative hearing. Yet, in his criminal case, Papa never objected and, in fact, agreed to the government\u2019s eight-million-dollar loss calculation. <em>See </em>Aplt\u2019s App. at 30, 31. Papa, therefore, has failed to establish cause excusing his procedural default.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 287, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999) (noting defendant will be unable to establish cause where he was previously aware of factual basis for claim, but failed to raise it earlier).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Further, although a \u00a7 2255 motion may be the appropriate method for challenging a federal conviction for the first time, where \u201c[t]he facts relied on are dehors the record and their effect on the judgment was not open to consideration and review on appeal,\u201d <em>Waley v. Johnston, </em>316 U.S. 101, 104, 62 S.Ct. 964, 86 L.Ed. 1302 (1942); <em>see also Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 621-22, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998), again Papa has failed to establish that the means to challenge the government\u2019s loss calculation were unavailable to him at the time the district court sentenced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">We would further note that it is not at all clear from the appellate record that Papa\u2019s criminal case and the HCFA administrative proceedings addressed the same time frame and the same claims. For one thing, the administrative hearing addressed four million dollars\u2019 worth of allegedly fraudulent claims, while the government\u2019s presentencing report, in these criminal proceedings, alleged twice that much. Additionally, the district court noted that, while the HCFA proceedings addressed \u201conly ... whether the services [Dest\u00edn provided] were medically necessary and whether the services were documented,\u201d the criminal indictment instead charged more broadly that Destin\u2019s false Medicare claims involved claims for supplies that 1) it never provided; 2) were not reimbursable; 3) were not medically necessary; 4) did not have a Florida \u201cpoint of sale;\u201d and 5) involved the \u201cnon-collection of co-payments.\u201d Aplt\u2019s App. at 30, 35 (Dist. Ct. Order at 2, 7). Based upon these differences in the scope of the administrative and criminal proceedings, therefore, the district court concluded that \u201cthe HCFA\u2019s Hearing Officer\u2019s decision would have had only a small impact on the government\u2019s proof of loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35 (Dist. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>Ct. Order at 7). Papa has not specifically challenged these distinctions drawn by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Papa next challenges the amount of restitution the district court ordered. He cannot challenge that award under \u00a7 2255, however, because he is not \u201cclaiming the right to be released\u201d from custody based on that claim. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bernard, </em>351 F.3d 360, 361 (8th Cir.2003), citing cases, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2044, 158 L.Ed.2d 512 (2004). And, even if Papa could, instead, seek coram-nobis relief from the restitution order, <em>see Barnickel v. United States, </em>113 F.3d 704, 706 (7th Cir.1997), that relief is not warranted here. Coram-nobis relief is available only to correct errors that result in a complete miscarriage of justice. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Haga, </em>931 F.2d 642, 645 (10th Cir.1991) (quotation omitted). In order to obtain coram-nobis relief based upon newly discovered evidence, Papa must still show, among other things, \u201cthat due diligence on his part could not have revealed the evidence prior to\u201d sentencing. <em>Klein v. United States, </em>880 F.2d 250, 253-54 (10th Cir.1989). Papa has failed to make that showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">For these reasons, this court\u2019s order abating this appeal is VACATED and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b882-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-8\">. This court previously granted Papa a certificate of appealability on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 claims challenging both the length of his sentence and the amount of restitution ordered. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. To the extent Papa is appealing the district court\u2019s decision denying him coram-nobis relief, he does not need a COA. <em>See United States v. Torres, </em>282 F.3d 1241, 1245 n. 6, 1247 n. 9 (10th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b884-6\">. Although this court can still generally overlook a procedural default if declining to review a claim would produce a fundamental miscarriage of justice, this procedural-bar exception does not apply to claims like Papa\u2019s, challenging a non-capital sentence. <em>See United States v. Richards, </em>5 F.3d 1369, 1371 (10th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
