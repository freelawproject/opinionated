We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Nieto-Cruz contends the district court erred by denying him the benefit of safety-valve relief under U.S.S.G \u00a7 5C1.2 (incorporating the criteria of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(1)-(5)). On the record before us, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred by finding that Nieto-Cruz had failed to provide the government with complete and truthful information concerning this offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5); <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>163 F.3d 1142, 1143-44 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Nieto-Cruz contends the district court erred by failing to make factual findings whether he was subjected to sentencing entrapment. The defendant has the burden of proving that he was a victim of sentencing entrapment because he had neither the intent nor the ability to produce the amount of drugs involved. <em>United States v. Naranjo, </em>52 F.3d 245, 250 n. 13 (9th Cir.1995). Nieto-Cruz produced no evidence, other than his own assertions, regarding his lack of intent or lack of ability to arrange the sale 20 kilograms of cocaine. The district court found that Nieto-Cruz was critical to the deal. The district court doubted Nieto-Cruz\u2019s assertion that this drug transaction involving a large quantity of drugs was Nieto-Cruz\u2019s first drug transaction. The record is sufficient to show what facts the district court relied upon in finding that Nieto-Cruz did not adequately prove sentencing entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">Nieto-Cruz contends the district court erred in denying his request for a \u201cminor role\u201d reduction in sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). The downward adjustment for being a minor participant is a question of fact, and we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Nieto-Cruz was not a minor participant. <em>See United States v. Murillo, </em>255 F.3d 1169, 1179 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b738-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit .except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
