Ill challenges the dismissal of his Bivens<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> complaint alleging constitutional violations by officials of several government agencies. The gravamen of the complaint is that the defendants unconstitutionally interfered with his claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8101-93 (\u201cFECA\u201d). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Borkins is a former employee of the United States Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d) and a veteran. In 1983, he filed a FECA claim alleging that postal employees had harassed and mistreated him, ultimately causing emotional illness. In his amended complaint in the district court, he alleged that the Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) and USPS defendants \u201cfront-desked,\u201d or purposely delayed, his FECA claim and otherwise conspired to defeat it. He also alleged that they prevented him from effectively resorting to the FECA appeals process by (1) refusing to equitably toll the deadline for filing a request for reconsideration by the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (\u201cOWCP\u201d), (2) prejudging his claim, (3) lying when challenging his claim, and (4) refusing to aid him in retrieving his medical records. He asserted that the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) defendants refused to provide him a medical opinion to support his request for reconsideration. The district court adopted the recommendations of the magistrate judge and granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Borkins timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">\u2018We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal of claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\u201d <em>Marks v. Newcourt Credit Group, Inc., </em>342 F.3d 444, 451 (6th Cir.2003). \u201cIn deciding whether to grant a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, we must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, accept all factual allegations [of the plaintiff] as true, and determine whether the plaintiff undoubtedly can prove no set of facts in support of his claims that would entitle him to relief.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451-52 (quoting <em>Allard v. Weitzman (In re DeLorean Motor Co.), </em>991 F.2d 1236, 1240 (6th Cir.1993)). We may affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal on any ground supported by the record. <em>Peterson Novelties, Inc. v. City of Berkley, </em>305 F.3d 386, 394 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-14\">The defendants argue that FECA\u2019s finality provision bars federal jurisdiction over the case, and that a <em>Bivens </em>remedy is inappropriate here in light of Congressionally-created regulatory schemes to handle claims against USPS, DOL and VA employees. We decline to reach these complicated questions because our holding that Borkins\u2019s complaint failed to allege cognizable due process and equal protection claims disposes of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-15\">I. Due Process Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b67-16\">The heart of Borkins\u2019s complaint is his assertion that the various defendants violated his procedural due process rights by impeding his access to FECA\u2019s compensation mechanism. The complaint fails to state a cognizable procedural due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>claim, however, because it does not demonstrate that the defendants\u2019 actions \u201ccontravened notions of due process.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Cohen, </em>304 F.3d 563, 576 (6th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX\">[A]n unauthorized intentional deprivation of property by a state employee does not constitute a violation of the procedural requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if a meaningful postdeprivation remedy for the loss is available. For intentional, as for negligent deprivations of property by state employees, the state\u2019s action is not complete until and unless it provides or refuses to provide a suitable postdeprivation remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ac\"><em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984). Borkins asserts that the defendants improperly interfered with the FECA claim process and intentionally disrupted or misapplied the FECA appeals process proscribed by law. He was therefore required under <em>Hudson </em>to show that the government provided no meaningful postdeprivation remedy for these alleged improprieties.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Borkins acknowledges that a claimant may appeal a final decision of the OWCP to the Employees\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (\u201cECAB\u201d). <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.625. A claimant may file his appeal within ninety days of the final decision of the OWCP, or within one year if good cause is shown. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 501.3(d). Borkins failed to appeal his claims to the ECAB. To preserve his claim that the postdeprivation remedies provided by FECA were inadequate, Borkins must therefore show that the ECAB could not have remedied the alleged wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Borkins\u2019s only argument to this effect on appeal is his observation that the ECAB may not consider new evidence. That fact has no relevance, however, because Borkins need not have presented new evidence to the ECAB in order for the Board to review the alleged wrongdoing during the OWCP proceedings. The ECAB \u201chas jurisdiction to consider and decide appeals from the final decision of the [OWCP].... The Board may review all relevant questions of law, fact and discretion in such cases.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 501.2(c). The decisions of the ECAB clearly demonstrate its ability and willingness to reverse and remand OWCP decisions when it finds them to have been unfairly reached. <em>See, e.g., In re Sacchetti, </em>2003 WL 23170517 at *3 (E.C.A.B.2003) (reversing and remanding on finding that the OWCP procedures constituted \u201cinherent unfairness\u201d); <em>In re Grossman, </em>2000 WL 1677321 at *4-5 (E.C.A.B.2000) (reversing and remanding on finding that OWCP procedures violated the Supreme Court\u2019s due process jurisprudence). Borkins could have made his complaints about the OWCP proceedings to the ECAB, and the Board could have reversed and remanded the case upon a showing of unfairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Borkins has, therefore, faded to provide any legally-sufficient attack on the complete postdeprivation remedy provided by the FECA scheme; the district court properly dismissed his claims alleging due process violations by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>II. Equal Protection Claim</p>\n<p id=\"A9\">Borkins\u2019s complaint also alleges equal protection violations. The Equal Protection Clause protects against \u201cintentional and arbitrary discrimination,\u201d <em>Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, </em>528 U.S. 562, 564, 120 S.Ct. 1073, 145 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2000) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Sioux City Bridge Co. v. Dakota </em>County, 260 U.S. 441, 445, 43 S.Ct. 190, 67 L.Ed. 340 (1923)), but Borkins has not adequately alleged any such discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">Borkins\u2019s complaint contains only bare allegations that the defendants\u2019 actions constituted \u201chandicapped discrimination.\u201d Conclusory allegations like these are insufficient to avoid dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-10\">Although [the] standard for Rule 12(b)(6) dismissals is quite liberal, more than bare assertions of legal conclusions is ordinarily required to satisfy federal notice pleading requirements. In practice, a ... complaint must contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements to sustain a recovery under some viable legal theory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ade\"><em>Scheid v. Fanny Farmer Candy Shops, Inc., </em>859 F.2d 434, 436 (6th Cir.1988) (internal citations and quotations marks omitted). In <em>Scheid, </em>the \u201ccomplaint merely statefd] that [plaintiff] was \u2018wrongfully discharged by the Defendant in violation of [state law]\u2019 and that this was \u2018discriminatory in nature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437. We found \u201c[s]uch unsupported assertions of legal conclusions ... insufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, like the plaintiff in <em>Scheid, </em>Borkins has failed to allege \u201cany facts suggesting that [disability] was a factor\u201d in the defendants\u2019 actions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">On appeal, Borkins introduces a new explanation of his equal protection claim: He asserts that the defendants\u2019 alleged misbehavior was retaliation against Borkins for exercising his First Amendment right to petition the government for redress. This account does not appear anywhere in Borkins s pleadings in the district court. Thus, because [arguments that were not raised below may not be asserted on appeal.\" <em>PACCAR Inc. v. TeleScan Techs., L.L.C., 319 </em>F.3d 243, 258 (6th Cir.2003) we decline to address <em>See also Young v. City of Mount Ranier, </em>238 F.3d 567, 576-77 (4th Cir.2001) (affirming dismissal because the legations in the original complaint were insufficient to establish theories of liability asserted on appeal)\u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">III. Motion to Appoint Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">Borkins also contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 for appointment of counsel. His claim is unavailing. We review a district court decision denying a motion for appointment of counsel for abuse of discretion. <em>See Lavado v. Keohane, </em>992 F.2d 601, 605 (6th Cir.1993). We overturn a district court\u2019s decision denying counsel only when the denial results in fundamental unfairness impinging on due process rights. <em>See Reneer v. Sewell, </em>975 F.2d 258, 261 (6th Cir.1992). \u201cAppointment of counsel in a civil case is not a constitutional right\u201d and \u201cis not appropriate when a pro se litigant\u2019s claims are frivolous, or when the chances of success are extremely slim.\u201d <em>Lavado, </em>992 F.2d at 605-06 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). As discussed above, Borkins\u2019s complaint fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted. Thus, his chances of success were very slim. The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-14\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b69-15\">For the reasons stated, the district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-17\">. <em>Bivens v.
