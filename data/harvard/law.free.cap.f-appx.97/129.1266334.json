The BIA\u2019s determination that Lopez is ineligible for asylum \u201ccan be reversed only if the evidence presented by [Lopez-Juan] was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-27\">As the BIA concluded, the record reflects that Lopez-Juan was never arrested, detained, or otherwise physically harmed. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir.1998) (recognizing a lack of persecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>where there is no significant physical violence or specific threats of serious harm). Lopez-Juan has not shown \u201cthat the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 998 (9th Cir.2003) (citations omitted). Since Lopez-Juan has failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily fails to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Additionally, Lopez-Juan\u2019s due process claim fails because the IJ exercised the discretion set forth in the governing rule when he allowed the untimely submission of evidence by the government. <em>See </em>San. Fran. Local Op. Proc. Rule 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b163-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
