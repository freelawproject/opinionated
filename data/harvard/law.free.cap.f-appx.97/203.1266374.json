We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-25\">Jones contends that the district court relied upon improper factors in departing upward based on its finding that Jones\u2019s criminal history was under-represented pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.3. Reviewing <em>de novo, see United States v. Phillips, </em>356 F.3d 1086, 1099 (9th Cir.2004), we conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>district court properly determined that Jones\u2019s criminal history category of IV significantly under-represented the seriousness of his criminal history and the likelihood of recidivism. <em>See United States v. Connelly, </em>156 F.3d 978, 983-85 (9th Cir.1998). Thus, the district court\u2019s decision to depart was appropriate. <em>See id. </em>at 984-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Jones further contends that the extent of the departure by the district court was unreasonable. We disagree. Jones\u2019s long history of fraudulent conduct is atypical as compared with other defendants in category IV. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in departing two levels to category VI. <em>See United States v. Goshea, </em>94 F.3d 1361, 1365 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b237-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
