Jackson (\u201cJackson\u201d) appeals from a final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d), dismissing her whistleblower claim and her request to reopen and modify all of her prior appeals filed with the Board. <em>Jackson v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>No. SF-1221-02-0131W-l (M.S.P.B. Apr. 1, 2002). Because the Board\u2019s decisions on the issues underlying the dismissal were supported by substantial evidence and were not arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of disci\u2019etion, procedurally deficient, or otherwise not in accordance with law, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b332-16\">Jackson has previously filed four appeals before the Board and this court stemming from her 1997 resignation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cDepartment\u201d) and based on claims she filed, <em>inter alia, </em>for involuntary resignation, job restoration, and disability retirement. Before the Board in the case now before us, Jackson sought to reopen and modify all of her previous appeals based upon purportedly new evidence and sought relief on a new whistleblower claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-17\">Because the members of the Board could not agree on the disposition of the appeal, the initial decision of the Administrative Law Judge became the final decision of the Board. In that decision, the Board found that the doctrine of res judicata applied to Jackson\u2019s appeal, barring Jackson from relitigating her claims or any claims that could have been raised in a prior proceeding. On that basis, the Board dismissed Jackson\u2019s appeal. Jackson then appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-18\">We have jurisdiction from an appeal of a final decision of the Board pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-19\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b332-20\">Our scope of review in an appeal from a decision of the Board is limited. Specifically, we must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless we find it to be arbitrary, capri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>cious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c); <em>Abell v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>343 F.3d 1378, 1382-83 (Fed.Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Jackson seeks to reopen and modify all of her previous appeals based upon purported new evidence and further brings what she characterizes as a whistleblower claim. The Board found no merit in Jackson\u2019s attempt to revisit previously considered issues, and disposed of the appeal in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">In this case, although appellant has attempted to recharacterize her appeal as a new action, it is apparent that appellant\u2019s appeal is nothing more than a patent attempt to reopen and relitigate previously filed appeals. <em>See, e.g., Fredeluces v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>75 M.S.P.R. 488, 493 (1997). It is a matter of public record in this case that in 1998 appellant filed an appeal concerning an alleged constructive removal. In an initial decision issued July 9,1998 (MSPB Docket No. SF-0752-98-0070-1-2), a finding was made that appellant failed to establish that her resignation was involuntary; the decision also found that appellant had failed to prove any discrimination or retaliation. The Board\u2019s final decision in this case was appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Appellant\u2019s appeal of that decision was ultimately dismissed by the Court in an order issued February 7, 2001. Appellant also filed a disability retirement appeal with the Board and the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s decision finding that appellant was ineligible for a disability retirement was affirmed by the Board in an initial decision issued July 30, 2001 (MSPB Docket No. SF-831E-99-0600-I-1). On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the Board\u2019s decision in an order issued July 30, 2001. Finally, appellant also filed a restoration to duty appeal and an initial decision on that matter, dismissing the appeal, was issued on April 23, 2001 (MSPB Docket No. SF0353-01-0167-I-1). The Board issued a final decision affirming the dismissal on March 1, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">Although appellant has submitted voluminous, and somewhat redundant, submissions on appeal, it is clearly apparent that appellant is merely reiterating claims previously filed. Indeed, as previously noted, appellant titled her appeal as a request to \u201creopen and modify all MSPB appeals.\u201d <em>See </em>Initial Appeal File, at 1 (Appellant\u2019s appeal petition). I find that the doctrine of res judicata applies to this appeal and appellant may not relitigate her claims here or any other claims which could have been raised in the prior proceedings. The Board\u2019s decisions in appellant\u2019s prior cases are final and appellant may not relitigate her claims here. <em>See Tyler v. United States Postal Service, 90 </em>M.S.P.R. 545, 548 (2002).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-9\"><em>Jackson v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>No. SF-1221-02-0131-W-1, slip op. at 2-3 (M.S.P.B. Apr. 1, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">A. <em>Involuntary Resignation and Job Restoration Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">\u201cUnder [the doctrine of] res judicata, a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.\u201d <em>Allen v. McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980). Because Jackson\u2019s prior involuntary resignation and job restoration claims were not adjudicated on the merits, but were dismissed in the prior appeals for lack of jurisdiction, those dismissals may not constitute a basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>for precluding all claims that could have been raised in those appeals under res judicata. See Fed.R.CivJP. 41(b) (an involuntary dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is not an \u201cadjudication on the merits\u201d). However, the error is harmless because Jackson cannot attempt once again to revisit the jurisdiction issue simply by urging the same arguments, merely reworded. The Board previously dismissed Jackson\u2019s involuntary resignation and job restoration claims for lack of jurisdiction based on Jackson\u2019s failure to show that her retirement was involuntary or that she suffered a compensable injury. <em>Jackson v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>No. SF-0752-98-0070-I-2, slip op. at 5-6 (M.S.P.B. July 9, 1998) (involuntary resignation claim); <em>Jackson v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>No. SF-0353-01-0167-1-1, slip op. at 2-3 (M.S.P.B. Apr. 23, 2001) (job restoration claim). These determinations are entitled to preclusive effect under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. \u201cUnder collateral estoppel, once a court has decided an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment, that decision may preclude relitigation of the issue in a suit on a different cause of action involving a party to the first case.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>449 U.S. at 94. Although the Board used the term \u201cres judicata\u201d in characterizing its dismissal of Jackson\u2019s involuntary resignation and job restoration claims, rather than employing the more precise term \u201ccollateral estoppel,\u201d the Board\u2019s dismissal was nonetheless made on the correct ground. The term \u201cres judicata\u201d is often generically used to encompass both issue preclusion (or collateral estoppel) and claim preclusion. <em>Migra v. Warren City Sch. Dist Bd. of Educ., </em>465 U.S. 75, 77 n. 1, 104 S.Ct. 892, 79 L.Ed.2d 56 (1984) (noting that in its generic sense, \u201cres judicata\u201d is a broad term that encompasses both issue preclusion, sometimes referred to as collateral estoppel, and claim preclusion, sometimes referred to as res judicata). The Board properly applied the doctrine of issue preclusion, recognizing that this doctrine precludes Jackson\u2019s attempted relitigation of these claims \u2018following the Board\u2019s prior decisions on the underlying issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">B. <em>Disability Retirement Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">As to Jackson\u2019s disability retirement claim, the Board correctly found that claim barred under the doctrine of res judicata. This court previously affirmed on the merits the Board\u2019s affirmance of the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s finding that Jackson was not entitled to disability retirement, because she failed to demonstrate a disabling medical condition. <em>Jackson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>10 Fed.Appx. 953 (Fed.Cir.2001) (not published) (affirming <em>Jackson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. SF-831E-99-0600-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Feb. 17, 2000)). Because the doctrine of res judicata provides that a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action, Jackson is precluded from relitigating her disability retirement claim following the decision of this court on the merits denying her disability retirement claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">C. <em>Whistleblower Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Jackson\u2019s whistleblower claim is also precluded under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion. \u201cThis court has held that the Board has jurisdiction over an IRA appeal if the appellant has exhausted his administrative remedies before the OSC and makes \u2018non-frivolous allegations\u2019 that (1) he engaged in whistle-blowing activity by making a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8), and (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency\u2019s decision to take or fail to take a personnel action as defined by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a).\u201d <em>Yunus v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>242 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Cir.2001). Jackson\u2019s voluntary resignation and the Department\u2019s denial of job restoration are not \u201cpersonnel actions\u201d within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(a)(2). A resignation is not a personnel action unless it is involuntary. <em>Middleton v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>185 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed.Cir.1999). Here, the Board already determined that Jackson\u2019s resignation was voluntary. <em>Jackson v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>No. SF-0752-98-0070-I-2, slip op. at 5-6 (M.S.P.B. July 9, 1998). Collateral estoppel precludes Jackson from relitigating the determination that her resignation was voluntary. Under certain circumstances, a restoration can be the basis for a personnel action. To establish a right to restoration, Jackson must prove that she suffered a compensable injury under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.301(a). Again, the Board has already determined that Jackson did not suffer a compensable injury and thus was not entitled to restoration. <em>Jackson v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>No. SF-0353-01-0167-I-1, slip op. at 2-3 (M.S.P.B. Apr. 23, 2001) Collateral estoppel precludes Jackson from arguing otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The Board correctly dismissed Jackson\u2019s whistleblower claim. The Board\u2019s imprecise use of the expression \u201cres judicata\u201d rather than the more precise terms \u201ccollateral estoppel\u201d or \u201cissue preclusion\u201d is harmless error. The Board, having decided the underlying issues, was not required to relitigate the same issues yet again.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Jackson has now had ample opportunities to challenge all of the disputes surrounding her resignation and to raise various theories concerning the remedies she has sought from the United States Government. While the courts of the United States are open for individuals to make claims against their government, continued challenges concerning the same set of underlying facts eventually constitute an abuse of the judicial system. Such a point has now been reached. Jackson is therefore warned that further appeals involving claims based on the same set of facts, whether raising the same or new theories, may be held to be frivolous and subject to sanctions, see Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
