Luswata argues the BIA erred in not following its established standard of review in deciding his motion to reopen, not considering his newly acquired evidence that was unavailable when he appeared before the immigration judge, and not issuing a written decision revealing the rationale for its decision to deny his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-19\">After careful consideration, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (BIA has discretion to reopen), because Luswata had not shown that the new evidence \u201cwas not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the [removal] hearing,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 107-08, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988) (motions to reopen deportation proceedings are disfavored because of strong public interest in bringing litigation to close); <em>Raffington v. INS, </em>340 F.3d 720, 721, 724 (8th Cir.2003) (standard of review; court reviewing denial of motion to reopen does not have jurisdiction to review underlying order). To the extent Luswata asserts a due process challenge to the BIA\u2019s streamlined-review procedure, the argument is unavailing. <em>Cf. Loulou v. Ashcroft, </em>354 F.3d 706, 708-09 (8th Cir.2003) (concluding affirmance without opinion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>immigration judge\u2019s decision does not violate alien\u2019s due process rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
