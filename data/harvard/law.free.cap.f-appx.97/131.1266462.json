The facts are known to the parties, so we do not recite them here. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-21\">Woodard pleaded guilty to all aspects of Count Two of the second superseding indictment except for the amount of the controlled substance attributable to him. Woodard also waived, to some extent, his rights to appeal. Though the plea agreement could certainly be considerably clearer, the district court clarified at the plea hearing that the agreement waived Woodard\u2019s right to appeal, with a limited exception for rulings made in the course of the bench trial, and Woodard and his counsel agreed. Thus, Woodard\u2019s waiver of his appellate rights is enforceable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Woodard entered into the agreement knowingly and voluntarily.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-22\">Woodard may, therefore, not appeal the district court\u2019s determination of drug weight or his sentence, as those final determinations are within the appeal waiver. The question whether the district court properly allowed the government to introduce evidence not in the record of the lead coconspirators\u2019 trial is, however, outside the scope of the appeal waiver, as it involves a ruling during trial. We therefore do reach that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-23\">We reject Woodard\u2019s contention that the district court permitted a breach of the terms of the plea agreement by allowing the introduction of the contested evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plea agreement clearly allows the Government to introduce evidence from the lead conspirator\u2019s trial. It does not forbid the introduction of other evidence. The district court clarified this fact to Woodard and offered, instead of enforcing the agreement, to begin the bench trial anew, under the usual evidentiary rules. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>When Woodard declined this offer, the district court properly considered the evidence before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Woodard challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for his conviction and the chain of custody of the controlled substances attributed to him. We do not reach those questions, however, as they are within the scope of the appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b165-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-20\">. <em>See United States v.
