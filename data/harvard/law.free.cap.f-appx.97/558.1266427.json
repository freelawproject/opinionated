The parties are represented by counsel and have waived oral argument, and the panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">Solim\u00e1n entered the United States as a visitor in 1989. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) began deportation proceedings against him because he overstayed his visa. Solim\u00e1n applied for asylum in 1991. An Immigration Judge (IJ) denied Soliman\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal but granted him voluntary departure. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision in February 1999. In May 1999, Solim\u00e1n and the INS filed a joint motion to reopen Soliman\u2019s case in order for him to request withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture. Solim\u00e1n submitted a new application and other documents. The IJ held a hearing in September 2000. Solim\u00e1n testified that he had been persecuted by Muslims because he is a Coptic Christian. The IJ denied Soliman\u2019s application. The IJ found that, although Soliman\u2019s testimony concerning violence against Coptic Christians was credible, Solim\u00e1n had not established that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if he returned to Egypt. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion in January 2003. Solim\u00e1n filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">In his petition for review, Solim\u00e1n argues that the BIA erred when it determined that he was not entitled to a grant of withholding of deportation pursuant to the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">A decision denying a claim under the Convention Against Torture is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law, and the administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) and (C); <em>Ali v. Reno, </em>237 F.3d 591, 596 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-15\">Upon review, we conclude that the petition for review must be denied. Solim\u00e1n testified that he and his family are Coptic Christians, also called Copts, a religious minority in an overwhelmingly Muslim country. He maintained that Muslims discriminate against Copts in housing, education, and employment. When asked to describe specific incidents of persecution, Solim\u00e1n said that, on separate occasions, he and other Copts were attacked by a Muslim crowd, his car was vandalized, and people put trash and graffiti by his doorstep. Solim\u00e1n also testified that two relatives were murdered in 1999. He believed the Egyptian government did little to protect the Coptic Christians. The State Department Report, however, indicated that the government conducted anti-terrorist campaigns against Muslim extremists and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>that there were no confirmed reports of the government targeting Christians for mistreatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The IJ concluded that Solim\u00e1n did not meet his burden of proving that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured by public officials or through the acquiescence of public officials. <em>See Ali, </em>237 F.3d at 596; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). The IJ stressed that Solim\u00e1n did not link the terrorist acts to the government. This conclusion is supported by the record. Moreover, \u201c[discrimination on the basis of race or religion, as morally reprehensible as it may be, does not ordinarily amount to \u2018persecution\u2019 within the meaning of the Act.\u201d <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995). Accordingly, Solim\u00e1n was not entitled to withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
