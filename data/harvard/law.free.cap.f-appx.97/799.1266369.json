The Immigration Judge denied his application for asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. He petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 ruling affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that Sudwikatmono has not established a \u201cpattern or practice of persecution\u201d of ethnic Chinese or Christians in Indonesia. <em>Mgoian v. INS, </em>184 F.3d 1029, 1035 (9th Cir.1999). Moreover, the evidence does not compel a finding that Sudwikatmono has a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"A5f\">Because Sudwikatmono has failed to satisfy the standard of proof for asylum eligibility, he also fails to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 1429. Furthermore, he has not established that it is \u201cmore likely than not that he ... would be tortured\u201d if returned to Indonesia. <em>Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1283 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b834-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
