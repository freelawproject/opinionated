Zapata, United States District Judge for the District of Arizona, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b179-24\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-25\">David Lowry appeals the dismissal of this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, <em>Orsay v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>289 F.3d 1125, 1128 (9th Cir.2002), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-26\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we recite them only as necessary for this decision. Lowry, an attorney, brought this mandamus action to compel the Commissioner of Social Security to pay him attorney\u2019s fees for legal services he rendered on behalf of clients seeking disability benefits. The district court dismissed the lawsuit, concluding that mandamus relief was improper because the Commissioner was still processing his fee requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-27\">We conclude that the complaint was properly dismissed for a different reason:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lowry faded to show that the Commissioner has a clear, ministerial duty to pay him attorney\u2019s fees in the precise amounts he claims are due. <em>Johnson v. Reilly, </em>349 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>F.3d 1149, 1154 (9th Cir.2003) (to be entitled to mandamus relief, a plaintiff must establish, among other things, that the act he seeks to compel is \u201cministerial and so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt\u201d). The decision whether to award attorney\u2019s fees and, if so, how much, involves the exercise of discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We note that the Commissioner does have a clear, non-discretionary duty to <em>process </em>a lawyer\u2019s claims for fees, <em>cf. Independence Mining Co., Inc. v. Babbitt, </em>105 F.3d 502, 507 n. 6 (9th Cir.1997), but Lowry did not request such relief in his complaint. Instead, he requested <em>payment </em>of specific sums.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">We also conclude that the district court properly declined to exercise subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 because Lowry\u2019s claims \u201carise under\u201d the Social Security Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h); <em>Heckler v. Ringer, </em>466 U.S. 602, 614-15, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 80 L.Ed.2d 622 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b179-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-29\">. We may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>R.T. Vanderbilt Co. v. Babbitt, </em>113 F.3d 1061, 1063 n. 1 (9th Cir. 1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-7\">. As to the \"fee petition\u201d claims, the Commissioner has discretion to set a fee based on a consideration of many factors. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1725(b)(1); <em>see also Barron v. Reich, </em>13 F.3d 1370, 1375-76 &amp; n. 3 (9th Cir.1994) (suggesting that agency decisions involving \"a complicated balancing of a number of factors\u201d are discretionary rather than ministerial). As to the \"fee agreement\u201d claims, the complaint fails to allege which, if any, of Lowry\u2019s claims are \"fee agreement\u201d claims or if Lowry has satisfied all of the prerequisites for approval of such claims. Absent these allegations, we need not reach the issue of whether the duty to pay \"fee agreement\u201d claims is sufficiently \"clear\u201d and \"ministerial\u201d to support a request for mandamus relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
