(Response Time) appeals from summary judgment in favor of Hartford Fire Insurance Company (Hartford) and also appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of Response Time\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration Based on Newly Discovered Evidence. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-18\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s May 1, 2002, partial summary judgment. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Response Time, we determine that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law. <em>See Lolli v. County of Orange, </em>351 F.3d 410, 414 (9th Cir.2003); <em>see also </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-19\">The lawsuit filed against Response Time by Sterling Commerce, Inc. (Sterling) did not trigger Hartford\u2019s duty to defend. Sterling made no charges against Response Time \u201cthat \u2018arguably' or \u2018potentially' bring the suit under the ... [advertising injury] provision[ ]\u201d of the policy between Response Time and Hartford. <em>Associated Aviation Underwriters, Inc. v. Vegas Jet, L.L.C., </em>106 F.Supp.2d 1051, 1053 (D.Nev.2000); <em>see also Bidart v. Am. Title Ins. Co., </em>103 Nev. 175, 734 P.2d 732, 734 (1987) (per curiam). Response Time failed to raise triable issues of fact with regard to at least two of three elements the parties agree are necessary to invoke Hartford\u2019s duty to defend. <em>See Associated Aviation, </em>106 F.Supp.2d at 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>First, none of Sterling\u2019s allegations raise a potential for liability for the relevant offense named in the policy: \u201c[misappropriation of advertising ideas or styles of doing business.\u201d Sterling\u2019s \u201cclaims for misappropriation of trade secrets\u201d do not \u201crelate to marketing and sales.\u201d <em>Sentex Sys., Inc. v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., </em>93 F.3d 578, 580 (9th Cir.1996). Rather, Sterling alleged that Response Time engaged in anticompetitive behavior in recruiting Humphrey, a Sterling employee who possessed confidential product and customer information, and consequently misappropriated Sterling\u2019s trade secrets and proprietary information. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 581. Sterling did not assert that Response Time\u2019s marketing method or style of doing business' \u2014 faxing consultants\u2019 resumes to potential customers \u2014 was stolen from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Second, we agree with the district court that \u201cResponse Time did not demonstrate a causal nexus between advertising activity and the injuries sustained.\u201d When \u201cthe \u2018harm [averred by Sterling] ... is allegedly caused by misappropriation of the [trade secret], not by the advertising itself,\u2019 \u201d it is not based on an injury \u201caris[ing] out of\u2019 an offense committed in the course of advertising activity and thus falls outside the advertising injury clause. <em>Simply Fresh Fruit, Inc. v. Cont\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>94 F.3d 1219, 1222 (9th Cir.1996) (second brackets in original), <em>quoting Microtec Research, Inc. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>40 F.3d 968, 971 (9th Cir.1994). Advertising the results of Response Time\u2019s allegedly anticompetitive recruitment in an effort to solicit customers does not convert the theft into an \u201cadvertising injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Response Time\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the May 1, 2002, summary judgment. <em>See Lolli, </em>351 F.3d at 414. Assuming arguendo that an excerpt of Sterling\u2019s appellate brief in the underlying litigation constituted \u201cnewly discovered evidence,\u201d <em>see </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2), Response Time failed to show that it was \u201cof such magnitude that production of it earlier would have been likely to change the disposition of the case,\u201d <em>Feature Realty, Inc. v. City of Spokane, </em>331 F.3d 1082, 1093 (9th Cir.2003) (internal quotations and citations omitted); <em>cf. Sentex Sys., </em>93 F.3d at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Since Hartford\u2019s basis for denying coverage and not defending Response Time was reasonable under the policy, Hartford did not violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing or commit the tort of bad faith. <em>See Guar. Natl Ins. Co. v. Potter, </em>112 Nev. 199, 912 P.2d 267, 272 (1996). Hartford\u2019s alleged failure to contact Sterling\u2019s counsel to ascertain the exact nature of Sterling\u2019s lawsuit (as well as certain Hartford employees\u2019 alleged unawareness of the decision in <em>Sentex Systems) </em>does not present a triable issue of material fact as to any contractual or extra-contractual liability Hartford would incur for failing to conduct a reasonable inquiry and investigation. <em>See Anthem Elecs., Inc. v. Pac. Employers Ins. Co., </em>302 F.3d 1049, 1054 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">Response Time\u2019s remaining state-law claims likewise are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b761-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
