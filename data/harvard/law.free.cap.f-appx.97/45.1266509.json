He conceded removability, but subsequently applied for asylum based on political persecution. The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied his application, discrediting Mr. Qari\u2019s testimony that there was a political basis for his alleged persecution. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed without opinion. We now deny Mr. Qari\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-17\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b80-18\">Mr. Qari arrived at O\u2019Hare International Mport from Albania on November 12, 1998, and was detained by INS officers who determined that he was attempting to enter the United States with a fraudulent passport. M INS officer, with the help of an interpreter, interviewed Mr. Qari. During the interview, Mr. Qari explained that \u201cthe Mafia\u201d had extorted money from him, and that if he had not closed the store that he owned and left Albania they would have Wiled him. When asked if the Mafia had any connection to the government, he answered \u201c[bjeing that the government is not doing anything how do I know. The government is doing nothing to help me out.\u201d When asked whether he had ever been threatened or abused by members of the government, he said that he had, stating further that \u201c[t]he Albanian government is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>asking why the store is going this way and why I am paying no taxes.\u201d Mr. Qari then clarified that he had in fact paid taxes, and that he left Albania not because he owed taxes but because \u201cthe people are coming asking for more and more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Two and a half months later Mr. Qari applied for asylum, claiming that the government had persecuted him because of his political opinion. Along with his application he submitted a personal statement, alleging that after \u201cthe communists came back into power\u201d in 1997, the local village government targeted him because of his membership in the Republican Party. He stated that he joined the party in 1990 as a young teenager and became increasingly active in 1997 and 1998, when he participated in numerous demonstrations against the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In 1998, his statement continues, local officials retaliated against him for his role in the political demonstrations by stealing from his store, which they threatened to close if he did not produce certain unspecified \u201cpapers.\u201d These threats were followed by a visit from members of a so-called \u201cmafia\u201d with \u201cties to the local village government\u201d who came to the store and extorted money from him at gunpoint. These men returned a second time, and when he did not produce more money, they \u201cpunched [him] in the face and began kicking [him]\u201d and told him \u201cthat the police would not help [him] because they had the right connections.\u201d He determined that he could no longer keep the store open and sold it at the end of September 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Also in September 1998, Mr. Qari stated, he \u201cwas called by the police and threatened with jail\u201d if he continued \u201cto participate in the activities of the opposition parties.\u201d The following month \u201che was chased by the police and shot at\u201d because he \u201chelped to organize counteraction by the Democratic Party\u201d to a government celebration of a former communist dictator. To escape further persecution, he asserted, he fled to Tirana, Albania\u2019s capital, and hid until he could make arrangements to leave for the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">At the hearing before the IJ, Mr. Qari provided more details about the men who extorted money from him, testifying that he recognized one of them as the brother of the \u201csecretary of the party for the village,\u201d and adding that he could not report the men to local government officials, who were all \u201ctheir people.\u201d He testified that he did report the extortion and threats to the leaders of the Republican Party in the nearby city of Korea, but party leaders told him to \u201cforget about this, because nobody can do anything.\u201d He also clarified that he had joined the Republican Party in \u201ceither \u201996 or \u201997,\u201d rather than in 1990 as earlier claimed in his asylum application. At the conclusion of the hearing, the IJ asked Mr. Qari why he did not' mention during his INS interview any of his political activities or any mistreatment he suffered at the hands of the police or local government. Mr. Qari responded that he did not give complete answers at that time because he was \u201cin shock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">In his ruling, the IJ found not credible Mr. Qari\u2019s testimony that there was a political motivation behind the alleged mistreatment. The IJ supported his finding with several reasons: during his initial INS interview at O\u2019Hare, Mr. Qari did not mention any political motivation behind the acts; Mr. Qari failed to bring his father \u2014 who had lived with him in Albania until 1996 \u2014 to corroborate his testimony that he was active in the Republican Party; as for the date when he joined the Republican party, there were inconsistencies in his application, testimony, and party membership documents; and Mr. Qari\u2019s portrayal of the political climate was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>tradicted by a 1997 State Department country report and a 1998 State Department human rights report. The IJ concluded that Mr. Qari\u2019s claims of extortion and beatings constituted attacks by criminals seeking financial gain rather than acts of political persecution, and accordingly denied his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and deferral of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Mr. Qari appealed the IJ\u2019s ruling to the BIA, arguing only that the IJ\u2019s credibility ruling was incorrect and that the judge failed to apply the correct legal standard in addressing his asylum claim. Because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s ruling, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7), we review the IJ\u2019s decision, reversing only if the ruling lacks substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s factual conclusions. <em>See Krouchevski v. Ashcroft, </em>344 F.3d 670, 673 (7th Cir.2003). We review legal conclusions <em>de novo. See Ahmed v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 611, 615 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Mr. Qari first argues that the BIA should not have streamlined his case because the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum was incorrect and the factual and legal questions in his appeal were substantial. A single board member should not affirm an IJ\u2019s decision without opinion if, among other things, the member determines that the decision under review was not correct or that the factual and legal questions raised on appeal are substantial. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7); <em>Georgis v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 962, 966-67 (7th Cir.2003). But Mr. Qari\u2019s challenges make no practical difference here; we review the IJ\u2019s decision directly in a streamlined case, and given the direct review, \u201cour ability to conduct a full and fair appraisal of the petitioner\u2019s case is not compromised.\u201d <em>See Georgis, </em>328 F.3d at 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Mr. Qari next challenges the IJ\u2019s decision to discredit his testimony. He argues first that the IJ should not have found that his testimony was undermined by his decision to not call his father as a witness because his father would not have had anything relevant to say. He next argues that the IJ should not have found that his testimony was contradicted by the State Department reports because those reports were outdated. We review an IJ\u2019s credibility determination deferentially, upholding it as long as it is supported by \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d that \u201cbear a legitimate nexus to the finding.\u201d <em>See Krouchevski v. Ashcroft, </em>344 F.3d 670, 673 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">Regardless of Mr. Qari\u2019s specific challenges on appeal, he does not dispute one of the other independent bases relied upon by the IJ to discredit him \u2014 that during his INS interview Mr. Qari never stated a political basis for his alleged mistreatment. And an IJ may discredit an asylum applicant whose testimony contains multiple inconsistencies, such as differing explanations for leaving the home country. <em>See Oforji v. Ashcroft, </em>354 F.3d 609, 613-14 (7th Cir.2003) (applicant properly discredited when she told INS interviewers that she was seeking asylum solely for economic reasons and then later testified that she fled because of government persecution for her political opinions). When Mr. Qari was asked during his INS interview at O\u2019Hare about any government involvement in the alleged extortion and beating, his answer was that the government\u2019s only interest in him was for his taxes; he did not mention his own political activity or any political motivation for the attacks.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Yet political persecution was the basis for asylum that Mr. Qari advanced in his application. The IJ relied on these inconsistencies in discrediting Mr. Qari\u2019s testimony, and these \u201cspecific cogent reasons ... bear a legitimate nexus\u201d to the denial of his claim. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Mr. Qari also argues that the IJ erred by requiring him to show that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution. Mr. Qari is correct that an asylum applicant need only show that there was a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d of persecution. <em>See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 440, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 484 (1987); <em>Ahmed, </em>348 F.3d at 618. But, contrary to Mr. Qari\u2019s contention, the IJ applied the higher \u201cmore likely than not\u201d standard only to Mr. Qari\u2019s request for withholding of removal, and then correctly stated that \u201cthe burden of proof for asylum is lower than that required for withholding of removal.\u201d <em>See Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Finally, Mr. Qari also argues that his due process rights were violated because the IJ denied him a full and fan-hearing by not allowing a witness to testify and by \u201carticulating prejudice against Petitioner\u2019s use of the term \u2018Mafia\u2019 throughout the hearing.\u201d By not raising these arguments to the BIA, however, Mr. Qari has waived them. <em>See Sayaxing v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 515, 522-23 (7th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Mr. Qari\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b82-7\"> Mr. Qari admits that he understood the questions that he was asked during the INS interview and that he provided truthful answers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
