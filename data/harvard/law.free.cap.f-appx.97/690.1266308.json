May appeals, challenging the district court\u2019s (1) refusal to give May\u2019s requested jury instruction on voluntary intoxication; (2) admission of certain testimony about a group known as the \u201cRed Nation Clique\u201d and May\u2019s membership therein; (3) limitation of May\u2019s cross-examination of an investigating FBI agent; and (4) instruction that the jury should \u201cplease continue [their] deliberations\u201d when, after considering the case for eight hours, the jurors sent a note stating they could not reach a unanimous verdict.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Having reviewed each of these matters for an abuse of discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-18\">First, the jury heard conflicting testimony regarding the amount of alcohol May consumed on the evening of the assault, and the evidence that May was intoxicated was minimal at best. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to instruct the jury regarding voluntary intoxication. <em>See United States v. Phelps, </em>168 F.3d 1048, 1056-57 (8th Cir.1999) (upholding refusal to give instruction where there was evidence of drinking but minimal evidence of intoxication); <em>see also United States v. Nacotee, </em>159 F.3d 1073, 1076 (7th Cir.1998) (\u201cTo warrant a voluntary intoxication instruction, a defendant must produce some evidence she was drunk enough to completely lack the capacity to form the requisite intent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-19\">Second, although we question the probative value of the evidence regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>a 30-second beating that initiates of the Red Nation Clique had to undergo to become members, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in admitting this and other evidence about the group. The court attempted to limit references to the inflammatory word \u201cgang,\u201d and the theme of the trial was not May\u2019s guilt through mere association with the group. <em>Cf. United States v. Roark, </em>924 F.2d 1426, 1432-33 (8th Cir.1991). The witnesses variously described the group as a circle of loyal friends and a \u201csecond family,\u201d evidence that was probative of May\u2019s particular role on the evening in question, the motivation for the assault, and the bias of those members who minimized May\u2019s participation during their testimony. <em>See United States v. McCoy, </em>131 F.3d 760, 761 (8th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>28 F.3d 1487, 1497 (8th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Third, during cross-examination, defense counsel asked whether the investigating agent had received \u201cinformation\u201d that the victim had possessed a gun and had threatened to shoot May. This information derived from the statement of a non-testifying witness who later contacted the FBI and recanted his story. The court prevented further questioning on the matter and ultimately struck on hearsay grounds the testimony pertaining to the victim\u2019s possession of a gun. Although counsel suggests that he was not seeking admission of the statement for the truth of the matter asserted, but \u201cto establish that the government had chosen not to present this evidence,\u201d we conclude that the district court did not abuse its broad discretion in limiting cross examination and in striking the testimony. <em>See United States v. Echols, </em>346 F.3d 818, 821 (8th Cir.2003) <em>(citing Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986)). The government\u2019s decision not to present a particular statement does not automatically render the statement (or testimony about it) admissible, and here we agree that the defense offered the statement for the truth it asserted, otherwise the government\u2019s decision not to present it would have been irrelevant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it instructed the jury to continue deliberations. May admits that the length of the jury\u2019s deliberations were not sufficient to raise an inference of coercion, and we disagree that the court\u2019s \u201cterse\u201d instruction misled the jurors into believing that they had to reach a verdict. Although the court did not give the model charge that we approved in <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>946 F.2d 73, 76 (8th Cir.1991), its short instruction was markedly similar to that referenced in the Eighth Circuit Manual of Model Criminal Jury Instructions, \u00a7 10.03, regarding lack of a unanimous verdict after polling. When viewed in context and in the light of the other instructions, we conclude that the district court\u2019s supplemental instruction was not impermissibly coercive. <em>See United States v. Walrath, </em>324 F.3d 966, 970-71 (8th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-15\">. The Honorable Joan N. Ericksen, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b725-20\">. The jury deliberated throughout a Friday and returned on Monday morning. After being instructed to continue their deliberations, the jury considered the case for another three hours before convicting May.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b726-5\">. The government\u2019s decision not to present a particular piece of evidence is noteworthy only inasmuch as that evidence pertains to a matter at issue. The out-of-court statement in this case could pertain to a matter at issue only if the statement were true.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
