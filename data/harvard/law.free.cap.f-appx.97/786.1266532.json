We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b). We review a denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion, <em>Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 1022, 1024 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Flores-Lima filed his motion to reopen on August 19, 2002, more than 90 days after the BIA\u2019s May 17, 2002 decision. Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen on grounds of untimeliness. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C)(i) (motions to reopen \u201cmust be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be Reopened\u201d); <em>Ekimian v.
