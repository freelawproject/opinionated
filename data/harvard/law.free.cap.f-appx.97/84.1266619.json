Arellano was convicted of first-degree murder in 1989, and was sentenced to a term of 27-years-to-life. Arellano\u2019s habeas petition raises claims of prosecutorial misconduct, improper admission of prejudicial character evidence and ineffective assistance of counsel. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for a limited evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Arellano argues that his due process rights were violated by the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct during closing argument. In order to succeed in his claim, Arellano must show that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 643, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974). During closing arguments, the prosecutor argued to the jury that Arellano\u2019s main alibi witness-his wife\u2019s grandmother-had lied on the stand about Arellano\u2019s whereabouts on the date of the murder. Even though there was no direct evidence of fabrication, the prosecutor recited to the jury an imaginary conversation between Arellano\u2019s wife and her grandmother in which the wife asks the grandmother to commit perjury on Arellano\u2019s behalf. We find these statements by the prosecutor deeply troubling. A prosecutor may suggest that a witness has been untruthful, <em>see United States v. Molina, </em>934 F.2d 1440, 1445 (9th Cir.1991), but he or she may not suggest facts not in evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, while we disapprove of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in this case, we cannot say that it \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make [Arellano\u2019s] conviction a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Donnelly, </em>416 U.S. at 643. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s determination on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Arellano also contends that he was denied a fair trial because of the trial court\u2019s decision to admit irrelevant and prejudicial evidence of his involvement with drugs. As with the prosecutorial misconduct claim, we cannot grant habeas relief based on this ground unless Arellano\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>trial was rendered fundamentally unfair. <em>See Karis v. Calderon, </em>288 F.3d 1117, 1129 n. 5 (9th Cir.2002). Moreover, Arellano must show that any error \u201chad substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)). Even assuming-as did the state appellate court-that the trial court committed error by admitting the contested evidence, we find any error to be harmless under <em>Brecht. </em>The jury in the case had already been presented with substantial evidence of Arellano\u2019s involvement with drugs. In particular, Monica Luna had testified that Arellano had been engaged in drug dealing around the time of the victim\u2019s death. The district court did not err in denying relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Arellano also raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, arguing that his trial counsel performed deficiently in a number of ways. A habeas petitioner alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must first show that the attorney\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The petitioner must then show \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Although we reject most of Arellano\u2019s complaints regarding his trial counsel\u2019s performance,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we conclude that Arellano\u2019s ineffectiveness claim with regard to his trial testimony may meet the <em>Strickland </em>standard. Arellano took the stand in his own defense, but trial counsel never asked him whether he denied committing the crime; nor did he ask him to provide any details about his alibi. The state contends that defense counsel\u2019s actions were part of his trial strategy: it argues that counsel was attempting to limit the scope of cross-examination by his sparse questioning on direct. If that is the case, defense counsel was operating under an erroneous understanding of California law. <em>See People v. Zerillo, </em>36 Cal.2d 222, 223 P.2d 223, 227 (1950) (holding that cross-examination \u201cmay be directed to the eliciting of <em>any </em>matter which may tend to overcome or qualify the effect of the testimony given by [the witness] on [ ] direct examination.\u201d (emphasis added)). \u201cTrial strategy\u201d is not a proper label for an attorney\u2019s action if that action is based on a misunderstanding of the law. <em>See United States v. Span, </em>75 F.3d 1383, 1389-90 (9th Cir.1996) (finding ineffective assistance of counsel where counsel failed to request a jury instruction because of his misunderstanding of the law). However, even if counsel\u2019s handling of Arellano\u2019s testimony on direct examination had been a reasonable tactic, his failure to conduct a more extensive inquiry on redirect cannot be justified on the basis of his trying to limit cross-examination. By the time of Arellano\u2019s testimony on redirect, the prosecutor had already elicited any significant damag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>ing _ information that Arellano\u2019s counsel may have been trying to keep from the jury. On the basis of the record as it stands now, Arellano\u2019s counsel\u2019s decision not to elicit from Arellano a firm statement that he did not commit the crime constituted deficient performance. We note, however, that the record has not been fully developed on this issue, and trial counsel may well have had reasons not evident from the current record to proceed as he did. We therefore remand to the district court for a limited evidentiary hearing on the issue of counsel\u2019s performance during Arellano\u2019s testimony. <em>See Turner v. Duncan, </em>158 F.3d 449, 458 (9th Cir.1998) (remanding for a limited evidentiary hearing on ineffective assistance of counsel claim); <em>see also 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 (stating that Court of Appeals may \u201crequire such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Of course, <em>Strickland </em>requires a showing of prejudice in addition to a showing of deficient performance. If trial counsel\u2019s performance was indeed deficient, we find that Arellano has made the required showing of prejudice. The case against Arellano was not overwhelming: by the prosecutor\u2019s own admission, the case came down to whether Luna or Arellano was telling the truth about the events on May 12, 1988. The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument emphasized the fact that Arellano had not denied committing the crime and had not provided any details about what he was doing in San Jose on the date of the crime. Arellano\u2019s sparse testimony left the jury with little to balance against the prosecution\u2019s eyewitness. We find that any deficient performance by counsel in handling Arellano\u2019s testimony would undermine confidence in the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">We remand to the district court for a limited evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether Arellano\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance in handling Arellano\u2019s testimony was justified on grounds other than his attempt to limit cross-examination. If the district court finds no other justification for trial counsel\u2019s performance, it should grant Arellano\u2019s habeas petition subject to the usual conditions. Costs accessed against the Appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b119-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-26\">. We note that the parties\u2019 filings and most of the record in this case reflects petitioner's last name as \"Arrellano.\u201d However, petitioner\u2019s signature indicates that the name is actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>spelled \"Arellano\u201d and we of course defer to petitioner\u2019s spelling of his own name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b120-6\">. Because Arellano\u2019s habeas petition was filed in 1992, the provisions of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, do not apply to the merits of Arellano's case. <em>See Alcala v. Woodford, </em>334 F.3d 862, 868 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\">. The Supreme Court has long made clear that prosecutors bear an important responsibility in ensuring the integrity of our judicial system. The Court's statement in <em>Berger v. United States, 295 </em>U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935), while addressed to federal prosecutors, is equally applicable to their state counterparts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">The United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute with earnestness and vig- or \u2014 indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">It is fair to say that the average jury, in a greater or less degree, has confidence that these obligations, which so plainly rest upon the prosecuting attorney, will be faithfully observed. Consequently, improper suggestions, insinuations, and, especially, assertions of personal knowledge are apt to carry much weight against the accused when they should properly carry none.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b121-6\">. Contrary to Arellano\u2019s assertions, trial counsel did object to the admission of drug and drug-related evidence, and to Luna\u2019s testimony about fearing retaliation. Trial counsel was therefore not deficient in these areas. Counsel's performance during closing argument was also not deficient: his statements regarding Arellano were clearly attempts to defuse negative evidence about his client. <em>See Yarborough v. Gentry, </em>540 U.S. 1, 124 S.Ct. 1, 6-7, 157 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003). Arellano\u2019s other claims regarding counsel\u2019s failure to request limiting instructions similarly lack merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
