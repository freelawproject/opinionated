Because Nelson\u2019s motion, styled as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion, directly attacked his conviction and sentence rather than any alleged defect in the collateral review process, it amounted to a successive \u00a7 2255 motion that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 207 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 496, 157 L.Ed.2d 395 (2003). We accordingly vacate the order denying the Rule 60(b) motion and remand to the district court with instructions to dismiss the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">In accordance with <em>Winestock, </em>we construe Nelson\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief on appeal as an application to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See id. </em>at 208. In order to obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a movant must assert claims based on either: (1) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review; or (2) newly discovered evidence sufficient to establish that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2) (2000). Nelson does not satisfy either of these conditions. Accordingly, we deny Nelson\u2019s implicit application for leave to file a second \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-15\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART; AUTHORIZATION DENIED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
