Branson appeals the district court order affirming the decision of the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration that applied 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(a), the workers\u2019 compensation offset provision, to his disability award. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-19\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we. do not recount them in detail except as necessary. We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to uphold the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits. <em>Merrill v. Apfel, </em>224 F.3d 1083, 1084 (9th Cir. 2000). We reverse if the Commissioner\u2019s findings of fact are not supported by substantial evidence or if there was legal error. <em>Id. </em>at 1084-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-20\">The parties contest whether Branson\u2019s Oregon workers\u2019 compensation award was reduced because of Oregon\u2019s reverse offset provision. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 656.209(1). The ALJ found that Branson did not establish that the workers\u2019 compensation payments received were for permanent total disability, and did not establish that the insurer applied a Social Security offset to reduce the value of his workers\u2019 compensation award. Thus, he concluded, the Social Security offset provision was properly applied to reduce Branson\u2019s Social Security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-21\">The ALJ\u2019s finding was supported by substantial evidence. The memo by Bran-son\u2019s lawyer reflects only that the adjuster would think about applying the offset. It did not prove that the offset was in fact applied. Furthermore, the inference that the offset may have been applied is refuted by the fact that Branson is not permanently totally disabled. He has returned to the workforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b210-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
