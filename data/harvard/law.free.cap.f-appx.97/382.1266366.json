Defendant\u2019s sole challenge is to the imposition of a two point upward adjustment for reckless endanger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>ment during flight pursuant to \u00a7 3C1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">First, in his guilty plea agreement, Dodd stipulated to the enhancement, i.e., that he had recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person on two occasions, while fleeing from police officers. We have held that a defendant who has entered into a guilty plea agreement may not object to his stipulations on appeal. <em>United States v. Cianci, </em>154 F.3d 106 (3d Cir.1998). The fact that the District Court resolved this aspect of the matter by reference to the oft-quoted Canadian culinary rule \u2014 \u201cwhat\u2019s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander\u201d \u2014 was obviously a shorthand manner of expression and does not undermine the District Court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Second, even if Dodd had not so stipulated, the record fully supports the enhancement. His attempt, on November 15, 1998, to retrieve a gun from his waistband while wrestling with the officers was conduct which could have resulted in the death of one or both officers, or an innocent bystander. Additionally, Dodd\u2019s conduct on April 29, 1999, when, while running from the officers, he threw a 9 millimeter Intratec semiautomatic pistol on the pavement loaded with seven rounds of ammunition, creating the risk that the gun could have accidentally fired thereby severely wounding or killing the officers or an innocent bystander, was also reckless and dangerous. Under these circumstances, the District Court clearly did not err in applying the two-level enhancement for reckless endangerment in computing Dodd\u2019s sentencing guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
