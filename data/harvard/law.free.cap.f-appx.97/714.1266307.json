We review the denial of a habeas petition de novo. <em>See Powell v. Lambert, </em>357 F.3d 871, 874 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Contrary to the State\u2019s argument, Lundquist does not seek the benefit of a new rule of law in violation of <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). It was clearly established by the Supreme Court at the time Lundquist\u2019s conviction became final that jury instructions may not be so infirm as to rob the defendant of the right to have every element of the charged crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Francis v. Franklin, </em>471 U.S. 307, 313-14, 105 S.Ct. 1965, 85 L.Ed.2d 344 (1985); <em>Sandstrom v. Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 521, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979). It was further clearly established that verdict forms are part of the overall charge given to the jury. <em>See Mills v. Maryland, </em>486 U.S. 367, 375-76, 108 S.Ct. 1860, 100 L.Ed.2d 384 (1988). <em>Teague </em>therefore does not bar Lundquist\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Lundquist is not entitled to habeas relief, however. The decision of the Supreme Court of Idaho that Lundquist\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated was neither \u201ccontrary to, [nor] an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\u201d nor was it \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2254(d)(1), (d)(2) (2003). Jury instructions are not to be judged in \u201cartificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.\u201d <em>Cupp v. Naughten, 414 </em>U.S. 141, 147, 94 S.Ct. 396, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973). The Supreme Court of Idaho viewed the \u201coverall charge\u201d to the jury \u2014 the allegedly deficient verdict form and the jury instructions, which Lundquist conceded were proper \u2014 and found that, viewed as a whole, the charge properly informed the jury of the elements of felony-murder. This ruling was supported by the record and was not inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent. The critical question is \u201cnot whether the trial court failed to isolate and cure a particular ailing instruction, but rather whether the ailing instruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process.\u201d <em>Id., </em>414 U.S. at 147; <em>see also Francis, </em>471 U.S. at 315 (\u201cOther instructions might explain the particular infirm language to the extent that a reasonable juror could not have considered the charge to have created an unconstitutional presumption.\u201d). The fact that Lundquist\u2019s verdict form did not list all of the elements for felony-murder, when taken together with the other instructions properly defining felony murder, did not so infect the entire trial that the resulting conviction violated due process. Lundquist\u2019s habeas petition was therefore properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b749-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
