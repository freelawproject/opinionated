We have jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>tion pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility determination, <em>see Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Sood contends that the IJ erred in finding him not credible. We disagree. The IJ found Sood\u2019s testimony implausible and offered specific and cogent reasons for disbelieving him. <em>See id. </em>at 1043. Accordingly, Sood failed to establish eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>No. 03-70477, petitioner\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the motion for stay of removal was granted, or continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, to the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b139-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
