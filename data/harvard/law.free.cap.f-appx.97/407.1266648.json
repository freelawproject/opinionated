He also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Catoe\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although counsel states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, he challenges the district court\u2019s denial of Catoe\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, as well as its application of sentencing enhancements for possession of a dangerous weapon during the commission of a drug offense pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) (2002) and assumption of a leadership role in the offense pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(e). Catoe filed a pro se supplemental brief, in which he also challenged the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing enhancements. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have considered the briefs and examined the entire record for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>meritorious issues. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Where, as here, a defendant who seeks to withdraw his guilty plea before sentencing must demonstrate a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for withdrawal of the plea. Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(e). A \u201cfair and just\u201d reason is one that essentially \u201cchallenges the fairness of the Fed. R.Crim. 11 proceeding\u201d or \u201cchallenges the fulfillment of a promise or condition emanating from the proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Lambey, </em>974 F.2d 1389, 1394 (4th Cir.1992). A court should closely scrutinize the Rule 11 colloquy and attach a strong presumption that the plea is final and binding if the Rule 11 proceeding is adequate. <em>Id. </em>We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>81 F.3d 1300, 1305 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">In determining whether a defendant is entitled to withdraw his guilty plea, the district court must consider (1) whether the defendant has offered credible evidence that his plea was not knowing or voluntary; (2) whether the defendant has credibly asserted his legal innocence; (3) whether there has been a delay between the entry of the plea and the filing of the motion; (4) whether the defendant has had close assistance of competent counsel; (5) whether withdrawal will cause prejudice to the government; and (6) whether it will inconvenience the court and waste judicial resources. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">We find that the district court properly weighed the <em>Moore </em>factors in denying Catoe\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Moreover, a review of the transcript of the guilty plea hearing discloses that the district court fully complied with Rule 11 in accepting Catoe\u2019s guilty plea. The court advised Catoe of the elements of the offense to which he was pleading guilty and concluded he understood them. The court also thoroughly apprised Catoe of the rights he was waiving by pleading guilty and the possible sentences he faced. The court further ascertained that Catoe was entering his plea voluntarily and that he was satisfied with the services of counsel. Thus, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding no \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for the withdrawal of Catoe\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">Moreover, we find that Catoe waived his right to appeal his convictions and sentence either directly or in post-conviction proceedings, with the exception of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct. A defendant may, in a valid plea agreement, waive the right to appeal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 (2000), as long as it is the result of a knowing and intelligent decision to fore-go the right to appeal. <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165 (4th Cir.1991). Because Catoe\u2019s waiver of appellate rights was knowing and intelligent, he may not appeal the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case, including the Rule 11 and sentencing transcripts, and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Catoe\u2019s convictions and sentence, as well as the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court to withdraw from representation at that time. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Catoe.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
