Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 851 (9th Cir.2003), and since we review the merits of the IJ\u2019s decision, we do not address whether the regulatory prerequisites for use of the Board\u2019s streamlining procedure were met. <em>Id. </em>at 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-15\">It was not an abuse of discretion to deny Singh\u2019s motion for change of venue. <em>See Baires v. INS, </em>856 F.2d 89, 92 (9th Cir.1988). Singh\u2019s conclusory reason for requesting a change of venue \u2014 that it would be in the best interests of justice and more convenient for all parties involved since the requested venue is located in the city of his new residence \u2014 failed to establish \u201cgood cause\u201d in light of other relevant factors. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.20(b) (1999) (now codified at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.20(b)). In addition to weighing the inconvenience a last-minute venue change would effect on the court, <em>see Baires, </em>856 F.2d at 92, the IJ also considered that Singh made the motion shortly after the master calendar hearing at which his individual hearing date was scheduled, but never explained why he did not mention his pending move during the calendar hearing. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 93 (stating that the IJ can take into account \u201cunreasonable conduct on the part of the alien\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-16\">It is evident from the record that the IJ did not deny Singh his right to the counsel of his choice, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362; <em>see also 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 3.16(b) (1999) (now codified at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.16(b)), and thus the IJ did not abuse his discretion, <em>see Castro-O\u2019Ryan v. INS, </em>847 F.2d 1307, 1312 (9th Cir.1987), or violate Singh\u2019s due process rights, <em>see Ramirez-Alejandre v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 858, 875 (9th Cir.2003) (en banc) (\u201cAs a predicate to obtaining relief for a violation of procedural due process rights in immigration proceedings, an alien must show that the violation prejudiced him\u201d). The IJ repeatedly told Singh he could be represented by any attorney he wished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>and obtained Singh\u2019s express waiver by directly asking if Singh wished to conduct his removal hearing without counsel or continue the hearing a second time. <em>See Tawadrus v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1099, 1103, slip op. 4961, 4970 (9th Cir.2004), 364 F.3d 1099, 2004 WL 794529, at *3 (9th Cir.Apr.15, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Petition DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b766-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
