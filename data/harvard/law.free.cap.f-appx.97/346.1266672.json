Duncan, </em>333 F.3d 102, 106 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Because the Appellate Division \u201cconsidered [Allen\u2019s] ... contentions, including those raised in his supplemental <em>pro se </em>brief, and [found] them to be without merit,\u201d <em>People v. Allen, </em>558 N.Y.S.2d 121, 122, 163 A.D.2d 396, 398 (1990), the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) applies. <em>See Dallio v. Spitzer, </em>343 F.3d 553, 560 (2d Cir.2003). Under AEDPA, a writ of habeas corpus cannot be granted \u201cunless the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">The trial court\u2019s decision to preclude Foster\u2019s alibi testimony was not contrary to Supreme Court precedent. In <em>Taylor v. Illinois, </em>484 U.S. 400, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988), the Court declined to \u201cdraft a comprehensive set of standards to guide the exercise of discretion in every possible case [of witness preclusion],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 414, instead holding that \u201cthe mere invocation of [the right to call witnesses] cannot automatically and invariably outweigh countervailing public interests,\u201d <em>id. </em>In this case, Foster\u2019s testimony was excluded because of both the trial court\u2019s stated concern for the fair and efficient administration of justice and its concern that a hastily accepted witness would present unreliable evidence and undermine the truth-determining function of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">Similarly, the trial court\u2019s decision not to introduce the grand jury testimony of Iris Taitt was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. Allen does not cite, nor could we find, any Supreme Court case that holds that a trial court\u2019s decision not to introduce grand jury testimony, based, as it was in this case, on the lateness of the application, the cumulative nature of the testimony, and the lack of affidavits supporting Allen\u2019s request, is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-16\">Finally, Allen asks us to address whether the trial court erred in rejecting his request for a continuance to allow Iris Taitt to testify. No certificate of appealability was issued on this issue. \u201cWe will not address a claim not included in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>certificate of appealability.\u201d <em>Armienti v. United States, </em>234 F.3d 820, 824 (2d Cir.2000). We see no reason to deviate from that general rule here.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
