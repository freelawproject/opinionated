FLETCHER, and BERZON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b784-14\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-15\">Ghulam Mustafa, a native and citizen of Pakistan, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) summary affirmance of an Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Reviewing the IJ\u2019s decision, see <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 851 (9th Cir.2003), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-16\">The IJ made an adverse credibility finding against Mustafa. \u201cSo long as one of the identified grounds is supported by substantial evidence and goes to the heart of [a petitioner\u2019s] claim of persecution, we are bound to accept the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Wang v. INS, </em>352 F.3d 1250, 1259 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-17\">The IJ found, with regard to Mustafa\u2019s demeanor, that \u201che became extremely uncomfortable and defensive when asked to provide documents of his parents\u2019 place of birth.\u201d Credibility determinations based on demeanor receive \u201cspecial deference.\u201d <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir.1999). This was an appropriate demeanor finding because it speaks to Mustafa\u2019s visible nervousness, a component of his non-verbal communication. <em>See Arulampalam v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 679, 686 (9th Cir.2003). The finding also \u201cgo[es] to the heart of the asylum claim,\u201d <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992-93 (9th Cir.2003), because documentation about his parents\u2019 place of birth could decisively establish or disprove Mustafa\u2019s status as a Mohajir.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-18\">In a similar vein, the IJ noted, and the hearing transcript confirms, that Mustafa\u2019s explanations for his inability to produce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>such documentation were \u201cvague, implausible, and in some cases incoherent.\u201d Mustafa did not claim that such documentation did not exist or would be difficult to obtain. Rather, he claimed that the documents did exist and that they were located at his parents\u2019 home. He simply provided <em>no </em>explanation as to why his parents failed to send the documents. Such specific instances of unresponsive and implausible testimony support an adverse credibility finding. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1109, 1113-14 (9th Cir.2002) (unresponsiveness); <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001) (implausibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Notably, we do not fault Mustafa for his failure to provide documentation in and of itself, as he was not necessarily required to do so. <em>See, e.g., Garrovillas v. INS, </em>156 F.3d 1010, 1016-17 (9th Cir.1998). Nonetheless, the existence, location, and availability of supporting documentation can \u201cgo to the heart of the asylum claim,\u201d <em>Malhi, </em>336 F.3d at 992-93, as they do in this case, <em>see supra. </em>So Mustafa\u2019s visibly uncomfortable, unresponsive, and implausible testimony on these matters supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Lastly, the record confirms the IJ\u2019s observation that Mustafa\u2019s \u201ctestimony throughout was in fact vague and general.\u201d This is an appropriate consideration in a credibility determination. <em>See SinghKaur, </em>183 F.3d at 1153.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">For the above reasons, the IJ\u2019s credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. We uphold the determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">By failing to qualify for asylum, Mustafa necessarily fails to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003). In addition, Mustafa is not entitled to CAT relief because he did not demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to Pakistan. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2); <em>Malhi, </em>336 F.3d at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b784-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
