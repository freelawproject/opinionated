The Honorable Edward R. Korman, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-11\">. The judge\u2019s instructions stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-12\">[18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959(b)(2)] contains a definition of enterprise and the full definition mentions several kinds of things that can constitute an enterprise, but only one part of the definition is relevant to our case. The statute defines enterprise to include any group of individuals associated in fact, although not a legal entity - in other words, it doesn't have to be a corporation or a partnership. It simply has to be any group of individuals associated together, in fact, although not a legal entity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-20\">Before you came to court and perhaps before you heard the discussion in this case, you may have thought of an enterprise as really generally consisting of a very substantial legitimate business organization. But the statute does not limit the concept of enterprise for the purpose of this law to such substantial organizations. As I have said, it defines enterprise to include any group of individuals associated together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-21\">Now the meaning of enterprise in this statute becomes clear when we recall that the statute speaks of an enterprise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>engaged in racketeering activity. So enterprise means any group of people associated together in any way, however informal, whether young people, old people, or any kind or a variety of persons, when such a group is engaged in racketeering activity.... So an enterprise engaged in racketeering activity simply means a group of people engaged in any of the crimes named above that I\u2019ve named----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">It is sufficient for the enterprise to engage in crimes if the group are associated together and if the group has a common objective or purpose of committing such crime or crimes ... You must find that the Tanglewood Boys was an enterprise engaged in racketeering activity; that is, a group of people associated together for the purpose of engaging in one or more of the crimes that I have listed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-12\">[I]f some people in that shopping center, in that area or even some people in the group were simply playing basketball and doing nothing more, they wouldn\u2019t be part of the Tanglewood Boys as a criminal racketeering enterprise. So you must find that there was, as I\u2019ve indicated in the first element, that there was a Tangle-wood Boys, so to speak, group, devoted to criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">Trial Tr. at 1339-43.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b390-13\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED and the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-15\">Appellant-Defendant John Petrucelli appeals from a judgment of conviction on one-count of murder in aid of racketeering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959(a)(1), following a two-week jury trial in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Thomas P. Griesa, /.).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-16\">Petrucelli raises numerous issues on appeal, principally, that: 1) the District Court provided inadequate instructions to the jury regarding the existence of an enterprise, 2) the District Court permitted the government to introduce evidence on several occasions in violation of the Federal Rules of Evidence, 3) the prosecution was time-barred, 4) and a new trial is warranted because the jury should have been allowed to consider a lesser included offense of manslaughter. We reject each of Petrucelli\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-18\">Petrucelli contends that the district \u25a0 judge, in his closing instructions, failed to define the \u201centerprise\u201d element of the offense completely or accurately, and instead provided only \u201ca deficiently minimalist explanation.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, he asserts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>the judge\u2019s explanation of \u201centerprise\u201d omitted the element of continuity, and that the judge consequently erred in rejecting defense counsel\u2019s request to add the following supplemental language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">An enterprise also includes a group of people who have associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct over a period of time. This group of people, in addition to having a common purpose, must have an ongoing organization, either formal or informal, and it must have personnel who function as a continuing unit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Trial Tr. at 1363-64 (reciting 3 L.Sand, <em>et al., </em>Modern Federal Jury Instructions 1152.07 at p.52-71).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">We review jury charges <em>de novo. United States v. Han, </em>230 F.3d 560, 565 (2d Cir.2000) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Nonetheless, a defendant \u201ccannot dictate the precise language of the charge,\u201d and \u201cif the substance of a defendant\u2019s request is given by the court in its own language, the defendant has no cause to complain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In assessing whether a delivered charge was erroneous, we must \u201creview the instructions as a whole to see if the entire charge delivered a correct interpretation of the law.\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Carr; 880 F.2d 1550, 1555 (2d Cir.1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, \u201c[w]e will not reverse a conviction on the grounds of faulty jury instructions unless the defendant demonstrates prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Orena, </em>32 F.3d 704, 713 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">Taken as a whole, we find that the judge\u2019s charge conveyed the concept of an enterprise accurately. The judge instructed that the purpose of the charging statute was to \u201cdeal with groups that associate together and create an enterprise ... engaged in criminal or racketeering activity.\u201d Trial Tr. at 1343. The judge explained several times that the purpose of the alleged enterprise had to be engaging in crime. <em>Id. </em>at 1341-42. The judge explicitly required the jury to find \u201cthat there was a Tanglewood Boys, so to speak, group, devoted to criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1343. In light of these instructions, it is unlikely that a rational jury could have found the existence of an enterprise without first inferring the requisite element of continuity. In any event, assuming the alleged error occurred, we are not persuaded that Petrucelli suffered prejudice. Indeed, the overwhelming weight of evidence regarding the ongoing existence of the alleged enterprise and its criminal activities is fatal to any claim of prejudice. Not only did the government introduce evidence re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>garding multiple criminal acts committed by members of the group, the government also established that the group ran a substantial bookmaking and loan sharking operation from 1991 to 1996. Against such evidence, there is little concern that a jury might have, as Petrucelli suggests, returned \u201ca guilty verdict based on a series of <em>ad hoc </em>criminal episodes involving Appellant and others that did not have the element of continuity.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14-15. For these reasons, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s jury instruction was adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Next, Petrucelli contends that at trial the District Court improperly admitted various evidence. First, he asserts that the judge erred in allowing overly prejudicial evidence of uncharged criminal conduct, including instances of theft, armed robbery, possession of firearms, bar fights, bookmaking, and loansharking, in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Petrucelli\u2019s counsel failed to object to either the court\u2019s pretrial ruling on the uncharged crimes or the evidence as it was admitted to trial - and he further failed to request a limiting instruction to the jury - we review his claim for plain error. <em>United States v. Aleskerova, </em>300 F.3d 286, 295-96 (2d Cir.2002). It is well-established that an act done in furtherance of a racketeering enterprise is not an \u201c\u2018other\u2019 act within the meaning of 404(b)\u201d because \u201cit is part of the very act charged.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>176 F.3d 52, 79 (2d Cir.1999). Evidence of uncharged criminal conduct may be properly introduced in racketeering prosecutions in order to establish the existence, organization, nature, and membership of the alleged criminal enterprise. <em>See Diaz, </em>176 F.3d at 80 (2d Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>116 F.3d 641, 682 (2d Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Wong, </em>40 F.3d 1347, 1378 (2d Cir.1994).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since the admitted evidence constituted proof of the alleged racketeering enterprise and Petrucelli\u2019s role within that enterprise, we find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Petrucelli also argues that the admission of the criminal acts was unfairly prejudicial in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 403. However, a \u201cdistrict court is obviously in the best position to do the balancing mandated by Rule 403. We will second-guess a district court only if there is a clear showing that the court abused its discretion or acted arbitrarily or irrationally. To avoid acting arbitrarily, the district court must make a conscientious assessment of whether unfair prejudice substantially outweighs probative value.\u201d <em>United States v. Salameh, </em>152 F.3d 88, 110-11 (2d Cir.1998) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). There is no clear showing here that the District Court abused its discretion or acted arbitrarily or irrationally to admit the evidence. The court carefully evaluated the criminal acts proffered by the government and made a conscientious assessment regarding each one. As a result of the court\u2019s analysis, several crimes that the court judged to be overly prejudicial, namely, two murders and an attempted murder, were not admitted. Accordingly, we find that the admission of the uncharged criminal conduct did not constitute an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Second, Petrucelli challenges the District Court\u2019s admission of hearsay evidence \u2014 pursuant to the hearsay exception for coconspirator statements<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 regarding the reaction by the Luchese and Genovese Crime Families to the murder victim\u2019s death, and their ensuing discussions regarding how the issue should be resolved. Of course, \u201c[w]e will not disturb a district court\u2019s findings on [the admissibility of evidence under the coconspirator exception] unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, we find no clear error in the admission of the challenged evidence because there was ample proof that a conspiracy, whose members included Petrucelli, existed to resolve the consequences of his criminal act, and that the statements were made during and in furtherance of that conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Gigante, </em>166 F.3d 75, 82 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Third, Petrucelli argues that the court should not have admitted \u2014 pursuant to the excited utterance exception<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 the hearsay statement of a witness claiming that the murder victim identified Petrucelli as the perpetrator. Given that the murder victim had been stabbed just minutes prior to making the challenged statement, and was almost certainly in a physical state of shock at the time of utterance, we conclude that the exception applies and the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">With respect to Petrucelli\u2019s remaining challenges to other evidentiary decisions by the District Court, we find them to lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Petrucelli argues that, since the indictment against him was initiated more than five years after the murder occurred, the prosecution was time-barred by the applicable five-year statute of limitations. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282. An exception to the statute of limitations is provided under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3281 for \u201cany offense punishable by death.\u201d Petrucelli contends that this exception is inapplicable because none of the aggravating factors which would have justified a death sentence apply to him, and because his indictment did not allege capital murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">The record indicates that Petrucelli never asserted a statute of limitations defense in the District Court. Accordingly, on appeal, he has waived the claim, <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>147 F.3d 172, 177 (2d Cir. 1998), and any error must be reviewed for plain error, <em>United States v. Grammatikos, </em>633 F.2d 1013, 1022 (2d Cir.1980). With respect to the merits, the government argues that the applicability of \u00a7 3281 should be determined by reference to the nature of the offense rather than whether the death penalty was sought or procedurally available. In <em>United States v. Kostadinov, </em>721 F.2d 411 (2d Cir.1983) (per curiam), we construed language identical to \u00a7 3281 in the context of a bail statute authorizing detention for a person charged with an \u201coffense punishable by death.\u201d <em>Kostadinov </em>held that, irrespective of whether the death penalty was sought by the government, the appellant\u2019s crime was properly categorized as being punishable by death simply because the death penalty was authorized by the statute under which the appellant was charged. In accordance with <em>Kostadinov, </em>we find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959(a)(1) describes an offense \u201cpunishable by death\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8281. We therefore conclude that there was no statute of limitations error, and certainly no \u201cplain\u201d error, with respect to the timing of this prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Finally, Petrucelli argues that the jury should have been given the option of returning a manslaughter verdict because manslaughter would have been a lesser included offense if he had been tried for murder in a New York state court. Petrucelli\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>176 F.3d 52, 101 (2d Cir. 1999), where the appellant argued, as Petrucelli does here, that manslaughter should be available to the jury because the predicate murder offense was charged under state law, and state law provided for manslaughter as a lesser included offense to murder. <em>Diaz </em>rejected this argument on the ground that murder in aid of racketeering was \u201ca distinct substantive offense\u201d from murder under state law, and was \u201cnot simply a federalized version of the state crime.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">We have considered Petrueelli\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b392-5\">. Federal Rule of Evidence 403(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHR\">Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts. \u2014 Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.
