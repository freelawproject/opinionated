We disagree because the district court did not err by finding Bateman did not timely notify the government of his intention to plead guilty. <em>See United States v. Narramore, </em>36 F.3d 845, 846-47 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that defendant who pled guilty one week before the scheduled trial date and after the government had begun to seriously prepare for trial was not entitled to the additional one-point adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under 3El.l(b)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b798-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
