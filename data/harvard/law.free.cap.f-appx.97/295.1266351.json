Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. CH844E020386-I-1, 95 M.S.P.R. 295, 2003 WL 22176822 (M.S.P.B. Sept. 16, 2003). Because Johnson\u2019s appeal relies on evidence that is not in the record before us, we must <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-18\">We affirm a decision of the board unless it is found to be \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000). We are \u201cprecluded by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8461(d) from reviewing the factual underpinnings of physical disability determinations, but may address whether there has been a \u2018substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error going to the heart of the administrative determination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marino v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>243 F.3d 1375, 1377 (Fed.Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Anthony v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>58 F.3d 620, 626 (Fed.Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-20\">Johnson asserts that the board erred in affirming OPM\u2019s denial of disability retirement because it failed to take into account her \u201cSocial Security medical documentation\u201d as well as the contents of a telephone interview with an unnamed psychiatrist. It is unclear from the record, however, whether the medical documentation considered by the board in its decision was in fact the Social Security medical documentation to which Johnson refers, whether it comprised merely a part of the Social Security medical documentation, or whether it was evidence submitted separately and distinctly from the Social Security medical documentation. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record concerning a telephone interview, nor does the record reflect that such evidence was properly before the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-21\">In sum, on appeal Johnson does not explicitly allege \u201ca substantial departure from important procedural rights ... or some like error going to the heart of the administrative determination.\u201d To the extent that she implies as much, given the principle that we are to construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally, her lack of evidentiary support undermines her position. <em>See Hughes v. Rowe, </em>449 U.S. 5, 9-10, 101 S.Ct. 173, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980). And we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>are statutorily precluded from conducting the review of the underlying facts that Johnson seeks.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
