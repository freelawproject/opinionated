We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility determination, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. The IJ offered specific, cogent reasons for disbelieving Shad based on inconsistencies between Shad\u2019s testimony and his declarations going to the heart of the asylum claim, including events leading up to his departure, his arrests, and his detentions. <em>See id. </em>at 1043. Accordingly, Shad failed to establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 1045; <em>Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b188-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
