Michigan law applies, as the parties\u2019 contract provides. In this diversity case we look to the forum state\u2019s choice-of-law rules. <em>Patton v. Cox, </em>276 F.3d 493, 495 (9th Cir.2002). Under California law, a choice-of-law provision in a commercial contract is enforced if the chosen state has a substantial relationship to the parties or their transaction unless the chosen state\u2019s law is contrary to a fundamental California policy. <em>Nedlloyd Lines B.V. v. Superior </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number><em>Court, </em>3 Cal.4th 459, 11 Cal.Rptr.2d 330, 834 P.2d 1148, 1151-52 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Plaintiffs principal place of business is in Michigan, so Michigan has a substantial relationship to one contracting party. Also, Michigan\u2019s commercial code is nearly identical to California\u2019s in the relevant particulars, so Michigan law is not contrary to a fundamental California policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">2. Under Michigan law, the lease did not create a security interest. Applying Michigan Compiled Laws \u00a7 440.1201(37), and looking at all the facts in the record, we conclude that the lease is a lease, and is not governed by Article 9 of Michigan\u2019s version of the Uniform Commercial Code. For example, the lessee was entitled to terminate the lease at any time, with 30 days\u2019 notice, and was never obliged or even entitled to take title to the property-</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">3. Plaintiff properly mitigated its damages. First, we decline to reach the argument that the Notice of Default was deficient, because this argument is raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Whittaker Corp. v. Execuair Corp., </em>953 F.2d 510, 515 (9th Cir.1992). Second, Defendant failed to adduce any facts in the summary judgment record to suggest that any of Plaintiffs sales was deficient or produced less than an appropriate amount of offset. Mere speculation that something more might have been accomplished by some other means is not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b201-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
