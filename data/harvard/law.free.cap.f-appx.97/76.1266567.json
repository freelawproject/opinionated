The district court sentenced Aispuro to 63 months imprisonment and 4 years supervised release. Counsel has moved to withdraw on appeal and has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court plainly erred in conducting the plea and sentencing hearings without certified interpreters. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-22\">The Court Interpreters Act requires judicial officers in judicial proceedings instituted by the United States to \u201cutilize the services of the most available certified interpreter, or when no certified interpreter is reasonably available ... the services of an otherwise qualified interpreter.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1827(d)(1). Because Aispuro did not object at the plea or sentencing hearing to the court\u2019s failure to use a certified interpreter \u2014 and in fact approved the interpreters provided \u2014 we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>339 F.3d 725, 728 (8th Cir.2003) (plain error is clear under current law and affects defendant\u2019s substantial rights). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>We find insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the court\u2019s decision to use qualified but uncertified interpreters affected Aispuro\u2019s substantial rights: there is no indication in the record that the interpreters and Aispuro had communication problems, or that any confusion on Aispuro\u2019s part stemmed from any translation error; the plea hearing transcript supports that Aispuro ultimately understood his <em>Alford </em>plea and desired the benefits it yielded; and counsel offers no other evidence that the plea was not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. <em>See id. </em>at 729 (because defendant pointed to no evidence that his plea agreement was not entered into knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently, defendant failed to show that district court\u2019s error in using uncertified interpreters affected his substantial rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">We have reviewed the record independently for any nonfrivolous issues, <em>see Penson v. </em>Ohio, 488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and we have found none.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-15\"><em>. </em>The Honorable Donald E.
