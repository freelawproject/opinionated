We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-24\">Ortiz filed her petition for review over 30 days after the BIA\u2019s final decision on her cancellation of removal application. Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision on her application. <em>See Sheviakov v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-25\">We have jurisdiction over the BIA\u2019s decision denying Ortiz\u2019s motion to reopen, <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b), and we review for an abuse of discretion, <em>see Lin v. Ashcroft, </em>356 F.3d 1027, 1034 (9th Cir.2004). The BIA appropriately denied Ortiz\u2019s motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>reopen because the motion was filed more than 90 days after the BIA mailed notice of its decision to the address of record for Petitioner\u2019s attorney. <em>See Taniguchi v. Schultz, </em>303 F.3d 950, 955 (9th Cir.2002). Furthermore, we do not consider whether Oriz may be entitled to equitable tolling because that issue was not raised before, or considered by, the BIA. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part, and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b824-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
