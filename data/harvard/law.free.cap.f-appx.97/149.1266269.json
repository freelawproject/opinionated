See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b183-24\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-25\">Alberto Padilla-Pedraza appeals the 77-month sentence imposed following his conviction by jury trial for unlawful reentry following deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, and the consecutive 6-month sentence imposed following his admission to violating the terms of his supervised release for a prior conviction of bank robbery. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We affirm in part and vacate in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-26\">Padilla-Pedraza contends that the district court erred when it denied his request for a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. We agree. We review de novo whether a district court misapprehended the law, and we review for clear error its factual determinations with respect to the acceptance of responsibility reduction. <em>See United States v. Cortes, </em>299 F.3d 1030, 1037 (9th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1224, 123 S.Ct. 1333, 154 L.Ed.2d 1084 (2003). The government incorrectly contended at sentencing that Padilla-Pedraza\u2019s decision to go to trial for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>reason other than to assert or to preserve a legal issue not related to factual guilt \u201cdisqualifie[d]\u201d him from consideration for the reduction, <em>see United States v. McKinney, </em>15 F.3d 849, 852-53 (9th Cir.1994), and the district court appeared to simply accept this argument. Because the record fails to make clear whether the district court recognized that Padilla-Pedraza\u2019s decision to go to trial to contest an issue related to factual guilt was not a <em>per se </em>bar to receiving the \u00a7 3E1.1 adjustment, we vacate his 77-month sentence and remand so that the district court may consider all the relevant factors related to the acceptance of responsibility reduction. <em>See id. </em>at 1038-39. We express no opinion on the merits of Padilla-Pedraza\u2019s request for this reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">We reject Padilla-Pedraza\u2019s contention that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence because of his prior conviction for bank robbery. <em>See Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (holding that <em>\u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, </em>any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b183-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
