Rather, he asserts that the sentence is cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, and that the government\u2019s two prior appeals of defendant\u2019s sentence were predicated on racial bias. Neither of these grounds were raised in the District Court. However, we may consider on appeal questions which were not raised in the court below. <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>218 F.3d 615 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The constitutionality of a sentence is a question of law which is subject to <em>de novo </em>review. The statutorily-mandated minimum for an armed career criminal is 15 years or 180 months. That sentence is mandated by Congress. It has been upheld as not being cruel and unusual punishment by this Court. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>22 F.3d 674, 683 (1994); <em>United States v. Warren, </em>973 F.2d 1304, 1311 (1992); <em>United States v. Pedigo, </em>879 F.2d 1315, 1320 (1989). The additional eight months were required in view of defendant\u2019s criminal history and the number of illegally-possessed weapons. We also note that the Supreme Court has upheld, against an Eighth Amendment challenge, a jail sentence of 25 years for a felon who stole three golf clubs where the sentence was a result of the application of the California\u2019s \u201cthree strikes\u201d law. <em>Ewing v. California, </em>538 U.S. 11, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003). We find nothing in the record of this case that would suggest that defendant\u2019s sentence is more cruel and/or unusual than that of the defendant in <em>Ewing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In addition to the Eighth Amendment challenge, defendant asserts that the government\u2019s pursuit of a severe sentence was racially motivated \u201cto punish him more severely than the underlying circumstances warranted.\u201d Charges of racial bias are serious accusations, not to be made or taken lightly. This is especially true when those allegations are directed against public officials. Despite repeated inquiries from this Court, defendant\u2019s counsel was unable to provide a shred of evidence that would substantiate his charge that the government\u2019s conduct in this case was motivated by anything other than its desire to ensure that the district court properly adhered to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court\u2019s failure to sentence defendant as an armed career criminal, required by his state conviction for Attempted Aggravated Burglary, and two breaking and entering of a dwelling convictions, obligated the United States to appeal. While the discovery of defendant\u2019s guns may have come about because his mother-in-law, who is white, provided information of his illegal possession (defendant is Black), she had many other reasons in addition to possible racial bias for being dissatisfied with her son-in-law as itemized in her trial testimony. Defendant points to no other evidence of racial bias in the record of the case. Indeed the defendant acknowledges in his brief that he does not contend that the initial prosecution was racially motivated. Once defendant was convicted, the district court lacked discretion to sentence below the statutory minimum of fifteen years and follow other guideline requirements. The government has an obligation to enforce Sentencing Guideline requirements and congressionally-mandated minimum sentencing statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Moreover, the government could have appealed the third sentence given by the district court because defendant\u2019s criminal history properly scored appears to be category VI rather than category IV. If racial animus was at play in this case, we have no doubt that such an appeal would have been forthcoming. We reiterate, in no uncer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>tain terms, that there is no evidence of racial bias in the actions of the government in this case. We trust that future defendants would abstain from making such unsupported allegations that do nothing but unjustifiably attempt to tarnish the reputation of men and women charged with the enforcement of our laws.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-17\">.
