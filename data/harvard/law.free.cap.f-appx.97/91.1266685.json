The district court did not, however, reach the merits of these rulings, but rather granted the trustee\u2019s motion to dismiss for Eisen\u2019s failure to prosecute, lack of standing, and mootness. We decline Eisen\u2019s invitation to ignore the district court\u2019s order and review the underlying merits of the bankruptcy court\u2019s rulings. Rather, we affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing Eisen\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">1. <em>Failure to Prosecute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-13\">There is no dispute that Eisen did not timely file materials required to perfect his appeal to the district court. Bankruptcy rules specifically provide for dismissal when the appellant fails \u201cto take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal----\u201d Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8001(a). Moreover, factors that we have previously identified as relevant support the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Pagtalunan v. Galaza, </em>291 F.3d 639, 642 (9th Cir.2002) (listing factors), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 909, 123 S.Ct. 1481, 155 L.Ed.2d 230 (2003). \u201c[T]he public\u2019s interest in expeditious resolution of litigation always favors dismissal.\u201d <em>Yourish v. California Amplifier, </em>191 F.3d 983, 990 (9th Cir.1999). Moreover, \u201c[t]he trial judge is in the best position to determine whether the delay in a particular case interferes with docket management and the public interest.\u201d <em>Pagtalunan, </em>291 F.3d at 642. There was prejudice to creditors seeking timely resolution of Eisen\u2019s bankruptcy case. Although there may have been less drastic alternatives available to the district court, prior sanctions imposed upon Eisen apparently have not deterred his litigious nature. Finally, public policy always favors disposition of cases on the merits, but this factor alone is not dispositive. <em>See Rio Properties, Inc. v. Rio Intern. Interlink, </em>284 F.3d 1007, 1022 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-18\">2. <em>Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-19\">The trustee argued below that Eisen lacked standing to appeal the bankruptcy court\u2019s rulings. We agree. As we explained in one of Eisen\u2019s earlier appeals, \u201cEisen, as a debtor, has no standing because ... [the] trustee is the representative of Eisen\u2019s estate.\u201d <em>In re Eisen, </em>31 F.3d 1447, 1451 n. 2 (9th Cir.1994). We further explained that the \u201ctrustee is the representative of the debtor\u2019s estate and has the capacity to sue and be sued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 323). \u201cOnce appointed a trustee, the debtor\u2019s assets and claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>pass to the trastee, making the trustee the proper party in interest, and the only party with standing to appeal the bankruptcy court\u2019s order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">3. <em>Mootness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Finally, the trustee argued there are insufficient funds in the estate to cover administrative expenses and therefore Eisen\u2019s appeal is moot. We agree. <em>See In re P.R.T.C., Inc., </em>177 F.3d 774, 778 n. 2 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201ca debtor cannot challenge a bankruptcy court\u2019s order unless there is likely to be a surplus after bankruptcy\u201d); <em>see also In re Fondiller, </em>707 F.2d 441, 442 (9th Cir.1983) (\u201ca hopelessly insolvent debtor does not have standing to appeal orders affecting the size of the estate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b126-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
