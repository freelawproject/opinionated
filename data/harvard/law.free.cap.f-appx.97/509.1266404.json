The district court correctly dismissed Thomas\u2019s retaliation claim relative to the November 28, 2000, incident because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>Richardson v. Spurlock, </em>260 F.3d 495, 499 (5th Cir.2001). Because Thomas is not entitled to equitable tolling of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)\u2019s exhaustion requirement, he is not entitled to a dismissal of the instant suit without prejudice so that he can exhaust his administrative claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Thomas\u2019s argument that he was deprived the opportunity to object to a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation lacks merit inasmuch as the district court was not required to assign Thomas\u2019s ease to a magistrate judge. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">The district court correctly dismissed as frivolous Thomas\u2019s claim that he was retaliated against on November 12, 2000, because Thomas fails to show retaliatory motive when prison officials placed him in his cell. <em>See McDonald v. Steward, </em>132 F.3d 225, 231 (5th Cir.1998). The district court also correctly dismissed Thomas\u2019s claim that he was retaliated against on November 28, 2000, because he fails to show a retaliatory adverse act stemming from that incident. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">This court need not reach whether Thomas\u2019s damages claim for emotional injury is barred under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e) because Thomas has failed to state a claim for retaliation. <em>See Oliver v. Scott, </em>276 F.3d 736, 746 n. 20 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">Thomas\u2019s claims relative to the disciplinary meeting in his cell following the November 12, 2000, incident are deemed abandoned because he makes no argument on appeal relative to those claims. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-15\">Thomas\u2019s argument about the extension of time in which he had to file a brief are meritless inasmuch as the Clerk\u2019s office accepted his brief for filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-16\">This court affirmed the dismissal of a prior <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP) civil rights suit filed by Thomas as frivolous. Thomas is advised that the district court\u2019s dismissal of the instant complaint for failure to state a claim and this court\u2019s affirmance of that dismissal constitute a second strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Thomas is hereby WARNED that if he accumulates three strikes he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-17\">AFFIRMED; WARNED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b544-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
