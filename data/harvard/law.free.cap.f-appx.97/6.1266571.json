Because we find the bankruptcy court\u2019s order consistent with this court\u2019s decision in <em>Term. Student </em>As<em>sistance Corp. v. Hornsby, 144 </em>F.3d 433, 437 (6th Cir.1998), we affirm the judgment of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">In 1996, Nicole Marie DeMatteis (\u201cDe-Matteis\u201d) graduated near the bottom of the class at Case Western Reserve University Law School with substantial student loan debt. DeMatteis failed the July 1996 Ohio bar exam, and has not taken the exam since then.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">On August 19, 1999, DeMatteis filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. At the time of her filing. DeMatteis\u2019s student loan debt totaled $110,469.38. with PHEAA guaranteeing $83.042.69. The Education Resource Institute (\u201cTERI\u201d) guaranteeing $23,532.50, and Case Western Reserve University (\u201cCWRU\u201d) guaranteeing the last $3,894.19. DeMatteis testified that her monthly student loan payment was approximately $630.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">In issuing its opinion, the bankruptcy court noted that DeMatteis had taken a job as an office manager in a chiropractic office, for which her take-home pay is approximately $1.034.00 per month. The court also found that the \u201c[pjlaintiff does not suffer from any physical, emotional or mental condition that prevents her from obtaining employment.\u201d DeMatteis is single and has no children, lives at home with her parents, and drives her father\u2019s car to work. After analyzing her budget, the bankruptcy court found that her monthly income exceeds her expenses by at least $200, and also found that some of her expenses \u201cappear higher than we customarily see for a person in her circumstances ____ indicating that] Plaintiff would be able to devote at least some of her income toward repayment of the loans without suffering a substantial decline in her standard of living.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-15\">While finding that the debtor did not demonstrate \u201cundue hardship\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(8), the bankruptcy court nonetheless granted a partial discharge of the student loan debt. In a subsequent order, the bankruptcy court fixed the student loan debt payment amount at $200 per month for 10 years, provided that CWRU should be paid in full, and split the remaining funds on a pro rata basis between PHEAA and TERI, resulting in a partial discharge of $67.360.16 owed to PHEAA, and a partial discharge of $19,109.22 owed to TERI.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-16\">On appeal, the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel of the Sixth Circuit (\u201cBAP\u201d) agreed that partial discharge was appropriate, but found that the bankruptcy court should read \u00a7 105 as \u201can overlay\u201d on \u00a7 523(a)(8) to reach this outcome. The BAP found the bankruptcy court erred in deviating from the pro rata rule for repayment of the creditors without justification, and remanded for findings to support its holding that a 10-year repayment period is \u201ctypical.\u201d Following the BAP\u2019s ruling. PHEAA made timely appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-18\">In reviewing bankruptcy cases appealed from district court or the Bankruptcy Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>pellate Panel, this court focuses its review on the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision, analyzing findings of fact for clear error, and conclusions of law <em>de novo. In re Federated Dept. Stores, Inc., </em>270 F.3d 994, 1000 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">The Bankruptcy Code provides that student loan indebtedness is not dischargeable in Chapter 7 bankruptcy unless the failure to discharge would impose an \u201cundue hardship\u201d on the debtor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">(a) A discharge under ... this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">(8) for an educational benefit overpayment or loan made, insured or guaranteed by a governmental unit, or made under any program funded in whole or in party by a governmental unit or nonprofit institution, or for an obligation to repay funds received as an educational benefit, scholarship or stipend, unless excepting such debt from discharge under this paragraph will impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor\u2019s dependents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(8). The term \u201cundue hardship\u201d is not defined in the statute. While this court has not adopted a single test for \u201cundue hardship,\u201d it has frequently looked to the test announced in <em>Brunner v. New York State Higher Educ. Serv. Corp., </em>831 F.2d 395 (2d Cir.1987). The <em>Brunner </em>test requires the debtor to demonstrate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">(1) that the debtor cannot maintain, based on current income and expenses, a \u201cminimal\u201d standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the loans; (2) that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period ...; and (3) that the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the loans.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-9\"><em>In re Chessman, </em>25 F.3d 356, 359 (6th Cir.1994) <em>(quoting Brunner, </em>831 F.2d at 396). In addition to the <em>Brunner </em>factors, this court has looked to objective factors, including \u201cthe debtor\u2019s income, earning ability, health, educational background, dependents, age, accumulated wealth, and professional degree.\u201d <em>In re Rice, </em>78 F.3d 1144, 1150 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">Applying the <em>Brunner </em>test to the facts of this case (that is, a graduate with a monthly surplus essentially attributable to the generosity of her parents), the bankruptcy court found this \u201ca very close case,\u201d but determined that DeMatteis did not meet the bankruptcy code\u2019s requirement of demonstrating the \u201cundue hardship\u201d requisite to permit the discharge of otherwise nondischargeable student loan debt. Nonetheless, the court concluded \u201cthat Plaintiff will be unable to pay off her loans entirely, even if she enters into a thirty (30) year repayment plan.\u201d Because the bankruptcy court found that such a result would be \u201ccontrary to the purposes and provisions of the bankruptcy code,\u201d the court, relying on what it characterized as \u201cdicta\u201d from this court\u2019s decision in <em>Hornsby, </em>144 F.3d at 437, opted to provide partial discharge of the debt pursuant to the bankruptcy court\u2019s 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105 equitable powers. The BAP agreed with the partial discharge outcome, but disagreed with the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that it must resort exclusively to \u00a7 105(a) to achieve partial discharge. Rather, relying on <em>Hornsby, </em>the BAP asserted that \u201c[s]ection 105(a) may appropriately be used when the trial court finds that some remedy is appropriate but that full discharge is not called for, an interpretation that allows an overlay of \u00a7 105(a) on \u00a7 523(a)(8) rather than an independent application of \u00a7 105(a).\u201d The court suggests that, while the debtor may not have established undue hardship for total discharge, the facts alleged may nonetheless demonstrate suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>cient undue hardship to grant partial discharge. Accordingly, the BAP suggests that \u00a7 523(a)(8) does not create an all-or-nothing discharge provision, at least when read with the \u201coverlay\u201d of \u00a7 105(a) equitable powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Appellant argues that the bankruptcy court and the BAP erred, because \u201cone cannot read <em>Hornsby </em>as authorizing partial discharge.\u201d According to Appellant, all that <em>Hornsby </em>authorizes is use of equitable powers to structure repayment of nondischarged student loan debt. We disagree. One <em>can </em>read <em>Hornsby </em>as authorizing partial discharge. In <em>Hornsby, </em>this court found that the bankruptcy court had erred in finding that the debtor was entitled to a full discharge based upon \u201cundue burden,\u201d but expressed the opinion that the court had \u201cthe power to take action short of total discharge.\u201d 144 F.3d at 438. Relying on \u00a7 105(a), the court found that \u201c[i]n a student-loan discharge case where undue hardship does not exist, but where facts and circumstances require intervention in the financial burden on the debtor, an all- or-nothing treatment thwarts the purpose of the Bankruptcy Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439. While conceding that the scope of the court\u2019s equitable power in student-loan discharge cases is as yet \u201cundefined,\u201d the court cited with approval the equitable remedies that have been crafted by courts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">[S]ome bankruptcy courts have thus given a debtor the benefit of a \u201cfresh start\u201d <em>by </em>partially discharging loans, whether by discharging an arbitrary amount of the principal, interest accrued, or attorney\u2019s fees; by instituting a repayment schedule; by deferring the debtor\u2019s repayment of the student loans; or by simply acknowledging that a debtor may reopen bankruptcy proceedings to revisit the question of undue hardship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 440. Immediately following this list, the court concluded that \u201cpursuant to its powers codified in \u00a7 105(a), the bankruptcy court here may fashion a remedy allowing the Hornsbys ultimately to satisfy their obligations to [the lender] while at the same time providing them some of the benefits that bankruptcy brings in the form of relief from oppressive circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Although the <em>Hornsby </em>decision is not perfectly clear on the question of partial discharge, the best reading is that <em>Hornsby </em>does in fact contemplate partial discharge under \u00a7 105. While this court\u2019s review focuses, as it must, on the decision of the bankruptcy court, it should be noted that the BAP\u2019s finding that \u00a7 523(a)(8) does not require an all-or-nothing approach when read with a \u00a7 105 overlay does not find support in Hornsby, which rather relies exclusively on \u00a7 105 for the authority to grant partial discharge. Accordingly, based upon this court\u2019s prior binding decision in <em>Hornsby, </em>we reject the overlay theory of the BAP in favor of the independent \u00a7 105 equitable grounds theory relied upon by the bankruptcy court. We therefore affirm the judgment of the bankruptcy court regarding the partial discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">I write separately in this section to clarify why I believe this circuit has made a serious misstep in traveling down the road begun with <em>Hornsby. </em>Contrary to characterizations made by counsel at oral arguments, DeMatteis\u2019s student loan guarantors are not weasels or feral cats \u2014 or even stoats \u2014 seeking to prey upon the fledgling DeMatteis, who has been prematurely pushed <em>from her nest. </em>Rather, they are corporations which have chosen to secure DeMatteis\u2019s loan debt on terms which were quite favorable to DeMatteis. The generous terms of the federal loan program are undoubtedly based-at least in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>parU-on the fact that discharge of student loan debt under the bankruptcy code is only allowed under very narrow circumstances, thereby limiting the number of situations in which a guarantor, or ultimately the taxpayer, will be left to pick up the tab. This policy decision was codified by Congress in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(8), which made federally subsidized student loan debt non-dischargeable except in extraordinary circumstances where \u201cexcepting such debt from discharge under this paragraph will impose an undue hardship....\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(8). The term \u201cdebt\u201d here is unitary, and not susceptible to \u201cpartial\u201d debt readings. When Congress wanted to permit partial discharge, it made that obvious through such language as \u201cto the extent,\u201d which Congress used elsewhere to modify the term debt. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(2), 523(a)(5), and 523(a)(7). Here, the term \u201cdebt\u201d is used in the general, \u00a7 101(5) sense: as a liability based on a claim, rather than some portion thereof.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the plain language of \u00a7 523(a)(8) governs the dischargeability of student loan indebtedness and does not permit partial discharge, the plain language of \u00a7 105 makes clear that the court\u2019s equitable powers cannot include the ability to partially discharge student loan debt. <em>See 11 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 105 (recognizing equitable powers \u201cnecessary and appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title\u201d). Where, as here, the' equitable remedy stands in direct conflict with a dictate of the code, such remedy cannot be \u201cappropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">That \u00a7 105 does not permit equitable remedies which violate the code is in keeping with the common law origins of equity. Equity is not the source of substantive rights and privileges, but rather is a class of <em>remedy. </em>Where, as here, the legislature has expressly specified that there is no right or privilege to a discharge for student loan debt except in cases of undue hardship (and then only for the total debt), the court may not look to a remedy to create such a right or privilege. Put more simply, the remedy here has nothing to which it may attach-there is nothing <em>to </em>remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Yet in <em>Hornsby, </em>this court found that a general theory of equity arising from \u00a7 105 is sufficient to overcome the clear and contrary language of \u00a7 523(a)(8) and to therefore permit partial discharge. I disagree, as do numerous other courts which have examined this issue. <em>See, e.g., In re Roach, </em>288 B.R. 437, 447-48 (Bankr.E.D.La.2003) (disagreeing with <em>Hornsby, </em>and finding no \u201cbasis either in the language of the Bankruptcy Code, or in the reasoning of these decisions that would allow a partial discharge of a student loan\u201d) (footnote omitted); <em>Illinois Student Assistance Com\u2019n v. Cox, </em>273 B.R. 719, 723 (N.D.Ga.2002) (rejecting partial discharge theory based in part on the fact that \u201c[u]sing \u00a7 105(a) to infuse general equitable powers into the mix, which would permit student loan dischargeability upon a lesser showing, would thus conflict with the specific mandate in \u00a7 523(a)(8)\u201d); In <em>re Broum, </em>249 B.R. 525, 530-31 (Bankr. W.D.Mo.2000) (rejecting the partial discharge theory, and noting the lack of any Eighth Circuit authority supporting such a theory); and <em>In re Hawkins, </em>187 B.R. 294, 300 (Bankr.N.D.Iowa 1995) (rejecting the partial discharge theory in favor of \u201can all- or-nothing proposition\u201d); <em>but see In re Saxman, </em>325 F.3d 1168, 1173 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>2003) (agreeing with <em>Hornsby </em>regarding the availability of partial discharge).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The court in Coa; was correct in noting that permitting partial discharge is \u201ctantamount to judicial legislation and is something that should be left to Congress, not the courts.\u201d <em>Cox, </em>273 B.R. at 723 (quotation omitted). I am nonetheless bound by the decision in <em>Hornsby, </em>which I join the court in applying today. Perhaps the full court will one day wish to examine the <em>Hornsby </em>line of cases, given the conflict between the law of this circuit and the plain language of the bankruptcy code, as well as the disagreement between this circuit and numerous other courts which have interpreted this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the bankruptcy court regarding the availability of partial discharge is AFFIRMED, and the case is REMANDED to the bankruptcy court for proceedings consistent with this order, and consistent with the remand required by the BAP\u2019s November 30, 2001 order, which applied to issues not appealed to this court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b44-6\">. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(5)(A) defines a claims as a \"right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b45-8\">CLAY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AgH\">concurring in</p>\n<p id=\"AUh-\">part, joined by</p>\n<author id=\"AzzH\">KEITH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">I join Judge Batchelder\u2019s majority opinion, except as to section III.
