He contends that the district court erred in denying him a downward adjustment for his role in the offense. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-23\">In his plea agreement, Chairez stipulated that no specific offense characteristics applied to his case and that his final offense level would be 29, with a base offense level of 34, a 2-level reduction under the safety valve provision, and a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Accordingly, he filed a motion for a downward departure, not a downward adjustment, for his role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-15\">We lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s discretionary denial of a downward departure. <em>See United States v. Campos-Fuerte, </em>357 F.3d 956, 961 (9th Cir.2004). Chairez is bound by the terms of his plea agreement and thus cannot argue that he is entitled to a downward adjustment for his role in the offense. <em>See United States v. Sandoval-Lopez, </em>122 F.3d 797, 800 (9th Cir.1997). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"An_\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
