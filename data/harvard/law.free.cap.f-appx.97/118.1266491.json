Magill, Senior U.S. Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b152-23\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-24\">In 1998, plaintiffs moved for a contempt citation against certain defendants. Plaintiffs accused the defendants of concealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>the fact that certain male-dominated classes of workers had not been counted in computing compliance with a consent decree entered by the parties in 1988, and in securing a general release from plaintiffs in 1989. The district court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion, and they appealed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Generally, we review a district court\u2019s decision on a motion for contempt for abuse of discretion, and affirm the underlying factual findings in the absence of some clear error. <em>See FTC v. Affordable Media, </em>179 F.3d 1228, 1239 (9th Cir.1999). Likewise, where a district court decides whether a settlement agreement bars certain claims in light of the prior and current litigation, we \u201cgive great deference to the district court and reverse only for clear error.\u201d <em>Petro-Ventures, Inc. v. Takessian, </em>967 F.2d 1337, 1340 (9th Cir.1992). Questions concerning a district court\u2019s interpretation of a consent decree are reviewed <em>de novo, </em>but deference to the district court\u2019s construction is appropriate when the district judge exercised \u201cextensive oversight of the decree from the commencement of the litigation to the current appeal.\u201d <em>Nehmer v. Veterans Admin, of the United States, </em>284 F.3d 1158, 1160 (9th Cir.2002) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">After considering the litigation history, the district court here determined that the 1989 general release barred the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of contempt. We are not persuaded that the district court\u2019s conclusion on this point was clearly erroneous, nor can we say that permitting rescission of the general release would be equitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Even if the general release did not waive plaintiffs\u2019 claims regarding the alleged miscounting of mechanics or permissive-rule registrants after 1989, plaintiffs have failed to meet their heightened burden of showing that the defendants\u2019 interpretation of the consent decree was unreasonable. <em>See Go-Video, Inc., v. Motion Picture Ass\u2019n of Am., </em>10 F.3d 693, 695 (9th Cir.1993). Indeed, it would be less than rational to expect defendants to regulate the gender percentages of longshore worker registrants if the ratio could be impacted by decisions over which the defendants have no control. Finally, plaintiffs have waived or abandoned arguments challenging the district court\u2019s findings regarding the Bowers class by not including such arguments in their opening brief. <em>See Kohler v. Inter-Tel Techs., </em>244 F.3d 1167, 1182 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Paciulan v. George, </em>229 F.3d 1226, 1230 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b152-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>cation and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
