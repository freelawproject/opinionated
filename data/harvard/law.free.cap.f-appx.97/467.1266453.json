Because Ramos-Lira did not object to the district court\u2019s alleged errors at the revocation hearing, they are reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 930 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The record in this case demonstrates that the district court implicitly considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it sentenced Ramos-Lira. The district court was informed of the nature and circumstances of the original conviction, the instant violations, the pending indictment, and Ramos-Lira\u2019s criminal history. In fact, the district judge who revoked Ramos-Lira\u2019s supervised release was the same judge who presided over the case that formed the basis for his revocation. Further, the district court was aware of Ramos-Lira\u2019s mental difficulties as evidenced by defense counsel\u2019s statements at the revocation hearing. The district court acknowledged the pertinent guideline policy statements when it found the applicable violation grade and criminal history category. The district court\u2019s decision to depart from the suggested guideline range of 12 to 18 months and impose a 24-month sentence with no further supervised release implies that it took into consideration Ramos-Lira\u2019s recidivism and the need to deter further criminal conduct. This court presumes that the district court knew the applicable law and there is no contrary indication in the record to suggest that it did not at least implicitly consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d at 930; <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Losoya, </em>219 F.3d 437, 440 (5th Cir.2000). Therefore, Ramos-Lira has not demonstrated plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The Government concedes, however, that the district court did not state the reasons for Ramos-Lira\u2019s sentence as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). Nevertheless, assuming that the district court\u2019s failure to state the reasons for the sentence was a clear and obvious error, Ramos-Lira has not shown that this error affected his substantial rights or the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceeding. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d at 931; <em>Izaguirre-Losoya, </em>219 F.3d at 441-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b501-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
