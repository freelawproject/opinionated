After careful review of the record and applicable law, <em>see Heartland Acad. Cmty. Church v. Waddle, </em>335 F.3d 684, 689-90 (8th Cir.2003) (standard of review for appeal from preliminary injunction), we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the district court had statutory authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345 to issue the injunction which is the subject of this appeal; that the court did not abuse its discretion in issuing the injunction, in light of the evidence offered by the government; and that the scope of the injunction was proper, given Liner\u2019s refusal to offer rebuttal evidence as to the source of the frozen assets, and the court\u2019s allowance of funds for Liner\u2019s living expenses. Liner\u2019s remaining arguments provide no basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-27\">.
