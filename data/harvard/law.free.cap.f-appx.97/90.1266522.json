Nor does appellant claim that the state appellate court acted contrary to or unreasonably applied any decision of the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">We do not defer to findings arrived at through factfinding procedures that are \u201cclearly inadequate.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But none of the flaws in the trial court\u2019s procedures that Robey alleges makes those procedures clearly inadequate. The state trial judge had to decide which of two jurors was telling the truth about what one of them said to the other privately in the hall before trial commenced. Asking them both, and then asking the jury foreman and another juror about'what had been said during deliberations on the same subject, was not clearly inadequate for purposes of making that determination, particularly because the judge had the benefit of his own previous colloquy with juror Marshal on the same general subject. Thus, we apply the level of deference that our case-law and the habeas statute require, and we find no \u201cmanifest error.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">AFFIRM1ED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b124-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AR\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b125-10\">. <em>Torres v.
