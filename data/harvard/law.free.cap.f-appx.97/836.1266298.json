R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-19\">Defendant Abel Saenz, a federal prisoner appearing pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. Saenz contends that the district court erred in ruling that his issues had been raised and decided on direct appeal. This court granted an application for a certificate of appealability and we now affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-21\">Saenz and three co-defendants were charged with federal drug crimes. Saenz entered into a plea agreement under which he pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute or possess with intent to distribute 500 or more grams of cocaine. The plea agreement indicated that, under the tentative computation of his criminal history, the estimated offense level could result in a sentencing range of 46 to 115 months and that the career criminal offender adjustment under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1 did not apply.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>The agreement also stated that it was \u201cnot conditioned on the defendant being in a particular history category,\u201d R., Vol. 1, Doc. 69 at 8; that the United States Probation Office would \u201cfurther investigate [defendant\u2019s] criminal history,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 7; and that the court \u201cmay impose any sentence, up to the statutory maximum,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">In preparing its presentence report, the probation department discovered a New Mexico felony drug conviction, which together with two already-known Colorado felony drug convictions, triggered the operation of the career-offender enhancement provisions of USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. Based on this discovery, the presentence report recommended the classification of Saenz as a career offender and a corresponding sentencing range of 188 to 235 months. The government advocated application of the revised calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">The proposed increase in sentencing range led to a series of hearings. At the first hearing, Saenz did not formally seek to withdraw his guilty plea, but he asserted that the government should be compelled to comply with the sentencing range stated in the plea agreement. At Saenz\u2019s request, his attorney moved to withdraw from the case. The court continued the sentencing proceeding so that the probation department could gather more information about Saenz\u2019s criminal history. During a second hearing, the court granted the attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw and again continued the proceedings, this time to allow Saenz to obtain replacement counsel. At the final sentencing hearing, Saenz\u2019s new attorney asked to withdraw the guilty plea. The court denied the motion and, after allowing for a downward departure for substantial assistance, sentenced Saenz to 159 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">Saenz filed a direct appeal. He argued that he should have been permitted to withdraw his plea because the government violated the agreement when it \u201cagreed with the probation department\u2019s recommendation that he in fact be sentenced as a career offender.\u201d <em>United States v. Saenz, </em>10 Fed.Appx. 701, 707 (10th Cir. May 8, 2001) (unpublished). In evaluating the district court\u2019s denial of the motion, this court looked at seven factors, including \u201c \u2018whether the plea was knowing and voluntary\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018the quality of the defendant\u2019s assistance of counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707-08 (quoting <em>United States v. Siedlik, </em>231 F.3d 744, 749 (10th Cir.2000)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This court decided that none of the factors favored allowing withdrawal of the plea and found no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of the motion. <em>Id. </em>at 708. Specifically, we determined that \u201cthe plea was knowing and voluntary, in the sense that Mr. Saenz had read and understood its terms and was not coerced into making it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>With regard to counsel\u2019s advice about a potential sentence, we specifically noted that \u201calthough Mr. Saenz asked to have his first attorney released, there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>evidence that he was ineffective in anyway.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Saenz then filed his \u00a7 2255 motion. In a brief order, the district court denied the motion on procedural grounds, without reaching the underlying constitutional claims. The denial was based on a determination that the motion was \u201canother attempt to litigate the same issues that were resolved\u201d in the direct appeal. R., Vol. 2, Doc. 192. This appeal followed. Since Saenz raises only questions of law, we review the district court\u2019s order de novo. <em>United States v. Mora, </em>293 F.3d 1213, 1216 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 961, 123 S.Ct. 388, 154 L.Ed.2d 315 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">A defendant may not assert issues in a \u00a7 2255 motion which have been considered on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Warner, </em>23 F.3d 287, 291 (10th Cir.1994).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We therefore examine each of Saenz\u2019s claims to determine if the district court was correct in deciding that it had been previously resolved. We note, however, that many of Saenz\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claims rely on allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. The general rule is that this court addresses ineffective assistance of counsel claims in collateral proceedings, not on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Montoan-Herrera, </em>351 F.3d 462, 465 (10th Cir.2003) (citing <em>United States v. Galloway, </em>56 F.3d 1239, 1240 (10th Cir.1995) (en banc)). Only in \u201crare instances\u201d does an ineffective assistance of counsel claim \u201cneed no further development prior to review on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Galloway, </em>56 F.3d at 1240. The \u201cexception to the rule exists when \u2018the record is sufficient, or where the claim simply does not merit further factual inquiry.\u2019 \u201d <em>Montoan-Herrera, </em>351 F.3d at 465 (quoting <em>United States v. Gordon, 4 </em>F.3d 1567, 1570 (10th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">Saenz\u2019s primary assertion, set out most fully in his first claim, is that he entered into an involuntary guilty plea as the result of (1) misleading statements by the court, the government, and counsel on the severity of the sentence he would receive upon his guilty plea; (2) his inability to use and understand English, coupled with his attorney\u2019s lack of Spanish-speaking capability; and (3) ineffective assistance of trial counsel. On direct appeal, the record was sufficient for us to reject Saenz\u2019s assertion that he was misinformed or misled about the length of his prospective sentence. The district court correctly ruled that Saenz may not resurrect this theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-13\">However, additional aspects of Saenz\u2019s initial claim are raised for the first time in his \u00a7 2255 motion. Saenz claims that his difficulty with the English language prevented his understanding of the proceedings. He also contends that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective in ways unrelated to the length of the sentence: incorrect guidance on the reversibility of the plea agreement; failure to investigate, research, or discuss the relevant facts and law; and concurrent representation of a co-defendant. None of these issues could have been resolved upon the record compiled on direct appeal. We therefore remand these portions of the first claim, and similar assertions set out <em>in </em>the second and fifth claims, for further development of the record and a dispositive ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-14\">Saenz\u2019s motion also asserts two interrelated claims for relief that were not addressed on direct appeal, but neverthe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>less may be decided in this \u00a7 2255 appeal without further factual inquiry. In claims three and four, Saenz asks this court to set aside one of the Colorado state convictions which entered into his criminal history calculation or, alternatively, abate his \u00a7 2255 action while he collaterally attacks the conviction in state court. A defendant may challenge a previous conviction in a later sentencing proceeding only by showing <em>\u201ca </em>jurisdictional defect resulting from the failure to appoint counsel at all.\u201d <em>Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 496, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994). Other constitutional errors, including \u201cclaims of ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d and \u201cfailure to assure that a guilty plea was voluntary,\u201d are immune from collateral attack in a sentencing proceeding. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Garcia, </em>42 F.3d 573, 580-81 (10th Cir.1994) (discussing Custis). Saenz\u2019s assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel in the state case does not undermine the federal career-offender enhancement. Accordingly, we need not either analyze the course of the state criminal proceeding or abate this action while the state system does so.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">To summarize, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Saenz\u2019s first and fifth claim to the extent that they rely on allegations of misleading statements and ineffective assistance of counsel related to the length of Saenz\u2019s sentence upon entry of the guilty plea. We also affirm the dismissal of his third and fourth claims, which challenge the Colorado state criminal eonviction. The remainder of Saenz\u2019s first and fifth claims, along with his second claim alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, are remanded for further development of the record and a determination on the merits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order and judgment. Saenz\u2019s motion to supplement the record on appeal with exhibits is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b871-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-24\">. USSG \u00a7 4B1.1(a) provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b871-25\">A defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b872-7\">. The remaining factors reviewed by the court were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-10\">\u201c(1) whether the defendant asserted his innocence; (2) whether the government will be prejudiced if the motion is granted; (3) whether the defendant has delayed in filing the motion; (4) the inconvenience to the court if the motion is granted; ... and [(5)] whether the granting of the motion would cause a waste of judicial resources.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 707-08 (quoting <em>Siedlik, </em>231 F.3d at 749).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b873-8\">. An exception to the rule, not applicable in the instant case, occurs when there has been an intervening change of law. <em>Warner, </em>23 F.3d at 291 (citing <em>United States v. Prichard, </em>875 F.2d 789, 791 (10th Cir.1989)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b874-7\">. In his opening brief, Saenz appealed the dismissal of a sixth claim, which alleged that his trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to challenge the lack of notice of the government\u2019s intent to seek the career-offender sentence enhancement. Saenz\u2019s reply brief concedes that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a) does not require notice in his situation and asks to</p>\n<p id=\"b874-19\">withdraw the issue from our consideration. Accordingly, we do not address this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-20\">Saenz has also asserted that he was denied due process by the manner in which the district court adjudicated his motion to vacate. In light of our resolution of his res judicata issues, we need not reach this contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
