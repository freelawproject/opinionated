We dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-29\">Sanchez-Sanchez contends that the district court improperly concluded that it did not have discretion to grant a downward departure based on the fact that his predicate felony offense was outside the \u201cheart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>land\u201d of cases subject to a sixteen-level enhancement under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), and that his criminal history was over-represented. We disagree. Our review of the record indicates that the district court was aware of its authority to depart downward, but concluded that a departure was not warranted given Sanchez-Sanchez\u2019s criminal history and behavior. Because the district court recognized its authority to depart downward, but declined to do so, we cannot review the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See United States v. Romero, </em>293 F.3d 1120, 1126-27 (9th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1144, 123 S.Ct. 948, 154 L.Ed.2d 844 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b799-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
