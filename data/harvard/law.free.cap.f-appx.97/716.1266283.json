Pittman, a Washington state prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s judgment denying his petition for writ of habeas corpus, brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>\u00a7 2254. Pittman\u2019s habeas petition alleged that his federal constitutional right to due process was violated by the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing argument. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision to deny the habeas petition, <em>Clark v. Murphy, </em>331 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir.2003), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Pittman argues that his right to due process was violated because the prosecutor during final argument improperly commented on Pittman\u2019s decision not to testify. Prosecutorial comments on a defendant\u2019s silence violate the Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965); <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 619, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The prosecutor skated close to the constitutional line in commenting that there were only two witnesses (i.e., the victim and the defendant) and that the victim had testified. Although not a direct comment on Pittman\u2019s failure to testify, the prosecutor\u2019s statement might imply that negative inferences could be drawn from Pittman\u2019s silence. The state court of appeals held, however, that if the prosecutor\u2019s statement was error, it was not significant and was cured by the trial court\u2019s instruction that Pittman\u2019s silence could not be used to infer guilt or prejudice him. The state court\u2019s decision was not contrary to, and did not involve an objectively unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). The remark was a small part of a long argument, and was neither repeated nor emphasized. The trial court properly instructed the jury. We conclude, therefore, that the prosecutor\u2019s statement could not have \u201c \u2018had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)). Habeas relief on this ground is therefore precluded. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">Finally, Pittman argues that his right to due process was violated when the prosecutor characterized his behavior as \u201ctypical grooming behavior for people who prey on children,\u201d even though no expert testimony had been offered on the subject. The prosecutor, however, was merely rebutting the defense counsel\u2019s argument that the victim had fabricated his testimony. Even if we were to assume (without deciding) that the prosecutor\u2019s lone remark was improper under state rules of evidence, the remark cannot be said to have \u201c \u2018so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986) (quoting <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 643, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974)). The state court\u2019s adjudication of this claim was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b750-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
