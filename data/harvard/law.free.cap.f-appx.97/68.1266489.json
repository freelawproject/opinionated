The Tax Court held, <em>inter alia, </em>that the doctrine of res <em>judicata </em>barred taxpayers from contesting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>amount owed because the court had previously entered stipulated decisions against taxpayers that determined the taxes that are the subject of the dispute here.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">We have carefully examined the record and conclude that the Tax Court correctly applied the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>in this case. We therefore affirm on the basis of its well-reasoned decision. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
