In May 2003 the district court dismissed Tylon\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A for failure to state a claim, holding that Tylon\u2019s arguments relating to the search or arrest were time-barred and those relating to the use of evidence against him were premature because the criminal proceedings against him had not yet been completed. Tylon did not appeal but instead, 23 days after the entry of judgment, filed a \u201cMotion for Relief from Judgment\u201d under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). He argued generally that his complaint had stated a claim under the liberal standards afforded to pro se litigants, and that the district court had applied the wrong statute of limitations. He also argued that the court erred in determining that his illegal search claim was premature. The district court denied Tylon\u2019s motion, noting that he merely \u201casserted] that the court misunderstood or misapplied the law,\u201d which is not grounds for relief under Rule 60(b). Tylon appeals from this order, and we dismiss his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">Rule 60(b) allows a district court to relieve a party from a judgment on the naiTow grounds of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect, newly discovered evidence, voidness, or \u201cany other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). It is not a substitute for a timely appeal. <em>Neuberg v. Michael Reese Hosp. Found., </em>123 F.3d 951, 955 (7th Cir.1997). Tylon\u2019s motion did not seek relief under any of the grounds specified in Rule 60(b), but simply asserted that the district court\u2019s underlying judgment was wrong. This is an impermissible use of Rule 60(b). <em>Bell v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>214 F.3d 798, 801-802 (7th Cir.2000). The errors Tylon\u2019s motion alleged would have been proper subjects of a direct appeal. <em>See FDIC v. Wabick, </em>335 F.3d 620, 624 (7th Cir.2003) (direct appeal addressing whether wrong statute of limitations was applied); <em>Gonzalez v. Entress, </em>133 F.3d 551, 553-54 (7th Cir.1998) (direct appeal addressing whether civil suit alleging illegal search was premature because filed before criminal proceeding ended). Tylon\u2019s appeal is in fact an untimely attempt to appeal the May 2003 dismissal of his case, and we will not consider it. <em>See Bell, </em>214 F.3d at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">Tylon is further advised that he has accrued three strikes under the Prison Litigation Reform Act. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). The strikes include, in addition to the two incurred for filing the Rule 60(b) motion in the district court and pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>suing it here, two others for <em>Tylon v. Kloak, </em>No. 03-3313, in this court and No. 03 C 4440 as initially filed in the Northern District of Illinois. Unless Tylon is in imminent danger of serious physical injury, he may not, while incarcerated, file a suit in the federal courts without prepaying the full filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
