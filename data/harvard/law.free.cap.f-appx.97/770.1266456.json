R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b805-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">Afsar Hossain, a native and citizen of Bangladesh, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order affirming the immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We review de novo all questions of law with regard to the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), but give substantial deference to the agency\u2019s interpretation. <em>Melkonian v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1065 (9th Cir.2003). We dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">This Court lacks jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that no \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d excused Petitioner\u2019s untimely filing of his asylum application, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D), as this court is barred from reviewing any determination made by the IJ pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2). <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-17\">This court also lacks jurisdiction to review Petitioner\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and CAT relief because Petitioner did not raise these claims before the BIA or before this Court. <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 815 n. 2 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-18\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), Petitioner\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the motion for stay of removal was granted, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, to the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b805-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
