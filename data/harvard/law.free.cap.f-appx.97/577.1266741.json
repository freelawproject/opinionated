At sentencing, this violation translated into a base offense level of twelve, which the district court reduced to ten in view of Rollins\u2019 acceptance of responsibility. The district court next attributed to Rollins a criminal history category of II based on his previous state-court convictions for (1) possession of marijuana and (2) driving without insurance. After combining the vertical requirements of Rollins\u2019 base offense level with the horizontal requirements of his criminal history category, the district court determined that he faced a sentencing range of eight to fourteen months, then sentenced him to an eight-month prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">On appeal, Rollins challenges the district court\u2019s inclusion of his conviction for driving without insurance \u2014 a misdemeanor under Kentucky law \u2014 in its calculation of his criminal history. His argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant\u2019s criminal history category includes all prior misdemeanors, unless they are specifically excluded in one of two subsections. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c) (2002). First, misdemeanors listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l) or \u201coffenses similar to\u201d those listed are excluded from the criminal history calculation unless \u201c(A) the sentence was a term of probation of at least one year or a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days, or (B) the prior offense was similar to an instant offense.\u201d Misdemeanors on this list include, among other offenses, careless or reckless driving, driving without a license or with a revoked or suspended license, and leaving the scene of an accident. Second, \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2) separately excludes other prior misdemeanors \u2014 including juvenile status offenses, loitering and \u201c[mjinor traffic infractions <em>(e.g., </em>speeding)\u201d \u2014 and \u201coffenses similar to them\u201d from a defendant\u2019s relevant criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-13\">Rollins initially argues that his Kentucky-law \u201cno insurance\u201d conviction constitutes a \u201cminor traffic infraction\u201d under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(2), making it non-countable in his criminal history assignment. Although this Circuit has yet to determine whether driving without insurance is a \u201cminor traffic infraction\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(2), our decision in <em>United States v. Kingston, </em>922 F.2d 1234 (6th Cir.1990), takes us a good way toward the conclusion that it is not. <em>Kingston </em>holds that \u201cinfraction\u201d in the phrase \u201cminor traffic infractions\u201d of \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2) represents a \u201cterm of art\u201d derived from U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.9 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559. 922 F.2d at 1239; <em>see also United States v. Aichele, </em>912 F.2d 1170, 1171 (9th Cir.1990). These provisions in turn each define an \u201cinfraction\u201d as \u201cany offense for which the maximum authorized term of imprisonment is not more than five days.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.9 cmt. n. 1; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a) (\u201cAn offense ... is classified [as an infraction] if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is ... five days or less, or if no imprisonment is authorized.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-14\">On the basis of this language, <em>Kingston </em>concluded that misdemeanor offenses with an authorized prison term of \u201cnot more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>than five days\u201d are \u201cminor traffic infractions\u201d while offenses with an authorized term of more than five days are not \u201cminor traffic infractions.\u201d 922 F.2d at 1239. Because in <em>Kingston </em>Tennessee law authorized a 90-day prison term for reckless driving, the court determined that reckless driving was not a \u201cminor traffic infraction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And in view of the established meaning of \u201cinfraction,\u201d the court concluded that the authorization of a 90-day prison term under Tennessee law ended the inquiry \u2014 as the Guidelines do \u201cnot intend courts to weigh the relative seriousness of traffic offenses when deciding which convictions to exclude from criminal history calculations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">These conclusions in <em>Kingston </em>more than suffice to respond to Rollins\u2019 first objection to his sentence. Because Kentucky law authorizes up to a 90-day prison term for violation of the State\u2019s car insurance requirements, <em>see </em>Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 304.99-060, not unlike the Tennessee law in <em>Kingston, </em>a conviction for \u201cno insurance\u201d in Kentucky does not constitute a \u201cminor traffic infraction\u201d under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(2). <em>Accord United States v. Perez de Dios, </em>237 F.3d 1192, 1199 (10th Cir.2001) (determining that driving without proof of insurance is not a minor traffic infraction under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(2)). Given this unchallenged aspect of Kentucky law and given our decision in <em>Kingston, </em>we reject Rollins\u2019 invitation to \u201cto weigh the relative seriousness\u201d of this traffic offense in \u201cdeciding which convictions to exclude from criminal history calculations.\u201d <em>Kingston, </em>922 F.2d at 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Nor may this offense be excluded under the other provision that lists non-countable misdemeanor offenses\u2014 \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l). In accordance with that provision, recall, \u201cdriving without a license or with a revoked or suspended license\u201d (or a \u201csimilar\u201d offense) may be excluded if <em>\u201cthe </em>sentence was a term of probation\u201d of less than a year. In this case, however, the state court imposed a <em>two-year </em>conditional discharge for his insurance violation \u2014 a sentence that this Court has previously determined to be the \u201cfunctional equivalent of \u2018unsupervised probation.\u2019 \u201d <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>56 F.3d 719, 722 (6th Cir.1995) (\u201cWe thus hold that conditional discharge [under Kentucky law] is the \u2018functional equivalent\u2019 of an unsupervised probation under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d).\u201d); <em>Harris v. United States, </em>204 F.3d 681, 682-83 (6th Cir.2000) (determining that Ohio\u2019s equivalent of a \u201cconditional discharge\u201d sentence qualifies as a term of probation of at least one year under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l)); <em>see also Pedigo v. Commonwealth, </em>644 S.W.2d 355, 358 (Ky.Ct. App.1982) (noting that aside from supervision, \u201cthere is no difference between conditional discharge and probation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Rollins has offered no explanation why a term of \u201cunsupervised probation\u201d should not be treated as a term of \u201cprobation\u201d under the provision. Nor can we think of one. Other courts, it bears adding, have reached the same conclusion, holding that \u201cconditional discharge\u201d and \u201cunsupervised probation\u201d alike constitute \u201cprobation\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l). <em>See United States v. Lloyd, </em>43 F.3d 1183, 1188 (8th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Caputo, </em>978 F.2d 972, 977 (7th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. McCrudden, </em>894 F.2d 338, 339 (9th Cir.1990) (\u201cThe guidelines make no provision for treating \u2018unsupervised\u2019 probation as less than probation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">Lastly, this Guideline provision cannot be construed to apply only to probation sentences given in connection with a suspended jail sentence, as opposed to probation sentences given in connection with a fine. By its terms, the provision prohibits excluding a sentence if \u201cthe sentence was a term of probation\u201d of a year or more. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l). Neither the provision nor the commentary draws any distinction between probation involving a suspended jail sentence on the one hand and probation involving a f\u00edne, community service or indeed probation alone on the other. The very next clause of the provision, moreover, plainly covers fines, as it indicates that a misdemeanor offense is not excludable if it is \u201csimilar to an instant offense,\u201d \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l)(B), a rule that necessarily includes misdemeanors that resulted in a f\u00edne alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">While it is true that probation frequently will occur in the context of the suspension of a jail sentence, the function of probation (and of conditional discharge under Kentucky law) is by no means restricted to that setting. The overriding objective of probation is to place court-imposed conditions on the defendant. <em>See, e.g., </em>Ky. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 533.020(1) (\u201cConditions of probation shall be imposed.\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 533.020(3) (\u201cConditions of conditional discharge shall be imposed.\u201d); <em>see generally </em>5 Wayne R. LaFave et al., <em>Crim. Proc. </em>\u00a7 26.1(d) (2004) (\u201c[T]he traditional definition of probation ... assumes release pursuant to one or more conditions and some degree of supervision to ensure adherence to those conditions.\u201d). It is these court-imposed restrictions on the defendant\u2019s behavior that distinguish sentences of probation or conditional discharge from mere fines. <em>See U.S.S.G. </em>\u00a7 4A1.1 cmt. n. 4 (\u201c[A] term of unsupervised probation would be included [as a criminal justice sentence under \u00a7 4Al.l(d)]; but a sentence to pay a fine, by itself, would not be included.\u201d). And it is these restrictions that render the sentences serious, <em>see </em>9 Leslie W. Abram-son, <em>Ky. Prac. Series: Crim. Prac. &amp; Proc. </em>\u00a7 31:131 (2004), and presumably what makes them countable under this Guideline. Whether the conditions imposed on Rollins in this instance (which the record does not describe) were mini<em>mal </em>\u2014 e.g., that he merely avoid further offenses during his conditional discharge\u2014 or quite onerous, the fact that his sentence entailed court-mandated restrictions on his behavior is enough to draw it within the meaning of \u201cprobation\u201d in the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gorman, </em>312 F.3d 1159, 1164-67 (10th Cir.2002) (determining that requirements of maintaining good behavior, refraining from violating the law, and paying a $300 fee, constituted \u201cprobation\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">That Rollins\u2019 conditional discharge involved the partial discharge of a modest fine ($500) in exchange for two-years of court-imposed restrictions, moreover, does not warrant differential treatment from other sentences of conditional discharge or probation. Although Kentucky law requires that a sentence of a prison term or a fine (or both) be imposed before a conditional discharge is given, <em>Commonwealth v. Tiryung, </em>709 S.W.2d 454, 456 (Ky.1986), other States allow for sentences of probation or (their equivalent) independent of any other sentence, <em>see, e.g., </em>730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5 \u2014 5\u20143(b); N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 60.01; <em>see generally </em>Daniel E. Feld, Annotation, <em>State Court\u2019s Power to Place Defendant on Probation Without Imposition of Sentence, </em>56 A.L.R.3d 932, 1974 WL 35134 (1974). Consistent with the language of the relevant provisions, the federal courts (to our knowledge) have never considered a stand-alone sentence of probation or conditional discharge, or a sentence of probation or conditional discharge coupled with a fine, to be anything other than a term of \u201cprobation\u201d under \u00a7 4A1.2(c) and \u00a7 4Al.l(d), even though the defendant does not face the threat of a suspended jail sentence. <em>See, e.g., Gorman, </em>312 F.3d at 1166-67 (sentence of unsupervised probation plus a fine is a criminal justice sentence under \u00a7 4Al.l(d)); <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number><em>Castro, </em>279 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir.2002) (one-year sentence of probation counts under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)); <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>146 F.3d 499, 502 (7th Cir.1998) (one year of court supervision and a fine \u2014 -where the supervision was vacated and the full fine imposed \u2014 is \u201cprobation\u201d under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)); <em>United States v. Baker, </em>116 F.3d 870, 873-74 (11th Cir.1997) (term of probation for one year or <em>until the fine is paid in full </em>counts under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)); <em>United States v. Labella-Szuba, </em>92 F.3d 136, 138 (2d Cir.1996) (one-year conditional discharge sentence, as unsupervised probation, qualifies as a criminal justice sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Application Note 4 of \u00a7 4A1.2 does not undermine this conclusion or the above court decisions. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 cmt. n. 4. (\u201cA sentence which specifies a fine or other non-incarcerative disposition as an alternative to a term of imprisonment ... is treated as a non-imprisonment sentence.\u201d). That a defendant\u2019s choice between a \u201cfine or other non-incarcerative disposition\u201d and a term of imprisonment is a \u201cnon-imprisonment sentence\u201d does not say anything about whether a sentence constitutes \u201cprobation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">It is true, as Judge Moore points out, that this interpretation has one seemingly odd consequence. Had Rollins paid the fine, his <em>sentence </em>would <em>not </em>have been countable. But when most of the fine was suspended and he received a two-year conditional discharge, the sentence became countable. It is not clear whether the Sentencing Commission anticipated this specific development when it imposed this bright-line rule about sentences of probation of a year or more. It is clear, however, that the Commission realized that the criminal-history rules in this section could lead to criminal-history outcomes that fail to square with the realities of an individual\u2019s criminal record. Section 4A1.3 addresses that problem, however, by allowing district court judges to grant downward and upward departures when an application of the Guidelines generates an inequitable result, and it makes more sense in our view to rely on that safety-valve provision than to disregard the unyielding terms of \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l). <em>See McCrudden, </em>894 F.2d at 339 (The Guidelines \u201cresolve this potential inequity by permitting departures from the prescribed sentence if a resulting history score \u2018significantly over-represents\u2019 the seriousness of a defendant\u2019s criminal history.\u201d). In this instance, Rollins did not invoke this safety-valve provision, which indeed would have been difficult for him to do in view of his other prior criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Rollins lastly argues that the inclusion of a \u201cno insurance\u201d conviction in his sentencing calculations violates the Guidelines\u2019 policy of creating \u201creasonable uniformity in sentencing\u201d by treating violators of similar offenses in a like manner. U.S.S.G. ch. 1, pt. A (policy statement). No such uniformity occurred here, he urges, because the inclusion of this conviction in his criminal history boosted his sentence above the sentences of similar offenders solely because the Kentucky judge who sentenced him for the \u201cno insurance\u201d violation conditionally discharged his fine rather than suspending the fine or requiring him to pay it in full \u2014 in contrast to what Rollins\u2019 lawyer asserts is common practice by Kentucky judges. But this characterization of the actions of the responsible Kentucky judge has no support in the record and is incompatible with the provisions of Kentucky law that specifically authorize just such a sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court correctly included Rollins\u2019 conviction for driving without insurance in its calculation of his criminal history. We affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>MOORE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Agm\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">While I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Rollins\u2019s \u201cno insurance\u201d conviction does not qualify as a \u201cminor traffic infraction\u201d under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(2), I disagree strongly with its conclusion that the conditional discharge of a fine is equivalent to a sentence of probation, such that the conviction should count under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The conditional discharge in this case is <em>not </em>\u201cthe functional equivalent of \u2018unsupervised probation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maj. op. </em>at 579, quoting <em>United States v. Miller, </em>56 F.3d 719, 722 (6th Cir.1995). Both cases that the majority cites, <em>Miller </em>and <em>Harris v. United States, </em>204 F.3d 681, 682-83 (6th Cir.2000), dealt with conditional discharge of a <em>prison sentence. See Miller, </em>56 F.3d at 721 (\u201cwhereby he was given a sentence of thirty days imprisonment conditionally discharged for two years\u201d); <em>Harris, </em>204 F.3d at 682 (discharge at issue in case is \u201ca condition on which a sentence of imprisonment is suspended\u201d). Here, the conditional discharge is of a fine, and all that the Kentucky courts would have done had Rollins violated the conditions of the discharge would be to impose punishment of the balance of the fine, plus court costs. The majority responds to this key distinction by arguing that it is the conditional nature of the discharge that is important: any time, then, that a state places conditions on a misdemeanant, the sentence will count, even if the full punishment the state could impose after a violation of those conditions is well below the threshold level otherwise to trigger the provision. The total illogic of this position \u2014 that a defendant fined $1,000,000 on the spot receives no criminal history points, but one whose $100 fine is conditionally discharged receives a point, or that a defendant whose fine for a nonsufficient funds check is discharged on the condition that she not shop at a particular mall for a year receives a point \u2014 is acknowledged by the majority, but does not lead it to conclude that perhaps the designers of the Sentencing Guidelines did not anticipate this result. I do not believe that the determinant of \u201cprobation\u201d is \u201cconditions\u201d on a defendant, but instead I believe that \u201cprobation\u201d is determined from the ultimate punishment that could be visited on the defendant who violates those conditions. Therefore, I would conclude that the nonsensical results that follow from the majority\u2019s reading of the provision are ample evidence that that reading is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">By transforming Rollins\u2019s fine into a term of probation, the majority also creates an odd result when contrasted with Application Note 4 to \u00a7 4A1.2, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\"><em>Sentences Imposed in the Alternative: A </em>sentence which specifies a fine or other non-incareerative disposition as an alternative to a term of imprisonment <em>(fi.g., </em>$1,000 fine or ninety days\u2019 imprisonment) is treated as a non-imprisonment sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">Thus, had Rollins been sentenced to payment of his $500 fine or ninety days in prison for his infraction, a possible sentence under the Kentucky statute and surely a more severe sentence than payment of $500, conditionally discharged to $50, his conviction would not count. I believe Rollins\u2019s actual sentence for driving without insurance, which could only have resulted in a fine, is not properly counted in his criminal history under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">Finally, the majority alludes to the possibility of downward departure under \u00a7 4A1.3 in cases like the one before us. Of course, no downward departure occurred in this case, and Rollins is unable to appeal the district court\u2019s failure to make one. By relocating this issue from the definite terms of \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l) to the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>cretionary \u201csafety valve\u201d of \u00a7 4A1.8, the majority insulates the district court\u2019s decision from review and further limits the ability of wrongfully sentenced defendants to appeal to this court for legal correction. I think this is entirely unwarranted, when the proper route is so clear. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
