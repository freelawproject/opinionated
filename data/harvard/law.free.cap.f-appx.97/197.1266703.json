We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-24\">We review for substantial evidence and will reverse the BIA\u2019s determination only if the petitioner shows that the evidence compels such a result. <em>Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1487 (9th Cir.1997). Here, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that the mistreatment Xue suffered at the hands of the local Chinese police was on account of a land dispute with his neighbor, and not on account of Xue\u2019s actual or imputed political opinion. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 88 (1992) (holding that a petitioner must provide <em>\u201csome </em>evidence\u201d of the persecutors\u2019 motives that would compel a reasonable factfinder to find that he was persecuted <em>\u201cbecause of </em>... political opinion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">By failing to qualify for asylum, Xue necessarily fails to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003). Finally, because Xue did not present the CAT claim in his appeal to the BIA, it cannot be addressed in this court. <em>See, e.g., Khourassany v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 1096, 1099 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b231-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
