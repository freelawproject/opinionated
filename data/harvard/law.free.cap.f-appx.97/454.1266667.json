The order affirmed, without opinion, the immigration judge\u2019s order denying Kebede\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Kebede first argues that the Board erred by applying its summary affirmance procedures in violation of its own regulations. As we recently have held, the remedy when the Board improperly affirms a case under its summary affirmance procedures, for example, by \u201callow[ing] a non-harmless error to slip through,\u201d is judicial review of the immigration judge\u2019s decision. <em>Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272, 281 (4th Cir.2004). We do not consider \u201cwhat the BIA may or may not have additionally meant in affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we proceed to consider the immigration judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Kebede challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that she was not entitled to asylum because she failed to demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. \u201cThis court will reverse the denial of an asylum application only if the evidence \u2018was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blanco de Belbruno, </em>362 F.3d at 284 (quoting <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002)). We have reviewed the record and conclude that Kebede has not met this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">We likewise hold that Kebede is ineligible for withholding of removal. An applicant is entitled to withholding of removal if she can establish a \u201cclear probability of persecution because of h[er] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu, </em>296 F.3d at 324 n. 13. This is a higher standard than an asylum claim\u2019s requirement of a well-founded fear of persecution. Since Kebede failed to meet the lower standard for an asylum claim, we find that the immigration judge also properly denied her petition for withholding of removal. <em>See Blanco de Belbruno, </em>362 F.3d at 285-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Finally, we hold that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s determination that Kebede did not establish that it was more likely than not that she would be tortured if removed to Ethiopia, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2) (2003), and thus, the immigration judge properly denied Kebede\u2019s petition for protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">Accordingly, we deny Kebede\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
