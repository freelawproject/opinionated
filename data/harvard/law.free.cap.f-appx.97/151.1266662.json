R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b185-20\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-21\">Nelson Manuel Galapon, a native and citizen of the Philippines, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) dismissal of his appeal from an Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of his application for asylum and withholding of removal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition for review. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201c[T]he IJ\u2019s determination that an alien is not eligible for asylum must be upheld if supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence in the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-22\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Galapon did not demonstrate past persecution. The New People\u2019s Army recruiters threatened him several times and he was once \u201cslapped ... hard.\u201d These circumstances do not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See Lim v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir.2000) (only in \u201ccertain extreme cases [have we] held that repeated and especially menacing death threats can constitute a primary part of a past persecution claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-23\">Addressing Galapon\u2019s well-founded fear of persecution, the BIA concluded that Galapon can live safely elsewhere in the Philippines. Substantial evidence supports the reasonableness of Galapon\u2019s relocation to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>part of the country where he lived undisturbed for more than three years after the initial forced recruitment attempt. <em>See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1069-70 (9th Cir.2003) (holding it proper to \u201cdeny eligibility for asylum to an applicant who has otherwise demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution where the evidence establishes that internal relocation is a reasonable option under all of the circumstances\u201d). The BIA\u2019s additional reference to changed country conditions does not alter our conclusion. <em>Cf. Cardenas v. INS, </em>294 F.3d 1062, 1066-67 (9th Cir.2002) (reversing BIA\u2019s finding on reasonable internal relocation where petitioner received a threat at his new residence and the State Department report did not assert that the guerrillas\u2019 geographical reach was reduced).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">By failing to qualify for asylum, Galapon necessarily fails to satisfy the more stringent standard required to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), Galapon\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the motion for stay of removal was continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>to the filing of the motion for stay of removal, and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"Aso\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
