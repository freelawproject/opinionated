Moore to ECMC. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision on an appeal from a bankruptcy court. <em>In re Saxman, </em>325 F.3d 1168, 1172 (9th Cir.2003). The bankruptcy court\u2019s award of attorneys fees must be upheld unless the court abused its discretion or erroneously applied the law. <em>In re Smith, </em>317 F.3d 918, 923 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-16\">ECMC contends that the bankruptcy court erred in partially discharging Moore\u2019s student loan pursuant its equitable powers under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a), despite the fact that Moore did not satisfy the three-part \u201cundue hardship\u201d test articulated in <em>In re Rifino, </em>245 F.3d 1083, 1087 (9th Cir.2001). A student loan may be discharged only on a finding that repayment of the debt would cause an \u201cundue hardship\u201d upon the debtor. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(8); <em>see Rifino, </em>245 F.3d at 1087 (determining that a student debt imposes an undue hardship if: (1) the debtor cannot maintain, based on current income and expenses, a \u201cminimal\u201d standard of living for him and his dependents if forced to pay back the loans; (2) these financial difficulties are likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans; and (3) the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the loans). The district court concluded, relying on <em>In re Myrvang, </em>232 F.3d 1116, 1124 (9th Cir.2000), that the bankruptcy court properly partially discharged Moore\u2019s student debt <em>without </em>a finding of undue hardship pursuant to its Section 105(a) powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-17\">The district court erred, however, by overlooking our more recent decision in <em>Saxman, </em>in which we stated that \u201cwe respectfully disagree ... that partial discharge is sometimes warranted even if the substantive requirements for an undue hardship discharge have not been demonstrated.\u201d <em>Saxman, </em>325 F.3d at 1174. Both the district court and the bankruptcy court concede that Moore has not satisfied our three-part undue hardship test to discharge her student loan pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(8). We hold, therefore, that she is not entitled to a partial discharge of her debt. <em>Rifino, </em>245 F.3d at 1089.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Contrary to ECMC\u2019s contention, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion by ordering that each side bear its own fees and costs. <em>Renfrow v. Draper, </em>232 F.3d 688, 693 (9th Cir.2000). The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">AFFIRMED in part; REVERSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b123-15\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
