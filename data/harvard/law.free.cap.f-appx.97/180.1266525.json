We granted a certificate of appealability solely \u201cas to the issue whether appellant\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258. We review de novo, <em>Sanchez v. United States, </em>50 F.3d 1448, 1451-52 (9th Cir.1995), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Stanley contends that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because the government withheld exculpatory information under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). However, there is not a reasonable probability under an objective standard that, but for the newly discovered evidence about the government\u2019s informant, Stanley \u201cwould have refused to plead and would have gone to trial,\u201d <em>Sanchez, </em>50 F.3d at 1454, because the newly discovered information was cumulative of information that Stanley knew at the time of his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The district court acted within its discretion in denying Stanley\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion without an evidentiary hearing because the files and records conclusively show that Stanley is not entitled to relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>see also Shah v. United States, </em>878 F.2d 1156, 1159 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b215-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-10\">. We do not consider any arguments outside the scope of the certificate of appealability. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Christakis, </em>238 F.3d 1164, 1168 n. 5 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
