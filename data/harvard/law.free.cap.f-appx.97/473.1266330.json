Pratt v. City of Houston, </em>247 F.3d 601, 605-06 (5th Cir.2001). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">To survive a motion for summary judgment on a Title VII claim, a plaintiff must present a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination or retaliation. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>Banks v. East Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., </em>320 F.3d 570, 575 (5th Cir.2003). A <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination requires a plaintiff to show (1) he is a member of a protected group, (2) he was qualified for the position at issue, (3) his employer took an adverse employment action against him, and (4) he was replaced by someone not a member of his protected group or he was treated less favorably than others similarly-situated to him. <em>See McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802. To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show (1) he participated in activity protected by Title VII, (2) his employer took an adverse employment action against him, and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. <em>Raggs v. Miss. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>278 F.3d 463, 471 (5th Cir.2002). A <em>prima facie </em>case raises an inference of discrimination or retaliation, and the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. <em>See Pratt, </em>247 F.3d at 606. If the defendant presents such a reason, the plaintiff must offer evidence that the proffered reason is a pretext for discrimination or retaliation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Where, as here, \u00a7 1983 is used as a parallel remedy for Title VII violations, the summary judgment analysis under the two statutes is the same. <em>See Patel v. Midland Mem. Hosp. &amp; Medical Ctr., </em>298 F.3d 333, 342 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Mylett alleges that he was discriminated against based on his race (Caucasian) and that he was retaliated against for giving negative testimony about Alvarez in another officer\u2019s civil rights trial. The district court found that Mylett did not suffer an adverse employment action and that he failed to provide evidence that any actions taken against him were motivated by discriminatory or retaliatory intent. We find that Mylett did not face any adverse employment actions, so he failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>case under either statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The broadest definition of an adverse employment action includes hires, refusals to hire, discharges, promotions, refusals to promote, demotions, compensation decisions, and formal reprimands.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Sharp, </em>164 F.3d at 933; <em>Mattern v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>104 F.3d 702, 707 (5th Cir. 1997). Mylett argues that he faced the following eight adverse employment actions: (1) refusal to promote, (2) written and verbal reprimands, (3) demotion, (4) denial of prestigious positions, (5) denial of positions with financial benefits, (6) oppressive changes of work hours for no legitimate reason, (7) denial of day shifts granted to all other lieutenants on light duty, and (8) humiliation. He also argues that even if none of these items qualify individually, together they constitute an adverse employment action. We find that the first five actions are mischaracterized and are not supported by the record. The last three are not adverse employment actions. We further find that all eight together do not constitute an adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">Mylett\u2019s promotion was delayed, not denied.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A delay in promotion is not an adverse employment action where any increase in pay, benefits, and seniority are awarded retroactively. <em>See Benningfield v. City of Houston, </em>157 F.3d at 378 (5th Cir.1998). The district court found that Mylett received retroactive pay, benefits, and seniority,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> so the delay was not an adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Formal reprimands may constitute adverse employment actions,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but, absent evidence that they are \u201canything more than mere criticisms,\u201d verbal reprimands do not. <em>Id. </em>at 377 (finding that accusations of stealing criminal history records and attempting to sabotage the fingerprint identification system were \u201cmere accusations\u201d and not adverse employment actions under \u00a7 1983). We find that Mylett\u2019s reprimands, including an email Alvarez sent to the division that was critical of Mylett\u2019s performance, constituted criticism, not formal reprimands, so Mylett has not shown an adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Mylett concedes that he was not actually demoted but transferred to the \u201cduty desk\u201d in what was technically a lateral transfer. At least for purposes of \u00a7 1983, however, a transfer may be considered the functional equivalent of a demotion and qualify as an adverse employment action if the new position is \u201cobjectively worse.\u201d <em>See </em>Sharp, 164 F.3d at 933. Mylett claims that the duty desk was objectively worse than both his previous regular duty position and other light duty jobs. His assignment to the duty desk, however, was a temporary one (approximately one year) to accommodate his need for a light duty position following an injury. \u201cUndesirable work assignments are not adverse employment actions.\u201d <em>Southard v. Texas Bd. of Crim. Justice, </em>114 F.3d 539, 555 (5th Cir.1997). Although there may be circumstances in which a temporary assignment is the functional equivalent of a demotion, we do not find such circumstances here.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Mylett offered no evidence to support his claim that he was denied a promotion after his assignment to the duty desk. The district court found that the more prestigious and lucrative positions for which Mylett applied either did not exist or were already filled when he applied. Mylett has not refuted these findings. If a position is not available, an employee has no actionable claim for not being promoted. <em>See Mills v. Int'l Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>634 F.2d 282, 285 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">It is well established that Mylett\u2019s last three claimed injuries- \u2014 oppressive change of hours, denial of particular shifts, and humiliation (including countermanding Mylett\u2019s orders in front of his subordinates and characterizing him as a liar) \u2014 are not adverse employment actions. <em>See, e.g., Benningfield, </em>157 F.3d at 377 (holding that changes in work hours, denials of requested shifts, accusations of theft and sabotage, and undermining an employee\u2019s performance by preventing people from speaking to her are not adverse employment actions); <em>Webb v. Cardiotoracic Surgery </em>Assocs. <em>of N. Tex., </em>139 F.3d 532, 540 (5th Cir.1998) (holding that rude and uncivil treatment is not an adverse employment action).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Mylett\u2019s argument that the sum of these actions violate Title VII and \u00a7 1983 also fails. A \u201ccampaign of retaliatory harassment\u201d is actionable only where it constitutes \u201ca constructive adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Colson v. Grohman, </em>174 F.3d 498, 514 (5th Cir.1999) (citing <em>Sharp, </em>164 F.3d at 934 as an example of a constructive demotion). We find that these actions, even in the aggregate, do not constitute an adverse employment action. <em>Cf. Benningfield, </em>157 F.3d at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Mylett did not suffer an adverse employment action. He therefore failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination or retaliation under Title VII or \u00a7 1983. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-12\">. Mylett also sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act, but he does not appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on those claims. <em>See Hadnot v. Bay, Ltd., </em>344 F.3d 474, 476 n. 4 (5th Cir.2003) (holding that claims not briefed on appeal are deemed waived).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b509-8\">. We therefore need not address whether Mylett offered any evidence of discrimination or retaliation. We also do not address Alvarez\u2019s argument that he is entitled to qualified immunity, as the district court did not address it, Alvarez did not designate it as an issue on. cross-appeal, and it is not necessary to our holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b509-9\">. The definition of an adverse employment action may be broader under \u00a7 1983 than it is under Title VII. <em>See Sharp v. City of Houston, </em>164 F.3d 923, 933 n. 21 (5th Cir.1999). Mylett brought claims under both statutes. As we find that Mylett faced no adverse employment action under even the broadest definition of the term, we need not differentiate between the definitions here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b509-14\">. To the extent Mylett\u2019s claimed \"refusal to promote\u201d relates to the denial of an official promotion ceremony with his family in attendance, it is clearly not an adverse employment action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b509-15\">. Offering no evidence to contradict the district court\u2019s finding, Mylett avers that the promotion was \u201cmade retroactive in pay only and for an insufficient period.\u201d Absent reference to any evidence in the record, this assertion is entirely unsupported, and we adhere to the district court\u2019s finding. <em>See Call\u00f3n, </em>351 F.3d at 207 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b510-6\">. Although formal reprimands may not be adverse employment actions under Title VII, they qualify under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Sharp, </em>164 F.3d at 933 n. 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
