He contends that the evidence produced at trial was insufficient to support his convictions. In effect, Alcantar-Chaidez is challenging the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for acquittal, an issue which we review <em>de novo. See United States v. Leed, </em>981 F.2d 202, 205 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-23\">Viewing the evidence produced at trial in the light most favorable to the verdict, a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the evidence established Alcantar-Chaidez\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt for both offenses. <em>See United States v. Jaramillo, </em>42 F.3d 920, 922-23 (5th Cir. 1995); <em>United States v. Ivy, </em>973 F.2d 1184, 1888 (5th Cir.1992). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b523-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
