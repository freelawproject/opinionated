Wiley appeals only the speech-retaliation portion of the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-25\">Having carefully reviewed de novo the issues raised in this appeal, we hold that the District Court correctly held that no reasonable juror could conclude that Wiley\u2019s speech played a substantial role in any adverse employment action taken against her. We also hold that the District Court properly analyzed Wiley\u2019s speech-retaliation claim under the test set forth in <em>Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977). Inas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>much as we agree entirely with the District Court\u2019s resolution of the case, we need not, and do not, reach the argument of defendants that they were entitled to qualified immunity from suit in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Finding no error of law, we affirm on the basis of the District Court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned order. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-13\">. The Honorable G.
