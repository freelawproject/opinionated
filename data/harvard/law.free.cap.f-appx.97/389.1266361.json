In particular, Patterson challenges the District Court\u2019s three-level upward departure made pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4A1.3 (2002),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which was based on his considerable criminal history and what the District Court termed appellant\u2019s \u201cpropensity to recidivate.\u201d We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-15\">On August 27, 2002, Patterson was named in counts 1 and 4 of a four-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury sitting in the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Count 1 charged that \u201c[b]eginning on or about January 28, 2002, and continuing until on or about August 16, 2002,\u201d Patterson and two co-defendants conspired to \u201cmake, utter and possess counterfeited securities of the American Express Company ...\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. App. at 15A-16A. Count 4 charged that \u201c[o]n or about August 12, 2002,\u201d Patterson \u201cutterfed] and possessed] a counterfeited security of the American Express Company ...\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-16\">On February 20, 2003, pursuant to a plea agreement, Patterson pled guilty to count 4 of the indictment. Patterson\u2019s presentence investigation report (PSR) revealed that he had 93 arrests resulting in 67 convictions, largely for a variety of nonviolent crimes such as larceny and forgery. The great majority of the convictions did not enter into the calculation of Patterson\u2019s criminal history points because they reflected offenses occurring prior to the time periods established by the Sentencing Guidelines covering offense conduct which is to be \u201ccounted\u201d in calculating a defendant\u2019s criminal history.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Patterson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>countable criminal history netted a total of 22 criminal history points and a criminal history category of VI. The court accepted a stipulation between the parties that the amount of loss resulted in Patterson\u2019s total offense level of 10, producing a guideline range of 24-30 months imprisonment. The court then granted the government\u2019s motion for a two-level downward departure warranted by Patterson\u2019s substantial assistance, resulting in a guideline range of 18-24 months. Finally, the court departed upward by three levels, pursuant to the probation office\u2019s recommendation based on the extent of Patterson\u2019s prior record. Patterson\u2019s resulting guideline range was 27-33 months. The court sentenced Patterson to 30 months imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release. The court explained the upward departure in its statement of reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">The Court finds that pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, an upward departure is warranted because the defendant\u2019s criminal history category significantly under-represents the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct and inadequately captures his propensity to recidivate. Larry Patterson has 93 arrests resulting in 67 criminal convictions and 22 criminal</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArS\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e). history points. He did not receive criminal history points for 56 of the convictions. The vast majority of his arrests have been for conduct similar to the instant federal offense which involved the passing of fraudulent American Express checks and money orders. The Court further finds that an upward incremental increase of one offense level for each additional three criminal history points exceeding 15 is appropriate. This results in the addition of three offense levels and a guideline custody range of 27 to 33 months.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Patterson now challenges the District Court\u2019s decision granting an upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 91, 96-100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996) directed courts of appeals to review a district court\u2019s departure decision for abuse of discretion. The government contends, however, that Koon\u2019,s abuse-of-discretion review has been replaced by <em>de novo </em>review by virtue of the subsequently enacted \u201cPROTECT Act\u201d amending 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e). For purposes of this appeal, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>need not decide which standard of review applies, because we would affirm the upward departure under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Section 4A1.3 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">If rehable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, the court may consider imposing a sentence departing from the otherwise applicable guideline range.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">The Commission contemplates that there may, on occasion, be a case of an egregious, serious criminal record in which even the guideline range for Criminal History Category VI is not adequate to reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history. In such a case, a departure above the guideline range for a defendant with Criminal History Category VI may be warranted. In determining whether an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI is warranted, the court should consider that the nature of the prior offenses rather than simply their number is often more indicative of the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal record. For example, a defendant with five prior sentences for very large-scale fraud offenses may have 15 criminal history points, within the range of points typical for Criminal History Category VI, yet have a substantially more serious criminal history overall because of the nature of the prior offenses. On the other hand, a defendant with nine prior 60-day jail sentences for offenses such as petty larceny, prostitution, or possession of gambling slips has a higher number of criminal history points (18 points) than the typical Criminal History Category VI defendant, but not necessarily a more serious criminal history overall. Where the court determines that the extent and nature of the defendant\u2019s criminal history, taken together, are sufficient to warrant an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI, the court should structure the departure by moving incrementally down the sentencing table to the next higher offense level in Criminal History Category VI until it finds a guideline range appropriate to the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">\n<em>Background: This policy statement recognizes that the criminal history score is unlikely to take into account all the variations in the seriousness of criminal history that may occur. For example, a defendant with an extensive record of serious, assaultive conduct who had received what might now be considered extremely lenient treatment in the past might have the same criminal history category as a defendant who had a record of less serious conduct. Yet, the first defendant\u2019s criminal history clearly may be more serious. This may be particularly true in the case of younger defendants (e.g., defendants in their early twenties or younger) who are more likely to have received repeated lenient treatment, yet who may actually pose a greater risk of serious recidivism than older defendants. This policy statement authorizes the consideration of a departure from the guidelines in the limited circumstances where reliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or likelihood of recidivism, and provides guidance for the consideration of such departures.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">The District Court, in determining that an upward departure was warranted, prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>erly applied the principles announced in \u00a7 4A1.8. <em>See United States v. Shoupe, </em>988 F.2d 440, 445-46 (3d Cir.1993) (describing guidance provided by \u00a7 4A1.3 to a district court\u2019s departure decision). Patterson\u2019s argument to the contrary is without merit. As the District Court aptly pointed out, Patterson\u2019s \u201ccriminal history category significantly under-represents [his] past criminal conduct and inadequately captures his propensity to recidivate.\u201d Patterson\u2019s numerous early convictions for larceny and forgery convictions not \u201ccounted\u201d in calculating his criminal history<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 presaged the forgery offenses that predominate in his \u201ccounted\u201d criminal history. And the crime whose sentence is here at issue\u201d \u2014 uttering and possessing a counterfeited security\u201d\u2014 is but a further chapter in a more-than-twenty-years record of criminal deceit. The District Court\u2019s three-level upward departure was warranted. The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-11\">. The 2002 edition of the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual was used to calculate Patterson\u2019s Offense Level and Criminal History Points.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b424-12\">. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e) provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-13\">(1) Any prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month that was imposed within fifteen years of the defendant\u2019s commencement of the instant offense is counted. Also count any prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month, whenever imposed, that resulted in the defendant being incarcerated during any part of such fifteen-year period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-18\">(2) Any other prior sentence that was imposed within ten years of the defendant's commencement of the instant offense is counted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-19\">(3) Any prior sentence not within the time periods specified above is not counted.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\">. In adding \"three offense levels\u201d on the basis of its finding that \"an upward incremental increase of one offense level for each additional three criminal history points exceeding 15 is appropriate,\" the District Court would appear to have been proceeding on the understanding that Patterson\u2019s criminal history points came to 24 (15 + 9). But the District Court actually found that Patterson\u2019s criminal history points totaled 22 (not 24). It is our supposition that the explanation for this arithmetic discrepancy (a discrepancy not addressed in either party\u2019s brief on appeal) is that the District Court meant to use 13, not 15, as the criminal history base-point above which the court would add one offense level for \"each additional three criminal history points.\u201d We suggest that 13 was the intended number, and 15 a typographical error, because Criminal History Category VI of the Guidelines Sentencing Table encompasses all those who have \"13 or more\" criminal history points. In short, 13 is a significant number for purposes of applying the Sentencing Table, while 15 is not. If 13 was the number the District Court intended as its base-point, then Patterson\u2019s total of 22 criminal history points would have been 9 in excess of that base-point, triggering the three-level increase in offense level which the District Court thought appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">If either of the parties thinks the foregoing supposition is unfounded, application may be made to the District Court to resolve the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b427-13\">.
