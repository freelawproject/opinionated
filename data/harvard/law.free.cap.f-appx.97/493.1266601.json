The district court entered a well-reasoned opinion carefully analyzing the summary judgment evidence in conjunction with the operative law on the subject in finding that there was no genuine issue of material fact for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-22\">We review the district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standard as the district court. <em>Wyatt v. Hunt Plywood Co., </em>297 F.3d 405, 408 (5th Cir.2002)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-23\">As the district court noted, we also note that Jarvis admitted that he was qualified the same as or similar to the employees retained after the reduction in force (RIF). In order to succeed on a discrimination claim in a RIF situation, it is incumbent upon the terminated employee to prove that he was \u201cclearly better qualified\u201d than the retained employees. <em>Manning v. Chevron Chemical Co., LLC, </em>332 F.3d 874, 882, n. 4 (5th Cir.2003)(explaining that the \u201cclearly better qualified\u201d standard still applies after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number><em>Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">After a careful review of the record, this court concludes that there was no genuine issue of material fact that would have entitled Jarvis to a trial on the merits. Therefore, for essentially the reasons cited in the district court\u2019s opinion, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b527-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
