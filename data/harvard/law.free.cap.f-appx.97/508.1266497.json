He contends that the district court erred by (1) attributing 10 pounds (4.3 kilograms) of methamphetamine to him; (2) adjusting his offense level for possession of a firearm; (3) attributing one criminal-history point for a theft conviction; and (4) declining to depart downward because a conviction for driving with a suspended license, which resulted in one criminal-history point, overrepresented the seriousness of Boliver\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Any error in the attribution of 10 pounds of methamphetamine was harmless. There was sufficient evidence in the record to support attribution of at least two kilograms of methamphetamine, which together with the 3.2 grams of cocaine he possessed, placed Boliver at base offense level 34, the same base offense level applicable to 10 pounds. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3); <em>see United States v. Narviz-Guerra, </em>148 F.3d 530, 537-38 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">The evidence supported the adjustment for possession of a firearm. James Helton\u2019s testimony indicated that Boliver possessed a firearm during a drug-related confrontation. <em>See United States v. Eastland, </em>989 F.2d 760, 770 (5th Cir.1993); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">The district court\u2019s comments at sentencing did not indicate that the district court was unaware of its discretion to depart downwardly based on possible over-representation of the seriousness of Boliver\u2019s criminal history. We therefore lack jurisdiction to consider whether the district court erred by declining to depart. <em>United States v. Landerman, </em>167 F.3d 895, 899 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-15\">We need not address Boliver\u2019s contention regarding the one criminal history point assigned to his theft offense \u2014 any error regarding the assignment of that point would be harmless, as Boliver would remain in criminal history category III. <em>See Narviz-Guerra, </em>148 F.3d at 537-38. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b543-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
