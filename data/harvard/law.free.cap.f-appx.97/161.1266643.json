R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b195-23\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-24\">California state prisoner Melvin Ka Yu appeals pro se the district court\u2019s judgment denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition challenging a prison disciplinary finding that he participated in a riot, in violation of CaLCode Regs. tit. 15, \u00a7 3005(c). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Yu contends that the disciplinary hearing finding, which resulted in the revocation of 90 days of good time credit, was a violation of his due process rights because it was supported by insufficient evidence. Procedural due process demands that the findings of a prison disciplinary board are \u201csupported by <em>some evidence </em>in the record.\u201d <em>See Superintendent v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985) (emphasis added). We conclude that the California Superior Court\u2019s determination that sufficient evidence supported the disciplinary hearing officer\u2019s finding was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>id. </em>at 453-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">To the extent that Yu raises uncertified issues, we construe it as a motion to expand the Certificate of Appealability, and we deny the motion. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 22-1(e); <em>Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1104 \u2014 05 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The motion for judgment filed on February 11, 2004 and docketed as the reply brief is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The Clerk shall file the \u201ctraverse,\u201d received on March 1, 2004, as the reply brief. Yu\u2019s requests for counsel and for an evidentiary hearing, raised in the reply brief, are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b195-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
