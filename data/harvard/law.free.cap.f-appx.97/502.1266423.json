She argues that the district court erred in upwardly departing pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.21 for conduct allegedly already accounted for under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.6(b)(2)(A). Bonilla did not object to the upward departure on the basis now argued on appeal; therefore, our review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Vasquez, </em>216 F.3d 456, 459 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Bonilla\u2019s double-counting argument fails because the district court based its upward departure on the conduct underlying the dismissed charge, <em>i.e., </em>her drug activity and the fact that she successfully evaded prosecution, factors that did not enter into the determination of the applicable guideline range under \u00a7 2J1.6. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.6 (2002), comment, (backg\u2019d); <em>United States v. Harper, </em>932 F.2d 1073, 1077 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">We also reject Bonilla\u2019s alternative argument that the evidence was insufficient to justify an upward departure. First, Bonilla\u2019s contention that her actions had no bearing on the Government\u2019s decision to dismiss the 1991 indictment is meritless given that her status as a fugitive for nearly eleven years directly caused the evidence against her to become stale. Second, absent any rebuttal evidence from Bonilla at sentencing, the district court was entitled to rely on the findings in the presentence report concerning the charged drug offenses. <em>See United States v. Huerta, </em>182 F.3d 361, 364-65 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b537-9\"> Pursuant to <em>5th Cir. R. 47.5, the </em>court has determined that this opinion should, not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
