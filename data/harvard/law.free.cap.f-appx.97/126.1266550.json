The BIA dismissed their initial appeal because of petitioners\u2019 failure to file a brief that their attorney had indicated she would file.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">In their petition to reopen, petitioners argued the ineffective assistance of their counsel in failing to file a brief. To prevail on a motion to reopen, however, they must establish not only that the representation was deficient, but that the deficiencies affected the outcome of the deportation proceeding. <em>See Ortiz v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir.1999). Petitioners have failed to show that the outcome would have been any different had they filed a brief; they do not make any showing that they are entitled to the substantive relief they sought. <em>See id.; Mohsseni Behbahani v. INS, </em>796 F.2d 249, 251 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">Petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b161-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
