Rodriguez\u2019s appeal was dismissed for failure to file a separate written brief or statement after indicating on the notice of appeal that one would be filed. In her petition for review, Rodriguez asserts that she is entitled to an adjustment in status and argues at length that this court has jurisdiction over her claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. As Rodriguez has not filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for writ of habeas corpus, this court does not have jurisdiction pursuant to that statute. Rodriguez offers no argument regarding the denial of her motion for reconsideration. Therefore, she has waived its review. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-23\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b546-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
