We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition. As the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recount them here except as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Romanenko first argues that the BIA and the IJ erred in fading to consider his eligibility for Convention Against Torture relief. We disagree. Romanenko, who was represented by counsel before the BIA, failed to raise a CAT claim before that tribunal and hence failed to exhaust his remedies. <em>See Vargas v. U.S. Dept. I.N.S., </em>831 F.2d 906, 907-08 (9th Cir.1987). Moreover, Romanenko could have sought to reopen his case before the IJ to assert his CAT claim, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(b)(2), but did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Romanenko next argues that the BIA erred in adopting the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845 (9th Cir.2003). Moreover, there is no harm to Romanenko in the BIA\u2019s affirmance without opinion because, where the BIA does this, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency action. <em>Id. </em>at 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Finally, pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), petitioner\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the temporary stay of removal was continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>to the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate. Romanenko will have three days after the issuance of the mandate to depart voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
