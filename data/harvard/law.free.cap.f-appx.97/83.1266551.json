Dorsey argues that the state trial court violated his right to due process by erroneously instructing the jury on the elements of kidnapping for robbery. Specifically, Dorsey contends that the trial court\u2019s instructions improper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>ly commanded the jury to consider movement of Dorsey\u2019s two victims that was \u201cincidental\u201d to the underlying robbery crime. <em>People v. Rayford, </em>9 Cal.4th 1, 36 Cal.Rptr.2d 317, 884 P.2d 1369, 1374 (1994) (\u201cKidnapping for robbery ... requires movement of the victim that is not merely incidental to the commission of the robbery, and which substantially increases the risk of harm over and above that necessarily present in the crime of robbery itself.\u201d); <em>see also People v. Daniels, </em>71 Cal.2d 1119, 80 Cal.Rptr. 897, 459 P.2d 225, 238 (1969) (same). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">We are convinced that any instructional error committed by the trial court did not have a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)); <em>see also Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 8-12, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999) (claim that jury instruction omitted necessary element of charged offense is subject to harmlessness review). Even assuming the victims\u2019 movement from the jewelry counter to the safe could not properly be considered, the subsequent movement away from the safe and outside was \u201cnot merely incidental\u201d to the underlying robbery crime. <em>Rayford, </em>36 Cal.Rptr.2d 317, 884 P.2d at 1374. It was neither necessary to the robbery nor too short a distance as a matter of law. <em>See id. </em>at 1382 (movement of 105 feet held sufficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The movement outside substantially increased the risk of harm to Dorsey\u2019s two victims. <em>See id. </em>at 1374 (requiring movement that \u201csubstantially inerease[d] the risk of harm\u201d). Dorsey was armed and had already pointed his gun at one of the victims. <em>See People v. Lara, </em>12 Cal.3d 903, 117 Cal.Rptr. 549, 528 P.2d 365, 369 (1974) (holding increased risk of harm requirement satisfied because victim was \u201cforced to travel a substantial distance under the threat of imminent injury by a deadly weapon\u201d). The movement took the victims away from co-workers and customers while exposing them to a dangerous encounter with the police. The movement from the enclosed safe room to the parking lot may also have encouraged the victims\u2019 dangerous attempts to escape and overpower Dorsey.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">In light of the movement away from the safe and outside, any instructional error regarding the asportation requirement was harmless. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b117-26\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
