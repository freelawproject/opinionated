We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo, <em>United States v. Bonilla-Montenegro, </em>331 F.3d 1047, 1049 (9th Cir.2003), and its factual findings for clear error, <em>United States v. Riley, </em>335 F.3d 919, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>925 (9th Cir.2003). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The district court correctly found that the government proved by clear and convincing evidence that Garcia suffered a 1978 conviction for Battery Upon a Peace Officer, <em>see Bonilla-Montenegro, </em>331 F.3d at 1049, and, therefore, correctly enhanced Garcia\u2019s sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). That a Notice of Appeal was filed and that there are marks on the Court Action form does not mean that the government failed to meet its burden to prove the previous conviction. The official records do not show any reversal on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">We review Garcia\u2019s argument that the time limitations in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e) apply to sentencing enhancements under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 for plain error because he raises it for the first time on appeal. <em>See Riley, </em>335 F.3d at 925. There was no error in not applying the \u00a7 4A1.2(e) time limitations because the temporal limitations in \u00a7 4A1.2 do not apply to \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Lara-Aceves, </em>183 F.3d 1007, 1013-14 (9th Cir.1999), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>247 F.3d 905 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc). The changes in the guidelines since <em>Lara-Aceves </em>are not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b814-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
