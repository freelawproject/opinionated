Familiarity is assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>1. This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s conclusion that Wint deserved a role enhancement under USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) and for clear error the factual findings underlying this determination. <em>E.g., United States v. Paccione, </em>202 F.3d 622, 624 (2d Cir.2000). In light of the district court\u2019s findings regarding Wint\u2019s role in the conspiracy, which were not clearly erroneous, it properly determined that Wint \u201cexercise[d] some degree of control over others involved in the commission of the offense ... or play[ed] a significant role in the decision to recruit or to supervise lower-level participants.\u201d <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>324 F.3d 88, 92 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotations and citation omitted) (alterations in original). Accordingly, the district court appropriately applied a three-level role enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">2. When relevant conduct hinges on what is \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d that determination is a factual finding subject to review for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Molina, </em>106 F.3d 1118, 1121 (2d Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Ekwunoh, </em>12 F.3d 368, 370 (2d Cir.1993). The district court found that the conspiracy involved more than twenty-five firearms and that this was \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d to Wint and \u201cin furtherance of [his] jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d USSG \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). The court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous and was properly relied on to increase Wint\u2019s offense level. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">3. A district court\u2019s decision regarding whether to sentence consecutively or concurrently under USSG \u00a7 5G1.3(c) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Livorsi, </em>180 F.3d 76, 82 (2d Cir.1999). \u201cNothing in the language of the guideline or its Commentary requires district courts to make specific findings with respect to any or all of the factors listed in the Commentary or \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Velasquez, </em>136 F.3d 921, 924 (2d Cir.1998). \u201cWe have never required judges to state on the record that they considered the mandatory factors affecting sentences of imprisonment, probation, or fine.\u201d <em>United States v. Walker, </em>353 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir.2003). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision to sentence Wint consecutively to his undischarged sentence was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">4. In reviewing whether the district court properly concluded that Wint was subject to a use/possession enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), \u201cwe uphold the sentencing court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous, and review its legal determinations <em>de novo, </em>while giving due deference to its application of the Sentencing Guidelines to the facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Berg, </em>250 F.3d 139, 142 (2d Cir.2001). \u201cWhether, when it comes to \u2018use\u2019 of a firearm, we should distinguish the receipt of guns for drugs (this case) from the receipt of drugs for guns, ... either situation involves the \u2018possession\u2019 of a firearm (if not its \u2018use\u2019) in connection with the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Smythe, </em>363 F.3d 127, 129 n. 1 (2d Cir.2004) (internal citation omitted) (upholding an enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l)). Based on the district court\u2019s finding that the instant conspiracy included \u201cthe quid pro quo exchange of drugs for firearms,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 129, a finding that was not clearly erroneous, the court properly enhanced Wint\u2019s offense level under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
