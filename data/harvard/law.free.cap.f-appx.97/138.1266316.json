We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>DeMartinez v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 1022, 1024 (9th Cir.2004). We deny in part, and dismiss in part, the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Because Maigue failed to address how the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion to reopen, he has waived any challenge to this decision, and we deny the petition for review. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1260 (9th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Furthermore, we lack jurisdiction to review Maigue\u2019s contentions regarding the BIA\u2019s September 10, 2002 decision affirming the immigration judge\u2019s denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture, because Maigue did not file a timely petition for review from that decision. <em>See id. </em>at 1258; <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). We also lack jurisdiction to review Maigue\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because he did not present this claim to the BIA. <em>See OntiverosLopez v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cWe ... require an alien who argues ineffective assistance of counsel to exhaust his administrative remedies by first presenting the issue to the BIA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part, and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b172-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
