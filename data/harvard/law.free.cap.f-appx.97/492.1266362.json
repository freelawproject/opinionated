Wayne contends that the district court improperly increased his sentencing guidelines offense level for possessing a dangerous weapon in connection with the crime. He also contends that the court should have given him an offense level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, despite the fact that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>a fugitive for nine years after he was first arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Even were Major\u2019s claims meritorious, which they are not under the proper \u201cclear error\u201d standard of review, any error would be harmless. Major was sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) <em>&amp; </em>(A)(vii). Even if his guidelines range was reduced to less than ten years, Major\u2019s sentence would not be affected. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) &amp; (c); <em>see also Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992) (harmless error); <em>United States v. Tello, </em>9 F.3d 1119, 1131 (5th Cir.1993). The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b526-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
