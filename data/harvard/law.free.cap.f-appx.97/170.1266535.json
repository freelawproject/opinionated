We dismiss the appeal because Chapman waived his right to appeal the sentence in the plea agreement. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>district court, as required by Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(c)(6), informed Chapman during the plea colloquy of, and determined that Chapman understood, the terms of the waiver, and there is no indication that the waiver was made other than knowingly and voluntarily. <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>235 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir. 2000) (\u201cThe sole test of a waiver\u2019s validity is whether it was made knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Chapman\u2019s contention that the condition that the district court not \u201cdepart upward in offense level\u201d renders the waiver unenforceable lacks merit. The district court did not depart from the Sentencing Guidelines offense level; the district court increased Chapman\u2019s offense level based on the specific offense characteristic of firearm possession described in Chapter Two of the Sentencing Guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 (stating that determinations made under Chapter Two of the Guidelines relate to a defendant\u2019s base offense level and any appropriate specific offense level characteristics, and that Part K of Guidelines Chapter Five relates to departures).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b204-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
