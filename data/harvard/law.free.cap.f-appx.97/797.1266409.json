Iniguez appeals his conviction on two grounds: 1) the district court abused its discretion by denying Iniguez\u2019s motion to suppress wiretap evidence; and 2) the evidence was insufficient to support Iniguez\u2019s conviction for two of the three counts of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-24\">1. <em>Suppression of wiretap evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-25\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Iniguez\u2019s motion to suppress the wiretap evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>to Iniguez\u2019s assertions, the FBI\u2019s application was neither misleading nor inadequate. Although the application did not contain an exhaustive list of the agency\u2019s pre-wiretap evidence, it contained no \u201cmaterial misstatements or omissions regarding the necessity of the wiretap.\u201d <em>United States v. Carneiro, </em>861 F.2d 1171, 1176 (9th Cir.1988). The wiretap application, which provided a careful discussion of why a wiretap was particularly necessary in this case, including deta\u00f1ed analyses of why normal investigative techniques could not achieve the investigation\u2019s stated objectives, met the requirements of \u00a7 2518. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(1)(c); <em>United States v. Ippolito, </em>774 F.2d 1482, 1486 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">2. <em>Sufficiency of evidence </em>\u2014 Count <em>3</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The evidence was sufficient to support Iniguez\u2019s conviction for Count 3\u2014 possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine on August 6, 1998.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The government presented the jury with sufficient evidence to convict Iniguez of Count 3 under either a constructive possession theory, <em>United States v. Cain, </em>130 F.3d 381, 382 (9th Cir.1997), or a <em>Pinkerton </em>theory, <em>Pinkerton v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 640, 645-48, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">We reject Iniguez\u2019s arguments that the district court explicitly limited its <em>Pinkerton </em>instruction to Count 1 and that a <em>Pinkerton </em>instruction was inappropriate because Iniguez was in custody when the substantive transactions underlying Counts 3 and 4 occurred. The district court gave no limiting instruction and, in this case, Iniguez\u2019s arrest did not thwart his role in the conspiracy, as Iniguez remained an active coconspirator from jafi.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">3. <em>Sufficiency of evidence </em>\u2014 Count <em>4</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">The evidence was also sufficient to support Iniguez\u2019s conviction for Count 4\u2014 possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine on December 9, 1998. The government produced evidence sufficient to establish that the possession underlying Count 4 was a reasonably foreseeable offense committed in furtherance of a conspiracy of which Iniguez remained a part. <em>See Pinkerton, </em>328 U.S. at 645-48, 66 S.Ct. 1180.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b832-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b832-17\">. Additionally, the government cross-appeals Iniguez\u2019s sentence. We address this cross-appeal in an en banc opinion filed concurrently with this memorandum disposition. <em>See United States v. Iniguez, </em>368 F.3d 1113 (2004) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b832-27\">. We review de novo whether the FBI submitted a full and complete statement of facts under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(l)(c); for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s necessity determination; and for clear error the district court\u2019s underlying factual findings. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Blackmon, </em>273 F.3d 1204, 1207 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\">. We review de novo a sufficiency of evidence challenge. <em>United States v. Antonakeas, 255 </em>F.3d 714, 723 (9th Cir.2001). There is sufficient evidence to support a conviction if, \"after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Booth, </em>309 F.3d 566, 574 n. 5 (9th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
