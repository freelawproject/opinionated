We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-18\">Perroton contends that his due process rights are being violated because the Bureau of Prisons refuses to shorten his sentence that was imposed after his parole violation by the 669 days of good time credit which he earned before he was released on parole. The district court dismissed his petition based on his failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-22\">Because Perroton has now fully exhausted his administrative remedies, we choose to address the merits. <em>See Bonin v. Calderon, </em>77 F.3d 1155, 1157 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cWe may affirm on any ground supported by the record, even if it differs from the rationale of the district court\u201d). We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Perroton\u2019s petition because his good time credits were properly applied before he was released on parole and he is not entitled to further relief. See <em>Boniface v. Carlson, </em>881 F.2d 669, 672 (9th Cir.1989) (\u201cBecause good time credits no longer exist after parole or mandatory release, the failure to honor such credits following a parole violation is not a \u201cforfeiture\u201d to which the protections of the due process clause might apply\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-23\">The government\u2019s motion to expand the record is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b812-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
