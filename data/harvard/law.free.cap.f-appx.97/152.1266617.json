The BIA also denied Vega-Sanchez\u2019s motion to reopen and remand to apply for cancellation of removal. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). We review the BIA\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion, <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002). We review de novo claims of due process violations in removal proceedings. <em>See Castillo-Perez v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 518, 523 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review in part, and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reopen Vega-Sanchez\u2019s case because it correctly determined that Vega-Sanchez failed to establish the threshold statutory requirement of ten years continuous physical presence to qualify for cancellation of removal. <em>See Ontiveros-Lopez v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2000). Similarly, contrary to Vega-Sanchez\u2019s contention, the format and content of the BIA\u2019s order did not violate his due process rights because, despite its brevity, the BIA\u2019s opinion addressed the issues Vega-Sanchez raised on appeal and sufficiently detailed the reasons for denial. <em>See Marcu v. INS, </em>147 F.3d 1078, 1082 (9th Cir. 1998) (\u201call that is necessary is a decision that sets out terms sufficient to enable us as a reviewing court to see that the Board has heard, considered, and decided.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review Vega-Sanchez\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, or his claim that the immigration judge denied him a full and fair hearing, because he did not raise these issues before the BIA. <em>See Liu v. Waters, </em>55 F.3d 421, 424-25 (9th Cir.1995); <em>Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779-780 (9th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part, DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b186-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
