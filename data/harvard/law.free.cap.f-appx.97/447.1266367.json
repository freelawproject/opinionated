See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b481-22\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b481-23\">Isabel Gonzalez appealed from the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. We previously granted a certificate of appealability on the following issues: whether Gonzalez received ineffective assistance when his attorney failed to (1) file a requested notice of appeal and/or (2) pursue objections to drug quantity, the leadership enhancement, or the obstruction of justice enhancements at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-24\">The district court dismissed these claims (along with many others), finding that Gonzalez waived the right to file a \u00a7 2255 motion in his plea agreement. However, the plea agreement explicitly reserved the right to challenge \u201cineffective assistance or prosecutorial misconduct not known to [Gonzalez] at the time of [Gonzalez\u2019s] guilty plea.\u201d The claims above fall into this category, as they concern actions or inactions by counsel <em>after </em>Gonzalez\u2019s guilty plea. In addition, Gonzalez has stated colorable claims that cannot be decided summarily on the current record.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-25\">Thus, with the exception of the claim regarding the leadership enhancement which has been waived on appeal,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of the claims described above and remand so that the district court can consider the merits of the claims in the first instance. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Gonzalez\u2019s claim that his attorney improperly failed to object to the leadership enhancement at sentencing. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b481-17\"> In his informal brief, Gonzalez contends that his attorney told him that he was not pleading guilty as a leader or organizer of the conspiracy, despite the fact that the indictment described him as occupying a leadership role. Because Gonzalez should have been aware of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>the contents of the indictment at the time of his guilty plea (and he does not claim otherwise), this issue was waived in his plea agreement. Moreover, the certificate of appealability was granted on Gonzalez\u2019s claim that his attorney withdrew her objection to the leadership enhancement attributed to him in his presentence report. This claim has now also been waived by Gonzalez\u2019s failure to address it in his informal brief. See 4th Cir. R. 34(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
