We have jurisdiction over Thurman\u2019s timely filed appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Giving due deference to the district court\u2019s factual findings, <em>see United States v. Morning, </em>64 F.3d 531, 532 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201c[W]e review the trial court\u2019s factual findings for clear error\u201d), we conclude that the district court properly denied Thurman\u2019s motion to suppress statements from his custodial interrogation. <em>See United States v. Male Juvenile, </em>280 F.3d 1008, 1022 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cWe review de novo the voluntariness of appellant\u2019s confession\u201d). Thurman faults the arresting officers for brandishing firearms and blindfolding him during his initial stop, but these tactics at his arrest did not necessarily foster a coercive atmosphere at the scene of his subsequent custodial interrogation. Because Thurman has not shown that any of the district court\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous, we conclude that \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u201d refute his assertion that the police obtained his confession \u201cby physical or psychological coercion or by improper inducement so that [his] will was overborne.\u201d <em>Male Juvenile, </em>280 F.3d at 1022, <em>quoting Derrick v. Peterson, </em>924 F.2d 813, 817 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">We likewise affirm the denial of Thurman\u2019s motion to suppress evidence from the search of his residence. Viewing the factual record \u201cin the light most favorable to the verdict,\u201d <em>United States v. Kim, </em>25 F.3d 1426, 1432 (9th Cir.1994), we discern no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination that Thurman voluntarily consented to the search of his home. <em>See United States v. Todhunter, </em>297 F.3d 886, 891 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cWe review for clear error a district court\u2019s determination of the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s consent to a search\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b770-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
