Mere threats are rarely considered <em>past </em>persecution triggering the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>sumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Lim v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir.2000). While mere threats may serve as the basis for a well-founded fear of <em>future </em>persecution, it has been recognized that \u201c[t]hreats themselves are sometimes hollow and, while uniformly unpleasant, often do not effect significant actual suffering or harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Persecution is \u201cthe infliction of suffering or harm upon those who differ ... in a way regarded as offensive.\u201d <em>Korablina v. INS, </em>158 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.1998). In the instant case, the threats suffered by Jimenez\u2014 while no doubt unpleasant \u2014 are a far cry from the \u201cextreme\u201d required by this court to support a finding of \u201cpersecution.\u201d <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">But even could the alleged threats against Jimenez somehow be considered persecution, still Jimenez\u2019s petition must be denied because she has presented no evidence tying such persecution to one of the specified statutory grounds. By her own admission, she left Guatemala \u201cbecause of the problem that [her boyfriend] had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">In the final analysis, it simply cannot be said that the \u201cevidence [Jimenez] presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b818-31\"> phis disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
