After careful review of the record, we deny the petition. <em>See Menendez-Donis v. Ashcroft, </em>360 F.3d 915, 917-19 (8th Cir.2004) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-18\">Agboola generally argues that his procedural and substantive due process rights were violated because the immigration judge (IJ) disallowed the testimony of his expert witness. We disagree. <em>See Escudero-Corona v. INS, </em>244 F.3d 608, 614 (8th Cir.2001) (reviewing constitutional challenges de novo). Agboola has not described testimony the proposed expert would have provided that might have changed the IJ\u2019s conclusive determinations. <em>See Kerciku v. INS, </em>314 F.3d 913, 918 (7th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (to find due process violation, applicant must show he was prejudiced by IJ\u2019s refusal to hear testimony, i.e., that testimony had potential for affecting outcome). Nor has he explained how the IJ\u2019s decision to exclude the testimony at issue constituted a substantive due process violation. <em>Cf. Putnam v. Keller, </em>332 F.3d 541, 547-48 (8th Cir.2003) (substantive due process claim requires showing that government officials\u2019 arbitrary action was conscience-shocking).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-20\">Agboola also argues that he should have received asylum based on his religious beliefs and membership in a particular social group. This argument fails as well. The IJ based his asylum decision primarily on his determination that Agboola had misrepresented a material fact by submitting a fraudulent document. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) (alien who, by fraud or willful misrepresentation of material fact, seeks to procure admission to United States is inadmissible). The IJ also gave multiple other reasons for finding that Agboola\u2019s assertions regarding a fear of persecution were not credible. We, like the BIA, defer to the IJ\u2019s credibility findings, as they are well supported by the record and by specific cogent reasons. <em>See Loulou v. Ashcroft, </em>354 F.3d 706, 709 (8th Cir.2003), <em>amended by, </em>No. 02-3004, slip op. (8th Cir. April 28, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-21\">Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
