The district court granted summary judgment for Defendant, holding that a psychiatrist owes no duty to third persons beyond any imposed under the statute, and that the statute is not applicable under the undisputed facts. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">For over forty years Joseph Owens has been mentally ill, in and out of Veterans\u2019 Administration hospitals both upon his own request and through involuntary commitments. Defendant the United States is allegedly liable through the actions of the Veteran\u2019s Administration and the psychiatric physicians who treated Owens over the years. One Dr. John Simpson evaluated Owens a few times during the 1990\u2019s, most notably four days before the August 1994 accident and fatality at issue in this case. Driving the wrong way in an on-coming lane of traffic, Owens struck the Credeur vehicle head-on, injuring Plaintiff Jennifer Credeur and killing her husband Robert Credeur.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-15\">We determine liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in accordance with the laws of the state where the act or omission occurred,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Louisiana in this case. We review summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-16\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-17\">The parties do not dispute that Dr. Simpson and the Veterans\u2019 Administration owed no statutory duty to warn, because the statute applies only to \u201cclearly identified victims,\u201d not the general public.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Owens did not even know the Credeurs when this accident occurred and certainly made no threat against them as identified victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Under plaintiffs interpretation, the statute provides no limitation on a psychotherapist\u2019s duty to third persons to control or protect against violent propensities of a patient, a duty recognized in <em>Estates of Morgan v. Fairfield Family Counseling </em>Center.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree because a Louisiana statute does provide a limitation on the duty owed third persons. <em>Morgan </em>does not persuade since it was decided in another jurisdiction and not under the applicable statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Here a statute on point declares that <em>\u201cA </em>... psychiatrist\u2019s ... duty to warn or to take reasonable precautions to provide protection from violent behavior <em>arises only under the circumstance specified\u201d </em>in that statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That specified circumstance is that the \u201cpatient has communicated a threat of physical violence ... against a clearly identified victim or victims\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 a circumstance all parties to this action admit was not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Plaintiffs attempt to distinguish the duty to warn from the duty to control is to no avail. This statute limits not only the duty to warn but also the duty \u201cto take reasonable precautions to provide protection from violent behavior.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The limited circumstance under which a psychiatrist could owe either duty to third persons did not arise in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Under the stipulated facts and the applicable law, Defendant had no duty to third persons to provide protection from Owen\u2019s violent behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-8\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
