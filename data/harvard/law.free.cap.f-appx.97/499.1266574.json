He asserts that the defendants engaged in fraud and unfair practices in filing a police report against him for a bad check charge, which resulted in his plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>to the offense and to a revocation of his parole. The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing as frivolous Sanders\u2019s claims, inasmuch as his allegations implicate the invalidity of his conviction and revocation, and Sanders has not demonstrated that these have been invalidated. <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997). Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b534-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
