California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Brack responded to counsel\u2019s motion, arguing that the Government breached the plea agreement by failing to move for a downward departure at sentencing in order that she would receive a 40-month sentence, as she was promised. She also maintains that she has a valid ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Accordingly, Brack requests the appointment of substitute appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-22\">This court generally does not review ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims on direct appeal; this case presents no exception. <em>See United States v. Valuck, </em>286 F.3d 221, 229 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1000, 123 S.Ct. 513, 154 L.Ed.2d 394 (2002). Brack\u2019s motion for appointment of substitute counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-23\">Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Brack\u2019s response shows that there are no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and this appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b524-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
