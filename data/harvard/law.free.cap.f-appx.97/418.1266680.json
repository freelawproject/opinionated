Farmer appeals his conviction by a jury of two counts of threatening federal witnesses, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(1) (2000). Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-33\">On appeal, Farmer asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on the prosecutor\u2019s remark that two Government witnesses, Jerry Poore and Edwin Shomaker, had given credible testimony in a prior trial. Farmer asserts the prosecutor\u2019s comment constituted improper bolstering of the witnesses\u2019 testimony based on another jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>decision in a different proceeding. A prosecutor\u2019s improper closing argument may \u201cso infect [ ] the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>135 F.3d 291, 297 (4th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986)) (internal quotation marks omitted). In determining whether a defendant\u2019s due process rights were violated by a prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, this Court considers whether the remarks were, in fact, improper, and, if so, whether the improper remarks so prejudiced the defendant\u2019s substantial rights that the defendant was denied a fair trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s argument in this case was improper. This Court has held that \u201cit is the providence of the defendant\u2019s jury to resolve issues of credibility: referring to what another jury may have done is clearly improper.\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>1 F.3d 235, 240 (quoting <em>United States v. Samad, </em>754 F.2d 1091, 1100 (4th Cir.1984) (observing that a prosecutor may not argue evidence not presented to the jury)). The prosecutor\u2019s statement that \u201c[b]ase[d], in part, on [Poore and Shomaker\u2019s] credible testimony [Ealy] was convicted,\u201d clearly constituted an improper invitation to the jury to consider evidence not presented at trial. The comment in this case, however, although erroneous, was not so prejudicial as to deny Farmer a fair trial. After analyzing the comment under the six-factor test articulated in <em>Wilson, </em>we conclude that the comment did not so substantially prejudice Farmer\u2019s rights that he was denied a fair trial. <em>Wilson, </em>135 F.3d at 299. The district court\u2019s denial of the motion for a new trial was thus not an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Stewart, </em>256 F.3d 231, 241 (4th Cir.2001) (setting forth standard for reviewing denial of motion for new trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Farmer\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
