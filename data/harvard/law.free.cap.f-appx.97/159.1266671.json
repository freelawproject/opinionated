We lack jurisdiction to review the decision because the district court considered the factors asserted by Binford and determined in its discretion that Binford\u2019s case was not outside the heartland of similar cases. <em>United States v. Barajas-Avalos, </em>359 F.3d 1204, 1217-18 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that this court lacked jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward where the district court considered the factors argued by counsel and determined that the case did not fall outside the heartland).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-18\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b194-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
