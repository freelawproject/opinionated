An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>\u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certif\u00edcate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court on the merits absent a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To obtain a certificate of appealability on a claim the district court denied on procedural grounds, Appellant must also show \u201c\u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)). Upon review of the materials before the court, we conclude that Appellant has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-12\">. We note that Appellant\u2019s motion remained pending in the district court for 20 months after the district court issued its order recharacterizing the motion without an attempt to withdraw the motion by Appellant, and that Appellant referred to his motion as the \"Re-characterize[d] 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 Motion\u201d when he supplemented it with additional materials.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
