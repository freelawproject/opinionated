On appeal, Morse alleges that: (1) the district court erred in finding that his prior Virginia conviction for assault and battery against a family or household member under Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-57.2 (Michie 1996) was a predicate \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d and (2) the district court erred in overruling his motion to dismiss on the grounds that \u00a7 922(g)(9), as applied to him, violates: (a) his right to notice that it was illegal for him to possess a firearm or ammunition, (b) the Commerce Clause, (c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the Tenth Amendment, and (d) the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">We find that Morse\u2019s conviction for assault and battery against a family or household member was properly considered a predicate crime for his \u00a7 922(g)(9) conviction. We note that Morse cohabited with the victim of his crime and thus would be considered a \u201cfamily or household member\u201d under Virginia law. <em>See </em>Va.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-228, 18.2-57.2. The facts reveal that Morse struck the victim in the face after she informed him that she was leaving him for another man. Morse\u2019s Virginia conviction and his conduct both meet the definition of a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d as set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">This court has rejected the argument that \u00a7 922(g)(9) is invalid because of notice concerns under the Fifth Amendment. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>209 F.3d 319, 323-24 (4th Cir.2000). Likewise, this court has found that \u00a7 922(g) is a valid exercise of Congress\u2019 power under the Commerce Clause. <em>United States v. Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d 134, 138 (4th Cir.2001). We find that Morse has failed to show that \u00a7 922(g)(9) violates the Tenth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Bostic, </em>168 F.3d 718, 723-24 (4th Cir.1999) (rejecting a Tenth Amendment challenge to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(8)). Finally, Morse provides no authority for his equal protection claim. Other circuits have rejected this claim. <em>United States v. Barnes, </em>295 F.3d 1354, 1368 (D.C.Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Hancock, </em>231 F.3d 557, 565-67 (9th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Lewitzke, </em>176 F.3d 1022, 1025-27 (7th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>171 F.3d 617, 623-26 (8th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
