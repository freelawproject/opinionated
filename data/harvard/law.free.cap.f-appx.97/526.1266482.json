Johnson and Brandon D. Johnson, pro se Tennessee residents, appeal a district court judgment dismissing their attempt to seek judicial review of the denial of social security disability benefits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">On October 19, 1999, Austin Johnson filed a complaint seeking review of the decision of the Commissioner denying his application for disability benefits. Austin Johnson had filed an application for benefits on May 22, 1997, alleging a disability onset date of June 1, 1994. On October 27, 2000, the district court affirmed the decision of the Commissioner. Austin Johnson did not appeal this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">While his appeal from the denial of the May 22, 1997, application for benefits was pending, Austin Johnson filed a second application. The Commissioner reopened Johnson\u2019s case and awarded benefits from an onset date of May 9,1999. On April 23, 2002, Austin and Brandon Johnson<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a complaint against the Commissioner under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Austin Johnson alleged that the Commissioner \u201cviolated his civil rights,\u201d violated \u201cprovisions of the Social Security Act,\u201d \u201cdid not prove his findings at step three in the sequential evaluation process in the initial claim,\u201d \u201cdid not meet his burden at step five in the sequential evaluation process in the initial claim,\u201d and made his decision \u201cin bad faith.\u201d Johnson, claimed that he was entitled to benefits for a period prior to May 9, 1999, because he was disabled as of June 1, 1994. On May 6, 2003, the district court dismissed the complaint. Neither Johnson appealed this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">In their current action, the Johnsons claim that the Commissioner\u2019s determination of an onset date of May 9, 1999, is not supported by substantial evidence. Austin Johnson admits that he did not exhaust his administrative remedies before filing this lawsuit. The Johnsons allege that their claims are constitutional and collateral to the claim of benefits. Therefore, they argue, they are excused from the exhaustion requirement. The district court dismissed the complaint as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">The district court\u2019s order is reviewed de novo on appeal. See <em>Brown v. Bargery, </em>207 F.3d 863, 866 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">The district court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the denial of social security benefits lies under \u00a7 405(g). See <em>Willis v. Sullivan, </em>931 F.2d 390, 396 (6th Cir.1991). In order to obtain judicial review, an initial determination on a claim must first be made by the Commissioner. Following the initial determination, a dissatisfied claimant may seek reconsideration. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.909, 404.920. After reconsideration, a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) may be requested. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.933, 404.936, 404.955. After the ALJ has issued a decision, further review may be sought before the Appeals Council. Only after the Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Council has issued a decision is there a \u201cfinal decision\u201d by the Commissioner within the meaning of \u00a7 405(g). Once a final decision has been made, the claimant may then file an action to review the Commissioner\u2019s decision before the appropriate federal district court. See <em>Willis, </em>931 F.2d at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The Johnsons concede that they have not exhausted their administrative remedies with respect to the determination of a May 9, 1999, onset date. As there has been no final decision by the Commissioner, the district court lacked jurisdiction under \u00a7 405(g) to review that determination. See <em>id. </em>We are not persuaded by the Johnsons\u2019 attempt to characterize their claim as constitutional. The gist of the claim is simply that the Commissioner made an unsupported factual determination. In any event, the district court considered and rejected the Johnsons\u2019 constitution-based claims when it dismissed the complaint filed on April 23, 2002. That decision, which was not appealed, has preclusive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. The Johnsons\u2019 motion for discovery is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-14\">.
