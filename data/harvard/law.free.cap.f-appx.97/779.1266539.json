He asserts that a four-month detention prior to his revocation hearing deprived the district court of jurisdiction over the revocation petition, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>violated his due process rights. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">We first note that, despite his release from custody, the length of Knighten-El\u2019s supervised release term is still at issue and thus this appeal is not moot. <em>See United States v. Verdin, </em>243 F.3d 1174 (9th Cir.2001). We are not persuaded by Knight-en-El\u2019s contention that the district court lacked jurisdiction over his revocation proceeding because of the four-month delay between his arrest and revocation hearing. His reliance on <em>United States v. Hill, </em>719 F.2d 1402 (9th Cir.1983), is misplaced. Unlike in <em>Hill </em>(a probation case), Knight-en-El\u2019s violation was adjudicated well within the period of supervised release and, consequently, the district court retained jurisdiction over his revocation proceeding. <em>Cf. United States v. Neville, </em>985 F.2d 992 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Under the constitutional framework set out in <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 488, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972), <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), and <em>Camacho v. White, </em>918 F.2d 74, 79 (9th Cir.1990), we conclude that the delay was not a violation of Knighten-El\u2019s due process rights or Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1. Significantly, he cannot establish that he was prejudiced by the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b813-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
