Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed.

We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-15\">Akkaraju was CEO and co-owner of Advantage Mortgage in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which brokered millions of dollars in home loans. From late 1996 to April 1998, Akkaraju and others at Advantage secretly acquired more than 40 properties and resold them to buyers who used Advantage to find lenders. To obtain loans for the buyers, Advantage lied about the buyers\u2019 financial status, falsified the amounts of down payments, inflated property appraisals, and concealed the ownership interest of Akkaraju and his confederates. Akkaraju eventually pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to defraud the lenders and transport the proceeds in interstate commerce, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371,1344, 2314, and in 1999 he was sentenced to 20 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. He did not file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-17\">Four years later, after immigration authorities had ordered him deported, Akkaraju filed under the cause number of his criminal case the first of a series of submissions apparently intended to forestall his deportation. In May 2003, while on supervised release, Akkaraju filed motions for a \u201cdeclaratory judgment\u201d that his conspiracy conviction was not an \u201caggravated felony\u201d or \u201ccrime of moral turpitude\u201d for immigration purposes, as well as for leave to withdraw his guilty plea on the ground that it had been entered without knowledge of the immigration consequences. The district court dismissed the first motion for lack of jurisdiction but construed the second as a petition for a writ of error coram nobis and denied it in June 2003 after giving it a new civil cause number. Akkaraju did not appeal either ruling. Instead, in August 2003 he filed two more motions under the cause number of his criminal ease, the first a request for a stay of deportation, and the second a \u201cmotion for writ of error coram nobis.\u201d The district court denied both motions, and Akkaraju, who since has been deported to India, appeals only the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-18\">Though the district court reached the merits, we note a more fundamental reason why the court was right to deny Akkaraju\u2019s submission: despite its title, the August motion was not a request for coram nobis relief at all. When he filed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>motion, Akkaraju was on supervised release, which means he was still \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2255. <em>Kusay v. United States, </em>62 F.3d 192, 193 (7th Cir.1995). And as we said in <em>Owens v. Boyd, </em>235 F.3d 356, 360 (7th Cir.2000), \u201c[pjersons still in custody must look to \u00a7 2254 or \u00a7 2255 for relief\u2019 and cannot use coram nobis \u201cto escape statutory restrictions on those remedies,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 360; <em>see Godoski v. United States, </em>304 F.3d 761, 762-63 (7th Cir.2002). Thus, while Akkaraju undoubtedly would have faced a time bar had he correctly identified his \u201ccoram nobis\u201d motion (or the earlier motion to set aside his guilty plea) as a motion to vacate under \u00a7 2255, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 H 6, that is what the motion was, <em>see Melton v. United States, </em>359 F.3d 855, 858 (7th Cir.2004); <em>Godoski </em>304 F.3d at 763-64; <em>United States v. Evans, </em>224 F.3d 670, 672 (7th Cir.2000). Coram nobis was not even a possibility until Akkaraju\u2019s sentence expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">That aside, the district court correctly discerned that relief would be unwarranted even if conceivable. Akkaraju\u2019s \u201ccoram nobis\u201d motion sought to have his guilty plea set aside on the premise that ignorance of the immigration consequences of a conviction rendered his guilty plea involuntary. But that claim could not have led to relief; coram nobis is an extraordinary remedy, one granted only under compelling circumstances, <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>346 U.S. 502, 511, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248 (1954); <em>United States v. Keane, </em>852 F.2d 199, 202 (7th Cir.1988), and no broader in scope than a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, <em>see Keane, </em>852 F.2d at 204. Akkaraju is correct that a defendant must have sufficient awareness of the consequences of his guilty plea in order for that plea to be knowing and voluntary, <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>536 U.S. 622, 628-29, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 153 L.Ed.2d 586 (2002); <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>337 F.3d 897, 904 (7th Cir.2003), but the defendant need only be informed about direct, not collateral, consequences, <em>Warren v. Richland County Circuit Court, </em>223 F.3d 454, 457 (7th Cir.2000). Immigration consequences are collateral. <em>See Santos v. Kolb, </em>880 F.2d 941, 944 (7th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. George, </em>869 F.2d 333, 337-38 (7th Cir.1989). Thus, even ignoring that Akkaraju had retained an immigration lawyer before he pleaded guilty, and that immigration matters were in fact discussed during his plea colloquy, Akkaraju\u2019s challenge to his guilty plea would not have entitled him to relief under \u00a7 2255, <em>George, </em>869 F.2d at 335-38, and so neither could it have afforded relief under the narrower remedy of coram nobis.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
