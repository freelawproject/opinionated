Treaty Doc. No. 100-20, at 20 (1988), 23 I.L.M. 1027, 1028 (1984) (\u201cConvention Against Torture\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">We conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was based on sufficiently \u201cspecific, cogent\u201d reasons, and is thus supported by substantial evidence. <em>Osorio v. INS, </em>99 F.3d 928, 931 (9th Cir.1996). Because Chen\u2019s testimony was not credible, he failed to meet the standard of proof to qualify for asylum. It necessarily follows that he failed to meet the higher standard to qualify for withholding under the INA. <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">We further hold that the IJ\u2019s denial of Chen\u2019s claim for withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture was supported by substantial evidence. Chen presented no evidence, credible or otherwise, that his mistreatment rose to the level of torture. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">The petition for review is accordingly DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b838-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
