The Respondent\u2019s motion seeking summary affirmance is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Hodgson-Espinoza argues that she is entitled to asylum based on past persecution and fear of future persecution. This court will uphold the BIA\u2019s factual finding that an alien is not eligible for asylum if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). The substantial-evidence standard requires only that the BIA\u2019s decision be based on the evidence presented and that the decision be substantially reasonable. <em>Carbajal</em>\u2014Gonzalez <em>v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The BIA\u2019s conclusion that Hodgson-Espinoza failed to show that she suffered from past persecution or that she had a well-founded fear of future persecution related to her political activity was based on the evidence before it and was substantially reasonable. Hodgson-Espinoza has not shown that her testimony would compel a finding of a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">We consider Hodgson-Espinoza\u2019s asylum claim also as a request for withholding of deportation. Because Hodgson-Espinoza does not meet the standard for asylum, she also does not meet the standard for withholding of deportation. <em>Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 906. Accordingly, Hodgson-Espinoza\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b538-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
