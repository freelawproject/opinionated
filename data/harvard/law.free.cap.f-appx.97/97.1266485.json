We have limited jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition. As the parties are familiar with the facts, we recite them only as necessary to explain our decision. Because the BIA affirmed without opinion, we look to the opinion of the IJ as the final agency action. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(iii); <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 848 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">1. There was substantial evidence for the IJ\u2019s finding that Muniz-Navarette is ineligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and Convention Against Torture relief. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). The official neglect of the Mexican peasantry Muniz-Navarette documented before the IJ did not constitute substantial evidence that he, as a peasant, had a well-founded fear of persecution-\u201cthe infliction of suffering or harm upon those who differ (in race, religion or political opinion) in a way regarded as offensive\u201d-were he returned to Mexico. <em>Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 339 (9th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Without establishing a well-founded fear of persecution, Muniz-Navarette is ineligible for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a); <em>Thomas v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir.2004). He similarly failed to satisfy the threshold showings for withholding of removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">2. The Board\u2019s use of the affirmance without opinion (AWO), or \u201cstreamlining,\u201d procedure did not deny Muniz-Navarette his regulatory right to appeal under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4). We need not decide whether we should ever exercise jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision to streamline an asylum case, a question arguably left open by <em>Falcon Carriche, </em>350 F.3d at 855. Even if petitioner\u2019s case could not properly have been streamlined under \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)(B), as he argues, it could properly have been streamlined under \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">Muniz-Navarette states in his principal brief that the AWO regulation denies him a statutory right to appeal conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(47) but provides no legal argument or citation to authorities in support of this conclusion. Nor does he provide any support for his bare assertion that \u00a7 1101(a)(47) demands that the Board provide \u201cmeaningful\u201d review not provided by a summary affirmance. <em>Cf. Falcon Carriche, </em>350 F.3d at 850 (stating that a summary affirmance is \u201call of the administrative appeal[] to which [a petitioner is] entitled by statute\u201d). Because this court \u201cwill not consider any claims that were not <em>actually argued </em>in appellant\u2019s opening brief,\u201d <em>Independent Towers of Washington v. Washington, </em>350 F.3d 925, 929 (9th Cir.2003) (citation omitted and emphasis added), and because \u201cthe summary mention of an issue ... without reasoning in support of the appellant\u2019s argument[] is insuffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>cient to raise the issue on appeal,\u201d <em>Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, </em>103 F.3d 767, 778 n. 4 (9th Cir.1996), Muniz-Navarette has not preserved his statutory argument. We therefore need not address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The BIA\u2019s use of the affirmance without opinion procedure does not violate Muniz-Navarette\u2019s due process rights. <em>Falcon Carriche, </em>350 F.3d at 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">3. Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that Muniz-Navarette is ineligible for voluntary departure under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(0.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b132-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
