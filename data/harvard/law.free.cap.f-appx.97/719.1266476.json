Ramos-Godinez, </em>273 F.3d 820, 825 (9th Cir.2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Munoz-Peralta crossed the border undetected, and the government was first alerted to the possibility that someone may have crossed the border when Munoz-Peralta triggered the sensor approximately 200 yards from the border. Additionally, the government tracked Munoz-Peralta by following his footprints. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Herrera, </em>273 F.3d 1213, 1219 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that a defendant is free from official restraint when \u201c[pjersistent tracking, rather than visual surveillance, led to [the alien\u2019s] apprehension\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-16\">The district court properly declined to give an \u201cofficial restraint\u201d jury instruction, because the evidence did not support such a theory. <em>See United States v. Castellanos-Garcia, </em>270 F.3d 773, 777 (9th Cir.2001). Likewise, the denial of MunozPeralta\u2019s motion for acquittal was appropriate, because the government presented sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could have concluded that Munoz-Peralta entered the United States free from official restraint. <em>See Ramos-Godinez, </em>273 F.3d at 825; <em>see also Hernandez-Herrera, </em>273 F.3d at 1218 (articulating the standard of review for a motion for acquittal).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b754-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
