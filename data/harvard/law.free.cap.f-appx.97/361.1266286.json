Garvan Murtha, District Judge for the United States District Court for the District of Vermont, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b395-24\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b395-25\">UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of said district court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-26\">Defendant-appellant Edmencio Antonio Rodr\u00edguez-Cruz appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Griesa, <em>District Judge), </em>convicting him of conspiracy to distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 upon his guilty plea. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>February 7, 2002, the district court conducted a <em>Fatico </em>hearing during which it determined Rodriguez-Cruz conspired to distribute between one and three kilograms of heroin. <em>See United States v. Fatico, </em>579 F.2d 707 (2d Cir.1978). On May 21, 2002, Rodriguez-Cruz was sentenced to a term of 97 months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">On appeal, Rodriguez-Cruz argues, inter alia, that the district court\u2019s determination of the amount of heroin involved in the offense was clearly erroneous and that he should have received a base level offense of 26 under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7). Rodriguez-Cruz alternately contends that the district court should have considered a downward departure based on an \u201cextraordinary combination of circumstances.\u201d See <em>United States v. Cordoba-Murgas, </em>233 F.3d 704, 709 (2d Cir.2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The district court\u2019s finding regarding the quantity of heroin was amply supported by the record and did not amount to clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Moreover, a district court\u2019s refusal to downwardly depart is not appealable \u201cunless the guidelines were misapplied, the court misapprehended its authority or imposed an illegal sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Haynes, </em>985 F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir.1993) (citations omitted). In this case, because Rodriguez-Cruz did not move for a downward departure on the basis of an \u201cextraordinary combination of circumstances\u201d under <em>Cordoba-Murgas, </em>we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s failure to depart on that basis. <em>See United States v. Hurtado, </em>47 F.3d 577, 585 (2d Cir.1995) (sentencing court\u2019s silence on a downward departure issue that the defendant did not raise below \u201cdoes not support an inference that the court misunderstood its authority to depart\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">We have considered all of Rodriguez-Cruz\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">Accordingly, and for the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
