Corum applied for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits and Supplemental Security Income payments, claiming the onset of disability in April 1999 because of the residual effects of testicular cancer and its treatment, pancreatitis, abdominal and testicular pain, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, fatigue, and depression. After a hearing, the Commissioner\u2019s administrative law judge (ALJ) denied the application, finding that Corum is a younger individual who suffers from a combination of impairments that are considered severe but do not equal a listed impairment; that he is unable to perform his past relevant work; that his \u201callegations regarding his limitations are not credible;\u201d and that he has transferable work skills and the residual functional capacity to perform a significant range of light work.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-23\">After the Appeals Council denied Co-rum\u2019s request for further administrative review, he commenced this action seeking judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s final decision. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner, concluding that the agency\u2019s final decision is supported by substantial evidence on the administrative record as a whole. Corum appeals, arguing that the ALJ erred in discounting a residual func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>tional capacity assessment by Corum\u2019s treating physician as inconsistent with the physician\u2019s treatment records and the other medical evidence, and that the ALJ erred in discounting Corum\u2019s complaints of disabling pain and fatigue and therefore failed to include all relevant impairments in posing hypothetical questions to the vocational expert who testified at the administrative hearing. The district court\u2019s thorough opinion addressed each of these issues. After thorough review of the record, we affirm for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s Order dated July 29, 2003. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-16\">. The HONORABLE NANETTE K.
