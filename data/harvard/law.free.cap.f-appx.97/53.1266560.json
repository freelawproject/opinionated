McBride alleged that, after she filed a grievance complaining about continued harassment by two officers, Higgins issued her a \u201cmajor disciplinary\u201d for using the grievance process. The disciplinary resulted in a classification reduction, thirty days in segregation, and the loss of good-time credit. McBride sought punitive damages and restoration of her good-time credit and class. Prior to service, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dismissed her complaint without prejudice. McBride appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-21\">The district court properly dismissed McBride\u2019s action after concluding that her claim was foreclosed by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) (to recover damages for unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for harm from actions whose unlawfulness would render conviction or sentence invalid, \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove conviction or sentence has been reversed, expunged, declared invalid, or called into question), because she challenged discipline that included the loss of good-time credit, and a judgment in her favor would necessarily imply the invalidity of her disciplinary conviction. <em>See Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 644-48, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997) (extending <em>Heck </em>to prison discipline decisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-22\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47A(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-18\">. The Honorable George Howard, Jr., United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable John F. Forster, Jr., United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
