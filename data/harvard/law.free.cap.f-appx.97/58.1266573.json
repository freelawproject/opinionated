The court sentenced Pagel to consecutive terms of 127 months imprisonment on the shotgun-possession offense, and 10 months on the firearm-receiving offense, and concurrent 3-year terms of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-19\">On appeal, Pagel\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing the district court erred in applying an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) for Pagel\u2019s possessing a firearm in connection with another felony. Given the undisputed evidence that significant methamphetamine precursors were on Pagel\u2019s property when police found the loaded shotgun in Pagel\u2019s closet, we find no clear error. <em>See United States v. Agee, </em>333 F.3d 864, 866 (8th Cir.2003) (standard of review; enhancement must be imposed unless it is clearly improbable that defendant possessed firearm in connection with another felony offense such as possession or manufacturing of methamphetamine).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-21\">We have also reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and we conclude that the district erred in sentencing Pagel to 127 months in prison on the shotgun-possession offense, because the statutory maximum term for that offense is 10 years imprisonment, or 120 months. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5871; <em>United States v. Montanye, </em>996 F.2d 190, 192 (8th Cir.1993) (en banc) (standard of review when issues are not raised in district court). Rather than remand for resentencing, we modify Pagel\u2019s 137-month prison sentence to consecutive prison terms of 120 months on the shotgun-possession offense and 17 months on the firearm-receiving offense. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 (appellate court may modify any judgment of court brought before it for review); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2 (sentencing on multiple counts of conviction). We have found no other nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-22\">Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm the judgment of the district court as modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
