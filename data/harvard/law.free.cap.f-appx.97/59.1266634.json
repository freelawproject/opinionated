Archambault also appeals the district court\u2019s order quashing his subpoena of a tribal treasurer, who Archambault posits would present evidence of the financial relationship between the tribe and the federal government, in support of his claim the tribe\u2019s authority to prosecute nonmember Indians was delegated rather than inherent. Because we conclude both of Archambault\u2019s contentions are controlled and precluded by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Lara, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 124 S.Ct. 1628, 1639, 158 L.Ed.2d 420, - (2004) (holding tribes have inherent, rather than delegated, power to prosecute nonmember Indians and thus prosecutions brought by a tribe and the federal government for same offense conduct are brought by different sovereigns and do not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause), we affirm the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-30\">.
