Because the district court could, on remand, impose the same 92-month combined sentence, Paredes has. failed to demonstrate that his substantial rights were affected by any error in the district court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.6. <em>See United States v. Leonard, 157 </em>F.3d 343, 346 (5th Cir.1998). Consequently, despite Paredes\u2019 argument to the contrary, he has failed to satisfy the plain-error standard of review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Also for the first time on appeal, Paredes contends that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) and (b) are facially unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Paredes concedes, his argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir. 2000). He raises the issue only to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b525-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
