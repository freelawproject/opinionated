We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b), and we grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Because the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is based on speculation, conjecture and minor inconsistencies concerning the manner and circumstances under which Abdella traveled to the United States from Ethiopia and crossed the Mexico-United States border, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s determination is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Zi Lin Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 611, 617 (9th Cir.2004) (noting that an adverse credibility determination must be based on a \u201cspecific, cogent reason for any stated disbelief\u2019) (citation omitted); <em>see also Salaam v. INS, </em>229 F.3d 1234, 1238 (9th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (\u201cThis Court reverses an adverse credibility determination that is based on \u2018speculation and conjecture\u2019 and is not supported by evidence in the record.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">We remand to the BIA for further proceedings to determine whether Abdella has established eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT in light of her credible testimony. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">Petition for review GRANTED; REMANDED with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b225-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b225-14\">KOZINSKI, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AFo\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">Petitioner\u2019s story of how she came to the United States and unwittingly crossed the United States border at Tijuana without inspection or travel documents of any kind is wholly implausible. The IJ got it exactly right. I would deny the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
