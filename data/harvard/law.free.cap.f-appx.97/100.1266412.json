R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b135-14\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-15\">Gloria Veraly Gonzalez de Morales (\u201cMorales\u201d), a native and citizen of Guatemala, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration\u2019s (\u201cBIA\u201d) per curiam order adopting and affirming the decision of the Immigration Judge (\u201cU\u201d) denying her application for asylum and withholding of removal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review a determination that an applicant has not established eligibility for asylum for substantial evidence, and where, as here, \u201cthe BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision while adding its own reasons, we review both decisions.\u201d <em>Kataria v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1107, 1112 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-18\">Because the IJ did not make an explicit adverse credibility determination, we assume that Morales\u2019 testimony was credible. <em>See Kataria, </em>232 F.3d at 1113-14. However, Morales\u2019 testimony that Guatemalan guerrillas mistreated her in order to obtain food, money, and to recruit her to their ranks, does not compel a finding that she is eligible for asylum. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (stating that a petitioner must provide <em>\u201csome </em>evidence\u201d of her persecutors\u2019 motives that would compel a reasonable fact-finder to find that she was persecuted <em>\u201cbecause of... </em>political opinion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-19\">By failing to qualify for asylum, Morales necessarily fails to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-20\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>No. 03-70477, petitioner\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the motion for stay of removal was granted, or continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, <em>nunc pro </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number><em>tunc, </em>to the filing of the motion for stay of removal, and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Remand, filed on April 7, 2004, is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b135-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
