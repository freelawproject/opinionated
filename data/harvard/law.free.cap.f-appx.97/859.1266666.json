He seeks review of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) order, which summarily affirmed a decision of an immigration judge (IJ) denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Inthasith entered the United States in 1992 pursuant to a valid B 2 nonimmigrant visa, with authorization to remain until March 1, 1993. Shortly after his arrival, he timely filed a request for asylum and withholding. In 1998, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> issued a notice to appear, charging him with remaining in the United States without INS authorization. Inthasith admitted the allegations in the notice to appear, conceded removability, declined to designate a country for removal, and sought asylum and withholding of removal. Following a hearing, the IJ issued an oral decision denying the applications for asylum and withholding of removal, but granting Inthasith\u2019s request for voluntary departure. The BIA, by a single member, summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Inthasith appealed. Exercising jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a), we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Inthasith testified that he was born in 1958 and raised in Laos. His father was a soldier until 1980 on \u201cthe old government side\u201d and absent from the home for long periods of time. Admin. R. at 69-70. His mother was a homemaker and Inthasith had only two or three years of education, after which he worked in agriculture and helped his mother farm. When he was eighteen, he began buying and selling goods, primarily agricultural products, but also illegal weapons \u201conce or twice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">Inthasith testified that he disagrees with the current government because \u201cthey cause[d] my family to flee the country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73. He told his uncle that he did not like the government. Although he trusted his uncle at the time, Inthasith asserted that the uncle had \u201cchanged and he is now on the same side as [the current, i.e., communist,] government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74. Inthasith further related that his uncle had warned him to flee Laos and his mother told him he could not return to Laos.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">Additionally, Inthasith testified that while in Laos he helped those who fled the country and tried to fight back to free Laos. His assistance included giving money to help people cross between Thailand and Laos and arranging border crossings, but did not extend to armed resistance or public opposition to the government. He asserted that he left Laos because he thought a government group was watching him; this \u201cgroup\u201d had questioned him about where he was going and what he was doing. <em>Id. </em>at 76-77. He knew many others who had trouble with the government, including a friend who was shot to death. However, Inthasith was never arrested, hurt, or tortured in Laos, and he left with a valid passport and a ticket in his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">Inthasith\u2019s family now lives in Thailand. Shortly after Inthasith left Laos in 1992, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>his father, younger brother, and three-year old son died. Although Inthasith stated he did not know how they died, he suspected they were poisoned because they all died at the same time. The only reasons he could think of for these supposed killings, however, were that \u201cthey did something\u201d \u201cto get in trouble\u201d or because his father had been a soldier some years before. <em>Id. </em>at 87. Inthasith testified that he thought that if he returned to Laos, he would be captured by the government and killed. He also believed that he would be treated differently by the government, i.e., as an enemy, because of his world travels.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">In addition to Inthasith\u2019s testimony, the IJ considered reports on human rights conditions in Laos (United States State Department Country Reports), which contained no reports of political killings for 1997 or politically motivated disappearances. However, the IJ noted that freedom of speech is restricted, there is no right to privacy, and persons expressing hostility toward the government are subject to arrest. Nonetheless, the 1997 Country Report reflects that many Laotian refugees have returned and that there is no evidence that any of them were punished for simply leaving the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">The IJ first determined that Inthasith had not alleged past persecution, \u201cbut only a reasonable possibility of future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39. This finding is supported by counsel\u2019s statement at the hearing that \u201cwe do not claim that [Inthasith] suffered past persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92. The IJ further determined that the record did not support a credible claim of future persecution, primarily because Inthasith\u2019s facts were vague, even though he had the opportunity to provide specific facts regarding the supposed poisoning of his family members and the opposition group he was allegedly helping with border crossings. The IJ emphasized that Inthasith had never been arrested or harmed. Noting Inthasith\u2019s belief that his uncle had reported Inthasith\u2019s anti-government activities, the IJ found Inthasith\u2019s claim that mere grumbling to a relative, even a communist party member, would result in his custody and death to be farfetched. In addition, the IJ expressed serious doubt that Inthasith would tell anyone in a government position that he was providing funding to insurgents.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">On appeal, Inthasith contends that he qualified as a refugee because of the deaths of his family members (which he labeled as killings) and because of alleged surveillance of him by government authorities. He further argues that the IJ erred in relying on the Country Reports \u201cto the exclusion of other documentary evidence.\u201d Finally, he challenges the BIA\u2019s summary disposition of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">To establish eligibility for asylum, Inthasith must first prove he was a refugee as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). <em>Vatulev v. Ashcroft, </em>354 F.3d 1207, 1208 (10th Cir.2003). The statute defines a refugee as a person unable or unwilling to return to his home country because of \u201cpersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Inthasith bears the burden of proving statutory eligibility. <em>See Woldemeskel v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1185, 1188 (10th Cir.2001). Because this case does not involve past persecution, Inthasith needed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution. This required him to first demonstrate an objective basis for such fear by \u201ccredible, direct, and specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>evidence in the record, of facts that would support a reasonable fear [of] ... persecution.\u201d <em>Yuk v. Ashcroft, </em>355 F.3d 1222, 1233 (10th Cir.2004) (further quotations omitted). \u201cOnce an objective basis is shown, [Inthasith] must show that his ... subjective fear is genuine.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The IJ determined that Inthasith had failed to meet his burden of establishing refugee status. When the BIA summarily affirms an IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s analysis as if it were that of the BIA. <em>Tsevegmid v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 1231, 1235 (10th Cir.2003). Our standard is deferential. We review the IJ\u2019s resolution of initial refugee status for substantial evidence and must uphold the IJ\u2019s determination that Inthasith is not eligible for asylum if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Yuk, </em>355 F.3d at 1233 (further quotations omitted). To establish grounds for reversal, Inthasith \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We do not, however, weigh the evidence, nor do we \u201cquestion the [IJ\u2019s] credibility determinations as long as they are substantially reasonable.\u201d <em>Woldemeskel, </em>257 F.3d at 1192.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">To the extent Inthasith may be relying on the deaths of family members in support of a reasonable fear of future persecution, the IJ found this testimony lacked credibility. The reasons given for this finding \u2014 lack of specific facts, no reports of political killings \u2014 satisfy our requirement that credibility determinations \u201cmust be substantially reasonable.\u201d <em>Sviridov v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 722, 727 (10th Cir.2004) (citation omitted). The IJ also noted that Inthasith\u2019s description of his assistance to some group opposed to the government was very vague and lacking in details. In addition, the Country Reports relied on constitute probative evidence in a well-founded fear case. <em>See Tsevegmid, </em>336 F.3d at 1235-36. Contrary to Inthasith\u2019s claim, the record simply does not establish Inthasith participated in \u201copposition activities which might subject the family to possible sanctions.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 20. Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s factual findings are conclusive because Inthasith has failed to demonstrate that any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>See Tsevegmid, </em>336 F.3d at 1235 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">The IJ also denied Inthasith\u2019s application for withholding of deportation. For entitlement to withholding, Inthasith must establish \u201ca clear probability of persecution, ... a higher standard than that for asylum.\u201d <em>Yuk, </em>355 F.3d at 1236 (quotation omitted). \u201cBecause Inthasith[] failed to meet the lower standard of showing entitlement to asylum, the IJ correctly denied [his] application for withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Finally, we have upheld the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance procedures against various challenges. <em>See Yuk, </em>355 F.3d at 1228-32 (upholding summary affirmance regulations as comporting with due process and administrative law principles); <em>Batalova v. Ashcroft, </em>355 F.3d 1246, 1251-54 (10th Cir.2004) (upholding review by single BIA member); <em>Sviridov, </em>358 F.3d at 726-27 (upholding BIA\u2019s procedures against claim that BIA failed to comply with applicable regulations and denied Inthasith due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">We have carefully examined the record and conclude that the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations are substantially reasonable. <em>See Woldemeskel, </em>257 F.3d at 1192. In addition, the IJ\u2019s decision is \u201csupported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>reasonable, substantial and probative evidence on the record as a whole\u201d and will be upheld for that reason. <em>Id. </em>at 1189. For these reasons, we DENY the petition for review and AFFIRM the BIA\u2019s decision to deny asylum and withholding of deportation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b893-15\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-13\">. \"The INS ceased to exist on March 1, 2003, and its functions were transferred to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ('US-CIS\u2019) within the newly formed Department of Homeland Security.\u201d <em>Batalova v.
