(the \u201cCompany\u201d) engaged in employment discrimination by refusing to sponsor him for a millwright apprentice<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>ship program because of his Hispanic ethnicity. The district court dismissed the action on the basis of issue preclusion. As the parties are familiar with the facts, procedural history, and arguments, we will not recount them here. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">\u201c[A]s the parties] asserting issue preclusion, [the defendants] must show that the estopped issues are identical to issues litigated in a prior action.\u201d <em>Resolution Trust Corp. v. Keating, </em>186 F.3d 1110, 1116 (9th Cir.1999). We look to four factors to aid in \u201c[d]etermining whether two issues are identical for purposes of collateral estoppel\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">(1) is there a substantial overlap between the evidence or argument to be advanced in the second proceeding and that advanced in the first?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">(2) does the new evidence or argument involve the application of the same rule of law as that involved in the prior proceeding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-7\">(3) could pretrial preparation and discovery related to the matter presented in the first action reasonably be expected to have embraced the matter sought to be presented in the second?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-8\">(4) how closely related are the claims involved in the two proceedings?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-9\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Application of these four factors compels the conclusion that the issues raised in this case are identical to those litigated in <em>Sun Studs I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">The second factor is clearly met: Reynaga\u2019s new claim involves the application of the same rule of law, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, as that involved in <em>Sun Studs I. </em>The three remaining factors are also satisfied. As to the first factor, there is a substantial overlap between the evidence and argument advanced in <em>Sun Studs II </em>and that advanced in <em>Sun Studs I. </em>Though Reynaga offers minor factual distinctions between the cases, collateral estoppel is \u201capplicable even though some facts differed in the two cases at issue, because the differing facts were not \u2018essential to the judgment\u2019 or \u2018of controlling significance\u2019 in the first case.\u201d <em>Starker v. United States, </em>602 F.2d 1341, 1346 (9th Cir.1979) (citation omitted). That the dates that Reynaga asked and was refused an apprenticeship sponsorship are different, without more, is not of \u201ccontrolling significance.\u201d Moreover, Gatzke\u2019s new rationale regarding uncertain time commitments was in addition to, and in no way undermined or contradicted, the Company\u2019s official reiteration of its \u201clack of business need\u201d rationale, which was unequivocally advanced in its October 3, 2000 memorandum to Reynaga and its January 16, 2001 letter to Reynaga\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-12\">The third factor is also satisfied, as pretrial preparation and discovery related to the matter presented in <em>Sun Studs I </em>could reasonably be expected to have embraced the matter presented in <em>Sun Studs II. </em>Reynaga\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d evidence of disparate treatment and the Company\u2019s sponsorship of the apprenticeship program could just as easily have been discovered at the time of <em>Sun Studs I. </em>Litigants may not have a second opportunity to prove a fact or make an argument relating to an issue previously decided. <em>See Yamaha Corp. of America v. United States, </em>961 F.2d 245, 254 (D.C.Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 1078, 113 S.Ct. 1044, 122 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (\u201c[0]nce an <em>issue </em>is raised and determined, it is the entire <em>issue </em>that is precluded, not just the particular arguments raised in support of it in the first case\u201d (emphasis in original)). Where the same parties are involved, there is no exception for prior decisions that were wrongly decided because of insufficient or unavailable evidence. <em>See Brown v. Felsen, </em>442 U.S. 127, 132, 99 S.Ct. 2205, 60 L.Ed.2d 767 (1979) (noting that issue preclusion often \u201cblockades unexplored paths that may lead to truth\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Finally, the fourth factor is satisfied, as Reynaga\u2019s claim in <em>Sun Studs II </em>is closely related to his employment discrimination claim in <em>Sun Studs I. </em>Indeed, Reynaga\u2019s entire justification for bringing suit in <em>Sun Studs II </em>is that he had been \u201cdenied in the past\u201d relief and he now possesses previously undiscovered evidence of disparate treatment and of the Company\u2019s sponsorship of the apprenticeship.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The district court therefore did not err in dismissing Reynaga\u2019s claim on the basis of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b763-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
