Johnson, filed the present petition for review of the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board), dated August 21, 2003. The Board\u2019s decision held that it lacked jurisdiction over petitioner\u2019s individual right of action (IRA) appeal. Because the Board did not err in reaching its decision, this court <em>affirms.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-23\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b359-24\">Petitioner was employed by the United States Department of Defense (agency) as a Sales Store Checker. During her probationary period, petitioner was terminated from that position, effective November 1, 1997, due to \u201cattendance, rudeness and lack of good customer service.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>95 M.S.P.R. 192, 112 (2003). The official responsible for making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the decision to terminate petitioner was Sharon Hoffler. Ms. Hoffler conferred with Michael Mena in reaching the decision. Petitioner believes she was terminated in retaliation for statements she made during a meeting with the Deputy Director of the Commissary and other employees in September 1997. Ms. Hoffler and Mr. Mena were not present at the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Petitioner filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) alleging she was removed from her position in retaliation for whistleblowing. OSC closed petitioner\u2019s file and informed petitioner of her right to file an IRA appeal with the Board. Petitioner filed her IRA appeal, which the Board ultimately dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Specifically, the Board held that petitioner did not make a nonfrivolous allegation that her alleged protected disclosures were a contributing factor in her removal because she did not allege that Ms. Hoffler was aware of the statements at the time of removal. This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Whether the Board has jurisdiction to adjudicate a particular appeal is a question of law, which this court reviews <em>de novo. Herman v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>193 F.3d 1375, 1378 (Fed.Cir.1999). \u201c[T]he Board has jurisdiction over an IRA appeal if the appellant has exhausted his administrative remedies before the OSC and makes \u2018non-frivolous allegations\u2019 that (1) he engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8), and (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency\u2019s decision to take or fail to take a personnel action as defined by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a).\u201d <em>Yunus v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed.Cir.2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Petitioner exhausted her administrative remedies before the OSC before filing her IRA appeal with the Board. Petitioner alleged that she had made a protected disclosure as defined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8). Thus, the sole jurisdictional issue on appeal is whether petitioner\u2019s allegations satisfy the requirement to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the decision to terminate petitioner\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Petitioner believes her factual allegations establish jurisdiction and that she is entitled to a hearing on the merits of her case. Wfliat petitioner misses, however, is that the Board\u2019s decision was based on petitioner\u2019s version of the facts. The Board found that petitioner did not allege that the deciding officer, Ms. Hoffler, knew of the asserted protected disclosures at the time petitioner was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Having reviewed the Board\u2019s decision and the record, this court agrees that petitioner did not make a nonfrivolous allegation that her protected disclosures were a contributing factor in the decision to terminate her employment. Petitioner\u2019s appeal merely alleges she made protected disclosures and that she was subsequently terminated. She did not allege facts that tie the two occurrences together, such as Ms. Hoffler learning of the protected disclosures prior to terminating petitioner\u2019s employment. Because petitioner failed to meet this prong of the jurisdictional test, this court affirms the Board\u2019s decision to dismiss petitioner\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
