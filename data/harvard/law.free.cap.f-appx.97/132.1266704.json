During a search of Whalen\u2019s home, FBI agents found two floppy diskettes containing 44 images of child pornography and a laptop computer containing an additional 29 images of child pornography. Whalen argues that the district court erred in counting each graphics file containing an image of child pornography as an \u201citem\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.4(b)(2). He also argues that the district court erred in declining to depart downward on the basis of his alleged diminished mental capacity. We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Montano, </em>250 F.3d 709, 712 (9th Cir.2001). We lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s decision not to depart downward absent evidence that the court believed it lacked the authority to do so. <em>United States v. Tam, </em>240 F.3d 797, 805 (9th Cir.2001). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-25\">We conclude that the district court did not err in counting each graphics file containing an image of child pornography as ah \u201citem\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.4(b)(2). Whalen\u2019s argument is squarely foreclosed by our decisions in <em>United States v. Fellows, </em>157 F.3d 1197, 1201-02 (9th Cir.1998), and <em>United States v. Perreault, </em>195 F.3d 1133, 1134-35 (9th Cir.1999). Because the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>clearly acknowledged that it had the authority to depart downward on the basis of diminished mental capacity (among other grounds), we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to consider the district court\u2019s decision not to depart downward. <em>Tam, </em>240 F.3d at 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b166-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
