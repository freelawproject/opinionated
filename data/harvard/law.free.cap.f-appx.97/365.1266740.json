For the reasons cited below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">We will review the facts briefly. On July 31,1998, a judgment of approximately $225,000 was entered against Victor International, Inc. (\u201cVictor\u201d), a New Jersey corporation. On November 24, 1999, Victor filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. On May 10, 2000, the Trustee appointed to Victor\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy filed a two-count complaint initiating an adversary proceeding against Taiwan Machinery, an entity that shared' substantially common ownership with Victor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint alleged that Victor had fraudulently transferred its assets to Taiwan Machinery, in violation of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548(a) and the New Jersey Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 25:2-25(a)-(b), 25: 2-27, incorporated into the adversary proceeding through 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544(b). On June 12, 2000, Taiwan Machinery filed an answer denying the allegations in the complaint and alleging that the demise of Victor\u2019s business was due to market forces beyond its control.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The parties engaged in discovery from June of 2000 until April of 2002. During this period, Taiwan Machinery consistently defied or deflected virtually every document request put forward by the Trustee and the Bankruptcy Court. When Taiwan Machinery did deign to provide documents, it did so selectively. Taiwan Machinery refused to comply with all three of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s orders, was held in contempt of court twice, and was subject to monetary sanctions. On May 24, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court ordered that Taiwan Machinery\u2019s answer be stricken, and it issued a default judgment of $373,607 in favor of the Trustee and against Taiwan Machinery. The District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">In this appeal, Taiwan Machinery argues that the District Court erred in affirming the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s default judgment because (1) the Trustee did not present sufficient evidence before the Bankruptcy Court to support the entry of a default judgment and (2) the Bankruptcy Court improperly quantified the default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-14\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334(b) and 157(b)(1). The District Court had appellate jurisdiction over the judgment of the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-15\">Because the District Court in this case sat as an appellate court reviewing a final order of the Bankruptcy Court, our review of its determination is plenary. <em>Interface Group-Nevada, Inc. v. Trans World Airlines, Inc. (In re Trans World Airlines, Inc.), </em>145 F.3d 124, 130 (3d Cir.1998). In reviewing the decision of the Bankruptcy Court, we exercise the same standard of review as the District Court, that is, we review the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s legal determinations de novo, its factual findings for clear error, and its exercise of discretion for abuse thereof. <em>Id. </em>at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The Bankruptcy Court entered a judgment by default against Taiwan Machinery pursuant to Fed.R.Bankr. 7037(b)(2), which adopts verbatim Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2). We review a decision to dismiss or enter a default judgment pursuant to Rule 37 under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Poulis v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>747 F.2d 863, 868 (3d Cir.1984). Substantial deference is afforded to a court\u2019s decision to dismiss. <em>See Mindek v. Rigatti, </em>964 F.2d 1369, 1373 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In determining whether a court properly exercised its discretion in ordering a default judgment, this Court takes into account six factors as articulated in <em>Poulis: </em>(1) the extent of the party\u2019s personal responsibility; (2) the prejudice the adversary caused by the failure to meet scheduling orders and respond to discovery; (3) a history of dilatoriness; (4) whether the conduct of the party or the attorney was willful or in bad faith; (5) the effectiveness of sanctions other than dismissal, which entails an analysis of alternative sanctions; and (6) the meritoriousness of the claim or defense. <em>Poulis, </em>747 F.2d at 868 (emphasis omitted). Not all six factors are necessary for the entry of default. <em>Hoxworth v. Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co., Inc., </em>980 F.2d 912, 919-21 (3d Cir.1992); <em>cf. Hicks v. Feeney, </em>850 F.2d 152, 156 (3d Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The record makes it abundantly clear that the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in filing a default judgment against Taiwan Machinery. In its recitation of the discovery and motion proceedings, the Bankruptcy Court amply considered the <em>Poulis </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">First, there is no dispute that Taiwan Machinery had personal responsibility to participate in the proceedings. Second, there was prejudice to the Trustee in Taiwan Machinery\u2019s failure to meet scheduling orders and respond to discovery, namely its failure to supply its tax returns. <em>See, e.g., Curtis T. Bedwell &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Int\u2019l Fidelity Ins. Co., </em>843 F.2d 683, 693 (3d Cir.1988). Taiwan Machinery\u2019s refusal to provide the requisite tax returns or even to supply the promised alternative financial materials substantially hindered the Trustee from analyzing financial transactions between Victor and Taiwan Machinery.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">Third, there was more than a sufficient basis for the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s finding of dilatoriness. The record of pervasive dilatoriness is set forth in detail in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s opinion. Suffice it to say here that Taiwan Machinery\u2019s history of resistance began with its initial refusal to comply with the Trustee\u2019s request for production of documents at the start of discovery and continued with Taiwan Machinery\u2019s failure to follow three of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s orders, dated June 20, 2001, August 7, 2001, and February 5, 2002. Taiwan Machinery\u2019s failure to comply with each order is even more remarkable in light of the considerable effort expended by the Bankruptcy Court to accommodate Taiwan Machinery\u2019s objections. Such consistent unresponsiveness epitomizes evasiveness. <em>See, e.g., Comdyne I, Inc. v. Corbin, </em>908 F.2d 1142, 1148 (3d Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">Fourth, we are persuaded by the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s determination that Taiwan Machinery exhibited willful and contumacious behavior. As discussed, during the sixteen month discovery period, Taiwan Machinery repeatedly failed to fulfill the numerous document requests put forward by the Trustee and the Bankruptcy Court. The Bankruptcy Court granted Taiwan Machinery\u2019s pleas to modify various orders, by, for example, allowing alternative financial documentation limited to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>State of New Jersey in lieu of the tax returns and accepting modified tax disclosures tailored to the company\u2019s accounting practices. Taiwan Machinery nevertheless failed even to meet its document production obligations under these generous accommodations. Taiwan Machinery\u2019s tactic of only providing those documents <em>it </em>deemed appropriate to produce understandably prompted the Bankruptcy Court to question its good faith. In the face of Taiwan Machinery\u2019s repeated and self-serving refusals to comply, we cannot say that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s finding that Taiwan Machinery acted in bad faith was clearly erroneous. <em>See e.g., Hoxworth, </em>980 F.2d at 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Fifth, it is abundantly clear from the record that the Bankruptcy Court tried various sanctions or threatened sanctions to compel Taiwan Machinery to produce the necessary documents. The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decisions to hold Taiwan Machinery in contempt and to impose monetary sanctions were not effective. After reminding Taiwan Machinery\u2019s counsel that it was at the \u201cthird or fourth bite at this dealing with monetary sanctions,\u201d the Bankruptcy Court found, \u201cit seems to me that though this Court is willing to consider and has considered less drastic remedies ... [but] the Court is in a position where it believes it\u2019s run out of rather ordinary sanctions. Monetary sanctions apparently won\u2019t work.\u201d (Appendix at 514). As the Bankruptcy Court further noted, \u201c[t]his Court has looked for lesser sanctions than an ultimate sanction and has in the past given any number of what can only be decided as breaks or relief from previously ordered penalties, but that soft-handed approach hasn\u2019t worked, in fact, quite the opposite. It may have made matters worse. So, monetary sanctions are not effective.\u201d (Appendix at 518)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Finally, we are persuaded that the merit of the Trustee\u2019s claims supports the Bankruptcy Court's decision to levy a default judgment against Taiwan Machinery. This Court reviews such claims with a moderately deferential standard of review. <em>See Poulis, </em>747 F.2d at 869-70. In <em>Poulis, </em>we said, \u201cwe do not purport to use summary judgment standards. A claim, or defense, will be deemed meritorious when the allegations of the pleadings, if established at trial, would support recovery by plaintiff or would constitute a complete defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As discussed more fully below, the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s findings of fraudulent transfer also lend strong support to the final decision. While this Court has observed that the sanction of default is often disfavored, we have also held that \u201cthe district court rather than the court of appeals is in the best position to evaluate whether a default is proper.\u201d <em>Hoxworth, </em>980 F.2d at 922. The Bankruptcy Court extended considerable latitude, patience, and forbearance to Taiwan Machinery, and the latter disdained all three. Based on our review of the record and the length and tenor of the proceedings, there is more than adequate support for the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s findings and no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Appellant takes specific issue with the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s finding of fraudulent transfer of assets between Victor and Taiwan Machinery. We find that the Bankruptcy Court did not commit error in concluding that there was fraudulent conveyance between the parties. The circumstances surrounding the bankruptcy, the demise of Victor, and the concomitant ascendance of Taiwan Machinery support the determination that a fraudulent transfer occurred between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The Bankruptcy Court presented a thorough and full explication of its findings of fraudulent conveyance between the parties in its discussion in the context of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 548(a), 544(b). In this regard, the Bankruptcy Court correctly relied on considerable circumstantial evidence to deduce fraudulent transfer. \u201cA court may make a finding of fraudulent intent under section 548(a)(1) on the basis of circumstantial evidence; direct proof of the transferor\u2019s fraudulent intent will rarely be available.\u201d <em>In re Roco Corp., </em>701 F.2d 978, 984 (1st Cir.1983). Company representatives admitted that Victor\u2019s employees, customer base, and physical assets (space and telephone and fax lines) were subsumed by Taiwan Machinery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A review of Victor\u2019s bare-bones and belatedly-supplied financial records established that no \u201creasonably equivalent value\u201d was provided to Victor in exchange for the assets transferred to Taiwan Machinery.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Also revealing was the out-of-the-ordinary-eourse depletion of Victor\u2019s assets, the elimination of its sales, and the substantially contemporaneous increase in Taiwan\" Machinery\u2019s revenues and assets. This evidence is summarized in part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">_Victor International, Inc._</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">1997 Return 1998 Return 1999 Return</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">_7/1/97 \u2014 6/30/98 7/1/98 \u2014 6/30/99 7/1/99 \u2014 2/29/00</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">Assets_$ 231,465,00_$ 22,413.00_$ 8,674.00</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">Gross receipts_$1,511,034.00_$ 18,514.00_$_0.00</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">_Taiwan Machinery Trade Center_ year ending year ending</p>\n<p id=\"b403-14\">_9/30/99_9/30/00</p>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">New Jersey Gross receipts_$1,580.729.67_$3,156,591.94</p>\n<p id=\"b403-16\">Finally, we observe that Taiwan Machinery\u2019s obduracy in discovery and its refusal to provide its tax documentation hampered the Trustee and Bankruptcy Court in resolving the fraudulent transfer charge and assessing the value of the transfer. Taiwan Machinery\u2019s conduct, among other things, left it \"with no proof or argument to rebut the overwhelming circumstantial evidence of fraudulent transfer of assets.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-17\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-18\">The Bankruptcy Court also properly exercised its discretion by entering a default judgment against Taiwan Machinery in an amount equivalent to the sum of the net debt left behind when Taiwan Machinery assumed Victor\u2019s assets. As the Bankruptcy Court noted, the measure of damage for a fraudulent conveyance is recovery of the value of the transfer. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 548(a), 550(a) and N.J.StatAnn. \u00a7 25:230b. Having been denied the ability to comprehensively assess the extent of the fraudulent transfers through Taiwan Machinery\u2019s own misconduct, the Bankruptcy Court was reasonable in determining that the measure of damages should be quantified by the net debt left behind by Victor. <em>Cf. Acequia, Inc. v. Clinton, </em>34 F.3d 800, 810-12 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s alternative determination that Taiwan Machinery\u2019s taking of Victor\u2019s business amounted to a de facto merger also supports the amount of the default judgment. As the Bankruptcy Court noted, a company that effects a de facto consolidation or merger is hable for the debts of each merging entity. <em>See Luxliner P.L. Export, Co. v. RDI/Luxliner, Inc., </em>13 F.3d 69, 73 (3d Cir.1993). This reinforces the damages finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Taiwan Machinery is in no real position to challenge the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s reasonable estimate of damages. Taiwan Machinery cannot credibly argue that the assessment of damages was not based on more accurate data, given that its wrongdoing rendered such data unavailable. \u201cThe most elementary conceptions of justice and public policy require that the wrongdoer shall bear the risk of the uncertainty which his own wrong has created.\u201d <em>Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., </em>327 U.S. 251, 265, 66 S.Ct. 574, 90 L.Ed. 652 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We have considered all of the arguments advanced by the parties and conclude that no further discussion is necessary. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-9\">. As the record reveals, Victor and Taiwan Machinery shared the same principal owner, Alen Hueng, as well as a number of board members.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b403-20\">. In the late fall of 1998 or early 1999, Taiwan Machinery began operating out of Victor\u2019s New Jersey premises and even began paying utility bills for the space. A utility bill for service through November 11, 1998, listed \"Taiwan Machinery Co. Trade Center\u201d as the payor for the premises.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b403-22\">. In addition, the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision could hardly come as a surprise, given that it clearly warned Taiwan Machinery twice that its failure to comply fully with the outstanding orders would subject it to the sanctions set out in Rule 37.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
