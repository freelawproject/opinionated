The Indictment alleged that Hernandez-Gareia had three prior aggravated felony convictions, which if true, would increase his maximum prison sentence from 10 to 20 years. Before trial, Hernandez-Gareia moved to dismiss the Indictment on the ground that his three prior convictions did not constitute aggravated felonies. The district court denied the motion, ruling that this was a sentencing issue best deferred to that phase of the proceedings. Hernandez-Gareia conditionally pled guilty to the Indictment, reserving the right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his pretrial motion. The district court sentenced Hernandez-Gareia to 24 months imprisonment, and three years supervised release. Hernandez-Gareia completed his prison term January 7, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">Hernandez-Gareia asserts that the district court\u2019s refusal to determine whether his prior felony convictions constituted aggravated felonies was a violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12. He also appeals the district court\u2019s decision that his conviction under California Vehicle Code \u00a7 2800.2 constituted an aggravated felony. The Government cross-appeals certain aspects of Hemandez-Garcia\u2019s sentence. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">I. <em>Hemandez-Garcia\u2019s Motion to Dismiss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12, a defendant may raise by pretrial motion \u201c[a]ny defense, objection, or request which is capable of determination, without the trial of the general issue.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b). A district court must decide a legal issue before trial \u201cif it is \u2018entirely segregable\u2019 from the evidence to be presented at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Shortt Accountancy Corp., </em>785 F.2d 1448, 1452 (9th Cir.1986) (quoting <em>United States v. Barletta, </em>644 F.2d 50, 57-58 (1st Cir. 1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-16\">The Indictment charged Hernandez-Garcia with one count of being found in the United States without permission after being deported four times, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. It properly alleged each of the elements of a \u00a7 1326 violation: (1) that Hernandez-Gareia was an alien; (2) that he had been deported from the United States on December 17, 1997, April 24, 1998, June 9, 1999, and April 24, 2001; and (3) that he returned to the United States following deportation without permission of the Government. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. A prior alleged ag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>gravated felony is considered a sentencing factor and not an element of \u00a7 1326. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 228, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Because the pretrial motion raised only a sentencing issue, the district court did not err in declining to dismiss the Indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">II. <em>California Vehicle Code \u00a7 2800.2</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The district court concluded that Hernandez-Garcia\u2019s prior conviction under California Vehicle Code \u00a7 2800.2 was an aggravated felony, and enhanced his sentence accordingly under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). This court reviews de novo whether a conviction constitutes an aggravated felony. <em>United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>247 F.3d 905, 907 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">A prior conviction is an aggravated felony for the purpose of enhancing a \u00a7 1326 sentence if it falls within one of the definitions set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). The Government contends that Hernandez-Garcia\u2019s conviction falls within one such definition, <em>viz., </em>\u201ca crime of violence (as defined in section 16 of Title 18, but not including a purely political offense) for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). Section 16 defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[an] offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Under the modified categorical approach set forth in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), a court first examines the statutory definition of the prior offense. <em>Id. </em>at 602; 110 S.Ct. 2143. If the statute \u201creaches both conduct that would constitute a crime of violence and conduct that would not, we have interpreted Taylor\u2019s edict to include examination of documentation or judicially noticeable facts that clearly establish that the conviction is a predicate conviction for enhancement purposes.\u201d <em>Rivera-Sanchez, </em>247 F.3d at 908 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">In <em>United States v. Campos-Fuerte, </em>357 F.3d 956 (9th Cir.2004), we held that a conviction under a previous version of California Vehicle Code \u00a7 2800.2 constitutes an aggravated felony. <em>Campos-Fuerte </em>is not binding in this case, however, because \u00a7 2800.2 was amended in 1996 to add that willful and wanton disregard includes \u201cdriving while fleeing or attempting to elude a pursuing police officer during which time either three or more violations that are assigned a traffic point ... occur, or damage to property occurs.\u201d <em>See People v. Sewell, </em>80 Cal.App.4th 690, 694, 95 Cal.Rptr.2d 600 (2000). As a result, amended \u00a7 2800.2, under which Hernandez-Garcia was convicted, \u201creaches both conduct that would constitute a crime of violence and conduct that would not.\u201d Therefore, it does not categorically qualify as a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">Under <em>Taylor, </em>we must examine the judicially noticeable facts to determine whether Hernandez-Garcia was convicted under the portions of \u00a7 2800.2 that prohibit behavior constituting a crime of violence. Hernandez-Garcia\u2019s plea agreement to the \u00a7 2800.2 charge establishes that he was convicted of behavior which qualifies as a crime of violence. Specifically, Hernandez-Gareia pled guilty to driving \u201cwith willful [sic] and wanton disregard for the safety of others, and in so doing[,] placed my daughter in a situation and under circumstances which could have resulted in great bodily harm.\u201d Therefore, Hernandez-Garcia\u2019s \u00a7 2800.2 conviction constitutes an aggravated felony for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the purposes of \u00a7 1326(b)(2)\u2019s sentence enhancement provision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">III. <em>Downward Departure for Cultural Assimilation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The Government argues that the district court erred when it granted Hernandez-Garcia a two-level downward departure for cultural assimilation. We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to grant a downward departure. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>356 F.3d 1086, 1098-99 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that the PROTECT Act\u2019s de novo standard of review applies to appeals pending on the date of the Act\u2019s enactment).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">A district court may depart from the Sentencing Guidelines when \u201cthere exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different [than described in the Guidelines].\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)). In <em>United States v. Lipman, </em>133 F.3d 726 (9th Cir.1998), this court held that a district court may depart downward on the basis of a defendant\u2019s \u201ccultural assimilation.\u201d <em>Lipman, </em>133 F.3d at 731; <em>see also United States v. Rivas-Gonzalez, </em>365 F.3d 806, 809-11, 2004 WL 859315 at *2-*3 (9th Cir. April 22, 2004). A court may consider the extent of the defendant\u2019s family and community ties, and whether \u201chis motives [for reentering the country] were familial or cultural rather than economic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Hernandez-Garcia presents circumstances outside the heartland of the usual \u00a7 1326 defendant. He was brought into the United States by his mother when he was only six years old, and has lived continuously in the United States for 28 years. He attended and graduated from a California public school, and played sports there. He applied for, and likely would have received, citizenship if he had not missed an appointment with the INS because he was in jail for a minor offense. Hernandez-Garcia\u2019s family, including three American-citizen children, live in the United States. His repeated reentry into the United States was motivated by the desire to be with his family, not economic gain. He worked legally in the United States for many years. Hernandez-Garcia is fluent in English, but speaks only limited Spanish. As such, Hernandez-Garcia is an ideal candidate for the cultural assimilation downward departure, as he is a person \u201cbrought to the United States as [a child], who had adapted to American culture in a strong way and who, after deportation, returned to the United States for cultural rather than economic reasons.\u201d <em>Rivas-Gonzalez, </em>365 F.3d 806, 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">We reject the Government\u2019s contention that Hemandez-Garcia\u2019s multiple deportations and criminal record per se render him ineligible for the cultural assimilation departure. Rather, they are factors to be considered by the district court, as was done here.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b155-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-9\">. Because we affirm as to Hernandez-Garcia\u2019s California Vehicle Code \u00a7 2800.2 conviction, we need not address the Government\u2019s cross-appeal on the district court's decision with respect to Hernandez-Garcia's California Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 <em>11377 conviction.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
