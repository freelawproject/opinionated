Medina-Viedma\u2019s counsel moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">On appeal, counsel argues the sentence imposed was too harsh and the district court failed to state a reason for imposing a sentence at the top of the Guidelines range. These arguments fail. MedinaViedma\u2019s sentence falls within 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2)\u2019s 20-year maximum, it is within the appropriate Guidelines range, and we will not review the sentence merely because it is at the top of the range, <em>see United States v. Woodrum, </em>959 F.2d 100, 101 (8th Cir.1992), and the district court was not required to state its reasons for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the Guidelines range (57 to 71 months), <em>cf. 18 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1) (requiring sentencing court to state reasons for imposing sentence at particular point within Guidelines range where range exceeds 24 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">After reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment, and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-31\">. The Honorable Linda R. Reade, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
