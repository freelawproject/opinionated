We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-26\">Gamez contends that the district court plainly erred by enhancing his sentence on the basis of a prior felony drug-trafficking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>offense that was not alleged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. This contention is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1127 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201c[T]he district court properly enhanced [defendant\u2019s] offense level on the basis of prior aggravated felonies even though he did not admit to having committed them, and even though the government neither alleged them in the indictment nor proved them at trial beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Gamez contends that the district court improperly applied a 12-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) for a prior drug-trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed was 13 months or less, because he received a suspended prison sentence with two years probation, therefore there was no \u201csentence imposed\u201d of 13 months or less. This argument is not persuasive. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Valdovinos, </em>352 F.3d 1243, 1249 (9th Cir.2003) (concluding that \u201c[a] sentence of probation, with or without the two months\u2019 incarceration, by definition is a sentence of. 13 months of [sic] less\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b220-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
