Bush initiated this case in the District Court to challenge the decision of Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) Timothy C. Pace denying Bush\u2019s claim for disability insurance benefits and Supplemental Security Income under titles II and XVI, respectively, of the Social Security Act (\u201cThe Act\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-433, 1381-1383E The District Court exercised jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), and, after extensive analysis, the court upheld the ALJ\u2019s decision, concluding that \u201csubstantial evidence exists that Bush\u2019s subjective complaints of pain were not entitled to full credence ... [and] the totality of the evidence simply does not support a finding that Bush is disabled.\u201d <em>Bush v. Barnhart, </em>279 F.Supp.2d 512, 520 (D.Del.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The question to be addressed is whether the ALJ\u2019s findings and conclusions are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Welch v. Heckler, </em>808 F.2d 264, 266 (3d Cir.1986). Substantial evidence means more than a mere scintilla of evidence. <em>Ventura v. Shalala, </em>55 F.3d 900, 901 (3d Cir.1995). \u201cIt means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Under the Act, and its implementing regulations, a person seeking benefits bears the burden of proving disability. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(5)(A); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512. To determine whether an individual has met this burden, the ALJ must follow the five-step sequential analysis set forth in the regulations promulgated by the Social Security Administration. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">In the instant matter, using this five-step analysis, the ALJ concluded that (1) Bush has not engaged in substantial gainful activity at any time since the alleged onset of disability; (2) Bush\u2019s episodic gout/inflammatory arthritis, degenerative disc disease of the lumbosacral spine and bronchial asthma constitute a severe impairment; (3) Bush\u2019s ailments are not severe enough to meet or medically equal one of the impairments listed in Appendix 1, Subpart P, Regulations No. 4; (4) Bush did not retain the residual functional capacity to perform the requirements of his past relevant work; and (5) Bush did retain the residual functional capacity to perform other jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy. Based on his fifth finding, the ALJ concluded that Bush was not \u201cdisabled\u201d under the Act at any time through the date of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">Bush contends that the ALJ erred with respect to the fifth step of this analysis by finding that, in light of his residual functional capacity, he is able to perform other jobs that exist in the national economy. Bush argues that the ALJ\u2019s decision \u201cis totally devoid of a proper evaluation of the evidence,\u201d and that, by \u201creciting the evidence and then coming to a conclusion without any explanation why certain evidence was accepted ... and other evidence was not accepted,\u201d the ALJ did not engage in valid decision-making. In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Bush submits that the ALJ failed to give adequate weight to his subjective complaints of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">After a careful review of the record, we cannot agree that the ALJ erred. The ALJ sufficiently evaluated the evidence before him, and his conclusion that Bush is not disabled is supported by substantial evidence. The ALJ considered the reports of each of Bush\u2019s treating physicians<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and weighed that evidence against Bush\u2019s own subjective complaints. Additionally, the ALJ relied upon the testimony of the vocational expert, who testified that appellant \u201cwas capable of making a vocational adjustment to other work,\u201d and listed the types of work that appellant would be able to perform. In light of this evidence, and while giving Bush the \u201cfull benefit of the doubt,\u201d the ALJ \u201cdid not find entirely credible [Bush\u2019s] allegations of disabling pain, and [found that] a thorough review of the objective medical evidence in the record did not alter [the ALJ\u2019s] doubts with regard to [Bush\u2019s] credibility.\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1529 and 416.929 (a residual functioning capacity assessment must be based upon a consideration of all symptoms, including pain, and the extent to which these symptoms can reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical evidence and other evidence.); <em>Hartranft v. Apfel, </em>181 F.3d 358, 362 (3d Cir.1999) (stating that, under \u00a7 404.1529(c), the ALJ\u2019s duty to evaluate the intensity and persistence of the pain or symptom and the extent to which it affects the individual\u2019s ability to work, requires the ALJ to determine the extent to which a claimant is accurately describing pain symptoms).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Bush relies on <em>Cotter v. Harris, </em>642 F.2d 700 (3d Cir.1981), to support his contention that the case should be remanded because the ALJ did not provide sufficient explanations for his reasoning. However, Bush\u2019s reliance on <em>Cotter </em>is misplaced. In <em>Cotter, </em>the court concluded that the ALJ erred when he (1) gave great weight to a third physician\u2019s medical report that did not contain a clinical report or observation and (2) failed to explain his implicit rejection of other expert medical testimony or even acknowledge its presence. <em>Id. </em>at 707. There was no such failure here. The ALJ considered and credited each of the physicians\u2019 reports, and, indeed, these reports, which note improvements in Bush\u2019s condition and his ability to work, support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion. The only rejection by the ALJ was of Bush\u2019s testimony, which the ALJ found less than credible and unsupported by the objective medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Because we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\">. Under the five-step sequential analysis, the ALJ considers whether the claimant: (1) is engaged in substantial gainful activity; (2) has a severe impairment; (3) has an impairment that meets or equals the requirements of a listed impairment; (4) can return to his or her past relevant work; and (5) if not, whether a significant number of other jobs exist in the national economy that the claimant can perform. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b429-6\">. The ALJ noted that (1) in January 1990, Bush was no longer taking medication and was released to return to work by Dr, Stern-berg; (2) \"[t]hermographic studies of the lumbar spine and lower extremities performed on October 8, 1990 wer\u00e9 within normal limits;\u201d (3) Bush was placed in vocational rehabilitation for placement in a light duty job; (4) \"[o]n April 8, 1991, Mr. Bush advised that the nerve block had resolved his left leg pain and that he was able to walk without his cane;\u201d (5) \u2018\u2018[a] work tolerance evaluation conducted on July 9, 1991 demonstrated that the claimant had the capacity to remain active for an 8-hour day;\u201d (6) Dr. Leroy, a neurologist, \"concluded that Mr. Bush is capable of working in a light-duty capacity;\u201d (7) \"on July 9, 1993, the claimant indicated that his symptoms were improved with treatment and Dr. Leroy advised that his condition was stable;\" (8) during a consultative visit with Dr. Kim, \"claimant stated that he could walk % mile secondary to shortness of breath and low back pain, stand for 1 hour secondary to low back pain, sit for 1 hour, and lift 20 pounds;\u201d (7) \"[plhysical examination was pertinent for clear lung sounds bilaterally without any wheezing or rales,\u201d and range of motion and muscle strength of the upper and lower extremities and cervical spine were within normal limits. \"There was no joint tenderness, swelling or temperature elevation ...
