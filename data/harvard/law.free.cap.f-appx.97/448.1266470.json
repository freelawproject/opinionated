After filing his retest motion, Brown filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion, reiterating his retest claims and raising several others. Because Brown can seek the relief he desires in his \u00a7 2255 proceeding, which is still pending in district court, mandamus relief is not warranted. <em>See In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988) (holding that mandamus relief is precluded if there are other adequate remedies). We grant Brown\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis and deny the petition for writ of mandamus. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-19\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
