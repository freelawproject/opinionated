Fleeks was convicted in Oklahoma state court on one count of burglary and one count of robbery. After seeking state post-conviction relief, Petitioner sought and was denied habeas relief in the Western District of Oklahoma. This court granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance claim with respect to trial counsel\u2019s failure to cross-examine Albert Lee Brown, Jr., regarding an alleged plea deal that Brown received in exchange for his testimony against Peti-</p>\n<p id=\"b286-26\">. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>tioner. We conclude that Petitioner\u2019s claim is procedurally barred and that, because the claim also fails on the merits, the procedural bar* cannot be excused for cause and prejudice. Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\n<em>A. Factual Background and Trial Court Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">In April 1995, Petitioner was charged by information in Garfield County District Court with one count of burglary in the first degree and one count of robbery by force after former conviction of two or more felonies. A preliminary hearing was held in September 1996, and Petitioner\u2019s trial was held on May 12-13, 1997. The jury found Petitioner guilty on both counts. Based on the jury\u2019s recommendation, the trial court sentenced Petitioner to fifty-five years\u2019 imprisonment on the robbery charge and forty-five years\u2019 imprisonment on the burglary charge, with the sentences to be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">The evidence at trial was as follows. Luella Helms testified that on March 24, 1995, she had been visiting her elderly mother, Myrtle White, at Ms. White\u2019s home in Enid, Oklahoma. Around 8:00 pm, Ms. Helms stepped into the dining room and saw a man dressed in tan coveralls and an orange ski mask standing in front of the living room window. When she asked the intruder what he wanted, he \u201crushed\u201d her, grabbed her, and started hitting her in the forehead with his fists. The intruder eventually threw her to the floor and demanded money. In her purse, Ms. Helms had about $25, which the in-trader took. When he noticed her rings and started yanking on them, Ms. Helms took the rings off and gave them to him. Ms. Helms identified the two rings at trial, and they were entered into evidence. The first ring comprised of her wedding band, engagement ring, and a ring guard. The wedding band had four diamonds, the engagement ring had one diamond, and the ring guard had six small diamonds. The second ring was a gold nugget with seven small diamonds. Ms. Helms was unable to testify to the identity of her assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">Only the testimony of two witnesses\u2014 Cheavel Cortez Lloyd and Albert Lee Brown, Jr. \u2014 linked Petitioner to the stolen rings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lloyd is Petitioner\u2019s eighteen-year-old stepson. At the time of the robbery, Petitioner was married to Lloyd\u2019s mother and lived in the same house with her and Lloyd. Lloyd testified on direct examination that, on the evening of the robbery, he was in the kitchen of his home when Petitioner came in \u201creal loud and sweaty,\u201d sat down, and stated, \u201cT got some rings.\u2019 \u201d At trial, Lloyd identified the rings taken from Ms. Helms as those which had been in Petitioner\u2019s possession. Lloyd testified that, later that same night, he overheard one side of a telephone conversation between Petitioner and an unknown person, during which Petitioner stated that he had just broken into \u201can old lady\u2019s house\u201d and had gotten some rings.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">Lloyd testified that Petitioner had fresh cuts on his knuckles and that he was wearing brown coveralls and an orange ski mask and carrying a stick when he came into the house. Later in his testimony, however, when confronted by the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>tor with a prior police statement, Lloyd conceded that the coveralls Petitioner was allegedly wearing that night might have been blue. Lloyd also testified that he had seen Petitioner with two $100 bills sometime around the date of the crime. Finally, Lloyd confirmed that no one from the prosecutor\u2019s office or from the Enid Police Department had promised him anything in exchange for his testimony or threatened him if he did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">On cross-examination, Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel questioned Lloyd extensively about the inconsistencies between his testimony at trial and a prior statement he had made to the police. The statement was taken during an interview with Enid Police Detectives Don Brown and Bob Pritchett approximately one month after the robbery. At the time he gave the statement, Lloyd was sixteen years old and in police custody on a separate burglary charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">In the statement, Lloyd claimed that one evening the month before, Petitioner rang the door bell. When Lloyd answered the door, Petitioner entered the house breathing hard and fast. According to Lloyd\u2019s statement, Petitioner was wearing black pants, black shoes and a black coat. In his testimony at the preliminary hearing and trial, however, Lloyd testified that Petitioner wore tan coveralls, an orange ski mask and carried a stick.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">During the cross-examination at trial, Lloyd\u2019s testimony denying that any favors or deals were extended to him by the police or the prosecution never changed. He did admit, however, that the criminal charge for which he was in custody when interviewed by the detectives was eventually dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The other witness against Petitioner was Albert Lee Brown, Jr. Brown\u2019s testimony forms the basis of the claim presented in this appeal. At trial, Brown testified that in March and April of 1995, Petitioner approached him regarding some ladies\u2019 rings. Brown identified the rings at trial and testified that he had sold the nugget ring to Jerry Mitchell in April for $100 or $150 and had given all the money to Petitioner. He testified that he had sold the other ring to Laron Norwood in March for $200 or $250 and used the money to buy cocaine for himself and Petitioner. Brown testified that he did not know where Petitioner had obtained the rings and that he had seen Petitioner wearing brown coveralls before.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Brown also testified regarding how the police acquired the rings from him. On April 12, 1995, Brown was approached by Detectives Don Brown and Bob Pritchett of the Enid Police Department with regard to the rings. The Enid police knew that Brown had had the rings in his possession and wanted him to get them back. Brown stated that he felt some pressure to get the rings back because he had taken possession of the rings without knowing where they had come from. He was able to get Jerry Mitchell and Laron Norwood to return the rings to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Finally, Brown testified that he had nine previous convictions and that at the time of his testimony he was serving a 15-year sentence for unlawful delivery of narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">On cross-examination, Petitioner\u2019s counsel concentrated on the inconsistencies between Brown\u2019s testimony at the preliminary hearing and his testimony at trial. Defense counsel questioned Brown regarding his testimony at the preliminary hearing that he had seen Petitioner in either brown <em>or </em>blue coveralls, whereas on direct examination he testified they were brown. She also further questioned Brown regarding whether he felt pressured into giving the police information about the rings to avoid prosecution for their theft. On direct examination, Brown testified that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>police were not pressuring him to get the rings back. At the Preliminary Hearing, however, Brown had stated \u201cif I didn\u2019t get [the rings] back [the police] were wanting to implicate me in that crime.\u201d Defense counsel further elicited that, at the time of the April 12, 1995, interview with the Enid police, Brown was under house arrest, the terms of which he had violated on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The gravamen of the claim on which we have granted a COA is that Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to cross-examine Brown on the possibility that he had in fact cut a deal with the Enid police to testify against Petitioner in exchange for a reduced sentence on a grand larceny charge pending against him when he was interviewed about the rings. The evidentiary bases for this claim are 1) the April 12, 1995, statement that Brown gave to the police detectives and further notes made by the detectives regarding communication with Brown on April 13,1995; 2) a form that Brown filled out in October 1995 in conjunction with the guilty plea that he entered on the grand larceny charge; and 3) Brown\u2019s testimony at the preliminary hearing in September 1996. We will describe these seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The first evidentiary basis is the April 12, 1995, statement Brown gave to police detectives Don Brown and Bob Pritchett regarding his knowledge of the stolen rings. Brown told the officers that he suspected Petitioner had been committing burglaries and that, approximately three weeks before the interview, Petitioner had come to him with the nugget ring and asked him to sell it. About a week later, he saw Petitioner with the wedding set and discussed the fact that Petitioner was trying to get rid of it. Brown did not admit in the statement that he had sold the rings for Petitioner; however, he agreed to help the detectives locate the rings.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The conversation then continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\">DB [Detective Brown]: Okay, we uh, we understand that you\u2019re on probation right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\">AB [Albert Brown]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-11\">DB: And how much longer do you have on probation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-12\">AB: Uh, well I\u2019m on this house arrest, I got approximately you know three and a half years uh maybe three years and I have a five years suspended sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-13\">DB: Okay now have we promised you anything for talking to us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-14\">AB: No you haven\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-15\">DB: Okay. Have you ask us for anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-16\">AB: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-17\">DB: Okay. Do you have pending charges at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-19\">AB: Yes I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-20\">DB: Okay and what are those charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-22\">AB: Grand larceny, ALC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-23\">DB: Okay uh, what is it that you\u2019ve ask us to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-24\">AB: Well I\u2019ve ask you know if you could put a word in or any kind of assistance I could get on this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-25\">DB: Okay. And what did, and what was our response to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-26\">AB: Uh, that you know that you couldn\u2019t promise me anything. You would, you know, do some talking and see what you could do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-27\">DB: Okay. So we haven\u2019t promised you anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-28\">AB: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-29\">DB: Nor have we intimidated or threatened you to make these statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-30\">AB: No you haven\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>DB: Okay. And you\u2019ve came in on your own free will and freely talked to us</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-4\">AB: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">DB: about this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">AB: Yes I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">DB: And that your [sic] going to cooperate in assisting us in try to locate this jewelry uh, freely?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">AB: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">Detective Bob Pritchett\u2019s notes from the next day, April 13, 1995, reflected that Albert Brown had located the wedding ring set and could buy it back for $200. Detective Pritchett arranged a meeting with Albert Brown and contacted Detective Brown to come as well. Albert Brown never showed up, but the detectives saw him on the street shortly thereafter. The detectives said they would give him the money to purchase the rings but that he had to wear a wire. Pritchett\u2019s notes then state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-11\">[Brown] told us that he didn\u2019t think that he wanted to wear the wire as it hadn\u2019t been mentioned to him before. I told him that there was no way I was going to give him the money without his being wired. I told him that for all I knew he had the ring in his pocket and he denied that. I told him with out [sic] the wire <em>there was no deal. </em>About that time Emerson Clinton Dixon III came riding around the corner to check on [Brown]. Dixon knows me so I told [Brown] <em>there would be no deal at this time.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">At trial, both the prosecution and defense counsel discussed Brown\u2019s April 12, 1995, statement with him. Both sides questioned Brown about whether he felt he was pressured into obtaining the rings in order to avoid prosecution for their theft. Defense counsel also elicited that Brown was under house arrest at the time of the interview and had violated the terms of that house arrest. But defense counsel did not bring up the fact that Brown had new charges of grand larceny pending against him at the time of the interview, that Brown had asked the detectives for their assistance with those charges, or that Detective Bob Pritchett\u2019s notes from April 13, 1995 indicated that the police had struck some type of \u201cdeal\u201d with Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-15\">The second basis for Petitioner\u2019s claim is that, in October 1995, in conjunction with his guilty plea to the grand larceny charge, Brown filled out a form entitled \u201cPlea of Guilty: Summary of Facts.\u201d In response to the question, \u201cBefore the Court considers the plea and sentence recommendation, do you have any questions or wish to say anything further?,\u201d Brown circled \u201cNo,\u201d but then wrote, \u201cI didn\u2019t get the deal promised by the Enid police department.\u201d He did not specify the details of the \u201cdeal\u201d as he understood it; however, Brown did state in response to another question that he understood he was to receive a one-year sentence for grand larceny committed after two or more felony convictions. Offender information obtained from the Oklahoma Department of Corrections confirms that Brown did in fact receive this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-16\">At trial, defense counsel did not adduce evidence related either to Brown\u2019s one-year sentence on the grand larceny charge (despite his numerous prior felony convictions) or to his complaint that he did not get the deal promised to him by the Enid police.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-17\">The third basis for the ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim is Brown\u2019s testimony at the September 1996 preliminary hearing. Brown admitted at the preliminary hearing that he had sold the two rings for Petitioner. Regarding the April 12, 1995, interview with the police detec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>tives, Brown testified that the police approached him and asked if he could get the rings back. Brown did not know if he could, but stated that \u201c[he] was kind of under the situation to where, you know, [he] had to get them back.\u201d The prosecutor asked, \u201cWhen you say you were under the situation, what do you mean by that?\u201d Brown answered, \u201cWell, it was like they were \u2014 if I didn\u2019t get them back they were wanting to implicate me in that crime.\u201d Brown denied, however, that he was testifying at the preliminary hearing \u201cto avoid prosecution in any way\u201d or \u201cto avoid implications in a particular crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Brown was then cross-examined by defense counsel; however, this was not the same counsel that represented Petitioner at trial. Counsel questioned Brown about the fact that he had been on an early release program in April 1995 and that he had violated the conditions of his program and was returned to the Enid correctional facility in May 1995. She also addressed whether Brown felt as though he had to comply with the Enid police to avoid prosecution for the theft of the rings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">Q: Now you indicated when you were talking to the police of [sic] April 12th, or around that time of 1995, that you felt somewhat caught between a rock and a hard spot. If you didn\u2019t help them get back the rings, they may try to implicate you in this crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">A: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">Q: And that was your feeling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-10\">Q: Okay. And is that still your feeling today that that is kind of what they meant at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-11\">A: Not necessarily. I had another charge pending also. And, you know, it was like \u2014 I had nothing to do with the crime but I feel like it was just a bluff on they behalf to scare me into helping them. So, you know, I felt like why not. You know, I didn\u2019t have anything to lose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-13\">Q: You indicated you had another charge pending?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-14\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-15\">Q: What was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-16\">A: That was for Grand Larceny From a Retailer. I was the manager at Goldie\u2019s Patio Grill and some money came up missing and I was implicated in that and charged with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-17\">Q: Okay. And what sentence did you receive for that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-18\">A: A one year sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-19\">Q: Time to do or suspended?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-20\">A: Time to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-21\">Q: Are those the only two felony convictions you have; Unlawful Delivery of Narcotic and the Grand Larceny?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-22\">A: That is what I\u2019m serving time for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-23\">Q: Are those the only two you have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-24\">A: No. I have previews [sic] incarceration history.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-25\">Q: Okay. How many felony convictions do you have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-26\">A: Maybe seven or eight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-27\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-28\">At trial, defense counsel questioned Brown regarding his fear of being prosecuted for the theft of the rings, but she did not address the fact that he had a grand larceny charge pending against him at the time of the April 12, 1995, interview, nor that he received only a one-year sentence on that charge, despite his \u201cseven or eight\u201d prior felony convictions, as revealed in this preliminary hearing testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>\n<em>B. Direct Appeal and State Post-Conviction Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Petitioner obtained new counsel and appealed his convictions and sentences to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d). He did not raise his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim, as required by Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, \u00a7 1086. After a remand for a competency hearing, the OCCA affirmed the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In November 1999, Petitioner filed an application for state post-conviction relief. This time he asserted his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims and argued that the ineffective assistance of his appellate counsel was the reason the claims had not been raised on direct appeal. In his motion for relief, he included the April 12-13, 1995, interview notes with Albert Brown, but did not include the October 1995 plea summary in which Brown alleged he did not get the deal the Enid police had promised him.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The trial court denied Petitioner\u2019s application for post-conviction relief, and the OCCA affirmed, holding that Petitioner had waived his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims by faffing to raise them on direct appeal and that Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims were without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\n<em>C. Section 2254 Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">In November 2000, Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the Western District of Oklahoma. He asserted seven claims for relief, including ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. The district court permitted him to supplement the record with Albert Brown\u2019s October 1995 \u201cPlea of Guilty: Summary of Facts\u201d form.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">The magistrate judge recommended that all of Petitioner\u2019s habeas claims be denied. She found that Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims were procedurally barred based on his failure to raise them on direct appeal and that his ineffective appellate counsel did not constitute cause to excuse the procedural bar because his underlying trial counsel claims were without merit. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation in its entirety and denied Petitioner\u2019s application for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">Petitioner applied to this Court for a COA, asserting eleven claims for relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We appointed counsel and granted COA only on the issue of whether Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to cross-examine Albert Lee Brown, Jr. at trial regarding: (1) the fact that he had a grand larceny charge pending against him in Garfield County District Court at the time he agreed to cooperate with the police in the investigation of Petitioner; and (2) the fact that Brown subsequently entered a plea of guilty to the charge of grand larceny in that case and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>received only a one-year sentence in exchange for the plea despite numerous prior felony convictions. Petitioner was also instructed to address whether this issue had been exhausted or was procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">For the reasons stated below, we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a) and AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\n<em>A. Procedural Bar</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Generally, the Oklahoma courts will not review in collateral proceedings an issue that could have been raised on direct appeal but was not. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 22 \u00a7 1086. Applying this rule in the state post-conviction proceedings, the OCCA determined that Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims had been procedurally defaulted because they were not raised on direct appeal. Because it found his ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims to be without merit, the OCCA also found there was no cause and prejudice to excuse the procedural bar. The district court agreed and concluded that Petitioner\u2019s failure to raise his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims did result in a procedural bar to that claim and that ineffective assistance of appellate counsel did not create cause and prejudice to excuse the failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">We review the district court\u2019s finding of a procedural bar de novo. <em>Ballinger v. Kerby, </em>3 F.3d 1371, 1374 (10th Cir.1993). On habeas review, we will find a procedural bar on \u201cissues that have been defaulted in state court on an <em>independent and adequate </em>state procedural ground, unless <em>cause and prejudice </em>or a fundamental miscarriage of justice is shown.\u201d <em>Steele v. Young, </em>11 F.3d 1518, 1521 (10th Cir.1993) (emphasis added). We find that Petitioner has failed to establish that Oklahoma\u2019s bar was not independent or adequate and that Petitioner has failed to demonstrate cause and prejudice to excuse the procedural bar. Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s claim is procedurally barred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">\n<em>1. Independent and Adequate State Procedural Grounds</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">A procedural bar will be recognized in federal habeas proceedings only if there is an independent <em>and </em>adequate state ground for it. In <em>English v. Cody, </em>146 F.3d 1257 (10th Cir.1998), this Court held that a procedural bar requiring the ineffective assistance claim to be raised on direct appeal can be adequate <em>only </em>if 1) the Petitioner had different trial and appellate counsel and 2) the ineffectiveness claim could have been resolved \u201cupon the trial record alone\u201d or after adequately developing a factual record through some other procedural mechanism. <em>Id. </em>at 1263-64. In this case, Petitioner did have different trial and appellate counsel, but we agree with Petitioner that the issue of ineffective assistance of trial counsel could not have been resolved upon the trial record alone.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Because Petitioner\u2019s claim required supplementation of the record on appeal, the next question to answer is \u201cwhether the applicable Oklahoma remand procedure was adequate to serve that purpose.\u201d <em>English, </em>146 F.3d at 1264-65. Rule 3.11 of Oklahoma\u2019s Court of Criminal Appeals provides a mechanism through which a defendant may supplement the record on direct appeal if he presents \u201cclear and convincing evidence [of] a strong possibility trial counsel was ineffective.\u201d Okla. Stat. Ann, tit. 22, ch. 18, Rule 3.11(B)(3)(b)(i). In his \u00a7 2254 proceedings, Petitioner has not alleged that Rule 3.11 was inadequate to allow him to supplement the record on his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">In <em>Hooks v. Ward, </em>184 F.3d 1206 (10th Cir.1999), we explained that where \u201cthe record below is largely silent on the adequacy of Oklahoma\u2019s Rule 3.11 [providing for remand on direct appeal], the resolution of this issue on appeal will depend on which party has the burden of proof to establish the adequacy or inadequacy of the state procedures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1216. We concluded that the burden to establish the affirmative defense of procedural bar rests on the Respondent, <em>id. </em>at 1217; however, it is the <em>Petitioner\u2019s </em>burden to put the adequacy of the state remand procedure at issue in the first place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">Once the state pleads the affirmative defense of an independent and adequate state procedural bar, the burden to place that defense in issue shifts to the petitioner. This must be done, at a minimum, by specific allegations by the petitioner as to the inadequacy of the state procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-11\"><em>Id. </em>Because Petitioner has not put the adequacy of Oklahoma\u2019s remand procedure at issue, he cannot demonstrate that Oklahoma\u2019s procedural bar is inadequate. Therefore, his claim is procedurally barred.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">\n<em>2. Cause and Prejudice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">Even where a procedural bar is found, however, an appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in failing to raise ineffective trial counsel on direct appeal can constitute \u201ccause\u201d sufficient to excuse the bar, if the assistance provided by appellate counsel falls to the level of a constitutional violation. <em>Murray v. Carrier, </em>477 U.S. 478, 488-89, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Reviewing this issue de novo,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>conclude that the assistance of Petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel was not constitutionally ineffective. Therefore, Petitioner has not established cause and prejudice to excuse the procedural bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">To succeed on an ineffective assistance claim, Petitioner must show both his counsel\u2019s constitutionally deficient performance and prejudice. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To show constitutionally deficient performance, a petitioner must show that his attorney \u201ccommitted serious errors in light of prevailing professional norms such that his legal representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Castro v. Ward, </em>138 F.3d 810, 829 (10th Cir.1998) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Counsel\u2019s performance must have been completely unreasonable, not merely wrong. <em>Hoxsie v. Kerby, </em>108 F.3d 1239, 1246 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">To show prejudice, <em>Strickland </em>requires that a petitioner demonstrate \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d 466 U.S. at 694. The performance and prejudice prongs of <em>Strickland </em>may be addressed in any order and need not both be addressed if the petitioner fails to make a showing of one. <em>See Boyd v. Ward, </em>179 F.3d 904, 914 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">In reviewing counsel\u2019s decision to omit an issue on appeal, a court\u2019s \u201cscrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689. \u201cWhen considering a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failure to raise an issue, we look to the merits of the omitted issue. \u2018If the omitted issue is without merit, counsel\u2019s failure to raise it does not constitute constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.\u2019\u201d <em>Hooks, </em>184 F.3d at 1221 (citing <em>United States v. Cook, </em>45 F.3d 388, 393 (10th Cir.1995)). The merits of Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims must, therefore, be examined to determine whether his appellate counsel\u2019s representation was deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">Because we find that Petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel is without merit, his ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim cannot establish sufficient cause and prejudice to overcome the procedural bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">\n<em>B. Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-15\">The state district court and the OCCA did not reach the merits of Petitioners\u2019 ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim, finding instead that it had been procedurally defaulted. Because this claim was not heard on the merits by the state courts, we review the federal district court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>Smallwood, </em>191 F.3d at 1264.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-16\">As described above, Petitioner must show both his trial counsel\u2019s constitutionally deficient performance and prejudice to succeed on this claim. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687. Because we find that trial counsel\u2019s failure to cross-examine Brown on his grand larceny charge and one-year sentence for that crime neither constituted constitutionally deficient performance nor caused prejudice, Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-17\">As described above, to show constitutionally deficient performance, a petitioner must show that his attorney \u201ccommitted serious errors in light of prevailing professional norms such that his legal represen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>tation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Castro, </em>138 F.3d at 829 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Counsel\u2019s performance must have been completely unreasonable, not merely wrong. <em>Hoxsie, </em>108 F.3d at 1246. Petitioner argues that the only testimony that linked him to the crime was the testimony of two questionable witnesses. Therefore, he concludes, it must have been constitutionally deficient performance for trial counsel to fail to cross-examine one of those witnesses on a grand larceny charge pending against him at the time that witness implicated Petitioner to the police, when that witness subsequently received only a one-year sentence on those charges, despite nine prior felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u201cAlthough counsel\u2019s <em>failure to impeach </em>a key prosecution witness is potentially the kind of representation that falls \u2018outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,\u2019 \u201d <em>Moore v. Marr, </em>254 F.3d 1235, 1241 (10th Cir.2001) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690), this case simply does not demonstrate a <em>failure </em>to impeach. Trial counsel impeached Brown on the inconsistencies between his trial testimony and his preliminary hearing testimony regarding what Petitioner was wearing when he approached Brown about the rings. She also elicited testimony from Brown regarding his reasons for helping the police. At the preliminary hearing, Brown testified he got the rings back because he was afraid if he did not, the police would implicate him in the crime. At trial, however, he claimed he felt pressure not from the police, but from himself. Finally, trial counsel impeached Brown with information that Brown was violating the terms of his house arrest at the time he met with Petitioner about the rings. On direct examination, Brown had admitted that he was serving a fifteen-year sentence on a drug crime at the time he implicated Petitioner and had nine prior felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Second, counsel could have feared that impeaching Brown regarding the alleged plea deal could have posed some logical inconsistencies, and counsel could have made a strategic decision not to impeach Brown on those grounds. In October 1995, Brown filled out a form indicating that he did not get the deal the Enid police had promised him on his sentence for the grand larceny charge. If he had not received the deal, why did he testify against Petitioner at the preliminary hearing a year later and again at the trial six months after that? Certainly, Petitioner may have been able to imply that, at the time Brown <em>implicated </em>Petitioner \u2014 April 1995 \u2014 he <em>thought </em>he was getting a deal from the police, which he subsequently did not get, but this still does not explain why he would have testified at the preliminary hearing and trial. Furthermore, impeaching Brown on these grounds would have required that the jurors not only believe that <em>Brown </em>was lying, but that they also disbelieve the police detectives. This is because the April 12, 1995 notes reflect that the police clearly asked Brown whether he was getting any kind of deal and that Brown responded that he was not. It is possible that counsel did not want to provoke the prosecution into calling the police detectives to rebut the implication that Brown had gotten a deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">In sum, trial counsel impeached Brown on numerous grounds. Her failure to do so on one matter \u2014 a matter which might have been difficult to convince the jury of \u2014 does not qualify as constitutionally ineffective assistance. <em>See Gillette v. Tansy, </em>17 F.3d 308, 311 (10th Cir.1994) (finding that counsel was not ineffective for failing to impeach a witness with records of sales that would prove he was lying, when he instead impeached the witness \u201cwith questions concerning the animosity between the [witness] and petitioner\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Further, trial counsel gave the jury many reasons to disbelieve Brown\u2019s testimony, which they rejected. Giving them one additional reason to disbelieve Brown, when that reason had more than one possible explanation, does not create a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the outcome of this case would have been different. <em>Cf. </em>Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Because Petitioner cannot prove either deficient performance or prejudice, he cannot establish the ineffective assistance of his trial counsel. Therefore, his ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim must also fail and there is no cause to excuse the procedural bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief on the issue on which we granted COA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We DENY COA on all other issues.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b286-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

Petitioner's claims on appeal were: (1) the district court judge failed to conduct a de novo review; (2) his appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to raise claims based on trial counsel's ineffectiveness; (3) the police and the prosecution suppressed evidence that Lloyd and Brown received lenient treatment in exchange for their assistance in the investigation and prosecution of petitioner, and his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to adequately investigate and cross-examine Lloyd and Brown; (4) his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to investigate and put forth an alibi defense; (5) he is factually innocent; (6) his convictions violated the Double Jeopardy Clause; (7) he was denied a fair cross section of the community in the jury selection process; (8) he was incompetent to stand trial; (9) there was insufficient evidence to support his burglary conviction; (10) he was denied a fair trial by the introduction of other-crimes evidence; and (11) his trial counsel failed to conduct adequate legal research.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b293-10\">. Habeas petitioners are typically required to exhaust state remedies before filing federal habeas petitions. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A). Respondent, however, has conceded that he waived his claim that Petitioner failed to exhaust all state remedies. Although this Court may raise exhaustion sua sponte, it is an \"unusual step\u201d and we find there is no particular reason to do so in this case. <em>Gonzales v. McKune, </em>279 F.3d 922, 926 (10th Cir.2002) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b293-17\">.

This document supported an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>important part of Petitioner's theory regarding Brown. It supported the inference that at the time Brown initially spoke to the police regarding Petitioner, he believed he was getting some kind of deal with respect to his grand larceny charge, and this information could have been used to impeach Brown. Thus, we conclude that Petitioner\u2019s claim \"could only be adequately developed through supplementation of the record on appeal or additional fact-finding.\u201d <em>English, </em>146 F.3d at 1264.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b294-6\">. In <em>Hooks, </em>we remanded to the district court for a factual inquiry into the adequacy of Oklahoma's remand procedure.

In this case, there is no such justification for Petitioner's failure to address the adequacy of the remand procedure because his habeas petition was filed in November 2000, after both <em>English </em>and <em>Hooks </em>were decided. <em>See Spears v.
