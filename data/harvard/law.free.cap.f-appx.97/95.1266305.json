We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">We review for substantial evidence the BIA\u2019s denial of an application for asylum on the ground that the alien has not establish eligibility. <em>Cardenas v. INS, </em>294 F.3d 1062, 1065 (9th Cir.2002). The decision must be affirmed if supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence in the record. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">An applicant may qualify for asylum by showing either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). The application may be denied, however, if it is shown that \u201c[t]he applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality ... and under all circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(B). When past persecution has been found, as the BIA presumed in this case, the government has the burden to show that it would be reasonable for the applicant to relocate within the country. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(ii); <em>Cardenas, </em>294 F.3d at 1066. Here, the BIA concluded that the government had satisfied its burden of proving that, under all circumstances, it would be reasonable for Jhamb to avoid persecution by Muslim extremists from Kashmir by relocating within India to a region where such extremists have little influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The BIA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. The government provided a State Department report, which explained that relocation within India is a viable option for individuals in India. Indeed, the report states that \u201cKashmiris have escaped the violence in their home state by settling elsewhere in India\u201d and that \u201cKashmiris have a long tradition of internal migration and have little difficulty resettling in other parts of India.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jhamb did not provide evidence that would dispute or undermine the viability of relocation within India. Moreover, Jhamb\u2019s own testimony indicates that he faced no problems with political opposition groups when he traveled to other areas of India prior to leaving the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">Accordingly, the record does not compel us to overturn the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Jhamb failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b129-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-6\">. Jhamb\u2019s assertion that the IJ\u2019s reliance on the State Department report constituted a due process violation is without merit. During the hearing before the IJ, Jhamb\u2019s counsel did not object to the introduction of this evidence by the government. Moreover, use of the country report was neither unexpected nor exceptional. <em>See Marcu v. INS, </em>147 F.3d 1078, 1081 (9th Cir.1998) (\"We have previously described these country reports as 'the most appropriate and perhaps the best resource' for 'information on political conditions in foreign nations.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Kazlauskas v. INS, </em>46 F.3d 902, 906 (9th Cir.1995))).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b130-14\">. Jhamb also claims that his placement in exclusion proceedings after re-entering the United States on an advance parole, rather than being accorded deportation proceedings, reveals that the use of advance parole effectuates an unknowing and involuntary waiver of his legal rights. Because Jhamb failed to raise this waiver argument before the BIA, we refuse to address it. <em>Martinez-Zelaya v. INS, </em>841 F.2d 294 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
