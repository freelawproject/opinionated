On appeal, the defendant claims (1) the court improperly admitted evidence of his prior misconduct, (2) the court provided an incorrect jury instruction regarding the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, (3) the prosecutor engaged in impropriety during closing and rebuttal arguments, and (4) the court erred in failing to disclose the psychiatric records of a state's witness following the court's in camera inspection of the\n   records. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On the night of October 9, 2009, the defendant,\n   Jorge Zayas, Ricco Correa, and Jose Serrano were drinking alcohol on the porch behind the defendant's apartment in Hartford. At one point, the victim and Michael Rodriguez drove into the well lit parking lot adjacent to the defendant's apartment building. When the victim exited the car, the defendant, Zayas, Correa, and Serrano approached him, and an argument ensued. During the argument, Correa passed a gun to the defendant. After taking the gun, the defendant shot the victim once in the head at close range, killing him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Rodriguez, who was standing in the parking lot when the shooting took place, did not see who shot the victim, but heard the gunshot and immediately turned around and saw that the defendant was the only person close to the victim's body. Seeing Zayas, Correa, and Serrano standing twenty to twenty-five feet away, Rodriguez fled the scene on foot. Correa, who had taken back the gun used to shoot the victim, pursued Rodriguez while the defendant, Zayas, and Serrano stood in the parking lot yelling, \"Kill him. Kill him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant's girlfriend, J.R.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   observed the whole incident from the doorway of the defendant's apartment. After witnessing the defendant shoot the victim, J.R. went back into the defendant's apartment and pretended to be asleep. The defendant ran into the apartment and stated to J.R., \"I killed him. I killed him. Get up.\" The defendant told J.R. that the victim \"came over there fighting for the turf and that he shot him.\" A few minutes later, the defendant received a phone call from\n   Correa, who told the defendant that he had \"mistakenly shot someone else thinking it was [Rodriguez], but that he was tossing the gun in the river.\" J.R. could not remember the type of gun the defendant used to shoot the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At approximately 1:15 a.m. on October 10, 2009, police arrived at the scene of the shooting in response to a 911 call. Officers found the victim's body in the parking lot behind the apartment building, bleeding from the right side of his head. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene. Susan Williams, an associate medical examiner for the state, determined that the cause of death was a single gunshot wound to the right side of the head. Williams estimated that, on the basis of soot and stippling patterns around the entrance wound, the muzzle of the gun was approximately six to ten inches from the right side of the victim's head when it was fired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 4, 2013, the state charged the defendant with murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a. On October 4, 2013, following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of murdering the victim. On December 6, 2013, the court sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of fifty years incarceration. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary to our assessment of the issues on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant first claims that the court abused its discretion by admitting evidence\n   of his prior misconduct, namely, that he had possessed a revolver approximately three months prior to the murder, for the purpose of establishing that he had the means to shoot the victim. In support of this claim, the defendant argues that the evidence was not relevant and that its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. In response, the state argues that the evidence was relevant because\n   it tended to show that the defendant had access to a weapon suitable for the commission of the murder and that this probative value outweighed the evidence's prejudicial effect. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. Prior to trial, the state indicated it was seeking to admit the testimony of Eduardo Colon, who had been the victim of a prior drive-by shooting allegedly perpetrated by the defendant. On September 27, 2013, the court held a hearing during which the prior misconduct evidence was discussed. The state represented that Colon would testify that on July 29, 2009, the defendant had shot him with a chrome revolver during a nonfatal drive-by shooting for which the defendant was charged with first degree assault. The state then argued that Colon's testimony was relevant \"to show that [the defendant] had the means to commit th[e] crime.\" In support of this argument, the state contended that Colon's testimony regarding the defendant's prior access to a revolver was probative because the witnesses in the present murder had observed the defendant carrying a gun and the lab analyses of bullet fragments recovered from the victim's body suggested that the bullet was fired from a revolver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In response, the defendant claimed that this evidence, \"while potentially relevant, [was] more prejudicial than probative because of the credibility issues surrounding\" the witnesses to the July 19, 2009 incident. The defendant explained that \"some other witness has said that they saw [the defendant] ... the evening of the [victim's shooting] in possession of a revolver,\" and \"to ... try and buttress that witness with this remote event where those witnesses have credibility issues themselves\" would confuse the issues and may \"portray [the defendant] ... unfairly ... not only in possession of a weapon, but using it for violent purposes.\" The defendant further emphasized that there was not an\n   established connection between the revolver previously observed in the defendant's possession and the shooting of the victim here, and that the prior incident was remote in time from the present murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court ruled that the evidence was relevant, but placed limitations on its admission to alleviate the defendant's sole concern that undue prejudice could result from a detailed discussion of the prior possession. According to the court's ruling, the state could inquire only into whether Colon saw the defendant holding a revolver and could not probe into the circumstances and the assault surrounding that prior possession. Specifically, the court stated: \"You don't have to mention what the event was or why they saw him [with the revolver], just that on a date there was a gun. Nothing about what the crime was. Nothing about any of that information. Just very simply, on that date. I'm going to allow that and that alone because it is probative.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At trial, and before the state called Colon as a witness, the defendant twice elicited testimony regarding the details of his prior possession of the revolver. First, through the cross-examination of Edwin Cardona, a state's witness and the defendant's parole officer, the defendant elicited testimony that Cardona had received a letter from Detective Andrew Jacobson of\n   the Hartford Police Department that indicated that the defendant had been implicated in a nonfatal shooting that took place on July 19, 2009. The defendant again elicited evidence during his cross-examination of Jacobson that exceeded the bounds of the court's ruling limiting the admission of evidence regarding his prior possession of a revolver. Through Jacobson, the defendant brought out that he had been a suspect in the July 19, 2009 nonfatal shooting, and that the incident involved a drive-by shooting of two individuals who were selling heroin on the street.\n   Also at trial, the state called Iris Sterling, the victim's girlfriend, as a witness. Sterling testified that, on the night of the murder, she saw the defendant inside his apartment holding a gun and saying, \"let's play Russian roulette\"-an act that requires placing a single cartridge in the cylinder of a revolver. Similarly, J.R. testified that, on the night of the murder, she saw the defendant inside his apartment holding a gun, that he was \"always around guns,\" but that he did not keep guns inside his apartment. Additionally, the state's firearms examiner, James Stephenson, testified that the bullet fragments recovered from the victim were consistent with eight different kinds of revolvers and one kind of semiautomatic pistol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Following this evidence, the state represented that it intended to call Colon as a witness. In response, the defendant renewed his objection to Colon's testimony. The defendant argued that Colon's testimony was not relevant because the state had not established that the murder weapon had been a revolver. Specifically, the defendant argued that none of the state's witnesses at trial provided a description of the murder weapon, and J.R. could not recall the kind of gun the defendant used to shoot the victim. Given that the state's witnesses were unable to provide a description of the murder weapon, the defendant argued, Colon's testimony was not relevant because the state had failed to establish \"a sufficient linkage\" between the chrome revolver Colon observed the defendant carrying on July 19, 2009, and the murder weapon. The defendant also renewed his objection on prejudice grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court overruled the defendant's objection, finding that Colon's testimony was relevant and not unduly prejudicial because the defendant already had elicited testimony regarding the prior shooting, the very testimony that he claimed would have been unduly prejudicial. On the issue of prejudice, the court stated: \"The\n   jury already knows, primarily through your cross-examination of [Jacobson] that you put out the information ... that there was an accusation involving a gun. So I don't think it's going to be unduly prejudicial and it does-it is relevant. But the information was brought out several times to [Jacobson] that when he was-when you were attempting to challenge the letters, that your client was arrested for an assault involving a gun.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Thereafter, consistent with the court's ruling limiting Colon's testimony, Colon testified that on July 19, 2009, he saw the defendant carrying a \"[c]hrome plated revolver.\" The court then instructed the jury as follows: \"That testimony was offered by the state in an effort to establish an element of the offense. You can accept it, you cannot accept it, but it's not [to] be used for any other reason including any indication of that character or propensity to do any type of act.\" The defendant did not object to this limiting instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the court abused its discretion in admitting Colon's testimony that he previously had possessed a revolver because the evidence is not relevant and, alternatively, is more prejudicial than probative. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"The standard of review regarding uncharged misconduct evidence is well established. Evidence of a defendant's uncharged misconduct is inadmissible to prove that the defendant committed the charged crime or to show the predisposition of the defendant to commit the charged crime. ... Exceptions to this rule have been recognized, however, to render misconduct evidence admissible if, for example, the evidence is offered to prove intent, identity, malice, motive, a system of criminal activity or the elements of a crime. ... To determine whether evidence of prior misconduct falls within an exception to the general rule prohibiting its admission, we have adopted a two-pronged analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ... First, the evidence must be relevant and material to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by the exceptions. Second, the probative value of such evidence must outweigh the prejudicial effect of the other crime evidence. ... Since the admission of uncharged misconduct evidence is a decision within the discretion of the trial court, we will draw every reasonable presumption in favor of the trial court's ruling. ... We will reverse a trial court's decision only when it has abused its discretion or an injustice has occurred.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20Conn.%20App.%2078\">\n    162 Conn.App. 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20A.3d%20770\">\n    129 A.3d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=321%20Conn.%20905\">\n    321 Conn. 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484929\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/281/\">\n    138 A.3d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the present case, the defendant contends that Colon's testimony was not relevant because the state failed to establish that the revolver Colon previously saw the defendant possess and the murder weapon were the same gun.

At trial, in order to establish that the defendant possessed the means to commit the crime, the state admitted the testimony of a witness that, approximately three months before the murder, she was confronted by the defendant who \"point[ed]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   at her what 'looked like a little gun' and threatened to shoot her.\" Id., at 95. The witness testified that she could not tell whether the gun was a semiautomatic pistol or a revolver, and that \"all that she saw was the small, skinny nozzle of the gun and part of the barrel.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. On appeal, the defendant claimed that the witness' testimony was not relevant to the issue of whether he possessed the means to commit the murder because her description of the gun was not sufficiently similar to the semiautomatic pistol used to shoot the victim.

Relevance, in this context, is satisfied by a showing that the prior weapon was \"suitable for the commission\" of the present crime.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20Conn.%20App.%2078\">\n    162 Conn.App. at 97-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20A.3d%20770\">\n    129 A.3d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Suitability is sufficient because \"[t]he state does\n   not have to connect a weapon directly to the defendant and the crime. It is necessary only that the weapon be suitable for the commission of the offense.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20A.3d%20770\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Here, the evidence adduced at trial established that the revolver that Colon previously observed in the defendant's possession was suitable for the murder. At trial, Stephenson testified that, after examining the bullet fragments recovered from the victim, he determined that the bullet was consistent with eight different kinds of revolvers and only one kind of semiautomatic pistol. The absence of a spent shell casing at the scene of the shooting was also consistent with the use of a revolver. Additionally, Sterling testified that she saw the defendant inside his apartment on the night of the shooting holding a gun and saying, \"let's play Russian roulette.\" Although this evidence does not establish a definitive connection between the revolver previously observed in the defendant's possession and the firearm used to kill the victim, the jury could infer from this evidence that three months prior to the shooting the defendant possessed and had access to the same type of firearm used in the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We further note that the fact that Correa handed the murder weapon to the defendant moments before the victim was shot does not render Colon's testimony less relevant. Although the defendant argues that the murder weapon could have been Correa's gun and not the revolver Colon saw the defendant previously possess, that argument is unpersuasive in light of\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   , which specifically rejects the need \"to connect a weapon directly to the defendant and the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20Conn.%20App.%2078\">\n    162 Conn.App. at 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20A.3d%20770\">\n    129 A.3d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the evidence adduced at trial does not necessarily support the defendant's argument. To the contrary, J.R. testified that throughout the night of October 9, 2009, a group of individuals, including Correa, was inside the defendant's apartment and on the back porch drinking alcohol. J.R. and Sterling testified that, during that time\n   period, they saw the defendant carrying a gun, and circumstantial evidence supported the inference that the defendant's gun was a revolver. Specifically, the defendant stated, \"let's play Russian roulette,\" no shell casing was recovered from the scene, and the state's firearms examiner testified that the bullet fragments recovered from the victim were consistent with eight different kinds of revolvers, but only one kind of semiautomatic pistol. Although Correa ultimately passed the defendant the murder weapon, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the murder weapon was the same revolver that J.R. and Sterling saw the defendant holding earlier that night. Additionally, J.R. testified that the defendant was \"always around guns,\" but that he did not keep guns inside his apartment. Finally, no evidence was produced at trial that\n   excluded the revolver Colon previously observed in the defendant's possession as the firearm used to commit the murder. Accordingly, Colon's testimony was relevant to the issue of whether the defendant had the means to commit the crime. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 96,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20A.3d%20770\">\n    129 A.3d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We next turn to whether the prior misconduct evidence was more prejudicial than probative. Here, the defendant argues that the probative value of Colon's testimony was minimal because the state failed to connect the revolver to the shooting and because it was cumulative of other evidence. The defendant further contends that the prejudicial effect of Colon's testimony, including details that the defendant had been the perpetrator in a prior shooting, outweighed the testimony's minimal probative value, and that the court's curative instruction exacerbated the prejudicial effect of the evidence. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"Although relevant, evidence may be excluded by the trial court if the court determines that the prejudicial\n   effect of the evidence outweighs its probative value. ... Of course, [a]ll adverse evidence is damaging to one's case, but it is inadmissible only if it creates undue prejudice so that it threatens an injustice were it to be admitted. ... The test for determining whether evidence is unduly prejudicial is not whether it is damaging to the defendant but whether it will improperly arouse the emotions of the jur[ors]. ... The trial court ... must determine whether the adverse impact of the challenged evidence outweighs its probative value. ... Finally, [t]he trial court's discretionary determination that the probative value of evidence is not outweighed by its prejudicial effect will not be disturbed on appeal unless a clear abuse of discretion is shown. ... [B]ecause of the difficulties inherent in this balancing process ... every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court's ruling. ...

We do not agree with the defendant's contention that Colon's testimony lacked probative value because the two guns were not shown conclusively to be the same, or that the testimony was entirely cumulative of other evidence. As previously noted; see part I A of this opinion; evidence that the defendant previously possessed a weapon, introduced to show that he had the means to commit the crime alleged, is relevant and probative if the prior weapon is a type that is suitable for the commission of the charged crime. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20Conn.%20App.%2078\">\n    162 Conn.App. at 97-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20A.3d%20770\">\n    129 A.3d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, Colon's testimony was not cumulative of other trial testimony. Although J.R. testified that\n   the defendant always was around guns, and both J.R. and Sterling testified that they saw the defendant in possession of a gun on the night of the crime, neither witness was able to specify that she saw the defendant in possession of a revolver. Thus, Colon was the only witness who provided direct evidence that, prior to the night of the crime, the defendant had access to a revolver. This was a contested issue as, during pretrial arguments, the defendant declined to stipulate that he was in possession of a revolver on the night of the murder. Viewed in conjunction with Stephenson's testimony that the bullet fragments recovered from the victim were consistent with the use of a\n   revolver, and Sterling's testimony that, on the night of the murder, the defendant brandished a gun suitable for Russian roulette, Colon's direct testimony that the defendant previously had access to a revolver carried probative value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Likewise, we disagree that Colon's testimony was overly prejudicial. First, we note that in the trial court the defendant's objection to the evidence on prejudice grounds was based on the danger that testimony regarding the circumstances of his prior possession of a revolver, specifically, that he shot Colon during a drive-by shooting, would be placed before the jury. The court, however, took care to limit this prejudicial effect by permitting Colon to testify only that he saw the defendant on July 19, 2009, in possession of a revolver. This ruling, therefore, precluded the portion of Colon's testimony that would have caused undue prejudice.

At trial, J.R. testified that, prior to the shooting, she assisted the defendant in testing the range of his bracelet. Additionally, Matthew Kennedy, a manager from the electronic monitoring company, testified that range testing could only be conducted\n   when the monitoring unit was initially installed.

Kennedy testified that the monitoring unit in the defendant's residence\n   had a range of 150 feet. The state admitted an electronic monitoring report into evidence that revealed that from October 9 through October 12, 2009, the defendant's monitoring unit had detected eight other electronic bracelets in that range. Thus, during that three day period, there were at least eight other individuals in close proximity to the defendant's residence who were subject to electronic monitoring.

During her closing argument, the prosecutor made the following remark: \"No one gave you any reason to believe that anyone other than the defendant killed [the victim]. And no one gave you a reason to believe the defendant couldn't have been the one to kill [the victim].\" During rebuttal argument, the state argued: \"And the last thing I want to leave you with is that reasonable doubt is not, I don't know, maybe it happened a different way. I don't know, maybe somebody else did it. I don't know, maybe we're not sure. Reasonable doubt is a real doubt ... an honest doubt, a doubt which you can attach a reason to.\n   <em>\n    I don't believe that\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    J.R.\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    is telling the truth because.

And if you look at their testimony in light of\n   everybody else's, and all the things that you know, and the fact that the electronic bracelet does not provide an alibi for him, then you have to find him guilty and that's what I'm asking you to do.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that the prosecutor's comments improperly suggested to the jury that reasonable doubt required the jurors to articulate a reason in order to find the defendant not guilty, which impermissibly shifted the burden to the defendant to prove his innocence.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. Prior to trial, the state subpoenaed J.R.'s mental health records from Capital Region Mental Health Center, where she had been a patient from June, 2008, to March, 2009, and Hartford Behavioral Health, where she had been a patient from August, 2011, to September, 2013. On\n   September 27, 2013, the defendant filed a motion requesting that the court review J.R.'s mental health records in camera and turn over to the defense any material from the records that would be relevant to J.R.'s testimonial capacity. On September 27, 2013, the court held a hearing on the defendant's motion, where it determined that the defendant had made the requisite preliminary showing to support an in camera review of the records. The court then reviewed the records in camera. On September 30, 2013, after reviewing the records, the court stated on the record that \"[it had] go[ne] over [J.R.'s] files from both Hartford Behavioral Health and the Capital Region, and gave to [defense] counsel anything that was relevant concerning credibility, ability to testify, anything in that regard, and that would be needed for trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \"Upon inspecting the records in camera, the trial court must determine whether the records are especially probative of the witness' capacity to relate the truth or to observe, recollect and narrate relevant occurrences. ... If the court determines\n   that the records are probative, the state must obtain the witness' further waiver of his privilege concerning the relevant portions of the records for release to the defendant, or have the witness' testimony stricken. If the court discovers no probative and impeaching material, the entire record of the proceeding must be sealed and preserved for possible appellate review. ... Once the trial court has made its inspection, the court's determination of a defendant's access to the witness' records lies in the court's sound discretion, which we will not disturb unless abused.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Slimskey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"963460\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/257/842/#p855\">\n    257 Conn. 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 855-56,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=779%20A.2d%20723\">\n    779 A.2d 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001).

In its pretrial ruling, the court explicitly stated, and then reiterated upon the defendant's request for clarification, that Colon could not testify as to the use of the revolver in the drive-by shooting or that the incident resulted in criminal charges against the defendant. The defendant thus made an unprompted strategic decision to elicit the potentially inflammatory evidence from Jacobson and Cardona in order to impeach their credibility and to prevent the jury from speculating about the details of the July 19, 2009 incident.
