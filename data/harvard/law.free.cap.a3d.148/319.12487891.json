Mitchell, have in common with \"Seinfeld's\" Cosmo Kramer? Both received and displayed on their respective motor vehicles, for a period of time, vanity license plates bearing words that had arguably scatological meanings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mitchell did not give up without a fight when the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) recalled his vanity plates; hence, this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The MVA granted in 2009 John T. Mitchell's application for vanity license plates bearing the word \"MIERDA.\" Two years later, the MVA received a complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   about \"MIERDA\" on\n   the plates displayed on Mitchell's vehicle. The MVA\n   determined then that \"mierda\" translates into English as \"shit\" and rescinded the plates according to a State regulation authorizing the denial or recall of vanity plates containing \"profanities, epithets, or obscenities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mitchell pursued a series of challenges to the MVA's decision. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) of the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH), the Circuit Court for Prince George's County, and the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland affirmed the MVA's actions. We granted Mitchell's petition for writ of certiorari.\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.

Although mindful that we risk being haunted by the spirit of the late comedian and social commentator George Carlin, we shall hold that: the characters or message on a vanity license plate represent private speech in a nonpublic forum, which requires government speech restrictions thereof to be reasonable and viewpoint neutral; Maryland's regulation prohibiting profanities, epithets, or obscenities satisfies this standard; and, the MVA acted to recall Mitchell's vanity plates reasonably and viewpoint-neutrally, in accordance with the regulation, and based on substantial evidence in the record. Thus, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Maryland requires the obtention and display of registration plates on in-state registered motor vehicles. Md. Code, Transportation Art., \u00a7 13-411 (1977, 2012 Repl. Vol.). The plates must contain an individualized \"registration number,\" consisting\n   of \"letters, numerals, or both,\" which is assigned typically by the MVA. \u00a7 13-410(b). For an additional annual fee of $50, an applicant may select a \"special, personalized registration number,\" subject to the MVA's approval. \u00a7 13-613(a), (b), and (c). Known as \"vanity plates,\" these plates allow the display of \"a message with at least 2 and up to 7 characters,\" unless the chosen message \"has already been issued or ... is objectionable.\" Md. Motor Vehicle Admin.,\n   <em>\n    Personalized (Vanity) License Plates,\n   </em>\n   Maryland.gov, http://www.mva.maryland.gov/vehicles/licenseplates/personalized-license-plates.htm [https://perma.cc/Y2CG-ZWF7]. Indeed, Maryland regulations empower the MVA to deny or rescind vanity plates whose messages bear \"profanities, epithets, or obscenities.\" Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 11.15.29.02(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The MVA offers also two options for customizing a license plate's general theme, which may, but need not, be combined with a vanity message. First, \"background scene plates,\" or \"commemorative plates,\" display images and text associated with issues the State wishes to promote through both its speech and fee revenue. Md. Motor Vehicle Admin.,\n   <em>\n    Background Scene Plates\n   </em>\n   , Maryland.gov, http://www.mva.maryland.gov/vehicles/registration/background-plate.htm [https://perma.cc/8K7D-G5ZF]. Commemorative plates are available presently to support the Chesapeake Bay, \u00a7 13-618, COMAR 11.15.15.01(A), and agriculture, \u00a7 13-619.2, COMAR 11.15.30.01(A). Second, Maryland allows the customization of \"specialty\n   plates\" for members of nonprofit organizations who pay a fee to express their organizations' messages via logos, emblems, the organization's name, or another combination of characters. \u00a7 13-619. The MVA sells specialty plates for a diverse range of issues from medical and military interests to educational institution alumni associations, and hobbies. Md. Motor Vehicle Admin.,\n   <em>\n    Organizational\n   </em>\n   , Maryland.gov, http://www.mva.maryland.gov/vehicles/specialty-plates/organizational-sp.htm [https://perma.cc/Q5XV-7G89].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2009, Mitchell applied for vanity plates bearing the characters \"MIERDA\" on the agricultural commemorative\n   plate template.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   With no apparent thought or reservation, the MVA approved the application and sent him the desired plates. After displaying the plates for two years without challenge, Mitchell renewed them in June 2011. The MVA claims to have received thereafter a complaint, in December 2011, alleging the inappropriateness of the use of \"MIERDA\" on Mitchell's plates. Sharon Crow, manager of the MVA's Motor Carrier and Electronic Services Division, investigated (apparently for the first time) the nature of \"mierda,\" using Wikipedia as her primary resource. Crow's \"research\" revealed that \"mierda\" is often regarded as a profanity in Spanish, and that in English it has as its primary meaning \"shit,\" context aside. \"Shit\" was (and remains, we are informed) a term on the MVA's ad-hoc \"objectionable plate list\" maintained by Crow's Division and used to screen prospective vanity license plate messages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Relying on COMAR 11.15.29.02(D), the regulation authorizing the MVA to deny or rescind plates containing \"profanities, epithets, or obscenities,\" the MVA informed Mitchell on 27 December 2011 of its decision to rescind and recall his \"MIERDA\" vanity plates. Mitchell exercised his right to demand an administrative appeal under COMAR 11.15.29.05. A hearing was held before an ALJ of the OAH on 23 April 2012. Mitchell argued that \"mierda\" has a variety of non-profane and non-obscene meanings, and that some of which, such as \"compost,\" make sense in the context of the agricultural plate template and a rural lifestyle, although he conceded that it can also mean \"shit.\" On 17 July 2012, the ALJ found dispositive \"mierda's\" offensive meaning, which, she ruled, justified the MVA's rescission of the plates under Md. Code, Transportation Art., \u00a7 13-613 and COMAR 11.15.29.02(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following Mitchell's filing of a petition for judicial review, the Circuit Court for Prince George's County affirmed the\n   ALJ's ruling, entering a spare order to that effect on 5 August 2013. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed, in a reported and thoughtful opinion, holding that vanity plates constitute a nonpublic forum for First Amendment purposes, and that the MVA's actions were reasonable and viewpoint neutral, thereby satisfying the Supreme Court's requirements on governmental restrictions of private speech.\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.

The State answers that: i) \"MIERDA\" on a vanity plate is government speech, or, alternatively, private speech in a nonpublic forum; ii) the First Amendment does not limit restrictions on government speech or, if \"MIERDA\" is private speech in a nonpublic forum, the regulatory scheme in question\n   is reasonable and viewpoint neutral; and iii) the MVA's rescission of Mitchell's plates was based on substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

A court's identification of speech as either that of the government or of a private person or entity determines whether the First Amendment applies at all: \"government statements (and government actions and programs that take the form of speech) do not normally trigger the First Amendment rules designed to protect the marketplace of ideas.\"\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590259\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2239/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2245-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Applying the Supreme Court's first analytical factor, historical usage, although license plates in general function historically as government IDs for vehicles, vanity plates display additionally \"a personalized message with intrinsic meaning (sometimes clear, sometimes abstruse) that is independent of mere identification and specific to the owner.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.

The unique, personalized messages communicated via vanity plates contrast with the generic, depersonalized speech conveyed by a specialty plate: \"[m]any Maryland vehicles display identical specialty plates; only the registration numbers, which on a specialty plate have no intrinsic meaning and carry no message, will vary.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360976\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/529/\">\n    225 Md.App. at 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360976\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/529/\">\n    126 A.3d at 184-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, private citizens, not the State of Maryland, create and submit prospective vanity plate messages. \"So, historically, vehicle owners have used vanity plates to communicate their own personal messages and the State has not used vanity plates to communicate any message at all.

Indeed, the Supreme Court's public forum doctrine, discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , exists only because of\n   the need to analyze government restrictions of private speech that takes place on government property.

Admittedly, Maryland did\n   <em>\n    intend\n   </em>\n   to open a public space for limited private expression via vanity plates, but only in the sense that it did not establish\n   <em>\n    accidentally\n   </em>\n   the procedures for vehicle owners to submit prospective vanity messages and procure vanity plates.

Maryland regulates also the content of vanity messages to prohibit, among other things, \"profanities, epithets, or obscenities.\" COMAR 11.15.29.02(D). As discussed earlier, these constraints do not rise to the level of \"direct control\" necessary to support a finding of government speech, but they do amount to the \"extensive government regulation\" that the\n   <em>\n    McDonald\n   </em>\n   court found inconsistent with a governmental intent to create a public forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals reasoned further that Maryland's restrictions on vanity plate access conflicts with finding that the State intended to open a public forum. Vanity plates are not open without limitation to the general public for private expression; only vehicle owners who pay a fee and receive State permission may receive vanity plates. \"Public access is a hallmark of a public forum, so the fact that the Maryland general public does not have unimpeded access to vanity plates also militates against a conclusion that the State intended to create a public forum in vanity plates.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360976\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/529/\">\n    225 Md.App. at 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360976\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/529/\">\n    126 A.3d at 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mitchell contends that \"limiting the content of the speech [on vanity plates] is not rationally related to the revenue-generating function [of vanity plates] or the underlying vehicle-identification function [of license plates in general],\" and that the State discriminated against his viewpoint by attributing to \"MIERDA\" \"its view of what Mitchell means when he says 'mierda.' \" The State responds to the contrary on both points. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that COMAR 11.15.29.02(D) and the MVA's rescission of the \"MIERDA\" vanity plates under this regulation are reasonable and viewpoint neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The prohibition of \"profanities, epithets, or obscenities\" on vanity plates relates reasonably to Maryland's purposes of vehicle identification and revenue generation, which involve the public display of license plates. Because the State requires motorists to display license plates on their vehicles, the public is exposed to the messages that appear on vanity plates. For better or worse, our society sets apart particular words as out-of-bounds; their utterance or display can be understood reasonably as indecent or offensive, especially in the presence of minors. \"Shit\" is one of these words, and that is an English translation, admitted by Mitchell, of \"mierda.\" It is reasonable, therefore, for the State to protect knowledgeable observers of vanity plates from the perception of such a term. Even though a witness to a vanity plate message will discern easily the\n   vehicle owner as the speaker, because the speech takes place on government property and only with State permission, the message will be associated with the State.\n   <em>\n    McDonald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9392696\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/280/159/\">\n    280 F.3d at 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The state has a legitimate interest in not communicating the message that it approves of the public display of offensive scatological terms on state license plates,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9392696\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/280/159/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   and it is reasonable, therefore, for Maryland to prohibit \"profanities, epithets, or obscenities,\" content with which it does not wish to associate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Neither the MVA's content-restricting regulation, nor its actions in accordance with that regulation, constitute viewpoint discrimination.

Here, the Maryland regulation targets only content-profanities, epithets, and obscenities-not a speaker's viewpoint about such terms or any viewpoint expressed with such terms. Clearly, the regulation does not target viewpoints in support of organic agriculture. If Maryland wished to suppress pro-agriculture speech, it probably would not speak in favor of agriculture via commemorative plates, and it would restrict the use on vanity plates of terms such as \"FARM,\" \"COMPOST,\" and \"CROPS.\" This is not the case. Moreover, Maryland did not \"impute an offensive intent\" on the part of Mitchell, as he claims. Mitchell's subjective intent is irrelevant because the regulation restricts outright and objectively profanities, not specific viewpoints for or against profanity. The MVA rescinded Mitchell's plates not because of Mitchell's real or presumed intent, but based on the content with which Maryland is not willing to be associated, and the content the State is not\n   willing to inflict upon the discerning public.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mitchell contends further that English translations of non-English words are too imprecise a basis for speech restrictions. First, he insists that upholding the ALJ's decision to affirm the MVA based on one possible English translation of \"mierda\" \"gives Maryland unlimited discretion\" to inflict \"collateral damage\" on benign interpretations of a term such as \"mierda.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is false. Maryland does not have unlimited discretion because its decisions must be reasonable and viewpoint neutral. Mitchell is correct that collateral damage may occur: a term with various definitional senses, any one of which is a profanity or obscenity, may be banned even if the speaker intended one of the benign interpretations, but this is\n   well-within Maryland's limited discretion to restrict the use of terms with which it wishes reasonably not to associate. As noted previously in this opinion, the speaker's intent is immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Second, Mitchell warns of the risk of \"mischievous violence to the First Amendment\" when the State may \"censor the speech of the speakers of one language based on whether a translation of the word or the letters forming the word were considered a 'bad word' in one of more than 100 other languages,\" resulting in the possibility of \"diminish[ed] freedom of speech in all affected languages.\" The Supreme Court allows States to \"diminish freedom of speech\" in a nonpublic forum, so this argument is unpersuasive. Certainly, the State must act reasonably and viewpoint-neutrally in its placement of a term on its \"objectionable plate list,\" but that standard does not require the MVA to translate a non-English term into dozens of languages in order to balance benign translations against offensive ones, or to engage in\n   some other form of trans-linguistic indecency calculus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The ALJ did not elaborate on her reasoning other than to say that \"many Spanish-speaking individuals might consider [\"MIERDA\"] obscene under at least one definition.\" The Court of Special Appeals rejected Mitchell's contention that, despite \"MIERDA's\" alleged inconsistency with Maryland's statutory definition of obscenity, the ALJ found narrowly that \"MIERDA\" was obscene. The appellate court found instead that the ALJ's ruling held that \"MIERDA\" fell under COMAR 11.15.29.02(D)'s restriction of \"profanities, epithets, or obscenities.\" Thus, our appellate brethren held that, under the ALJ's decision, \"MIERDA\" could be obscene or profane, so whether \"MIERDA\" fit Maryland's definition of obscenity was irrelevant.

In defining the designated public forum with language that parallels uncannily the Supreme Court's prior definition of the limited public forum, it is unclear whether the Court conflated intentionally these fora.

We agree that speech need not be necessarily dialogue to be protected by the First Amendment, and, in any event, vanity plates do invite responses of a sort. A passing motorist may honk or give a \"thumbs up\" sign in approval, or alternatively, present the\n    <em>\n     digitus impudicus\n    </em>\n    to indicate disapproval, of a message such as \"MIERDA.\" This line of reasoning, however, is irrelevant.\n    <em>\n     Cohen\n    </em>\n    dealt with whether the State could enact content-based limitations of public expression, in general, as disturbing the peace:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n    Cohen was tried under a statute applicable throughout the entire State.

The present case, by contrast, deals specifically with restrictions that apply only to speech on government property.

This suggests that the Court is relying on an\n    <em>\n     independent factor\n    </em>\n    to decide the role of judicial review. Yet, this suggestion is, in essence, misleading. Under the modern forum doctrine, it is not the nature of the location that determines the level of scrutiny; rather, it is the intent of the government officials who happen to manage the particular location. Under\n    <em>\n     Cornelius,\n    </em>\n    the factor determining the forum category is the intent of the government officials.
