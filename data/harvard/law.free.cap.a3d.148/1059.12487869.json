See generally General Statutes \u00a7 54-47a. The primary question in this appeal is whether the state, after immunizing such a witness for testimony given during the state's case-in-chief, may decline to extend that immunity to the same witness in connection with his testimony during the defense case-in-chief. Here, we conclude that the state was not required to grant three prosecution witnesses\n   additional immunity for their testimony during the defense case-in-chief, and that the court's refusal during the defense case-in-chief to compel those witnesses to testify when they invoked their fifth amendment right to remain silent was proper as to some testimony and harmless as to the rest. Accordingly, because we conclude that the remainder of the defendant's claims-three evidentiary claims and a claim that the court improperly penalized the defendant at sentencing for electing to go to trial-also lack merit, we affirm the judgment of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant, Anthony Collymore, appeals from that judgment, rendered after a jury trial, of (1) felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c ; (2) attempt to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) and 53a-134 (a) (2) ; (3) conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a) and 53a-134 (a) ; and (4) criminal possession of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217 (a) (1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At trial, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On January 18, 2010, the defendant and two of his friends, Rayshaun Bugg and Vance Wilson (Vance), were driving around Waterbury in a white, four door, rental Hyundai that the defendant's aunt and uncle had lent to him, looking to rob someone. Eventually\n   the three men drove into the Diamond Court apartment complex, which comprises eight apartment buildings. Halfway down the main road of the complex, the men saw an expensive-looking, black Acura sport utility vehicle (SUV) and decided to rob its driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   They drove down a small road behind the apartments, where the defendant and Vance pulled out their guns and exited the Hyundai, saying that they were going to rob the driver of the SUV. The defendant had a .38 revolver and Vance had a .357 revolver. Bugg drove to the end of the small road and waited. The defendant and Vance reached the SUV, saw two young children running toward its driver, and decided to call off the robbery. The SUV drove away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant and Vance then saw seventeen year old John Frazier (victim) and decided to rob him. As they were trying to rob him, he slapped away one of their guns and ran toward his apartment, at the entrance to the complex. The defendant and Vance both fired shots at the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Bugg drove up, the defendant and Vance ran over to the Hyundai and got in, and they sped off to the apartment of Jabari Oliphant, a close friend who lived in Waterbury. There, the defendant and Vance explained to Bugg and Oliphant what had just transpired at Diamond Court, namely, that they had intended to rob the man in the SUV but decided not to when they saw his young children; instead, they tried to rob the victim and shot him when he resisted. They then asked Oliphant if he had something to clean their guns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Police arrived at Diamond Court within minutes of the shooting and found the fatally wounded victim in front of his family's apartment. An autopsy revealed that a single .38 class bullet through the victim's heart had killed him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant was arrested and tried.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At trial, the state's case included more than thirty witnesses, who testified over the course of fifteen days. A jury found the defendant guilty, and the court imposed a sentence of eighty-three years in prison. The defendant now appeals from that conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant's first claim is that the court improperly failed to compel three defense witnesses to testify. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court improperly allowed the state to revoke the immunity of three prosecution witnesses when they were called as defense witnesses, then improperly allowed those witnesses to invoke their fifth amendment right and refuse to testify, and that these two errors combined to unconstitutionally deny the defendant these witnesses' exculpatory testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. At the defendant's trial, the state granted immunity to three witnesses-Bugg, Vance, and Oliphant-in exchange for their testimony during the state's case-in-chief. Although they were called as prosecution witnesses, once they began to testify, these witnesses repudiated prior statements inculpating the defendant and testified so as to exonerate him, reiterating their exculpatory testimony when the defense cross-examined them. The defendant sought to examine those witnesses again during his case-in-chief but, this time, each witness invoked his fifth amendment right and refused to answer many or all questions asked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The inculpatory evidence from these three witnesses came from recorded statements they gave before trial to various authorities, which the court admitted for substantive purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statements differed markedly\n   from the trial testimony, and each of the three witnesses repudiated his statements at length during the state's direct examination and the defendant's cross-examination. We discuss each witness in turn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Bugg was the first of the three witnesses granted immunity. When the state called him to testify in its case-in-chief, he communicated through his attorney that he would be invoking his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination, fearing that the state might bring drug charges against him for his activities on the night of the shooting and perjury charges if he contradicted the testimony he had given at the defendant's probable cause hearing. The state told the court: \"Your Honor, based on our review of the statute, the state intends to give [Bugg] use immunity for any drug activity he was engaged in on January 18, 2010.... [In addition] the state does not intend to prosecute [Bugg] for any perjury that he may have committed at the probable cause hearing.\" The court informed Bugg that as a result, \"your [immunity under the statute] doesn't exist, because the state has removed [the possibility of prosecution that] would otherwise allow you to [claim the immunity].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Bugg indicated that he understood. The court instructed the jury that \"under [\u00a7] 54-47a, [Bugg] has been compelled to testify ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   a\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Bugg's Testimony during State's Case-in-Chief\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When the state examined Bugg during its case-in-chief, he testified that on January 18, 2010, he, the\n   defendant and Vance drove to Diamond Court to buy drugs from \"the weed man,\" and then drove to Oliphant's apartment. Bugg acknowledged under questioning that this story differed from the police statement he gave on February 10, 2011, and from his testimony at the defendant's probable cause hearing on August 30, 2011. In repudiating his earlier statements, he claimed, however, that the police had forced him to sign the statement after writing it themselves and that he had testified falsely at the probable cause hearing in exchange for a plea deal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On cross-examination, Bugg reiterated that, on January 18, 2010, there was never any plan to rob someone, they were \"going to get some weed, that was the whole thing,\" and he did not see the defendant or Vance with a gun that night. Bugg testified that he signed the police statement in exchange for a plea deal and because the police beat him, and that his testimony at the probable cause hearing was part of the same plea deal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   b\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Bugg's Prior Inconsistent Statements\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The state submitted the two statements made by Bugg prior to his testimony at trial, both of which were admitted into evidence for substantive purposes under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559597\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/200/743/#p753\">\n    200 Conn. 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 753,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=513%20A.2d%2086\">\n    513 A.2d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6502338,6503652,6502713,6503432,6503325,6503216,6503540,6502614,6502425,6502525,6503134\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/994/\">\n    479 U.S. 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20S.%20Ct.%20597\">\n    107 S.Ct. 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20598\">\n    93 L.Ed.2d 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   First, the state introduced Bugg's police statement, made on February 10, 2011, through Lieutenant Michael Slavin, one of the detectives who had taken it. Slavin testified that Bugg had agreed with the statement he had given to the police and that the police did not beat or threaten Bugg. The court admitted the statement as a full exhibit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Bugg stated to the police that on January 18, 2010, he, the defendant and Vance were driving around when\n   the defendant and Vance saw a black Acura SUV at Diamond Court, pulled out their guns, told Bugg that they were going to rob its driver, and got out of the car. Bugg saw the defendant with a .38 revolver and Vance with a .357. Soon, Bugg heard five or six gunshots and saw the defendant and Vance running up. They got into the Hyundai and told Bugg to drive, and he sped away. When they arrived at Oliphant's apartment, Vance and the defendant explained to Bugg that \"the guy in the Acura had a baby in it, so they felt bad; instead [they] took the young nigga.\" The defendant told Bugg that Vance \"ha[d] his gun to the [victim's] chest\" while they were trying to rob him, \"and the [victim] tried to grab it and they started to tussle over the gun, [and] that is why he shot him.\" While the defendant was talking, Vance asked for some ammonia so that he could clean off his gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Second, Bugg's probable cause hearing statement, made on August 30, 2011, was admitted into evidence through the testimony of the court reporter who had recorded and transcribed it. At the probable cause hearing, Bugg had testified that the defendant and Vance decided to rob the man in the Acura SUV, that they went to do so, that he heard gunshots, that the defendant and Vance came running to the Hyundai, that they got in and he drove off, and that at Oliphant's apartment they had\n   stated that they robbed someone else instead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   c\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Bugg's Testimony during Defense Case-in-Chief\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   When the defense told the court that it would be calling Bugg as a witness, the state told the court that \"the state's granting of immunity to the-the prosecution witnesses does not extend to them as defense witnesses ....\" The court told Bugg that there was \"an issue as to whether or not the immunity that the state gave [him] when [he was] here before applie[d] to [his]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   testimony now, because now [he was] being called by the defendant ... and that issue, whether or not the immunity attache[d] [was] unclear,\" so \"what [he] should do is be guided by what [his] attorney,\" who would be sitting next to him during his testimony, \"advise[d] [him] as to answering any of the questions.\" When the state added that, \"notwithstanding the court's position, it is the state's that [Bugg] is not being given ... immunity for his testimony at this point in time,\" the court clarified, \"I want to be sure this is clear for the record. I believe what I said to [Bugg] is that the law is unclear as to whether or not the immunity he was given by the state relates to his testimony as a defense witness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In response to questions about the night of January 18, 2010, Bugg testified that he was driving the Hyundai that night, that he \"thought they was going to get some weed,\" and that he did not know where the shooting occurred because he \"was in a car.\" Bugg asserted his fifth amendment rights when asked where he drove after the defendant and Vance exited the car, and where he was when he heard gunshots. Bugg also answered defense counsel's questions about various phone calls he had made from prison and asserted his fifth amendment rights for only one such question-after testifying that his cousin, Marquise Foote, had stolen from him, he asserted his fifth amendment rights when asked what was stolen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As to his testimony at the probable cause hearing, Bugg agreed with the defense counsel that he had testified at that hearing \"for the purpose of getting a deal,\" but asserted his fifth amendment rights when asked if his testimony at that hearing was true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Vance was the second of the three witnesses granted immunity. When the state called him to testify, he\n   waived his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. The state later clarified that it had granted Vance immunity \"for a claim of false statement ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   a\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Vance's Testimony during State's Case-in-Chief\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   During the state's case-in-chief, Vance testified that on January 18, 2010, he and Bugg accompanied the defendant to Diamond Court to collect $3000 from someone so that the defendant could repay Vance for heroin Vance had given the defendant. Vance believed that they were \"going to ask [the man] where the money is. That's all.\" When they arrived, that man drove off, Vance punched the defendant in the jaw and, believing that the defendant was \"reaching for something,\" Vance shot at the defendant with a .357 Taurus Magnum revolver as he ran away. Vance testified that he had never seen the defendant with a gun but had seen him with a knife. Soon, the defendant got back into the car with Vance and Bugg, and they drove off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The state asked Vance about his two prior accounts of the shooting-his statement to police on February 22, 2011, and\n   his guilty plea on February 21, 2012-both of which differed from his trial testimony. Vance claimed that he signed the police statement only because he had been threatened with the death penalty and that he entered his guilty plea in exchange for a sentence of only thirty to fifty years' incarceration. When questioned about his police statement and guilty plea, Vance repudiated both and persisted in his story about driving to Diamond Court to collect money owed him for heroin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On cross-examination, Vance essentially reiterated his testimony given on direct examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   b\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Vance's Prior Inconsistent Statements\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The state submitted the two statements made by Vance prior to his testimony at trial, both of which were admitted into evidence for substantive purposes under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559597\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/200/743/#p753\">\n    200 Conn. at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=513%20A.2d%2086\">\n    513 A.2d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   First, the state introduced Vance's police statement, made on February 22, 2011, through Slavin, who testified that Vance had signed at the bottom of each page and that no one threatened or forced him to do so. In Vance's statement, he said that on January 18, 2010, he, the defendant and Bugg drove to Diamond Court where they saw a black Acura SUV and decided to rob its driver. Vance took out a .357 revolver, the defendant took out a .38 revolver, and they exited the car and ran up to the SUV, but they then saw two young children, causing them \"to let it go.\" The SUV drove off. Vance and the defendant then saw the victim walking by and decided to rob him. The defendant stuck his gun in the victim's chest, saying, \"you know what it is,\" but the victim slapped the gun away and took off running. The defendant and Vance each fired two or three shots in the victim's direction before getting into their car and driving to Oliphant's apartment. There, the defendant asked for Vance's gun so he could dispose of it and his gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Second, Vance's guilty plea statement was admitted into evidence through the testimony of the court monitor who recorded and transcribed it. At the guilty plea hearing, Vance had admitted that the defendant asked him to commit a robbery; that he, the defendant, and Bugg decided to rob the man in the SUV; that both he and the defendant had guns; that the defendant's gun was a .38; that they decided against robbing the SUV when they saw its driver had young children; that they tried to rob the victim instead; that the defendant ran\n   up to the victim first and put a gun to his chest; that Vance fired two or three shots when the victim ran; that the defendant fired shots as well; and that back at Oliphant's apartment on Walnut Street, Vance gave his gun to the defendant when asked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   c\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Vance's Testimony during Defense Case-in-Chief\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   When the defense called Vance as a witness, the state asserted that \"it is the state's position that any testimony that he gives at this portion of the proceeding is not covered by ... immunity.\" The court repeated to Vance the same advisement it had given Bugg concerning immunity and told him to \"be guided by the advice of your attorney and that's-that's the way we should proceed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The court asked for an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury, during which defense counsel asked what the police said when they took Vance's statement, whether Vance shot the victim, and whether Vance called a person named Karen Atkins in June, 2012. Vance replied: \"Based on the advice of my counsel, I'm going to invoke my fifth amendment right.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Although the defendant argued that Vance had no valid fifth amendment right to assert, the state and Vance's attorney argued that Vance had yet to be sentenced on a guilty plea to various charges arising from the January 18, 2010 shooting; that the plea deal allowed a sentence in the range of thirty to fifty years; and that until Vance was sentenced his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination continued to apply to the events of January 18, 2010. The court held that Vance's fifth amendment right continued to apply until after sentencing and that, because the state \"sa[id] on the record that [Vance] is not being immunized with respect to his testimony as a defense witness,\" therefore he\n   \"properly, in my view, invoked his fifth amendment privilege.\" Because it would be improper to call a witness for the sole purpose of having him invoke the fifth amendment in front of the jury; see\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Person\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"542563\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/215/653/#p660\">\n    215 Conn. 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 660-61,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=577%20A.2d%201036\">\n    577 A.2d 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6555809,6555554,6555908,6555463,6555726,6555951,6555601,6555763,6555509,6555670,6555990,6555642,6555419,6555870,6555839\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/1048/\">\n    498 U.S. 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20S.%20Ct.%20756\">\n    111 S.Ct. 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20776\">\n    112 L.Ed.2d 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991) ; the court excused Vance without having him testify as a defense witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Oliphant was the third of the three witnesses granted immunity in connection with the defendant's trial. When the state called him to testify, he communicated through his attorney that he would be invoking his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. Oliphant's attorney discussed with the court Oliphant's fear that the state might bring false statement charges against him if he contradicted his statement to police, and hindering prosecution charges for his interactions with the defendant, Vance, and Bugg after the shooting. After a colloquy with the prosecutor, the court told Oliphant, \"you don't have a fifth amendment privilege because ... you have been given transactional immunity by the state.\" Oliphant said that he understood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   a\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Oliphant's Testimony during State's Case-in-Chief\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   During questioning in the state's case-in-chief, Oliphant testified that on the night of January 18, 2010, he was at the apartment on Walnut Street when the defendant, Vance, and Bugg came over. Privately, Vance told Oliphant that he had just killed someone, and wanted to kill Bugg and the defendant \"because he didn't want to leave no witnesses.\" A couple of days later, Bugg told Oliphant that the defendant, Vance, and he had been driving around drinking and smoking that night, when Vance \"saw somebody walking down the\n   street, hopped out [of] the car, [and] tried to rob him. The [victim] fought [Vance] off and [Vance] shot [the victim]. [Vance] jumped back in the car and they sped off.\" Oliphant further testified that the defendant never talked about the shooting with him, and that Oliphant had never seen the defendant with a gun, but that he had seen Vance with a .357 caliber gun before the January 18, 2010 shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Oliphant acknowledged that this story differed from the statement he had given to the police on February 2, 2011. He claimed, however, that the police made him sign that statement after beating him for hours, while he was high on PCP and alcohol. When the state questioned Oliphant line by line, he again repudiated his statement and persisted in his story that he was told that Vance got out of the car alone and robbed a passerby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On cross-examination, defense counsel examined Oliphant extensively about his statement, which Oliphant repudiated and said he signed only because police beat him and a prosecutor \"was offering [him] deals to perjure [him]self ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   b\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Oliphant's Prior Inconsistent Statement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The state submitted Oliphant's police statement into evidence and the court admitted it for substantive purposes under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559597\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/200/743/#p753\">\n    200 Conn. at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=513%20A.2d%2086\">\n    513 A.2d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The state again called Slavin as a witness, who testified that he had taken Oliphant's police statement in the same manner he had taken Bugg's and Vance's statements, and that no one forced or threatened Oliphant to sign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In the statement, Oliphant said that on the night of January 18, 2010, at the apartment on Walnut Street, Vance and the defendant both told Oliphant that they had been driving around with Bugg looking to rob someone when they saw the victim in the Diamond Court\n   apartment complex. They told Oliphant that they tried to rob the victim, but when he fought back and ran toward his apartment, Vance shot him in the back. At some point, Bugg also spoke with Oliphant and told him that the defendant, Vance, and he were driving around in the white car on January 18, 2010, looking for someone to rob, that they saw the victim in the Diamond Court apartment complex, and that Vance shot the victim as he ran away. Oliphant previously had seen Vance with a .357 caliber gun and the defendant with a .38 caliber revolver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   c\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Oliphant's Testimony during Defense Case-in-Chief\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   When the defense tried to call Oliphant as a witness, the state told the court that \"it's the state's position that the immunity that was given to Mr. Oliphant when he testified as a prosecution witness in the state's casein-chief ... ended ... and he has no immunity for anything that goes on today.\" The court advised Oliphant concerning immunity as it had Bugg and Vance and told him to \"be guided ... by [his] attorney's advice ....\" Oliphant's attorney said that Oliphant would not answer any questions \"[b]ased on the representation that immunity will not be extended to him being called as a defense witness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   During an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury, defense counsel asked several questions about Oliphant's February 2, 2011 statement to the police. Oliphant invoked the fifth amendment when asked if he was beaten on that date and what he had meant by part of his trial testimony as a prosecution witness,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   but he did testify that, on February 2, 2011, he was arrested with a man named Jamel, whom he had not known for long. The state asked three questions on cross-examination-how, and for how long, had Oliphant known Jamel before their arrest; and did they have narcotics when arrested. Oliphant asserted his fifth amendment rights in response to each question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The state argued that Oliphant could not selectively assert his fifth amendment rights, testifying about a subject for the defense but refusing to answer the state's questions about the same subject. Defense counsel agreed that if Oliphant did so, then he would be unavailable for cross-examination and so the court would have to strike his testimony.

The court held that, because Oliphant \"indicated he is not going to respond to any of the questions asked on cross-examination by the state,\" it would be futile to call him as a witness only to have his testimony stricken. Accordingly, the court released Oliphant from the subpoena with which he had been served, and he did not testify as a defense witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   With that factual history in mind, we now turn to the defendant's first claim on appeal, which is that the court improperly (1) allowed the state to revoke the immunity of Bugg, Vance, and Oliphant, three prosecution witnesses, when they were called as defense witnesses; and (2) failed to compel those three witnesses to testify when they asserted their fifth amendment rights as defense witnesses, thus denying the defendant crucial, exculpatory testimony. We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The defendant argues that the court improperly allowed the state to \"revoke\" its grant of immunity to Bugg, Vance, and Oliphant when they were called as defense witnesses and, that the revocations violated the defendant's rights to due process and a fair trial under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, as well as his rights to compulsory process and to present a defense under the sixth amendment\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the United States constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we have noted, the state initially had granted each witness immunity during the prosecution's case-in-chief, pursuant to \u00a7 54-47a.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the defendant called those same witnesses for his case-in-chief, the state told each of them that they no longer had immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The defendant characterizes this as a \"revocation\" of immunity and argues that such a revocation violated his constitutional rights because it effectively prevented the witnesses from testifying. By contrast, the state\n   argues that it \"did not\n   <em>\n    revoke\n   </em>\n   grants of immunity to any of its witnesses\" and that the real question is whether the court properly held that the state need not grant\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   immunity to those witnesses. (Emphasis added.) We agree with the state that, because it did not revoke the witnesses' immunity and the court properly held that the state was under no obligation to grant them additional immunity, the defendant's constitutional rights were not violated.\n   First, to the extent that the defendant claims that the court violated his constitutional rights by misapplying \u00a7 54-47a to permit the state to\n   <em>\n    revoke\n   </em>\n   immunity previously granted under \u00a7 54-47a, we must interpret that statute. \"To the extent that the [defendant's] claim requires us to interpret the requirements of [a statute], our review is plenary.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Nevaeh W.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20723\">\n    317 Conn. 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 729,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201177\">\n    120 A.3d 1177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). We begin with the statute's text and relationship to other statutes, and consider other evidence of its meaning only if the text itself is either ambiguous or yields absurd results. Id., 729-30,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201177\">\n    120 A.3d 1177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Section 54-47a has two parts. Section 54-47a (a) provides in relevant part: \"Whenever in the judgment of ... a state's attorney ... the testimony of any witness ... in any criminal proceeding involving ... felonious crimes of violence ... or any other class A, B or C felony ... [is necessary to obtain] sufficient information as to whether a crime has been committed or the identity of the person or persons who may have committed a crime ... [and] is necessary to the public interest ... the state's attorney ... may, with notice to the witness, after the witness has claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, make application to the court for an order directing the witness to testify ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Section 54-47a (b) provides in relevant part: \"Upon the issuance of the order such witness shall not be\n   excused from testifying ... on the ground that the testimony ... may tend to incriminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture. No such witness may be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter or thing concerning which he is compelled to testify ... and no testimony ... so compelled, and no evidence discovered as a result of or otherwise derived from testimony ... so compelled, may be used as evidence against him in any proceeding, except that no witness shall be immune from prosecution for perjury or contempt committed while giving such testimony ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The plain language of \u00a7 54-47a (b) thus provides that, if a witness is compelled to testify about a \"transaction, matter or thing,\" then the witness cannot be \"prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of\" that transaction, matter, or thing. Nothing in the statute suggests that a prosecutor may later revoke that immunity, before or after the witness testifies, and decide to prosecute the witness after all. Indeed, if the state had such power, then the immunity promised under \u00a7 54-47a would be an empty gesture. We conclude that, in the absence of special circumstances, once the state grants a witness immunity under \u00a7 54-47a, it plainly lacks the power to revoke that immunity. Accordingly, to the extent that Bugg, Vance, or Oliphant was compelled under \u00a7 54-47a to testify about a transaction, matter, or thing during the state's case-in-chief, then, from that point on, the state could no longer prosecute them for or on account of it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The state argues, and we agree, that it \"did not\n   <em>\n    revoke\n   </em>\n   grants of immunity to any of its witnesses.\" (Emphasis added.) Given the constraints imposed by \u00a7 54-47a, the state's comments to the three witnesses are best understood not as a \"revocation\" of the immunity that they already had, but rather as a refusal to grant those witnesses\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   To wit, the state did not wish to grant them both transactional immunity from prosecution for any transactions discussed for the first time during the defense case-in-chief, and use or derivative use immunity that would bar the state from using their defense testimony-or evidence derived from it-in any potential prosecutions against them that the state could still legally pursue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The question is not one of revocation. Rather, the question is whether any of the constitutional provisions cited by the defendant required the state to grant that additional immunity to those witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   We therefore turn to whether the state was required to grant the three witnesses additional immunity for their testimony as defense witnesses. \"As a threshold matter, we must first determine the applicable standard of review that governs our examination of the defendant's claims. The issue of whether a defendant's rights to due process and compulsory process require that a defense witness be granted immunity is a question of law and, thus, is subject to de novo review. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \"[A] defendant has a right under the compulsory process and due process clauses to present [his] version\n   of the facts as well as the prosecution's to the jury so [that] it may decide where the truth lies. ...

[Section] 54-47a authorizes the prosecution to grant immunity to state witnesses under certain circumstances. We explicitly have held that \u00a7 54-47a confers no such authority upon the courts with regard to defense witnesses. ... Indeed, this court has held repeatedly that there is no authority, statutory or otherwise, enabling a trial court to grant immunity to defense witnesses. ... We have no occasion to revisit those holdings today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \"We recognize that other courts have held that under certain compelling circumstances the rights to due process and compulsory process under the federal constitution require the granting of immunity to a defense witness. The federal Circuit Courts of Appeals have developed two theories pursuant to which the due process and compulsory process clauses entitle defense witnesses to a grant of immunity. They are the effective defense theory, and the prosecutorial misconduct theory ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \"Under the effective defense theory ... the trial court has the authority to grant immunity to a defense witness when it is found that a potential defense witness can offer testimony which is clearly exculpatory and\n   <em>\n    essential to the defense case\n   </em>\n   and when the government has no strong\n   interest in withholding ... immunity ....

Under this theory, however, the constraint imposed by the due process clause is operative only when the prosecution engages in certain types of misconduct, which include forcing the witness to invoke the fifth amendment or engaging in discriminatory grants of immunity to gain a tactical advantage, and the testimony must be material, exculpatory and\n   <em>\n    not cumulative\n   </em>\n   , and the defendant must have\n   <em>\n    no other source to get the evidence.\n   </em>\n   \" (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kirby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5729290\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/280/361/#p403\">\n    280 Conn. 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 403-404,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=908%20A.2d%20506\">\n    908 A.2d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Our Supreme Court previously has declined to decide whether either of these theories is correct, in the absence of circumstances that would then warrant reversal of a judgment on that basis.

Here, by contrast, there is no reason to believe that the three witnesses' testimony\n   during the defense case-in-chief would have been anything other than a rehash of their prosecution testimony, which, if believed, already tended to exonerate the defendant from each of the crimes charged. Each testified at length, favorably to the defendant, both when the state examined them during its case-in-chief and when the defendant cross-examined them. Although it is possible that the witnesses would have provided additional exculpatory details when called as defense witnesses, nothing in the record indicates what those details would have been.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Triumph Capital Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=237%20Fed.%20Appx.%20625\">\n    237 Fed.Appx. 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 630 (2d Cir.2007) (\"[N]o one knows what [the witnesses] would have testified to since they refused to comment on the matter.

At oral argument before this court, the defendant's counsel was specifically asked what additional details the defendant was prevented from eliciting from these three witnesses, and she provided none. Accordingly, the defendant has failed to show that the witnesses' excluded testimony would not have been cumulative and that he had no other source to get the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   We thus conclude that the state was not constitutionally required to grant additional immunity to Bugg, Vance, and Oliphant when they testified as defense witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The defendant also argues that the court improperly failed to compel Bugg, Vance, and Oliphant to testify when they asserted their fifth amendment rights as defense witnesses, because at that point, as a result of the immunity that the state had granted them during its case-in-chief, they were no longer exposed to prosecution and thus had no valid fifth amendment right to assert.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the court properly refused to compel these witnesses to answer some questions, that the court improperly refused to compel them to\n   answer other questions, and that any error was harmless because all of the testimony improperly excluded was cumulative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   We begin with our standard of review. \"A ruling on the validity of a witness' fifth amendment privilege is an evidentiary determination that this court will review under the abuse of discretion standard. ...

Even if the court improperly admitted this testimony, which we do not conclude, nevertheless, it was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In this regard, the defendant first challenges the court's admission of a portion of Oliphant's testimony during which the prosecutor asked if Oliphant had told the police about an incident on January 9, 2010, when the defendant allegedly shot someone in the groin at a bar fight. Initially, the state sought to admit this testimony for substantive purposes, to prove that the defendant possessed a gun nine days before the Diamond Court robbery and thus had the means to commit the Diamond Court robbery. The defense objected that it was more prejudicial than probative. The court ruled that the state could ask Oliphant only whether the defendant had a gun on January 9 because gun possession then was relevant to \"an element of the fifth count of the information,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"[t]hat is an exception where [the evidence is relevant to] an element of the crime,\n   [and that] is one of the reasons why uncharged misconduct can be allowed.\" See Conn. Code Evid. (2009) \u00a7 4-5 (b) (\"[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts of a person is admissible ... to prove ... an element of the crime\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The state, however, sought to ask about the details of the January 9, 2010 incident as well, to the extent that Oliphant had described them in his statement to the police but repudiated that statement at trial. The prosecutor made an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury, during which she examined Oliphant line by line on his police statement about the\n   January 9 incident. Oliphant categorically denied that he ever gave such a statement and added that he had \"never seen [the defendant] with a gun.\" After the proffer, the defense renewed its objection to the testimony. The court ruled that it would allow the questions \"only for purposes of [the] impeachment and credibility of Mr. Oliphant,\" and, when the jury returned to the courtroom, the court instructed it accordingly. The state then examined Oliphant line by line on the statement he had given to police about the defendant shooting another person in the groin one week before the Diamond Court shooting. Oliphant categorically denied giving such a statement to the police and added that he had \"never seen [the defendant] with a gun ever.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The second piece of uncharged misconduct evidence that the defendant claims the court improperly admitted is the portion of his uncle Omar's testimony in which Omar said that he saw the defendant with a gun on May 8, 2010. Initially, the state sought to admit the testimony to prove that the defendant possessed a gun four months after the Diamond Court shooting; the defense objected that such testimony was more prejudicial than probative; and the court ruled that the testimony was admissible under \u00a7 4-5 (b) of the (2009) Connecticut Code of Evidence as relevant to an element\n   of the fifth count of the information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   After an extensive offer of proof by the state, the defense also objected that the testimony was not relevant to the gun possession charge in count five because the May 8, 2010 gun was not the gun that the defendant allegedly possessed on January 18, 2010. The state argued that the defendant's possession of a different gun four months later was still relevant to whether the defendant possessed a gun on the night of the Diamond Court shooting. The court ruled that Omar's testimony that the defendant possessed a different gun four months after the Diamond Court shooting was not relevant to establish an element of the fifth count of the information but was admissible together with the testimony about gun possession on January 9, 2010, and January 18, 2010, as evidence of \"a system of criminal activity\" of gun possession engaged in by the defendant, offered to prove the defendant's intent to rob the victim at Diamond Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   See Conn. Code Evid. (2009) \u00a7 4-5 (b) (\"[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts of a person is admissible ... to prove ... a system of criminal activity\"). Omar then testified that he saw the defendant with a handgun on May 8, 2010. In its jury charge, the court instructed the jury that the testimony about gun possession on May 8, 2010, was admitted \"solely to show or establish a system of criminal activity being engaged in by the defendant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Even if the court had improperly admitted both of these portions of testimony, which we do not conclude, we hold that the defendant has nevertheless failed to carry his burden of proving that the jury's verdict was substantially swayed by its admission.

Whether the defendant had\n   a gun on January 9, 2010,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   or on May 8, 2010, was ancillary to the central issue of the case, namely, whether the defendant participated in the robbery and shooting of the victim on January 18, 2010. The state presented ample evidence of the robbery, as discussed subsequently in connection with the strength of the prosecution's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Second, evidence that the defendant possessed a gun weeks before or months after the shooting was largely superfluous because there was also evidence that he possessed a gun on the night of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Third, as to corroborating or contradictory evidence, multiple witnesses either testified or admitted in statements to the police, which the state previously had submitted into evidence, that they saw the defendant with a gun on the night of the shooting or on other nights, while several witnesses-most notably Bugg and Vance, in direct contradiction to their police statements-testified that they had never seen the defendant with a gun. Neither Oliphant's nor Omar's testimony was unique or pivotal in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Fourth, the defendant was able adequately to cross-examine both Oliphant and Omar. Oliphant testified favorably to the defense during both direct and cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Fifth and finally, the prosecution's case was strong. The state's case comprised more than thirty witnesses and more than 200 exhibits over the course of fifteen days of testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The victim's mother testified that, from the family apartment, she saw two people with physiques similar to the defendant and Vance both shoot at the victim at approximately 9:40 p.m. on January 18, 2010. The victim's brother testified that, from the family apartment, he saw the defendant and a second man both shoot at the victim a little after 9:30 p.m. on January 18, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The state submitted the prior statements and testimony of the defendant's two accomplices, Bugg and Vance, both of whom initially confessed to the armed robbery in those statements and testimony. Although they recanted their confessions once they received plea deals and testified favorably to the defense at trial, the state impeached them with phone call recordings in which Bugg seemingly asked various relatives to help him coordinate his testimony with Vance, saying at one point that Vance had agreed to \"take the whole charge\" in exchange for some money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Oliphant and his then girlfriend, Sade Stevens, both gave statements to police that they had heard the defendant and Vance confess to robbing and shooting the victim when they came to Oliphant's apartment on the night of January 18, 2010, although they, too, partially recanted those statements at trial and claimed instead that Vance alone confessed that he robbed and shot the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The state's crime scene technicians and its ballistics expert determined that the four bullet cores recovered\n   from the crime scene plus the intact bullet recovered from the victim's body were .38 class bullets, fired from a .38 Special revolver, a .357 Magnum revolver, or a nine millimeter pistol. Because pistols eject bullet casings when fired, however, the state's ballistics expert testified that the lack of casings found at the crime scene was consistent with the shots being fired from a revolver. Multiple witnesses either testified or gave statements to police that were admitted into evidence to the effect that the defendant had a .38 revolver and that Vance had a .357 revolver, which they had with them on the night of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Phone records showed that, at approximately the time of the shooting, the defendant's cell phone reflected several calls from the area of Diamond Court. Various neighbors saw a four door white car driving through Diamond Court just before the shooting and speeding out of Diamond Court just after the shooting. The defendant's aunt testified that, on the night of the shooting, she had lent the defendant her rental car-a four door, white Hyundai-and that they returned the car to the rental company the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The defendant himself testified that, on the night of the shooting, he and Vance dressed all in black and drove to Diamond Court with Bugg in the defendant's white rental car; that they parked behind the apartments; that the defendant and Vance exited the car and walked first toward the man in the SUV, then toward the victim after they realized the man in the SUV had children; that Vance fired shots in the victim's direction; that Bugg pulled up in the car; that the defendant and Vance got in; and that Bugg drove off. The defendant claimed, however, that they never agreed or tried to rob anyone; Vance had gotten into an unrelated altercation with the victim, on his own, and shot him for that reason. The state introduced into evidence phone call recordings in which the defendant\n   repeatedly told his\n   mother to convince one of the prosecution witnesses to invoke her fifth amendment rights if called to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   As a result, we conclude that the defendant has failed to carry his burden of proving that the jury's verdict was substantially swayed by the admission of evidence that he had a gun one week before or several months after the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   As to Bugg's prior inconsistent statement, the defendant challenges the court's admission of the testimony of Bugg's cousin, Foote, about Bugg's confession to him during a car ride several weeks after the shooting. We conclude that the court properly admitted that testimony for the limited purpose of impeaching Bugg's credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. Initially, the state sought to admit the challenged testimony for substantive purposes, arguing that, although it was hearsay, it fell under the coconspirator exception to the prohibition on hearsay,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   but the state later conceded that the coconspirator exception did not apply. Instead, the state sought to admit the testimony solely for impeachment purposes, as extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by Bugg. The state argued that, under the Connecticut Code of Evidence, \"it's within the judicial discretion of the trial court whether to admit the impeaching statements where no foundation has been laid.\" See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-10 (c) (\"[i]f a prior inconsistent statement made by a witness is not ... disclosed to the witness at the time the witness testifies, and if the\n   witness admits to making the statement, extrinsic evidence of the statement is inadmissible,\n   <em>\n    except in the discretion of the court\n   </em>\n   \" [emphasis added] ). The defense objected to the testimony as hearsay and argued that, if the state wished to use it as an inconsistent statement, then it should have disclosed it to Bugg when he testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   After reviewing the transcript of Bugg's earlier trial testimony, the court noted that Bugg twice had denied confessing to Foote, once when asked directly if \"there came a point in time where [he] told [Foote] what had happened on Diamond Court\"-Bugg replied, \"[n]o\"-and, second, when Bugg was asked if his statement to police that \"[t]he only one [he] told about this [was his] cousin Marquis[e] Foote\" was true-Bugg replied, \"[n]o.\" The court ruled that Foote could testify to Bugg's prior inconsistent statement, but that such testimony would be admissible only for the limited purpose of impeaching Bugg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Accordingly, before Foote testified to his conversation with Bugg, the court instructed the jury as follows: \"Ladies and gentlemen, I talked to you when we first began the trial about evidence admitted for a limited purpose. Any comments that Mr. Bugg made to Mr. Foote, they can be used by you only for purposes of evaluating the credibility of Mr. Bugg; you can't use them for any other purpose. So, to the extent that you find them [relevant] you can use them, but only insofar as they relate to the credibility of Mr. Bugg; they are not to be used by you ... these statements are not to be used by you for substantive purposes. So, this is a limit[ed] inquiry, credibility only, not for substantive purposes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Foote testified that three or four weeks after the shooting, he and Bugg were driving\n   around smoking pot when Bugg confided in him what had happened on\n   the night of the shooting. Foote recalled that Bugg had said that he, Vance, and the defendant were out looking to rob someone that night. They saw the victim and decided to rob him. The defendant and Vance got out of the car and put a gun in the victim's face, which he pushed away. The victim then ran away and the defendant and Vance shot him. The state asked if Bugg had ever told Foote that, on the night of the shooting, he, the defendant, and Vance were there to buy marijuana, or to settle a debt. Foote testified that Bugg had not told him such a story.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   At the end of the trial, the court again instructed the jury: \"The testimony of Marquise Foote was admitted only for impeachment purposes as to Rayshaun Bugg. Any other use of that testimony would be improper.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   We begin by setting forth the applicable law. Section 6-10 (a) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides: \"The credibility of a witness may be impeached by evidence of a prior inconsistent statement made by the witness.\" Our Supreme Court has held that \"[i]mpeachment of a witness by the use of a prior inconsistent statement is proper only if the two statements are in fact inconsistent. ... Moreover, the inconsistency must be substantial and relate to a material matter.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"567645\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/214/752/#p763\">\n    214 Conn. 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 763,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=574%20A.2d%20182\">\n    574 A.2d 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Section 6-10 (c) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides in relevant part that \"[i]f a prior inconsistent statement made by a witness is not ... disclosed to the witness at the time the witness testifies,\n   <em>\n    extrinsic evidence\n   </em>\n   of the statement is inadmissible,\n   <em>\n    except in the discretion of the court.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.)

In view of all the circumstances, we conclude that the court reasonably decided (1) that Bugg's confession to Foote was substantially inconsistent with both his denial of having made such a confession and with his testimony at trial about driving to Diamond Court only to buy marijuana from the \"weed man\" on the night of the shooting; and (2) that the issue of whether the jury should believe Bugg's statement to police that the defendant and Vance committed the crimes charged, or Bugg's testimony at trial that they merely attempted to buy marijuana, was material to the defendant's guilt or innocence. Accordingly, the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the challenged testimony for the limited purpose of impeaching Bugg.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The defendant dresses his third and final evidentiary claim in constitutional garb, arguing that \"the trial court erred in permitting lead detective ... Slavin to testify about and comment on hearsay information police received from the state's witnesses, [that the admission of this testimony] violated the defendant's rights to confrontation and cross-examination, [that the admission of this testimony] invaded the province of the jury as to both witness credibility and critical disputed facts, and [that the admission of this testimony] was contrary to the rules of evidence.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The defendant argues that the court permitted Slavin to testify as a \"super-witness\" who filtered the testimony of other witnesses for the jury. We conclude that the court properly admitted Slavin's testimony for the limited purpose of explaining how the police investigation proceeded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. Near the end of the state's case-in-chief, the state recalled Slavin as a witness so that he could testify about how the police investigation of the January 18, 2010 shooting proceeded. As part of this testimony, the state planned to ask Slavin about the statements that various witnesses had given to police. The defense objected that such testimony would be both improper hearsay and improper commentary on the testimony of other witnesses. The court ruled that such testimony was admissible, but only \"with respect to individuals that have already testified,\" and \"only for the purpose of [showing] how that affected the [police] investigation ... [not] for any other purpose.\" The court added that it would be giving the jury a limiting instruction and, accordingly, instructed the jury as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   \"You're also going to hear testimony about what some of the witnesses said to the police-witnesses that have\n   already testified here in front of you. That-those comments by Lieutenant Slavin about what a witness said,\n   <em>\n    that is not intended in any way to affect your individual determination of the credibility of that witness as they-as they sat here on the\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    witness\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    stand and testified. The whole purpose of this testimony by Lieutenant Slavin is to give you, in context, how the police investigation proceeded.\n   </em>\n   So, there are going to be some comments about other things you've heard here from other witnesses.\n   <em>\n    That's not to be used for any purpose other than how the police reacted to those responses.\n   </em>\n   So, you've got-we talked about compartments. You've got a compartment for the witness and what the witness testified to. Then you've got a compartment, comments that Lieutenant Slavin may make about what those witnesses said.\n   <em>\n    Again, only to give you the context of the police investigation.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \"You've got to separate that so the fact that I'm going to allow him to make comments on what somebody else said\n   <em>\n    doesn't mean in any way, shape, or form that you should treat that testimony any differently than I instructed you to treat all the testimony, which is to take everybody individually and treat them by the same standard.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) The court clarified, \"[and] if I said, what they said, I didn't mean in any [way] to support anything that anybody said. I'm just trying to\n   apply the rules as best I can. You've got to determine the credibility. That's your job, not my job.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Slavin testified as follows about the investigation and the role that various witnesses' police statements played in it. Ten days after the shooting, the police received a tip. On the basis of that tip, he entered two nicknames into a police database and came up with the names of the defendant and Oliphant. He searched the Judicial Branch website for those names and found that the defendant received a ticket a few days before the shooting. From the police report of that incident, he\n   obtained the defendant's phone number and a description of the car he drove, which matched the car seen on the night of the shooting. He also learned of a third individual, Vance, who was with the defendant when he was ticketed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   One year later, on January 5, 2011, Foote was arrested on unrelated charges and told police that he had information about the January 18, 2010 shooting. Foote confirmed that the defendant, Oliphant, and Vance were involved and added a fourth name-Bugg. Foote told police that those individuals tried to rob the victim on the night of the shooting, that the victim \"disrespected\" the attempted robbery, that they shot him for that reason, and that Bugg was the getaway driver. Foote did not give the police a written statement at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The police next interviewed Oliphant and his then girlfriend, Stevens, who both gave written statements on February 2, 2011, denying that Oliphant was involved and asserting that the defendant, Vance, and Bugg were the culprits. On February 10, 2011, the police interviewed Bugg, who gave a written statement confessing that he, the defendant, and Vance, but not Oliphant, attempted the robbery on the night of January 18, 2010. Bugg's statement that the defendant and Vance initially planned to rob a man in an Acura SUV, but changed plans when they saw he had two children caused one of the detectives to remember a phone call he received shortly after the shooting from a friend who was at Diamond Court picking up his children on the night of the shooting. On February 16, 2011, police interviewed him and took a written statement. On February 18, 2011, the police interviewed Vance's then girlfriend, Vondella Riddick, who gave a written statement. Finally, police traveled to North Carolina where they interviewed Vance, who gave a written statement on February 22, 2011, confessing that he, the defendant, and Bugg attempted to rob the victim and ended up shooting him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   At that point, the police arrested the defendant, Vance, and Bugg. Prior to trial, the police conducted additional interviews, including a second interview with Stevens and an interview with the defendant's aunt, both of whom gave written statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   After the state finished questioning Slavin, the defense cross-examined him. The defense previously had cross-examined each of the witnesses whose police statements Slavin discussed in his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The court's final charge to the jury at the end of the trial reiterated that the jurors were \"the sole judges of the facts,\" and that they \"must determine the credibility of police personnel in the same way and by the same standards as [they] would evaluate the testimony of any other witness.\" The charge did not specifically reference Slavin's testimony, but instructed the jury generally that, \"[y]ou will recall that I have ruled that some testimony and evidence has been allowed for a limited purpose. Any testimony or evidence which I identified as being limited to a purpose you will consider only as it relates to the limits for which it was allowed, and you shall not consider such testimony or evidence\n   in finding any other facts as to any other issue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Although the defendant frames his objection to this testimony in constitutional terms, invoking the sixth amendment's confrontation clause\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the fair trial component of the fourteenth amendment's due process clause,\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   his claim is in reality evidentiary in nature.

Before being sentenced, the defendant addressed the court to explain that although \"I do accept responsibility for my actions [insofar as] ... I feel that if I was living a better life in 2010, I wouldn't be sitting right here. [Nevertheless] I did not shoot [the victim]. I didn't do it.

Once again, I'm sorry, for y'all loss, but the facts ... of the matter, Your Honor, [are that] on these five counts ... I'm innocent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   After briefly addressing the victim's family, the court addressed the defendant: \"Anthony Collymore, your actions on the night of January 18th, 2010, were completely random, totally senseless and just vicious in nature. You shattered [the victim's] family, left them with a loss that will linger with them forever.

At trial, the state asked Slavin how the police first learned who was involved in the shooting. Slavin began to say that they had received a tip but defense counsel interrupted, objecting \"as to what the tip might have been\" on the ground that it was hearsay. The state claimed it for its effect on the listener, the court overruled the objection, and Slavin testified that the police \"received a tip from a young lady who overheard some people talking on a bus that a party named Rex and Stacks or ... Dreads were ... the ones responsible for killing [the victim].\" The court then excused the jury and held a sidebar, at which defense counsel asked the court to strike the testimony about \"the tip information\" but expressly agreed that the state could \"ask the question, you heard something, you got a tip, and then as a result of that tip, what did you do. It doesn't have to have what the tip is.\" The court adopted that position, ruling that Slavin could testify that \"the authorities [got] a tip and act[ed] on that\" but could not testify that \"the tip said (a), (b), or (c).\" When the court reiterated that the state could ask about \"[t]he fact ... [that police] got a tip,\" the state asked, \"[b]ut that's where the objection would l[ie] for [defense counsel],\" and the court replied: \"That's not what I heard. What I heard was, the issue was with respect to the\n    <em>\n     content\n    </em>\n    of the conversation from someone outside of the authorities. Am I correct in that?\" (Emphasis added.) Defense counsel replied, \"Yes.\" The court then brought the jury back into the courtroom, instructing the jurors that it was striking the testimony they had heard about the tip and that although Slavin would be testifying about what others had said, such testimony was \"not to be used for any purpose other than how the police reacted to those responses ... to give [jurors] the context of the police investigation.\" The state then elicited the following testimony from Slavin:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-203\">\n    \"Q.
