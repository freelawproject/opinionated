The first matter is a reciprocal discipline case (\"the reciprocal discipline matter\"). On April 16, 2015, Bar Counsel, on behalf of the Attorney Grievance Commission, Petitioner, filed with this Court a \"Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action,\" alleging that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (\"the Fourth Circuit\") had suspended Allenbaugh from the practice of law before the Fourth Circuit for two years, based on his failure to competently and diligently represent a client and to respond to court orders. In the petition, Bar Counsel alleged that Allenbaugh's misconduct\n   before the Fourth Circuit violated the Maryland Lawyers' Rules of Professional Conduct (\"MLRPC\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and sought reciprocal discipline.\n   This petition initiated AG No. 9 in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 16, 2015, this Court ordered the parties to show cause why this Court should not impose reciprocal discipline. On June 1, 2015, Bar Counsel filed in this Court a response to the show cause order, requesting that this Court suspend Allenbaugh from the practice of law in Maryland for two years. On June 2, 2015, Allenbaugh filed in this Court a response to the show cause order, requesting that this Court dismiss the request for reciprocal discipline, or, in the alternative, that this Court impose a sanction that would be less severe than suspension,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a sanction without any suspension. On June 23, 2015, this Court designated the Honorable Anne K. Albright (\"the hearing judge\") of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to hear AG No. 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The second matter (\"the Raphael matter\") arose when Alexander Raphael (\"Raphael\"), a client of Allenbaugh and a citizen of Canada, filed a complaint against Allenbaugh.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 13, 2012, Raphael retained Allenbaugh to assist him in obtaining immigrant visas and permanent resident benefits for himself, his wife, and his two daughters. Allenbaugh accepted an up-front fee of $5,000 from Raphael, and informed Raphael that he would put together an application for an L-1 visa.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Raphael, however, was ineligible for an L-1 visa, as he was not employed by an employer who could petition the United States Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") on his behalf. After receiving advice from Allenbaugh's assistant, Raphael's wife and two daughters subsequently entered the United States on non-immigrant, temporary visas, as Raphael had.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Raphael's wife returned to Canada to visit family. She was barred from re-entering the United States when she arrived at the border. DHS declared her inadmissible to the United States because she had overstayed her temporary visa. Raphael attempted to obtain assistance from Allenbaugh, but his attempt went unanswered. Raphael and his two daughters eventually returned to Canada. Allenbaugh never filed any paperwork with DHS on Raphael's behalf and never sought work authorization for Raphael from the United States Department of Labor. Despite having performed no legal services for Raphael, Allenbaugh retained the $5,000 that Raphael had paid him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 9, 2015, Bar Counsel filed in this Court a second \"Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action\" against Allenbaugh, charging him with violating MLRPC 1.1 (Competence), 1.4(a)(2) (Communication), 1.5(a) (Reasonable Fees), 1.15(a), 1.15(c) (Safekeeping Property), 1.16(d) (Terminating Representation),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   8.1(b) (Disciplinary Matters), 8.4(d) (Conduct That is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice), and 8.4(a) (Violating the MLRPC) in representing\n   Raphael. This petition initiated AG No. 25 in this Court, and did not concern the\n   conduct that was at issue in AG No. 9. On July 13, 2015, this Court designated the hearing judge to hear AG No. 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 2, 2015, Bar Counsel filed in this Court a motion to consolidate the two pending attorney discipline proceedings against Allenbaugh (AG Nos. 9 and 25). On September 3, 2015, this Court granted the motion to consolidate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The hearing judge held motions hearings on November 9, 2015, December 14, 2015, and January 14, 2016, concerning Bar Counsel's motion for an order of default, Allenbaugh's motion to vacate the order of default, and Bar Counsel's motion for sanctions against Allenbaugh for failure to respond to discovery requests, respectively. The hearing judge scheduled an evidentiary hearing for April 4, 5, and 6, 2016. On April 4, 2016, Allenbaugh did not attend the scheduled hearing. On May 19, 2016, the hearing judge filed in this Court an opinion including findings of fact and conclusions of law, concluding that, as to the reciprocal discipline matter, Allenbaugh had violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 3.2, 3.4(c), 8.1(b), 8.4(d), and 8.4(a). As to the Raphael matter, the hearing judge concluded that Allenbaugh had violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.4(a)(2), 1.5(a), 1.15(a), 1.15(c), 8.1(b), 8.4(d), and 8.4(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Oral argument in this Court was scheduled on October 7, 2016; Allenbaugh failed to appear; and this Court issued a\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   order in which we disbarred Allenbaugh.\n   <em>\n    SeeAttorney Grievance Comm'n v. Mark Howard Allenbaugh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487784,12175063\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/450/211/\">\n    450 Md. 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487784,12175063\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/450/211/\">\n    147 A.3d 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205867218\">\n    2016 WL 5867218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (2016). We now explain the reasons for Allenbaugh's disbarment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After the consolidation of the reciprocal discipline matter and the Raphael matter, the hearing judge conducted a hearing and found the following facts, which we summarize.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 12, 2000, this Court admitted Allenbaugh to the Bar of Maryland. At the time that the following conduct occurred, Allenbaugh was also a member of the Bar of the District of Columbia, the Virginia State Bar, and the Criminal Justice Act (\"CJA\") Panel for the Fourth Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    The Reciprocal Discipline Matter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 11, 2014, the Fourth Circuit issued an order suspending Allenbaugh from the practice of law for two years. The Fourth Circuit also imposed a fine of $1,000 against Allenbaugh for abandoning a client and an additional fine of $1,000 for repeatedly ignoring orders of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Fourth Circuit's sanctions arose as the result of Allenbaugh's repeated inaction on behalf of a client, Monterio Riley (\"Riley\"), whom Allenbaugh was appointed to represent in the matter of\n   <em>\n    United States v. Riley\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-4766, pursuant to his membership on the CJA Panel. On December 13, 2013, the Fourth Circuit directed Allenbaugh to file a brief and joint appendix on\n   or before January 17, 2014. Allenbaugh filed a motion requesting an extension to March 21, 2014, which the Fourth Circuit granted. On March 21, 2014, Allenbaugh moved to further extend the deadline to March 24, 2014. The Fourth Circuit deferred action on the motion pending the filing of the brief and joint appendix by March 24, 2014. Allenbaugh did not file the brief or appendix.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On April 7, 2014, the Fourth Circuit issued a notice under Local Rule of the Fourth Circuit 46(g), stating that it would refer Allenbaugh's failure to comply with the briefing order to the Fourth Circuit's Standing Panel on Attorney Discipline (\"the Standing Panel\") unless Allenbaugh filed the brief and appendix by April 22, 2014. On April 22, 2014, Allenbaugh filed a motion to extend the deadline to April 25, 2014. The Fourth Circuit denied the motion. Allenbaugh subsequently informed\n   the Clerk of the Court that he would file the brief and appendix by May 9, 2014. Allenbaugh failed to file the brief and appendix by that date, but informed the Clerk of the Court that he would file by May 19, 2014. Allenbaugh, ultimately, never filed the brief or joint appendix.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On June 13, 2014, the Standing Panel ordered Allenbaugh to show cause why he should not be struck as CJA appointed counsel in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Riley\n   </em>\n   . Additionally, the Standing Panel ordered Allenbaugh to show cause why his membership on the CJA Panel should not be revoked. Allenbaugh failed to file a response to the order to show cause by the due date of July 14, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On July 28, 2014, the Standing Panel struck Allenbaugh's appointment in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Riley\n   </em>\n   and revoked his membership on the CJA Panel. Additionally, the Standing Panel directed Allenbaugh to show cause why additional discipline should not be imposed against him. Allenbaugh again failed to respond to the show cause order. In an order dated September 11, 2014, the Fourth Circuit concluded that Allenbaugh had violated Rule 1.3 (Diligence) of the Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct, Rules 30(a) (Appendix to the Briefs) and 31(a) (Serving and Filing Briefs) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, Local Rule of the Fourth Circuit 31(a) (Shortened Time for Service and Filing of Briefs in Criminal Cases), and the Fourth Circuit's briefing order in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   . By virtue of the same order, the Fourth Circuit suspended Allenbaugh for two years from the practice of law before the Fourth Circuit and fined Allenbaugh $1,000 for abandoning Riley and another $1,000 for repeatedly failing to respond to court orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In its order, which was admitted into evidence by the hearing judge, the Standing Panel made the following findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Allenbaugh failed to represent his client with reasonable diligence and failed to respond to directives of the Court. His violation of these duties was knowing and delayed his client's appeal. Allenbaugh has not provided any reason for\n   the repeated lapses or any mitigating factor. Allenbaugh's statement to the Clerk that, in retrospect, he should have requested a continuance of the briefing schedule pending action by the Sentencing Commission on retroactive guideline amendments suggests only that counsel preferred to file the brief and appendix on his own schedule and fails to explain his repeated failure to follow Court orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Suspension is generally the appropriate sanction when \"a lawyer knowingly fails to perform services for a client and causes injury or potential injury to a client.\" ABA Standards \u00a7 4.42(a). Allenbaugh's failure to respond to two orders to show cause why he should not be disciplined for this misconduct was a further \"serious breach of the attorney's professional obligations to the Court and the public,\"\n   <em>\n    In re Warbu r gh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5649789\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/173/#p176\">\n    644 F.3d 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 176 (2d Cir. 2011), and a factor aggravating his original misconduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   We find that Allenbaugh's persistent failure to represent his client and comply with orders of the Court, and his failure to respond to the Panel's orders to show cause, warrant imposition of a fine and suspension from practice before this Court. The Panel fines Mr. Allenbaugh $1,000.00 for abandoning his client and an additional $1,000.00 for\n   repeatedly ignoring orders of the Court, for a total fine of $2,000.00. The fine is payable by certified check to the Clerk of Court within 30 days of the date of this order. The Court also suspends Allenbaugh from practice before this Court for two years. Allenbaugh may apply for reinstatement after the suspension period, premised on his showing \"familiarity with, and willingness to conform to, this court's rules and [his] obligations to clients, and [proof of] payment of any outstanding fines with interest from the due date.\"\n   <em>\n    In Re Flannery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"857825\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/186/143/#p146\">\n    186 F.3d 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 146 (2d Cir. 1999).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Alterations and footnote in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Allenbaugh subsequently failed to report to Bar Counsel that he had been sanctioned by the Fourth Circuit. Allenbaugh's sanction by the Fourth Circuit came to the attention of Bar Counsel as a result of information provided by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel for the District of Columbia, which instituted a reciprocal discipline proceeding against Allenbaugh in the District of Columbia following the Fourth Circuit's sanctions against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    The Raphael Matter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In September 2011, Allenbaugh met Raphael, a citizen of Canada. Raphael told Allenbaugh that he and his wife and two daughters were interested in immigrating to the United States. Allenbaugh informed Raphael that he could obtain visas, permanent residency, and Social Security cards if Raphael invested $25,000 in a particular bail bonds business. Allenbaugh informed Raphael that the fee for these services would be $5,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Raphael subsequently came to the United States on a non-immigrant, temporary visa. Raphael then met with Allenbaugh in Allenbaugh's office in Costa Mesa, California and paid the $5,000 fee in a cashier's check to retain Allenbaugh. Allenbaugh did not place the funds in an attorney trust\n   account, despite the fact that Raphael had not consented in writing to having his funds kept in an account other than an attorney trust account.\n   The retainer agreement between Allenbaugh and Raphael specified that Allenbaugh would obtain an L-1 visa for Raphael. This particular visa, however, was inapplicable to Raphael, as it requires an immigrant to be working for a foreign firm that does business in the United States.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Note 3. At some point, Raphael informed Allenbaugh that he had not invested $25,000 in the bail bond company. Raphael asked Allenbaugh whether he could still bring his family to the United States. Allenbaugh told Raphael that his assistant would follow up with him. Later, Allenbaugh's assistant informed Raphael that \"all would be taken care of\" and that Raphael could bring his family to the United States. Allenbaugh failed to advise Raphael of the type of visa that his family needed to enter the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In July 2012, Raphael's wife and daughters came to the United States on non-immigrant, temporary visas that were valid for six months. In March 2013, Raphael's wife returned to Canada to visit family and was subsequently denied re-entry into the United States. DHS denied Raphael's wife entry into the United States because she did not have the proper type of visa and because she had stayed in the United States after her prior visa had expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Raphael contacted Allenbaugh requesting assistance, and forwarded his wife's documents from DHS. Allenbaugh provided no assistance to Raphael regarding Raphael's wife's inadmissibility to the United States. Because Raphael's wife was unable to re-enter the United States, Raphael and his daughters returned to Canada. If Raphael and his daughters attempt to re-enter the United States, they too may be found inadmissible because they also overstayed their temporary visas and lack proper visas for those seeking to immigrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After returning to Canada, Raphael requested that Allenbaugh continue assisting him and his family in immigrating to the United States. Allenbaugh's assistant assured Raphael that Allenbaugh would file the necessary paperwork so that Raphael and his family could re-enter the United States. In a subsequent conversation, Allenbaugh advised Raphael to find\n   a job in California that paid a six-figure salary to facilitate the immigration process. After July 6, 2013, Allenbaugh did not respond to Raphael's requests for updates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Allenbaugh never drafted any documents on behalf of Raphael or his family for submission to DHS or the Department of Labor. Despite having conducted no meaningful legal work on Raphael's case, Allenbaugh did not refund any of the $5,000 that Raphael had paid him. Allenbaugh also failed to provide Raphael with any accounting of the funds or any billing statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In October 2013, Raphael filed a complaint against Allenbaugh with the State Bar of California. Because Allenbaugh was not licensed to practice law in California, the State Bar of California forwarded Raphael's complaint to Maryland Bar Counsel. On March 21, 2014, Bar Counsel forwarded Raphael's complaint to Allenbaugh and requested a response within fifteen days. Allenbaugh requested and was granted an extension until May 5, 2014. Allenbaugh failed to respond by the deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In a letter dated May 27, 2014, Bar Counsel again requested a response to Raphael's complaint. In a letter dated June 25, 2014, Allenbaugh briefly summarized his representation of Raphael and requested another extension to respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In a letter dated July 8, 2014, Bar Counsel informed Allenbaugh that the Raphael matter had been docketed, and that his response to Raphael's complaint was due on July 29, 2014. Allenbaugh failed to respond. In a letter dated August 5, 2014, Bar Counsel requested a response within seven days. Once again, Allenbaugh failed to respond. In a letter dated August 19, 2014, Bar Counsel yet again requested a response. In a letter dated August 28, 2014, that was nearly identical to his June 25, 2014 letter, Allenbaugh again briefly summarized his representation of Raphael.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On September 12, 2014, Bar Counsel sent Allenbaugh ten specific questions, including two in which Bar Counsel sought Allenbaugh's trust account records and time sheets relating to his representation of Raphael. Allenbaugh did not respond. As\n   part of the investigation conducted by Bar Counsel, an investigator made two appointments with Allenbaugh in September and October 2015. Allenbaugh did not keep either appointment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On April 16, 2015, Bar Counsel, on behalf of the Attorney Grievance Commission, filed with this Court a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, alleging that Allenbaugh's misconduct before the Fourth Circuit also violated the MLRPC. On the same day, this Court issued a Show Cause Order, ordering the parties to show cause in writing why this Court should not impose corresponding discipline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On June 1, 2015, Bar Counsel filed a response to the Show Cause Order, requesting that this Court impose discipline equal to that imposed by the Fourth Circuit and enter an order suspending Allenbaugh from the practice of law in Maryland for two years. On June 2, 2015, Allenbaugh filed a response and requested dismissal of the request for reciprocal discipline. In the alternative, Allenbaugh requested a \"far less severe sanction-one without any suspension[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In his response, Allenbaugh asserted that a suspension from the practice of law in Maryland was inappropriate for three reasons. First, Allenbaugh contended that the Fourth Circuit is not \"another jurisdiction\" within the meaning of Maryland Rule 16-773(a) because the Fourth Circuit is not a State. Second, Allenbaugh argued that his due process rights were violated because he did not receive a hearing prior to being sanctioned by the Fourth Circuit, and Allenbaugh claimed that he was not given actual notice regarding the severity of the sanctions that he faced. Third, Allenbaugh maintained that his conduct before the Fourth Circuit would not be grounds for a two-year suspension in Maryland. Regarding potential mitigating factors, Allenbaugh asserted that he suffered anxiety and depression around the time of\n   <em>\n    United States v. Riley\n   </em>\n   , which affected his ability to represent Riley. Allenbaugh indicated in his response that he had sought treatment and that his anxiety and depression are under control. Allenbaugh also\n   asserted that Riley had no meritorious grounds for appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 8, 2015, Bar\n   Counsel filed a reply to Allenbaugh's response, maintaining that this Court has jurisdiction to impose reciprocal discipline and contesting Allenbaugh's due process claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On July 9, 2015, Bar Counsel filed with this Court the second Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, thus initiating the Raphael matter. On September 2, 2015, Bar Counsel filed in this Court a Motion to Consolidate the reciprocal discipline matter and the Raphael matter. This Court granted the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On September 8, 2015, Bar Counsel filed a Motion for an Order of Default in the reciprocal discipline matter, which the hearing judge granted on September 25, 2015. Bar Counsel also filed a Motion for an Order of Default in the Raphael matter. On November 9, 2015, both parties appeared before the hearing judge for a hearing on the motion for an order of default. Allenbaugh appeared, but had not filed a responsive pleading. During the hearing, Allenbaugh requested an extension so that he could seek assistance of counsel, which the hearing judge denied. The hearing judge granted the motion for an order of default in the Raphael matter, but informed Allenbaugh that he could file a motion to vacate the order of default. On December 8, 2015, Allenbaugh filed a motion to vacate the order of default. On December 14, 2015, following a\n   hearing, the hearing judge granted the motion to vacate the order of default in the Raphael matter. The hearing judge set deadlines for discovery and scheduled three days for the evidentiary hearing: April 4, 5, and 6, 2016. On December 23, 2015, Bar Counsel moved for sanctions based on Allenbaugh's failure to respond to Bar Counsel's discovery requests. The hearing judge ordered that all of Bar Counsel's Requests for Admissions of Fact and Genuineness of Documents were deemed admitted, and Allenbaugh was precluded from introducing evidence or testimony that had been sought by Bar Counsel during discovery. Allenbaugh failed to submit a prehearing statement; and on April 4, 2016, Allenbaugh did not appear for the scheduled evidentiary hearing. The hearing judge took the matter under advisement and offered both parties the opportunity to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Allenbaugh did not submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Neither party excepts to any of the hearing judge's findings of fact; thus, we \"treat the findings of fact as established[.]\" Md.

Although, in response to this Court's show cause order, Allenbaugh claimed he believed that Riley had no meritorious claims to bring on appeal in the Fourth Circuit-and, thus, that his inaction did not prejudice Riley-such excuses do not undermine the hearing judge's findings with respect to Allenbaugh's violation of MLRPC 1.1. Allenbaugh delayed filing the brief and appendix for six months, and even failed to follow through after promising the Clerk of the Court that he would file the brief and joint appendix by certain dates.

Specifically, Allenbaugh failed to identify the proper type of visa for which Raphael and his family might qualify, instead advising Raphael to obtain an L-1 visa, for which Raphael was ineligible. After Allenbaugh's assistant provided advice to Raphael that Raphael's wife could immigrate to the United States, Allenbaugh failed to advise Raphael regarding the type of visa that he and his family would need and how to avoid violating immigration laws. As a result, Raphael's wife was subsequently deemed inadmissible to the United States by DHS, and Raphael and his daughters eventually left the United States because his wife could not return. Further, the hearing judge specifically noted that if Raphael\n   and his daughters seek to re-enter the United States, they may be deemed inadmissible also because they, like Raphael's wife, overstayed their temporary visas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    MLRPC 1.3 (Diligence)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \"A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\" MLRPC 1.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge's conclusion that Allenbaugh violated MLRPC 1.3 in representing Riley.

Allenbaugh provided no substantive information regarding the visa application to Raphael, but rather deferred to his assistant, who told Raphael that Allenbaugh would \"take[ ] care of\" Raphael's visa application, while providing no further details. When Allenbaugh spoke with Raphael directly, the extent of his legal advice was to suggest that Raphael obtain a job in California with a six-figure salary. Allenbaugh was also unresponsive to Raphael's request for assistance when Raphael's wife was denied re-entry into the United States. And, after July 6, 2013, Allenbaugh stopped communicating with Raphael entirely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    MLRPC 1.5(a) (Reasonable Fees)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   MLRPC 1.5(a) stated, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   A lawyer shall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses.

Allenbaugh never drafted any immigration documents on Raphael's behalf to submit to DHS. Allenbaugh also never drafted applications for labor certification from the Department of Labor. In sum, despite having been paid, Allenbaugh never performed any work for Raphael or his family's immigration to the United States. Furthermore, Allenbaugh failed to send billing statements to Raphael and provided no accounting of how the funds were applied to work on Raphael's case.

Because Allenbaugh failed to do the very work that he was appointed to do-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , file a brief and appendix-Allenbaugh's behavior raises concern about the need to protect potential future clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Allenbaugh's conduct in the Raphael matter, which occurred prior to his conduct in the reciprocal discipline matter, increases the concern regarding the need to protect the public from such conduct in the future. Specifically, Allenbaugh violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.4(a)(2), 1.5(a), 1.15(a), 1.15(c), 8.1(b), and 8.4(d), demonstrating a lack of competence, a failure to communicate with Raphael, the charging of unreasonable fees, a failure to place unearned fees in trust, and a failure to respond to Bar Counsel. In the aggregate, such conduct reveals that Allenbaugh flagrantly neglected Raphael's affairs. Indeed, Allenbaugh violated MLRPC 1.4(a)(2) and 1.5(a) by failing to respond to Raphael and by retaining the $5,000 that Raphael had paid him. Allenbaugh's conduct was injurious to Raphael and his family. If Raphael and his family seek to re-enter the United States, they may be prevented from doing so by DHS because of having overstayed their previous visas. In short, Allenbaugh failed to perform meaningful legal work for Raphael and has endangered Raphael's and his family's ability to immigrate to the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The hearing judge found the following aggravating factors: (1) a pattern of misconduct; (2) multiple offenses; (3) \"bad faith obstruction of the attorney disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the Commission\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   ; (4) a refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct; (5) vulnerability of victim; (6) substantial experience in the practice of law; and (7) indifference to making restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In addition to the serious misconduct discussed above, upon our independent review, we note the same seven aggravating factors: (1) a pattern of misconduct; (2) multiple violations of the MLRPC; (3) bad faith obstruction of the attorney discipline proceeding; (4) a refusal to acknowledge the misconduct's wrongful nature; (5) the victim's vulnerability; (6) substantial experience in the practice of law; and (7) indifference to making restitution or rectifying the misconduct's consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   To begin, there is a pattern of misconduct. In both the reciprocal discipline matter and the Raphael matter, Allenbaugh\n   did not represent his client competently. Both matters involve instances in which Allenbaugh failed to take action on behalf of a client when he was obligated to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Next, Allenbaugh engaged in multiple violations of the MLRPC. In the reciprocal discipline matter, Allenbaugh violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 3.2, 3.4(c), and 8.4(d). In the Raphael matter, Allenbaugh violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.4(a)(2), 1.5(a), 1.15(a), 1.15(c), 8.1(b), and 8.4(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Allenbaugh's repeated failure to respond to Bar Counsel constitutes an obstruction of the attorney disciplinary proceeding. Allenbaugh failed to respond to Raphael's complaint when forwarded by Bar Counsel during the investigation in the instant case, failed to attend two scheduled appointments with Bar Counsel's investigator, and failed to respond to discovery requests by Bar Counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Allenbaugh has not acknowledged the wrongful nature of his conduct in the Raphael matter. In his response to this Court's show cause order in the reciprocal discipline matter, Allenbaugh stated that there was no excuse for his behavior and characterized it as \"unfortunate and eminently regrettable.\" Allenbaugh, however, has not acknowledged in any way the wrongful nature of his misconduct in the Raphael matter, nor has he demonstrated any remorse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Raphael's status as an immigrant rendered him particularly vulnerable to Allenbaugh's misconduct.\n   <em>\n    SeeThomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307989\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/440/523/#p558\">\n    440 Md. at 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307989\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/440/523/#p558\">\n    103 A.3d at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We have recognized previously the special vulnerability of immigrants as clients.\");\n   <em>\n    Attorney Grievance Comm'n v.

Thus, he has over fifteen years of experience in the practice of law, and had over a decade of experience at the time of the misconduct in the reciprocal discipline matter and\n   the Raphael matter, constituting substantial experience in the practice of law-an aggravating factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Finally, Allenbaugh has not attempted to rectify his wrongdoing. He continues to retain the $5,000 that he charged Raphael and refuses to account for the funds. Additionally, Allenbaugh has continued to be unresponsive to Bar Counsel throughout this attorney discipline proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The hearing judge found that Allenbaugh provided no evidence of mitigating factors. As this Court observed in\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307989\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/440/523/#p558\">\n    440 Md. at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307989\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/440/523/#p558\">\n    103 A.3d at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"[m]itigation is not on the table ... without the attorney providing supporting evidence of the existence of such factors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We are aware that Allenbaugh contended in his response to this Court's show cause order that his misconduct stemmed from a depressive episode, for which he stated that he has sought treatment. Attached as an exhibit to Allenbaugh's response to this Court's show cause order was a letter, dated March 27, 2015, from a psychiatrist stating that Allenbaugh had been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder, and was being treated with medication. The psychiatrist's letter does not mention the reciprocal discipline matter, does not provide a date with respect to the onset of the alleged disorders, and does not indicate that Allenbaugh's ability to practice law was impacted in any way. Allenbaugh failed to appear for the scheduled evidentiary hearing and failed to submit any evidence with respect to the alleged mental health disorders, and, as such, has failed to demonstrate that the disorders affected his conduct in the reciprocal discipline matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Notably, in the Raphael matter, Allenbaugh failed to file an answer to the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action or to present any mitigating evidence whatsoever with respect to his misconduct. Although a diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety at the time of a lawyer's misconduct may be a mitigating factor, in this case, the hearing judge is correct that Allenbaugh presented no mitigating evidence as to either the reciprocal discipline matter or the Raphael matter. Allenbaugh\n   has not linked the diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety to his misconduct in the reciprocal discipline matter, or attempted to address his misconduct in the Raphael matter. Accordingly, we discern no mitigating factors. Taken together, the flagrancy of Allenbaugh's misconduct in the reciprocal discipline matter and the Raphael matter, along with the multitude of aggravating factors, warrant disbarment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   For the above reasons, on October 7, 2016, we disbarred Allenbaugh and awarded costs against him.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    Effective July 1, 2016, the MLRPC were renamed the Maryland Attorneys' Rules of Professional Conduct, or MARPC, and renumbered.

After he was notified[ ] that his failure to file the brief and appendix would be referred to the Standing Panel on Attorney Discipline if not remedied by April 22, 2014, Allenbaugh filed yet another \"Final Motion to Continue Briefing Schedule\" to April 25, 2014, which the Court denied. Allenbaugh had not filed the brief and appendix or made any response to the order to show cause at the time the Court terminated his representation on July 28, 2014.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    Allenbaugh characterizes his conduct as \"failing to file an\n    <em>\n     Anders\n    </em>\n    brief that otherwise did not prejudice the client in any material way[.]\" Allenbaugh maintains that he believed that there was no meritorious issue for the Fourth Circuit to consider in United States v.

Pursuant to Local Rule of the Fourth Circuit 46(g)(9), the Standing Panel acts on the Fourth Circuit's behalf by issuing show cause orders, considering all responses to show cause orders, and presiding over disciplinary hearings. Pursuant to Local Rule of the Fourth Circuit 46(g)(8), the Standing Panel is comprised of three active Fourth Circuit judges.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    Although MLRPC 1.0 (Terminology) does not define \"disciplinary authority,\" this Court has applied MLRPC 8.1(b) to failures to respond to a request by Bar Counsel for information, as opposed to failures to respond to a court's show cause order. For example, in Attorney Grievance Comm'n v. Williams,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4165397\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/446/355/#p375\">\n     446 Md. 355\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 375,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4165397\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/446/355/#p375\">\n     132 A.3d 232\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 244 (2016), this Court concluded that, \"in failing knowingly to respond to Bar Counsel's letters demanding information about this case, Respondent violated MLRPC 8.1(b).\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    Given that, in the reciprocal discipline matter, the hearing judge's findings of fact indicate that Allenbaugh failed to respond to a show cause order from a three-judge panel, rather than that Allenbaugh failed to respond to Bar Counsel or a similar authority, we shall refrain from finding that clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge's conclusion of law that Allenbaugh violated MLRPC 8.1(b) by failing to respond to the Standing Panel's show cause orders. This circumstance does not change the outcome of the case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    By order dated September 11, 2014, the Fourth Circuit suspended Allenbaugh from the practice of law before the Fourth Circuit for two years. Although, in response to this Court's show cause order, Allenbaugh alleged that the two-year suspension constituted a violation of due process, the record reflects that, prior to imposing the two-year suspension, the Standing Panel directed Allenbaugh to show cause as to why discipline should not have been imposed, and Allenbaugh failed to respond. Accordingly, Allenbaugh has not demonstrated that the Fourth Circuit \"procedure was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of due process[.]\" Md. R. 16-773(e)(1).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
