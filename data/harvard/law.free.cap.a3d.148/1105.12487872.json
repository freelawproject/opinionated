Having thoroughly reviewed the record prior to oral argument,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   we concluded\n   after oral argument that the habeas court properly granted the petitioner's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Immediately thereafter, we orally affirmed the judgment of the habeas court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consistent with that ruling, we now issue this written opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as set forth by our Supreme Court in the petitioner's direct criminal appeal, and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. \"On September 1, 2004 ... the [petitioner, the petitioner's infant daughter, Ayanna, and the petitioner's boyfriend, David Bell, were driven] to the apartment of Sarah Tarini in Meriden. Tarini lived in the apartment with her ten year old daughter, Summer, and she had been allowing Michael Fontanella and Shanna Kropp to stay in one of the apartment's two bedrooms for several weeks. The [petitioner] and Bell asked Tarini if they could spend the night there and told her that they would be going to New York the next day. Tarini agreed to let\n   the [petitioner], Ayanna and Bell stay in the bedroom where Fontanella and Kropp usually stayed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"On September 2, 2004, Kropp told the [petitioner] that she and Bell would have to leave Tarini's apartment. The [petitioner] appeared to Kropp to be aggravated and annoyed at this request. At about 6 p.m., the [petitioner] left the apartment with Ayanna, stating that she was going to call someone on a pay telephone to get a ride. The [petitioner] called the victim, Faye Bennett, who was a good friend of the [petitioner] and someone she had known since childhood, and asked her to come to the location of the pay telephone to pick her up. The victim, who was approximately six or seven months pregnant, arrived in her Chevrolet Blazer a short time later. The [petitioner] repaid the victim $20 that she previously had borrowed from her and the victim gave the [petitioner] a pair of sneakers as a birthday gift for Ayanna. At about 7 p.m., the victim called her boyfriend, told him that she and the [petitioner] were going to Tarini's apartment, and asked if he wanted to join them. He declined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"At approximately 7:30 p.m. that same evening, Tarini, Summer, Fontanella and Kropp left the apartment and walked to a nearby store to purchase cell phone minutes and ice cream. At approximately 7:45 p.m., Scott Baustien, who lived in the first floor apartment directly below Tarini's apartment, saw the [petitioner] and the victim walk by his window and heard them walk up to the second floor and enter Tarini's apartment. He then heard thumping noises. Baustien also noticed that the victim's Blazer, which was parked in the driveway, was blocking his car and a car belonging to Clarence Labbe, who lived above Tarini in the building's third floor apartment. Baustien telephoned Labbe to tell him about the Blazer. Labbe told Baustien that he also had heard banging noises coming from Tarini's apartment, which he assumed were caused by children playing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Baustien then went outside to check the Blazer that was blocking the driveway and saw the [petitioner] seated behind the steering wheel and Ayanna in the passenger seat. He told the [petitioner] that she could not park there. The [petitioner], who appeared to Baustien to be extremely nervous and as 'white as a ghost,' said, 'I'm\n   sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,' and backed the Blazer quickly down the driveway toward the road, hitting the corner of the apartment building in the process. After Baustien returned to his apartment, he heard footsteps going down the front stairs of the apartment and a car horn beeping several times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"At approximately 8:15 p.m., Tarini, Summer, Fontanella and Kropp returned to the apartment. Tarini knocked on the door of the bedroom where the [petitioner] and Bell had been staying. When she received no response, she opened the door and saw that the room was covered with blood and that there was a body in a garbage bag on the bed. Tarini immediately asked Fontanella to take Summer upstairs to Labbe's apartment and called 911. A short time later, Captain Timothy Topulos and Officer Justin Hancort of the Meriden police department arrived at the scene. They met Tarini and Fontanella, who were visibly shaken, outside the building. They then entered Tarini's apartment and observed the bloody crime scene and the victim's body on the bed. They also saw a baby bottle on the bedroom floor. Topulos summoned medical personnel, who determined that the victim was dead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Initially, the police misidentified the victim as the [petitioner]. It was not until the next day, during the victim's autopsy, that the victim was correctly identified as Bennett. The chief medical examiner determined that the cause of the victim's death was multiple stab wounds and strangulation. The [petitioner] and Bell were apprehended in the Bronx, New York, approximately eight days after the victim's murder.\" (Footnotes\n   omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Helmedach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%2061\">\n    306 Conn. 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 66-69,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20A.3d%20664\">\n    48 A.3d 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the jury trial that followed, \"[t]he state's theory was that the [petitioner] had lured the victim to Tarini's apartment so that she and Bell ... could steal the victim's car and money and escape to New York.

The petitioner claimed that the performance of her trial counsel, Richard Reeve, was deficient because he failed to timely and meaningfully communicate a plea offer of ten years to the petitioner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 19 and December\n   12,\n   2014, the habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Cobb, J.\n   </em>\n   , held a trial in which it heard testimony from the petitioner; Reeve; Gary Nicholson, the assistant state's attorney who prosecuted the case; and Michael Sheehan, Reeve's law partner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After trial, the habeas court granted the petition for a writ of habeas corpus. In a corrected written memorandum of decision dated August 26, 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court concluded that Reeve's failure to relay the favorable offer to the petitioner in a timely manner before it was withdrawn fell below the objective standard of reasonableness required by attorneys under the state and federal constitutions. The habeas court granted certification to appeal. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The respondent claims that the habeas court improperly concluded that Reeve had provided ineffective assistance to the petitioner by delaying to inform her of a plea offer until after she had completed her trial testimony. More specifically, the respondent contends that the habeas court improperly relied on\n   <em>\n    Missouri\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=566%20U.S.%20133\">\n    566 U.S. 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188490\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/134/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188490\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/134/\">\n    182 L.Ed.2d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), and\n   <em>\n    Sanders v.

The respondent also argues that Reeve's performance was objectively reasonable under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In response, the petitioner argues that Reeve's conduct could not be reasonable trial strategy because, as a matter of law, the decision made by Reeve to delay informing the petitioner of a favorable plea offer is not one that counsel constitutionally is allowed to make because it undermined the petitioner's ability to meaningfully exercise a right that belongs solely to her. Thus, in the petitioner's view, Reeve's conduct cannot be characterized as a matter of trial strategy. The petitioner alternatively contends that if this court decides that Reeve's decision to delay communicating the plea offer to her was a matter of strategy, it should conclude that Reeve did not make a\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   strategic decision under the circumstances. We agree with the petitioner that Reeve's decision to delay informing the petitioner about a plea offer was not within the realm of strategic decisions that an attorney is allowed to make.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The following additional facts, as found by the habeas court, are relevant to this claim. \"Reeve was appointed to represent the petitioner after her arrest and represented her throughout the pretrial and trial proceedings in this case. ... Like most criminal cases, the parties in this case engaged in pretrial plea negotiations in an attempt to resolve the case prior to trial. On December 18, 2006, the state made its first plea offer to the petitioner during a supervised pretrial with Judge Damiani. With Judge Damiani's assistance, the state offered the petitioner a plea to robbery or conspiracy to commit robbery and incarceration in the range of fifteen to twenty years, with the right to argue to the court that it impose a sentence at the low range or the 'floor.' The judge approved the [plea offer], but indicated to\n   [Reeve] at the pretrial that he would likely sentence the petitioner at the high end of the range, absent some compelling circumstances that arose at the sentencing hearing. [Reeve] said he would discuss the offer with the petitioner and the state indicated it would discuss it with the victim's family.\n   \"[Reeve] met with the petitioner and relayed to her the offer. He advised the petitioner about the strengths and weaknesses of the state's case, her defense and the risks of going to trial. The petitioner agreed to accept the offer. On January 10, 2007, [Reeve] wrote to [Nicholson] and indicated that the petitioner accepted the offer. ... [Reeve] did not receive a written response from [Nicholson].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"At the next supervised pretrial, in mid-January 2007, [Nicholson] informed [Reeve] and the judge that the victim's family did not support the proposed agreement, and as a result, the state was withdrawing it. As a result, the parties decided to forgo plea negotiations until after the petitioner's codefendant, [Bell], had been tried or his case resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"On May 23, 2007, Bell was convicted on all charges and on December 14, 2007, was sentenced to eighty-five years incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"This case was then placed on the trial list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"On August 24, 2007, [Reeve] filed a motion to compel specific performance of the original plea offer. That motion was denied [by the court].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"The case proceeded to trial and while the parties were selecting the jury, the state made its second plea offer to the petitioner. That offer was twenty-two years, suspended after seventeen years incarceration. After discussing this offer with [Reeve], the petitioner rejected it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"The state then made its third offer, during jury selection or during the first days of its case-in-chief. That offer was fourteen years to serve. The petitioner rejected this third offer, after conferring with [Reeve]. [Reeve] explained to the petitioner that if convicted she would be facing at least thirty years in prison, as the\n   felony murder charge had a twenty-five year mandatory minimum sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"The petitioner rejected the second and third offers because the state's case had been weakened as a result of its key witness', Gabriel Colon, recantation of his prior oral statement to police that the petitioner spoke to him about participating in the setup of the robbery of the victim. Because Colon had not provided a written statement to police, his prior statement could not be introduced under [the]\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Colon was the only witness that was able to tie the petitioner directly to the robbery. Tying the petitioner to the robbery was essential to establishing the underlying felony on the felony murder charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"The petitioner's criminal trial was held on various days between October 1, 2007, and October 16, 2007. On Friday, October 5, 2007, the state rested its case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"After the state rested, the case was continued to the following Tuesday, October 9, 2007. The courts were closed on Monday in observance of Columbus Day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"[Nicholson] did not make any offers to the petitioner on Friday, October 5, 2007. Over the weekend, [Reeve] spent numerous hours at the York prison in Niantic, where the petitioner was incarcerated, preparing\n   the petitioner for her testimony, which would begin the following Tuesday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"On Tuesday morning, October 9, 2007, [Reeve] arrived at his office early to prepare for trial. Between 9:15 and 9:30 a.m., [Reeve] received an unexpected call from [Nicholson]. During the call, [Nicholson] offered the petitioner ten years to serve. [Reeve] told [Nicholson] that he had spent the entire weekend prepping the petitioner for her testimony on Tuesday. [Reeve]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   explained that although he believed that ten years was a very favorable offer, he was concerned about relaying it to the petitioner immediately prior to her testimony because she was young and flustered, and he believed that this unexpected news would negatively impact her testimony. [Reeve] asked [Nicholson] if he could convey the offer after the petitioner testified, and [Nicholson] said: 'that's okay.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"After the call from [Nicholson] and prior to leaving for court that Tuesday morning, [Reeve] stopped by the office of his partner, [Sheehan], to inform him of the unexpected call he received from [Nicholson], the offer of ten years, as well as his concerns about relaying the offer to the petitioner before she testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"[Sheehan] agreed that the ten year offer was favorable and advised [Reeve] that he should not wait to communicate the offer to the petitioner until after she testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"In view of [Nicholson's] acquiescence to leave the offer open, [Reeve] followed his instincts and did not relay the offer to the petitioner on Tuesday morning, but instead waited until after her testimony concluded. The petitioner's testimony took two and one-half days. Upon learning of the ten year offer after she testified, the petitioner expressed her desire to accept it and indicated she wanted to discuss it with her mother and attorney jointly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"[Reeve] then approached [Nicholson] and told him the petitioner was interested in accepting the offer of ten years. [Nicholson] informed [Reeve] that the offer was withdrawn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"When [Reeve] returned to his office, he relayed these events to [Sheehan]. [Sheehan] told him that his failure to relay the ten year offer to the petitioner prior to its withdrawal created an issue of [Reeve's] ineffectiveness\n   under\n   <em>\n    Sanders\n   </em>\n   v.

Each of these dictionary definitions references either immediacy or a lack of delay, concepts which the petitioner advanced in her construction of the term \"promptly.\" In contrast, because the respondent argues that \"promptly\" does not necessarily mean \"immediately\" and admits that defense counsel here acted\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   delay, that construction of the term is unpersuasive.

Once Reeve received the extremely advantageous ten year offer from Nicholson on the morning of October 9, he decided to wait to tell the petitioner about the offer until after she had taken the stand in her own defense and gone through her entire trial testimony, which ultimately took two and one-half days to complete. Significantly, the respondent does not claim on appeal that Reeve was prevented by circumstances outside of his control from communicating the plea offer to his client for several days. Because the trial proceeded on October 9, the very same day Reeve received\n   the offer from\n   Nicholson, Reeve obviously was interacting with his client throughout each of the following days and had ample time to communicate the offer and to discuss the risks and benefits of accepting or rejecting it. In making the conscious decision to delay delivering this information to his client, Reeve did not act immediately or without delay within the definition of \"promptly.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nicholson's agreement to keep the offer open did not obviate Reeve's duty to promptly inform his client of the offer. Therefore, Reeve failed to comply with our Rules of Professional Conduct and, by extension, failed to fulfill his duty to timely communicate offers from the state in derogation of\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Because defense counsel's actions prevented the petitioner from properly exercising her constitutional right to plead guilty and to make a fully informed decision as to whether to testify on her own behalf, we agree with the petitioner that Reeve's decision may not properly be viewed as trial strategy at all, much less a\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   trial strategy. Nevertheless, even if we were to consider counsel's decision to delay communicating the plea\n   offer as falling within the penumbra of trial strategy, we would find that Reeve's decision was not reasonable under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In keeping with the analysis set forth in\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , we afford Reeve the presumption that the challenged decision might be considered sound trial strategy, and evaluate the decision from Reeve's perspective, under the circumstances as of the time of his conduct. See\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   , supra, 466 U.S. at 689-90,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present case, the habeas court found that after Reeve received the unexpected phone call and ten year plea offer from Nicholson, his immediate reaction was to tell Nicholson \"that he had spent the entire weekend prepping the petitioner for her testimony on Tuesday,\" and that although \"he believed that ten years was a very favorable offer, he was concerned about relaying it to the petitioner immediately prior to her testimony because she was young and flustered, and he believed that this unexpected news would negatively impact her testimony.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, on the basis of the record before us, the habeas court reasonably\n   could have found that Reeve did not delay informing the petitioner\n   of the offer for any reason grounded in legal strategy, such as increasing the chances of a more favorable plea offer from the state or of an acquittal by the jury. When asked during his habeas trial testimony whether it was true that he wanted the offer to remain open through the petitioner's trial testimony \"for strategic reasons, so that you can see how ... how she would do,\" Reeve responded, \"I don't think that really-I don't really think that was a factor in my mind, to be honest. I think I said that earlier. I wasn't really thinking about that time, well, what if she falls apart on the stand, or, alternatively, as you're now positing a question, what if she does better? I've answered both. I would answer the same way, that really wasn't in my limited thinking calculus at that time.\" Given that, from Reeve's perspective, he withheld the exceptionally advantageous ten year offer from his client in the sole interest of protecting her fragile emotional state and has not explained how this would affect his trial strategy, Reeve's conduct cannot be considered sound trial strategy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Further, Reeve's decision is unreasonable in the context of the history of Reeve and Nicholson's plea negotiations in this case. As the habeas court found, the state made its first offer to the petitioner, a plea to robbery or conspiracy to commit robbery and incarceration in the range of fifteen to twenty years, during a supervised pretrial conference in December, 2006. The judge\n   approved the sentence, and Reeve said he would discuss the offer with the petitioner, and the state indicated it would discuss it with the victim's family. After Reeve advised the petitioner about the strengths and weaknesses of the state's case, her defense, and the risks of trial, the petitioner agreed to accept the offer, and Reeve wrote to Nicholson on January 10, 2007, to inform him of the petitioner's acceptance. Reeve did not receive a response from Nicholson, and at the next supervised pretrial conference in mid-January, Nicholson informed Reeve and the judge that the state was withdrawing the offer due to the lack of support from the victim's family. On August 24, 2007, Reeve filed a motion to compel specific performance of the original plea offer, which the court ultimately denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On the basis of these events, Reeve knew that Nicholson had already rescinded\n   a plea offer that had been discussed by both parties in a supervised pretrial conference, had been agreed to by the judge, had been open for several weeks, and already had been accepted by the petitioner in writing. In fact, Reeve had been so concerned with the circumstances surrounding the withdrawal of the earlier plea offer that he had taken the time to file a motion to compel specific performance of the offer. That he did not register any similar concern about the possible withdrawal of a much better offer that arrived orally, by telephone, in the last moments before his client was to testify in her own defense, is unreasonable on his part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, as additional evidence that establishes that Reeve's decision lacked reasonableness, we turn our attention to the testimony of Sheehan, Reeve's law partner. Pursuant to the habeas court's factual findings, after Reeve received the call from Nicholson and prior to when he left for court, Reeve stopped by Sheehan's office to inform him of the ten year plea offer as well as his concerns about relaying the offer to the petitioner\n   before she testified. Significantly, \"Sheehan agreed that the ten year offer was favorable and advised Attorney Reeve that he should not wait to communicate the offer to the petitioner until after she testified.\" Reeve, however, decided to follow \"his instincts\" and wait to tell the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Although Reeve certainly was not bound by Sheehan's advice, it makes a difference, for purposes of analyzing the reasonableness of his decision, that Reeve was made aware by a fellow attorney, his law partner, that the decision might not be a reasonable course of action under the circumstances. That Reeve quickly dismissed Sheehan's recommendation reinforces the conclusion that defense counsel's mind was closed to advice and that he acted unreasonably, without meaningfully calculating the risks of his decision beforehand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In sum, we conclude that even if defense counsel's conduct was a matter of trial strategy, the petitioner has successfully rebutted the presumption, under that framework, that defense counsel's conduct was reasonable. Ultimately, however, we conclude that defense counsel's decision to delay communication of the plea offer to the petitioner cannot be considered an exercise of trial strategy under the facts of this case; thus, he performed deficiently. We, therefore, conclude that the habeas court did not improperly conclude that the petitioner's trial counsel provided ineffective assistance. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the habeas court. As the habeas court terminated the appellate stay and returned the matter to the criminal trial court for further proceedings, we hereby order the trial court to fashion, on an expedited basis, an appropriate remedy pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Ebron\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20Conn.%20342\">\n    307 Conn. 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20A.3d%20983\">\n    53 A.3d 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The judgment is affirmed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The habeas court granted the respondent's petition for certification to appeal from the judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    On March 3, 2016, the petitioner filed a motion to expedite this appeal.
