Jamison, thereafter, entered an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to first degree rape and kidnapping and was sentenced to life imprisonment plus 30 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2008, Jamison filed a Petition for DNA Testing, alleging that newly discovered slides containing cellular material from swabs taken from the victim's vulva,\n   vagina, and endocervix needed to be tested:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   41. The Slides constitute \"scientific identification evidence\" under Maryland Code of Criminal Procedure Section 8-201. The sperm on the Slides was apparently deposited by the sole suspect in this matter. A DNA test that excludes Mr. Jamison as the source of the sperm would compel the conclusion that he is innocent of the crimes for which he has been convicted and is incarcerated. Accordingly, the evidence in this case meets the standards for court-ordered DNA testing pursuant to Maryland Code of Criminal Procedure Section 8-201.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Judge Patrick Cavanaugh of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County granted Jamison's motion, and Orchid Cellmark of Dallas, Texas conducted the testing. Jamison, thereafter, filed a Motion to Vacate Conviction pursuant to Section 8-201 of the Criminal Procedure Article of the Maryland Code (2008 Repl. Vol, 2009 Supp.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   He contemporaneously filed a Petition\n   for Writ of Actual Innocence pursuant to Section 8-301 of the Criminal Procedure Article of the Maryland Code (2008 Repl. Vol., 2009 Supp.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State responded on the merits but also raised the issue of Jamison's guilty plea as a defense:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   11. In this case, the Defendant proceeded by way of a guilty plea. Even if the Cellmark evidence is reliable and admissible, its introduction into the guilty plea proceedings would not create a substantial possibility that Petitioner would not have been convicted based upon the overwhelming facts of guilt in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Judge Vicki Ballou-Watts of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County held a hearing on the motions in November of 2014 and during the next year, denied them. Jamison filed a timely notice of appeal under Section 8-201(k)(6)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in which he raised the following questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1. Did the Circuit Court err in holding that a petitioner under Section 8-201 must prove that it is \"more than ... 'likely' \" that he would have been convicted but for new DNA evidence?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   2. Did the Circuit Court abuse its discretion when it found that the underlying DNA testing conducted by Cellmark was not reliable?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   3. Did the Circuit Court abuse its discretion when it found that evidence of DNA that matched neither the victim nor the defendant in the criminal action was not \"favorable\" to that defendant and did not produce a \"substantial possibility\" of a different result in that action?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   4. Did the Circuit Court err when it rejected Dr. Perlin's probabilistic genotyping analysis of Appellant's expert as irrelevant and not generally accepted in the scientific community?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   5. Did the Circuit Court consider improper factors in determining whether a new trial was warranted \"in the interest of justice\" under Maryland Code of Criminal Procedure Section 8-201(i)(3) ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Before us, the State not only responds on the merits, but also asserts that Jamison cannot avail himself of a Petition for DNA testing because he entered a plea rather than going to trial. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Section 8-201 permits post-conviction petitions for DNA testing of \"scientific identification evidence,\" which is described in Section 8-201(a)(5) as evidence that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (i) is related to an investigation or prosecution that resulted in a judgment of conviction;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (ii) is in the actual or constructive possession of a law enforcement agency or agent of a law enforcement agency; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (iii) contains biological evidence from which DNA may be recovered that may produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence relevant to a claim of a convicted person of wrongful conviction or sentencing if subject to DNA testing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Section 8-201(d) articulates those findings that a court must make before ordering DNA testing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (d)\n   <em>\n    Findings requiring DNA testing\n   </em>\n   .-(1) Subject to subsection (e) of this section, a court shall order DNA testing if the court finds that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (i) a reasonable probability exists that the DNA testing has the scientific potential to produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence relevant to a claim of wrongful conviction or sentencing; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (ii) the requested DNA test employs a method of testing generally accepted within the relevant scientific community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   If the results of the DNA testing are unfavorable or favorable, Section 8-201(i) defines the consequences:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (i)\n   <em>\n    Disposition upon receipt of results.\n   </em>\n   -(1) If the results of the postconviction DNA testing are unfavorable to the petitioner, the court shall dismiss the petition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (2) If the results of the postconviction DNA testing are favorable to the petitioner, the court shall:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (i) if no postconviction proceeding has been previously initiated by the petitioner under \u00a7 7-102\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   of this\n   article, open a postconviction proceeding under \u00a7 7-102 of this article;\n   (ii) if a postconviction proceeding has been previously initiated by the petitioner under \u00a7 7-102 of this article, reopen a postconviction proceeding under \u00a7 7-104\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   of this article; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (iii) on a finding that a substantial possibility exists that the petitioner would not have been convicted if the DNA testing results had been known or introduced at trial, order a new trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (3) If the court finds that a substantial possibility does not exist under paragraph (2)(iii) of this subsection, the court may order a new trial if the court determines that the action is in the interest of justice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (4) If a new trial is granted, the court may order the release of the petitioner on bond or on conditions that the court finds will reasonably assure the presence of the petitioner at trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We acknowledge from the start that Section 8-201 is silent regarding whether a person who has pled guilty is permitted or prohibited from pursuing a post-conviction DNA test. Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia expressly permit those who have pled guilty to seek post-conviction DNA testing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and one state statute expressly prohibits those\n   who have pled guilty from accessing post-conviction DNA testing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The legislative history of\n   Section 8-201 suggests, however, that the Legislature did not intend for Section 8-201 to be available to those who have entered a guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Before we forage into the woods of legislative intent,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   however, we must explore whether Jamison's\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea can\n   be considered a guilty plea. We previously have concluded that an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea equates to a guilty plea. In\n   <em>\n    Bishop v.

Where there was no trial, it would be utter speculation to attempt to construct what the imaginary trial might have consisted of. We may not hypothesize a mythical trial. The statement of facts offered in support of the guilty plea is only minimalist. A State's Attorney's Office going before a jury would almost certainly opt for a more maximal case of guilt. We do not know, therefore,\n   what witnesses would have been called or what, under direct and cross-examination, they might have said. We do not know whether the appellant would or would not have testified and, if he did testify, how his testimony would have held up. We do not know what medical reports might have been submitted. There would be self-evidently no way to make the prescribed comparison. Newly discovered evidence simply cannot be measured in the case of a conviction based on a guilty plea. With what cast of characters, moreover, would we people our hypothetical testing? Do we ask whether the\n   hypothetical jury that might have rendered a guilty verdict after a hypothetical trial would probably have rendered a different verdict? Or do we ask, as in this case, whether Judge Levitz would still have accepted the guilty plea? These are very different questions. The criteria for rendering a trial verdict and the criteria for accepting a guilty plea are not remotely the same.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   In every newly discovered evidence case, including newly discovered DNA evidence or other newly discovered evidence of actual innocence, there is a universally recognized procedure for measuring the persuasive weight of such newly discovered evidence. That is the \"before and after\" test. We first look at the evidence of guilt before the jury at the trial that led to the conviction. We then look at the newly discovered evidence. The acid test is to ask whether, if that jury had had the benefit of the newly discovered evidence as well as the evidence that was before them, would there be \"a substantial or significant possibility that the result would have been different?\" There is no way that such a test can be applied, however, to a conviction based on a guilty plea rather than upon a trial. The minimalist statement of facts offered in factual support of a guilty plea is no equivalent of or substitute for an actual trial. It was never intended to be.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   Generally speaking, we have no firm idea what the proof of guilt might have been that the jury might have heard because there was no jury and there was no trial. Would the State have mounted an \"all out\" strong prosecution or simply have put on an adequate prosecution? That could make a big difference. The answer might, of course, depend not simply on the availability of the evidence but upon such other imponderables as the adequacy of the staffing of the State's Attorney's Office at a given moment, the depth of the State's Attorney's budget at a given moment, or upon how busy or unbusy the Office was with other cases on its agenda at a given moment. Might the State, in a case such as this, have mounted a full-scale effort and hired expert computer technicians to retrieve the text of the chatting\n   between Yonga and his victim? Such a text may not have been critical to the\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   of rape, which may have been interrupted in the nick of time by the victim's mother. It could have been both revealing and devastating, on the other hand, as to Yonga's\n   <em>\n    mens rea.\n   </em>\n   It is not unheard of, moreover, where the\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   is ambiguous enough that it could reasonably tilt in either direction, that a damning\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   could nudge an unsympathetic jury in a given direction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   At such a purely hypothetical trial, moreover, might Yonga have invoked his right to silence? Under the facts of this case, such silence could have been fatal, whatever the Fifth Amendment instruction might be about not using his silence against him. Or if Yonga had taken the stand, how might he have stood up against rigorous and sustained cross-examination? We cannot know any of this and that is why the newly discovered evidence cannot possibly be measured\n   against an unknown antecedent. Guilty pleas simply do not lend themselves to newly discovered evidence analysis. We would have no standard to measure the newly discovered evidence against.

The Circuit Court held that Mr. Jamison is not entitled to\n   relief under the post-conviction DNA testing statute, Maryland Code, Criminal Procedure Article (\"CP\"), \u00a7 8-201, because the results of the DNA testing were not favorable to him. The Majority opinion affirms the Circuit Court judgment without opining on the merits of that decision. It does so by holding that Mr. Jamison may not seek relief under the post-conviction DNA testing statute because his conviction resulted from an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Unlike the Majority opinion, I would not take this occasion to extend the holding of\n   <em>\n    Yonga\n   </em>\n   -which essentially disqualifies one who has entered a guilty plea from pursuing a writ of actual innocence-to a defendant convicted as a result of an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea. In an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea, the defendant maintains his or her innocence, but acknowledges that the State's evidence, if believed by the factfinder, would result in the defendant's conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    North Carolina v.
