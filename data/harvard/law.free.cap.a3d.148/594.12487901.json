On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court committed reversible error by (1) admitting into evidence a video recording of a forensic interview between a clinical social worker and the victim, (2) imposing an illegal sentence, and (3) admitting harmful uncharged misconduct evidence. We affirm the judgment of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The victim was born on October 24, 2000, and the defendant is his biological mother. The defendant met the victim's father, F, approximately one and one-half years before the victim was born. In 2005, the defendant gave birth to the victim's sister, B, whose father is also F. From 2000 to 2005, the defendant and F maintained an \"on again, off again\" relationship, but they did not live together, and they never married. In 2005, when the victim was five years old, he maintained a permanent residence with the defendant at her home in New Haven. The victim eventually began residing with F at his home in East Haven as well, but he still would\n   spend certain nights and days with the defendant at her New Haven home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During this time, on more than five occasions, the defendant pulled down the victim's pants and underpants, and touched the victim's penis with her hands or her mouth. The first time that one of these incidents happened was when the victim was between seven and eight years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On one such occasion, the victim and the defendant were in the defendant's bedroom. The victim was partially asleep, but he awoke when he felt and saw the defendant \"squishing\" his penis while she was on top of him. While this occurred, the victim kept one eye open, but he eventually opened both eyes so that the defendant could tell that he was awake. After realizing that the victim was awake, the defendant told the victim that she was checking his penis to see if it was healthy. On another such occasion, the defendant also touched the victim's penis with her mouth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On another one of\n   these occasions, the victim walked by the defendant's bedroom while she was naked in her bed. The door was open, and she told the victim to come inside. The victim refused to come into the room and he ran to the garage. The defendant then found the victim hiding in the garage. She hit him on his arm and forced him to go back into her bedroom and remove his clothing. The defendant then \"squished\" the victim's penis with her hands and put her mouth on it as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Also during this time period, while the victim was residing with the defendant at her New Haven home, the defendant, on at least two occasions, forced the victim to watch pornographic movies. The defendant also threatened the victim by telling him that she would hit him if he refused to watch the movies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On at least several other occasions during this time period, while the victim was seven years old, and on another occasion when the victim was eight years old, he and the defendant were alone in the living room at her New Haven home when the defendant forced the victim to touch her breasts for approximately five to ten minutes. The defendant also threatened the victim by telling him that if he refused to touch her breasts, she would \"hit him hard.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On at least several other occasions when the victim was eight years old, while the victim and B were sleeping in the defendant's bedroom, the victim awoke to find the defendant having sexual intercourse with her boyfriend, N, in the same bed in which the victim and B were sleeping. Also on this occasion, the defendant and N were watching a pornographic movie while they engaged in sexual intercourse. On another occasion, the victim found several pornographic videos and photographs on the defendant's computer. When the defendant discovered that he had found the materials, she told him that if he told anyone about his discovery,\n   she would harm F and kill the victim's stepmother, C. Furthermore, on another occasion, while the victim was in the car with the defendant and the victim's aunt, the victim overheard the defendant say that she was going to kill F and C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On another occasion, when the victim was eight or nine years old, the defendant forced the victim to take a shower with her. During this incident, the defendant\n   forced the victim to touch her breasts, and told him that if he refused, she would hit him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The victim eventually began living with F and C at F's home in East Haven. The victim's and B's visitations with the defendant at her home terminated in the summer of 2009, but they resumed at some point in late 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the commencement of these incidents, the victim began having nightmares, and F frequently observed that the victim was \"changed\" when he returned to F's home after visiting with the defendant. The victim also began misbehaving in school, particularly in the spring of 2010. Specifically, the victim stole items from others at school, and he fought with other students. On one such occasion during this time period, the victim stole an iPod from a teacher, and, after being apprehended, he subsequently was suspended from school and was placed in a disciplinary program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On one day in April, 2010, the victim came home from school crying. C asked the victim why he was crying and if he had misbehaved at school. In response, the victim told C that the defendant had touched his penis. C comforted the victim and called F, telling him that the victim needed to talk to him about something when he returned home from work. Later that night, F came home from work, and the victim told him that the defendant had touched his penis and threatened him on numerous occasions while he had been residing at her home in New Haven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Shortly after the victim told F about the defendant's actions toward the victim, F, on that same night, placed telephone calls to the police and the Department of Children and Families (department) to report the incidents that had occurred between the defendant and the victim. When F called the department on that night, however, there was no answer on the telephone, so, on the next day, F went to the Clifford Beers clinic (Clifford Beers) in New Haven and scheduled an appointment for the victim to see a psychologist there on the following day. On the date of the scheduled appointment, the victim went to Clifford Beers with F and C. During this visit, F and C gave permission for several professionals at Clifford Beers to interview and provide therapy to the victim in connection with the incidents that he had reported involving the defendant's actions toward him. Dr. Alyson Brodhagen, a clinical psychologist at Clifford Beers, diagnosed the victim with post-traumatic stress disorder. After this initial meeting, which occurred in April, 2010, the victim continued to participate in therapy consultations with professionals at Clifford Beers until the commencement of the defendant's trial in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 3, 2010, after having visited Clifford Beers, the victim met with Theresa A. Montelli, a licensed clinical social worker employed by Yale-New Haven Hospital as a forensic interviewer for the Yale Child Sexual Abuse Clinic (Yale clinic). During this interview, the victim discussed the incidents that had occurred between the defendant and himself. Specifically, during this interview, the victim pointed out on anatomical diagrams and dolls where the defendant had touched him, and he conveyed some of the details about these incidents to Montelli. This interview was recorded on video, and, while it was occurring, it was observed by a department employee, another forensic interviewer from the Yale clinic, and a New Haven Police Department detective, who observed the interview from a separate room on a closed circuit television screen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Several days later, on May 7, 2010, the victim met with Janet Murphy, a pediatric nurse practitioner at the Yale clinic, for a\n   medical evaluation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Murphy did not observe the forensic interview that Montelli conducted, she met with Montelli after the interview and learned about the victim's history, the circumstances surrounding his relationship with his family, and \"the relevant details\" for the medical evaluation. Additionally, before conducting the medical evaluation of the victim, Murphy met with C to obtain any further necessary health information about the victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Murphy then completed a full physical examination of the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In June, 2010, the victim also began meeting with Dr. Ragne Pajo Adams, a psychologist at Clifford Beers, for outpatient therapy sessions. At some point after August, 2010, the victim also saw a psychiatrist, Dr. Thomas Prakash, who diagnosed him with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, for which he also was treated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On the basis of the victim's disclosures made during his interview with, inter alia, the professionals working at the Yale clinic, as well as the victim's disclosures to the professionals working at Clifford Beers, Detective William White, Jr., of the New Haven Police Department prepared an arrest warrant for the defendant and she was arrested. The state charged the defendant with two counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2), and a third count of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After a trial in May, 2012,\n   the jury found the defendant guilty on all counts. The court,\n   <em>\n    B. Fischer, J\n   </em>\n   ., on October 2, 2013, sentenced the defendant, on each of the two counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2), to twelve years of imprisonment, execution suspended after the service of eight years, five years of which was a mandatory minimum sentence, followed by ten years of probation. On the third count of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1), the defendant was sentenced to a period of ten years imprisonment,\n   execution suspended after eight years, and five years probation. All sentences were to run concurrently. The total effective sentence was twelve years imprisonment, suspended after the service of eight years, with ten years probation. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We first address the defendant's claim that the court committed reversible error by admitting into evidence, under the medical diagnosis and treatment exception\n   to the hearsay rule, the video recording of the forensic interview between Montelli and the victim. The defendant argues that the state had not met its burden of showing that the essential purpose of the interview was to further the victim's medical treatment. The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. Prior to the commencement of the defendant's criminal trial, the state, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-86g and\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jarzbek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"501375\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/204/683/\">\n    204 Conn. 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=529%20A.2d%201245\">\n    529 A.2d 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"602177,602244,602214,600969,601962,599180,600335,599919,600975,599636,600822,601784,602299,601246,599167\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/1061/\">\n    484 U.S. 1061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20S.%20Ct.%201017\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1017\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20982\">\n    98 L.Ed.2d 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988), filed a motion seeking to elicit the victim's trial testimony outside of the presence of the defendant through the use of a video recording. After the court,\n   <em>\n    Fasano, J\n   </em>\n   ., held a hearing on October 26, 2011, it granted the state's motion in an oral decision issued on October 31, 2011, concluding that \"the state ha[d] established a compelling need for the [victim] to testify outside the presence of the defendant ... by clear and convincing evidence in that the [victim] would be so intimidated or otherwise inhibited by the ... physical presence of the defendant that the trustworthiness or reliability of the [victim's] testimony would be seriously called into question.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On March 2, 2012, pursuant to the court's ruling on the state's\n   <em>\n    Jarzbek\n   </em>\n   motion, the victim testified under oath at Southern Connecticut State University in front of the court,\n   <em>\n    B. Fischer, J\n   </em>\n   ., two state's attorneys, trial counsel for the defendant, two interpreters, the victim's guardian ad litem, a temporary assistant clerk, and a certified court reporter. In addition to being subject to direct examination by the prosecutor who tried the defendant's criminal case, the victim was subjected to cross-examination by the defendant's trial counsel. The victim's testimony was videotaped and reproduced in a video recording. During the hearing, the state questioned the victim about, inter alia, the forensic interview that he participated in at the Yale clinic with Montelli.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On May 4, 2012, after the conclusion of jury voir dire proceedings and outside the presence of all potential jurors, the state indicated its intent to introduce into evidence the video recording of the victim's forensic interview with Montelli. Defense counsel objected to the state's offer of the video recording of the forensic interview, arguing that it should not be admitted into evidence because (1) defense counsel was not present at the interview and the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the United States constitution accordingly would prohibit the introduction of such evidence, and (2) Montelli brought up the subject of the defendant's drinking habits during the interview, which defense counsel argued was highly prejudicial and of little probative value. In response, the state argued that \"it [was] the state's intention with respect to the contents contained in the video to establish that the questions and answers were for the purpose of mental treatment.\" The state also argued that its \"response to the video being used versus the witness [Montelli] simply testifying as to the questions and the answers, and the information elicited simply is that [the video is] the best evidence\n   that exists of what actually transpired.\" Furthermore, the state argued that the video recording of the forensic interview was the best evidence that existed because it was \"better than [Montelli] trying to articulate [the victim's] nonverbal response and what [Montelli observed, given that] she would be anticipated to testify that the video ... is a fair and accurate representation of what actually transpired.\" Finally, the state argued that the video recording of the forensic interview was relevant and was \"not prohibited hearsay by virtue of the fact that the information elicited was for the purpose of treatment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 7, 2012, the first day of the defendant's trial, the court, after allowing both sides to argue further on the issue and clarifying that the defendant's objection included a claim that the medical diagnosis and treatment exception did not permit either the video recording or Montelli's testimony to be admitted,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   ruled that the video recording of the forensic interview with Montelli and her testimony were both admissible. With respect to the video recording of the forensic interview, the court first referred to the text of \u00a7 8-3 (5) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, which provides in relevant part: \"The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness ... (5) A statement made for purposes of obtaining a medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof, insofar as reasonably pertinent to the medical diagnosis or treatment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Thereafter, the court stated in relevant part: \"And ... our case law has expanded it from doctors to other medical professionals, including social workers, who are acting in the chain of medical diagnosis. In the case of [\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"831934\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/260/1/\">\n    260 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20A.2d%20823\">\n    792 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) ] the victim was interviewed by a social worker at the hospital. The court held that ... the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule applies to statements made by a sexual assault victim to a social worker\n   who is acting within a chain of medical care as long as those statements are made for the purpose of obtaining medical diagnosis or treatment and are pertinent to the diagnosis or treatments.... So, I think ... [\u00a7 8-3 (5) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence ] applies and I will allow the forensic interview as evidence here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On the next day of trial, the state presented the testimony of Montelli on the witness stand, and during her testimony, the state offered the video recording of the forensic interview, which it then played in front of the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the court erred by admitting the video recording\n   of the forensic interview because it contained hearsay and it was not shown to have been carried out for the purpose of medical treatment. In opposition, the state argues that the court did not abuse its discretion by admitting into evidence the video recording of the forensic interview because the state presented sufficient evidence at trial that the primary purpose of the interview was for medical treatment, which allowed its admission under the medical diagnosis and treatment hearsay exception. Alternatively, the state argues that any error was harmless to the defendant. We agree with the state that the court did not abuse its discretion by admitting into evidence the video recording of the forensic interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We begin our analysis of this claim with the appropriate standard of review. \"To the extent [that] a trial court's admission of evidence is based on an interpretation of the Code of Evidence, our standard of review is plenary. For example, whether a challenged statement properly may be classified as hearsay and whether a hearsay exception properly is identified are legal questions demanding plenary review.... We review the trial court's decision to admit evidence, if premised on a correct view of the law, however, for an abuse of\n   discretion.... In other words, only after a trial court has made the legal determination that a particular statement is or is not hearsay, or is subject to a hearsay exception, is it vested with the discretion to admit or to bar the evidence based upon relevancy, prejudice, or other legally appropriate grounds related to the rule of evidence under which admission is being sought.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Griswold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20Conn.%20App.%20528\">\n    160 Conn.App. 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 536,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20A.3d%20189\">\n    127 A.3d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20907\">\n    320 Conn. 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.3d%20952\">\n    128 A.3d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At the outset of our analysis, we note that the defendant argues that the court, by admitting the video recording of the victim's forensic interview with Montelli, violated her sixth amendment right to confront witnesses against her pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p68\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 68-69,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p68\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p68\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004), because the statements made by the victim during that interview were testimonial in nature. With respect to this claim, which is distinct from her evidentiary claim related to the admissibility of the video recording, she relies on\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maguire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20535\">\n    310 Conn. 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20828\">\n    78 A.3d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), and contends that the court erred in admitting the video recording under the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule without first finding that the forensic interview was not testimonial in nature. The defendant argues that the interrogation conducted by Montelli was intended primarily to further the criminal investigation and preparation for her prosecution, and not to provide medical assistance to the victim. In so arguing, she relies on the principle that \"statements taken by government actors who are not members of law enforcement are testimonial if the interview is the functional equivalent of police interrogation with the primary purpose of establishing or proving past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Arroyo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3956601\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/284/597/#p629\">\n    284 Conn. 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 629,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=935%20A.2d%20975\">\n    935 A.2d 975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The state argues that because the victim was available and was subject to cross-examination at trial, there was no constitutional violation. Moreover, the state claims the defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Maguire\n   </em>\n   is misplaced because that case involved similar evidence admitted under the tender years exception to the hearsay rule, rather than the medical treatment exception. Finally, the state asserts that any error was harmless because the statements made during the forensic interview were cumulative\n   of other properly admitted and unchallenged evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Recently, in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Griswold\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20Conn.%20App.%20528\">\n    160 Conn.

The defendant in that case argued that if the video recordings and summaries were not admissible under the tender years exception as a result of the holding in\n   <em>\n    Maguire\n   </em>\n   , then they likewise were inadmissible under the medical diagnosis and treatment exception. We began our analysis in\n   <em>\n    Griswold\n   </em>\n   by first clarifying the important point that, because the victims appeared at trial and were subject to cross-examination by the defendant,\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   and its progeny did not directly apply.

Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-3 (5). Neither this language, nor any common-law principle that we are aware of, mandates that statements offered under the exception be nontestimonial.

Section 8-3 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, titled \"Hearsay Exceptions: Availability of Declarant Immaterial,\" provides that twelve types of statements \"are not excluded by\n   the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness.\" The fifth subsection of this section, titled \"Statement for purposes of obtaining medical diagnosis or treatment,\" provides that the following type of statement is not inadmissible under the hearsay rule: \"A statement made for purposes of obtaining a medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof, insofar as reasonably pertinent to the medical diagnosis or treatment.\" Conn.

Furthermore, given that the medical diagnosis and treatment exception does not require that the primary purpose of the forensic interview and the statements made by the victim therein be for medical treatment, we are satisfied that the victim's statements fell within the exception despite the facts that a police officer and a department social worker were observing the interview, it was recorded, and Montelli's questions largely focused on determining what had happened to the victim in his encounters with the defendant. We also note that the involvement of a police officer in the interview does not automatically preclude a statement from falling within the medical diagnosis and treatment exception.

After the victim revealed the details of his encounters with the defendant to F and C, the victim, as a result of those encounters, received a medical diagnosis and began receiving treatment at Clifford Beers in April, 2010. Dr. Adams, a psychologist who treated the victim at Clifford Beers in 2010, testified that Clifford Beers is a \"community mental health center,\" and that when F and C took the victim to Clifford Beers for the first time after he\n   disclosed the details of the defendant's actions to them, as part of the intake process, the victim was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after he was examined by Dr. Brodhagen, who is also a psychologist. From April, 2010, to approximately October, 2011, the victim continued visiting Dr. Adams for therapy sessions in order to treat this disorder. The forensic interview between the victim and Montelli took place on May 3, 2010, which was during the time period during which Dr. Adams and other professionals at Clifford Beers were treating the victim for post-traumatic stress disorder. On May 7, 2010, which was several days after the victim participated in the forensic interview with Montelli, he also visited Murphy for a medical evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Although Murphy testified that she did not observe the video recording of the forensic interview between the victim and Montelli prior to her conducting a medical evaluation of him, she testified that she met with Montelli and discussed the relevant details of the victim's situation as they related to his encounters with the defendant. Murphy also testified that she met with C to obtain any additional necessary information pertaining to the victim's medical history prior to her conducting a medical evaluation of him. Furthermore, Murphy testified that at the commencement of her medical evaluation, she told the victim, as she normally does, that she works with Montelli and that she wanted to make sure that the victim understood that he knew that she was checking his body to make sure that he was in good physical health as a result of his previous encounters with the defendant. Murphy also testified that, as a standard operating procedure, she works closely with social workers, like Montelli, who conduct forensic interviews of victims so that she has all necessary information about the victims' medical histories and the nature of the abuse that they allegedly have\n   experienced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, Murphy testified\n   that, at the time that she conducted the medical evaluation of the victim, she was aware that Montelli had given the victim therapy referrals, and she was further aware that he had begun receiving mental health treatment at Clifford Beers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the victim's statements made during the forensic interview with Montelli were reasonably pertinent to his receiving medical treatment. Although the victim\n   already had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder by Clifford Beers professionals in April, 2010, his treatment for this disorder did not conclude, at the earliest, until the commencement of the defendant's criminal trial. Furthermore, as Murphy testified, she met with Montelli to discuss the forensic interview to obtain the history and other relevant details prior to conducting the physical examination of the victim. Thus, the physical examination of the victim was informed by the forensic interview. The evidence showed that both Montelli and Murphy were aware that other medical and mental health professionals were treating the victim and that part of Montelli's purpose in this regard was to elicit information to pass on to these professionals, including Murphy, so that proper treatment could be rendered. Specifically, as Murphy testified, professionals at the Yale clinic worked to ensure that the victim was receiving proper treatment from those other professionals, particularly those working at Clifford Beers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the court properly determined that the victim's statements made during the forensic interview with Montelli fell within the medical diagnosis and treatment exception to the hearsay rule, and that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the video recording of the forensic interview into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Next, we address the defendant's claim that the court committed reversible error in imposing an illegal sentence by sentencing the defendant to a mandatory minimum sentence of five years imprisonment on each of the two counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2). With respect to this claim, the defendant first argues that the court erred because the information in which the defendant was charged alleged that\n   the offenses occurred on divers dates between 2006 and 2010, and the mandatory minimum sentencing scheme pertained only to offenses committed after July, 2007. The defendant argues that jury interrogatories should have been submitted to the jury to establish whether it found the defendant guilty\n   on the basis of acts prior to July 1, 2007. Second, the defendant argues that the court erred by imposing an illegal sentence because, in the absence of a jury determination that the offenses occurred when the victim was under thirteen years old, the court did not have the authority to sentence the defendant to a mandatory minimum of five years of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In opposition, the state argues that the court did not impose an illegal sentence because the evidence adduced at trial established that all of the offenses occurred after the July 1, 2007 effective date for the mandatory minimum sentencing scheme. In response to the defendant's second argument, the state argues that it is not reviewable because it was inadequately briefed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the state that the court did not err in imposing a five year mandatory minimum sentence on each count of risk of injury to a child under \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2) because the evidence adduced at trial proved that the offenses committed by the defendant in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2) occurred after July, 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We begin our analysis of this claim with the appropriate standard of review. Our rules of practice provide that \"[t]he judicial authority may at any time correct an illegal sentence or other illegal disposition, or it may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner or any other disposition made in an illegal manner.\" Practice Book \u00a7 43-22.

It is an undisputed fact that the victim was born on October 24, 2000. The victim's testimony demonstrated that all of the defendant's abusive actions toward him occurred while he was seven years old or older, or on or after October 24, 2007. Specifically, the victim testified at trial that the first time that\n   the defendant abused him by touching his penis occurred when he was between seven and eight years old. The victim then testified that the defendant abused him by touching his penis about five or more times after that. The victim testified that the incident where he witnessed the defendant and N having sexual intercourse with each other while he and B were trying to sleep on the defendant's bed occurred when\n   he was between eight and nine years old. He also testified that he was \"eight to nine\" years old on the first occasion where the defendant forced him to touch her breasts. Furthermore, the victim testified that he was between eight and eight and one-half years old when the defendant abused him in the shower. C testified that the victim first disclosed the nature of the defendant's abusive acts toward him in April, 2010. The victim testified that when he first disclosed the nature of the defendant's abusive acts toward him to C, which would have been in April, 2010, he had experienced these acts for \"about two years\" prior to the date of this disclosure. Finally, the court, at the sentencing hearing, despite stating that the defendant had sexual contact with the intimate parts of the victim on numerous occasions approximately from 2006 to 2009, stated twice that the victim was seven, eight, or nine years old when the offenses occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We conclude that the court did not impose an illegal sentence by imposing the five year mandatory minimum sentence for the judgment of conviction against the defendant with respect to each of her violations of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2) because the evidence adduced at trial adequately proved that the defendant committed all of the offensive acts after July 1, 2007. We reach this conclusion because the testimony elicited at trial established that the earliest occasions on which the victim experienced abusive conduct at the hands of the defendant occurred after October 24, 2007, when he was seven years old. Although the information charged that the defendant committed the offenses \"on divers dates between and including September, 2006, and March, 2010,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   we note that informations are not evidence.

We conclude that this argument has no merit because any alleged error in this regard is harmless under the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The following additional procedural history is relevant to this argument. In the court's jury instructions, it instructed, inter alia, that the fourth element of the\n   crime of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1) and (2) required the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time of the incident, the minor was under sixteen years of age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In light of the fact that the sentencing portion of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2) provides that the five year mandatory minimum sentence\n   applies when the victim is under the age of thirteen years at the time of the commission of the crime, the defendant argues that the jury also should have been instructed to make this specific finding with respect to the offenses charged under \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2), instead of being instructed to find that the victim was under the age of sixteen years at the time of the commission of those crimes. The defendant's argument is premised on two holdings of the United States Supreme Court,\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), and\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Jersey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    530 U.S. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). In\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held, inter alia, that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Jersey\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 490,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Alleyene\n   </em>\n   , the court reaffirmed its\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   holding and clarified that \"[a]ny fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an 'element' that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Alleyene\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 2155. Thus, the defendant argues, given that the sentencing portion of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2) enhances punishment for the offense by imposing a mandatory minimum five year sentence when the victim is under thirteen years of age, this fact should have been found beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We agree with the state inasmuch as it argues that any error in this regard is harmless.

It is undisputed that the victim was born on October 24, 2000. Given that the defendant's trial occurred on several days in May, 2012, when the victim was eleven years old, we conclude that the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that all of the instances of the defendant's offensive conduct against the victim occurred while the victim was under thirteen years of age. As a result, we reject the defendant's argument and conclude that any alleged error of the court in not instructing the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim was under thirteen years of age when the defendant violated \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2) was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, we address the defendant's claim that the court committed reversible error by admitting unduly prejudicial uncharged misconduct evidence against the defendant.

The state argued that this evidence was relevant because it was \"a matter of impeachment\" for the victim, given that he had testified that he occasionally tells lies and steals. The court did not rule on the issue on that date, but the videotaped testimony of the victim, in which he testified that he lies and steals at times, subsequently was played before the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   On May 8, 2012, the defendant filed a written objection to the state's notice of intent and an accompanying memorandum of law, in which she objected to the state's introduction of the uncharged misconduct evidence on the grounds that its probative value was outweighed by its unfairly prejudicial effect, and that it subjected her to unfair surprise. On this same date, the court ruled that the evidence presented through M's testimony was admissible, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \"There was filed yesterday by motions ... a notice of intent to introduce evidence. This is the state's motion of other crimes, wrongs or acts, specifically to allege relevant facts. The first one is, quote, the defendant is alleged to have requested that the [victim] steal money from [F] to bring to the defendant, who, thereafter, indicated she would purchase him things with it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \"The court has already and the jury has already heard [that the victim] has admitted under oath to stealing. The court would allow the defendant to make comments, and the defendant's statements are admissible. Relevant statements are admissible.

The victim was the state's key witness at trial and, in essence, the state's case hinged on the victim's credibility. Given that during direct and cross-examination, the victim testified that he lied and stole at times, his credibility was called into question. \"Issues of credibility typically are determinative in child sexual abuse prosecutions.

This uncharged misconduct evidence did not tend to arouse the emotions of the jury, especially in light of the nature of the crimes with which the defendant had been charged, crimes that\n   involved her sexual abuse of her son. The prejudicial tendency of this uncharged misconduct evidence also pales in comparison to evidence that was adduced at trial showing that the defendant had threatened to kill F and C. Thus, we conclude that the jury's emotions were not unduly aroused by the admission of evidence that she encouraged her son, the victim, to steal. The evidence also did not create a distracting side issue because it pertained to the credibility of the state's key witness, which was the essence\n   of the state's case. Furthermore, the evidence and counterproof of it was not consumed by an inordinate amount of time, but rather was resolved quite summarily at the beginning of two days of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Last, we are not persuaded by the defendant's argument that she was unfairly surprised by the evidence. On May 7, 2010, at the request of defense counsel, the court afforded defense counsel an opportunity to meet with M prior to her testimony on the afternoon of May 8, 2010. The record suggests that this meeting between M and defense counsel occurred and that no further objection that was based on the lack of timely notice was raised by the defendant.

So, the initial meeting is with the social worker and the person who is doing the medical evaluation with the accompanying guardian to the child to get a history about the family history and about the concern of why the child is there. After that history is obtained, the forensic interviewer will then meet with the child to do the forensic interview that is observed by myself. I do most of the medical evaluations, so, by myself or whoever is doing the medical by police and [the department]. Then, after the interview is completed is when the child typically is offered a medical evaluation. Sometimes if a medical person isn't available, we don't always do the medical on the same day. Occasionally, it's done on a different day, and then the social worker ... meets with whoever the child is scheduled with to fill them in on the details of the forensic interview and the history....\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n    \"[A]ll children are offered a medical evaluation, and there are several reasons for that. Many of the children who have talked about different things that have happened to them, whether a medical evaluation is indicated or not, sometimes they have worries about their body that they're going to share in the medical evaluation that they may not have shared within the forensic interview or with whoever else they might meet. The other reason is that there's a kind of a process to telling; some kids only tell partial information initially, and sometimes the things they may not have talked about, which may be the more embarrassing things, would necessitate a medical. So, just kind of sitting down and talking with a child about what we want to check, making sure they are okay and learning about what their understandings of things are, what they might be worried about. They may have inaccurate information about some health issue that might be related to whatever happened to them.

After the defendant was found guilty, the court sentenced him pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a, which provided, inter alia, that any felony committed on or after July 1, 1981, would require that a definite sentence be imposed for a judgment of conviction for such felony.

On appeal, the defendant argued that his sentence was illegal because the state had charged that he had committed offenses both prior to and after July 1, 1981, and, as a result, the court should have sentenced him pursuant to \u00a7 53a-35, which required, inter alia, that any sentence imposed for a judgment of conviction for a felony committed prior to July 1, 1981, would be an indeterminate sentence.

Furthermore, this court stated in relevant part that \"where a sentencing statute which is applicable to a continuing offense is amended during the course of the commission of that offense, and where the offense is not completed until after the effective date of the amended statute, the defendant is subject to the penalties provided by that amended statute. ... General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 defines a crime which, depending on the facts of the case, may be a continuing offense or may be an offense which is completed upon the happening of a single event. This information was treated by the court and the parties as a continuing offense, beginning in 1980 and not ending until 1984. The court therefore was entitled to sentence the defendant, pursuant to \u00a7 53a-35a, for the continuing offense....\" (Citations omitted.)

In the present case, we similarly conclude that the court did not err by imposing a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2), as amended in July, 2007, because the evidence adduced at trial established that the offenses committed by the defendant, at the very least, were not completed until after July, 2007.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    Although the defendant objected to M's testimony on hearsay grounds, the court properly ruled that the defendant's statement was admissible as an admission of a party.

Therefore, the court was permitted to admit the uncharged misconduct evidence at issue in the present appeal to the extent that it bore on the victim's credibility, which the court determined to be a material issue in the state's case. Furthermore, we note that \"[t]he state is allowed to rehabilitate a witness whose credibility has been impeached ... by allowing that witness to explain the circumstances underlying the [the incident that was used to impeach] ... and may rebut such evidence\n    <em>\n     by other evidence\n    </em>\n    .\" (Citation omitted; emphasis added.)\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Sauris\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"710444\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/227/389/#p412\">\n     227 Conn. 389\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 412,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=631%20A.2d%20238\">\n     631 A.2d 238\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1993), overruled in part on other grounds by\n    <em>\n     Label Systems Corp\n    </em>\n    . v.\n    <em>\n     Aghamohammadi\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5303807\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/270/291/#p309\">\n     270 Conn. 291\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 309,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=852%20A.2d%20703\">\n     852 A.2d 703\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2004). Such other evidence may also include the testimony of a witness such as M who is called to testify about the circumstances surrounding an event which opposing counsel used to cast doubt on the credibility of another witness.
