(association), and certain individual members of its board of directors, Andrew Hames, Frank Meolli, Michael Gagliardi, Michelle Augliera, and Raymond Vermette (individually named defendants), on the basis that all of the plaintiff's claims arising from the deprivation of the use of a particular garage were time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff argues that the court erred in rendering summary judgment in favor of the defendants, because, inter alia: (1) the trial court applied the wrong statute of limitations to count one of his complaint, which sought to enforce the condominium instruments; and (2) genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the applicable statutes of limitations were tolled by virtue of the continuing course of conduct doctrine. We affirm the judgment of the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Evidence concerning the following facts and procedural history appears in the record. Shell Beach Condominium (condominium) is a condominium complex located in East Haven and organized pursuant to the\n   Condominium Act of 1976 (Condominium Act), General Statutes \u00a7 47-68a et seq. It is comprised of forty-seven residential units and fifty-two garages,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and includes a number of open-air parking spaces. The association is a nonstock corporation, owned by the unit owners of the condominium; membership in the association occurs immediately upon acquisition of title in a unit. The affairs of the condominium are conducted by a board of directors (board), all of whom are unit owners.\n   See General Statutes \u00a7 47-80 (c) (1) (bylaws required to contain, inter alia, \"[t]he election from among the unit owners of a board of directors\"). Each of the individually named defendants was a member of the board when the plaintiff commenced this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 1999, the plaintiff became a unit owner in the condominium when he purchased his individual unit from Salvatore Amendola, who was assisted in the sale by his daughter, Rosalie Porrello. The warranty deed, dated May 26, 1999, and recorded May 27, 1999, purported to convey unit 14 and garage 49.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   During this transaction, the plaintiff was informed that garage 49 was the garage that would be conveyed with unit 14. Neither Amendola nor Porrello, however, discussed with the plaintiff any use of or ownership in garage 14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, although Amendola was a member of the board at the time of the transaction, he was selling a unit that he personally owned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Apart from his conversations with Amendola, the plaintiff did not speak with any member on the board at the time of the conveyance, nor did he speak with any of the individually named defendants, at or before the time of the closing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff did not receive the condominium declaration prior to or during the closing; instead, the association mailed it to him at some point thereafter. Although\n   the plaintiff received a copy of the declaration in 1999, he admittedly did not review that document until 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In January, 2009, the plaintiff received a tax assessment that he believed to be substantially higher than prior assessments. He contacted the assessor, and was informed that he was being assessed for both garage 14 and garage 49. After this conversation, the plaintiff examined the\n   condominium instruments\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and came to believe that he was entitled to the exclusive use of garage 14, not garage 49.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff contacted the board and demanded that it, on behalf of the association, take action to provide him with use of garage 14 pursuant to the applicable statutory authority and provisions of the condominium instruments. After the board denied the plaintiff's request, the plaintiff commenced this action by summons and a seven count complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   on each of the defendants in July, 2009, in which he alleged, inter alia, that the defendants had deprived him of the use of garage 14 in violation of the condominium instruments and the Condominium Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on January 23, 2012, in which they claimed, inter alia, that the statutes of limitations had run on all seven\n   counts of the plaintiff's complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the court allowed additional time for the parties to conduct discovery, and the parties had filed additional briefs, the court heard argument on October 20, 2014. In a memorandum of decision dated February 9, 2015, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment as to all counts, making several determinations relevant to this appeal. First, it determined that, pursuant to the declaration, garages are limited common elements of the condominium,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   rather than units\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   as the\n   defendants\n   had contended. Second, it also determined that the declaration did not require that particular garages or parking areas be assigned to any particular units, and the defendants therefore had no ongoing duty to ensure that the plaintiff, as title owner of unit 14, be assigned garage 14. Having already concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact concerning whether the applicable statute of limitations as to each count had run, the court accordingly rendered judgment for the defendants on all counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff filed a motion for reargument and/or reconsideration, which the court denied. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiff argues that the court erred in rendering summary judgment on the first count of his complaint,\n   in which he claimed that the defendants, by their conduct, had violated General Statutes \u00a7 47-75 (a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   because it improperly relied upon\n   the wrong limitations period in ruling on the timeliness of that claim. In this respect, the plaintiff makes two separate and distinct claims. First, he argues that the court erred in determining that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   statute of limitations applies to count one because a claim under \u00a7 47-75 is equitable in nature. Second, he argues that, even if the court properly determined that the claim pleaded in his first count is subject to a statute of limitations, the court erred in determining that the applicable limitations period is the three year limitations period for tort actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The determination of which statute of limitations applies to a given action is a question of law over which our review is plenary.

We address each of the plaintiff's claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   With respect to his first claim, the plaintiff argues that the court improperly determined that count one is subject to any statute of limitations because an action pursuant to \u00a7 47-75 is equitable, and equitable proceedings are not subject to statutes of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The following facts are relevant to the resolution of this claim. In the first count of the complaint, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants, pursuant to both \u00a7 47-75 and article 15 of the declaration,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   are required to comply with and enforce the condominium instruments and the Condominium Act. Pursuant to the declaration, the plaintiff alleges that garages are limited common elements, and that he, as the title owner of unit 14, is entitled to an exclusive easement in garage 14. He further alleges that the declaration forbids any attempt to convey or mortgage the title to a unit without conveying all appurtenant interests or any attempt to sell or transfer an appurtenant interest except as part of the unit to which it is attached, and that the defendants, \"in violation of the condominium instruments and the Condominium Act,\" have \"wilfully allowed and/or permitted and/or caused\" the interest in garage 14 to be severed from unit 14 and unit 14 to be sold to the plaintiff\n   without the exclusive use of garage 14, and have \"wilfully allowed and/or caused and/or permitted and/or continue to permit\" another\n   unit owner to use garage 14. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Further, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants have failed to correct this situation, despite demands by the plaintiff that they \"comply with and enforce the condominium instruments, the Condominium Act ... and the easement in favor of the plaintiff for the exclusive use of\" the garage. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) As a result of the defendants' actions, the plaintiff alleges a number of injuries, including that he has been denied the use of garage 14 and has suffered financial harm because, inter alia, he has been assessed for and has paid taxes on that garage, paid for electricity for that garage, and the fair market value of his property has been substantially reduced. Counts two through seven of his complaint rely on most of the same operative facts as count one. In his prayer for relief, he seeks, inter alia, various forms of injunctive relief pursuant to \u00a7 47-75 and compensatory damages, but does not attempt to allocate any particular relief to any particular count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Our case law draws a distinction where statutes of limitations are concerned between purely equitable proceedings and actions where a party can seek both legal and equitable relief. \"[I]n an equitable proceeding, a court may provide a remedy even though the governing statute of limitations has expired, just as it has discretion to dismiss for laches an action initiated within the period of the statute.... Although courts in equitable proceedings often look by analogy to the statute of limitations to determine whether, in the interests of justice, a particular action should be heard, they are by no means obliged to adhere to those time limitations.\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Dunham\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dunham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"501648\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/204/303/#p326\">\n    204 Conn. 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 326-27,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=528%20A.2d%201123\">\n    528 A.2d 1123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987), overruled in part on\n   other grounds by\n   <em>\n    Santopietro\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Haven\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"300316\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/239/207/\">\n    239 Conn. 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 213 n.8, 221,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=682%20A.2d%20106\">\n    682 A.2d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The situation is different, however, where a party asserts a cause of action, pursuant to which it rightfully could seek both legal and equitable relief. \"[W]here a party seeks equitable relief pursuant to a cause of action that would also allow that party to seek legal relief, concurrent legal and equitable jurisdiction exists, and the statute of limitations that would be applicable to bar the legal claim also applies to bar the equitable claim.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Gager\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sanger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661483\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/95/632/#p641\">\n    95 Conn.App. 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 641-42,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=897%20A.2d%20704\">\n    897 A.2d 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5730561,5730709,5729598\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/280/905/\">\n    280 Conn. 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=907%20A.2d%2090\">\n    907 A.2d 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006).

Further, the plaintiff has pleaded the same essential facts in each of the counts on which he bases his claims for legal and equitable relief. See\n   <em>\n    Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cooperman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3965425\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/289/383/#p411\">\n    289 Conn. 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 411,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=957%20A.2d%20836\">\n    957 A.2d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) (affirming trial court's determination that, where legal claims for statutory theft and conversion were time barred, \"the plaintiffs' equitable claims\n   <em>\n    based on the same facts\n   </em>\n   also [were] time barred\" [emphasis added] ). Under these circumstances, the court has concurrent equitable and legal jurisdiction, and the running of the applicable limitation period\n   would bar both the plaintiff's legal\n   and equitable claims brought pursuant to \u00a7 47-75.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The plaintiff next argues that, even if the court properly determined that count one alleging a violation of \u00a7 47-75 is subject to a statute of limitations, it improperly determined that count one was subject to the three year limitations period set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-577,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   which governs torts generally. Noting \"the unique nature of condominiums,\" he asserts that the Condominium Act is concerned with property rights and that the declaration provides that both the relevant statutory provisions and the condominium instruments are covenants that run with the land.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Arguing that\n   the appropriate limitations period therefore must be grounded in property law and asserting that his claims are similar to adverse possession claims, the plaintiff contends that the only potentially applicable limitations period is the fifteen year period prescribed for such an action by General Statutes \u00a7 52-575 (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The individually named defendants and the association disagree with the plaintiff and with each other as to which statute of limitations applies to claims brought pursuant to \u00a7 47-75. The individually named defendants assert that, because the plaintiff repeatedly contends that the defendants violated the Condominium Act, count one asserts a claim for a statutory violation and, thus, is subject to \u00a7 52-577. In contrast, the association claims that the plaintiff's first cause of action asserts\n   a violation of the defendants' duties pursuant to the declaration and, therefore, is governed by General Statutes \u00a7 52-576 (a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   or, if interpreted as asserting a violation of the Condominium Act, by \u00a7 52-577. We conclude that either \u00a7 52-576 or \u00a7 52-577 would apply to bar this cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"[W]hen a statute includes no express statute of limitations, we should not simply assume that there is no limitation period.

In the plaintiff's analogy, he is the rightful owner or possessor of garage 14 by virtue of the condominium instruments; therefore, if the analogy were to hold, he would be suing the defendants as the adverse possessors of the property. He does not allege or present any evidence, however, that the association or the individually named defendants, in their roles as directors of the board of the condominium, are in actual possession, or have been in possession, of garage 14 since the allegedly impermissible severance of that interest from unit 14, and no evidence in the record supports such a finding. Nor does he allege in his complaint or present any evidence showing that the current owner and user of garage 14, who has never been made a party to this action, is using it pursuant to the type of agreement or relationship with the defendants from which it could be inferred that the defendants, through that occupant, have been making the type of adverse and hostile use of the property in derogation of the plaintiff's interest that would constitute adverse possession.

Instead, the plaintiff's entire theory of recovery against the defendants rests on the assertion that they breached their statutory and contractual duties to him by causing or failing to prevent the severance of garage 14 from unit 14 and by failing thereafter to take any action to\n   return possession of the garage to him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Actions that assert a breach of a duty sound in contract or tort, depending on the source of the duty alleged.

The analysis employed by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Bellemare\n   </em>\n   could support the application in this case of either the general tort or written contract statute of limitations. Determining that an action seeking damages for violation of General Statutes \u00a7 49-8, the mortgage release statute, sounded in tort, our Supreme Court noted that, despite the presence of a contract, the duty contemplated arose entirely by statute and would exist even without any specific terms in a mortgage contract.

Further, we also note that there is evidence that the deed purporting to convey garage 14 separately from unit 14 was executed in 1986 by the developer; see footnotes 23 and 25 of this opinion; and no evidence has been submitted that the garage and unit, if they were originally required by the declaration to be conjoined, ever\n   <em>\n    have\n   </em>\n   been conjoined in the same owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In summary, the plaintiff has not raised a genuine issue of material fact in this case that requires or justifies application of the continuous course of conduct\n   doctrine,\n   and we therefore decline the plaintiff's invitation to apply it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Because we affirm the judgment on the basis that the plaintiff's claims are time barred, we do not consider the plaintiff's arguments that the court improperly determined that other grounds existed for granting the motion for summary judgment as to his claims of trespass and unfair trade practices in violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Although a point of contention in the trial court, we do not need to determine conclusively whether the court properly determined that, pursuant to the terms of the condominium declaration, garages are limited common elements and not separate units.

It is uncontested that the condominium in question was created prior to January 1, 1984, and, therefore, generally is governed by the terms of the Condominium Act and not the Common Interest Ownership Act, General Statutes \u00a7 47-200 et seq. (Common Interest Ownership Act). See General Statutes \u00a7 47-214. Despite this uncontested fact, certain defined provisions of the Common Interest Ownership Act are applicable to preexisting common interest communities. See General Statutes \u00a7 47-216.

Such action may be brought by the association of unit owners against any unit owner or owners or, in any proper case, by one or more aggrieved unit owners on their own behalf or as a class action. If any such action results in a final judgment or decree in favor of the party instituting such action, such judgment or decree may incorporate a provision for reasonable attorney's fees, as specified in such judgment or decree, to be paid by the party against whom such judgment or decree is entered.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    To support his claim that a claim brought pursuant to \u00a7 47-75 is equitable in nature, the plaintiff urges us to take cognizance of the \"unique amalgamation of property, contract, and tort law\" at work in the Condominium Act. Thus, he asserts that an action to enforce the condominium instruments and the Condominium Act is akin to an action to enforce a restrictive covenant, which may be enforced by an injunction, and relies upon both the nature of the relief that he seeks as well as the equivalent provision in the Common Interest Ownership Act to show that a \u00a7 47-75 action is equitable. See General Statutes \u00a7 47-278 (a) (\"A declarant, association, unit owner or any other person subject to this chapter may bring an action to enforce a right granted or obligation imposed by this chapter, the declaration or the bylaws.

Further, various provisions of the Restatement (Third) of Property similarly suggest that the association and the board, although owing duties to unit owners in the exercise of their authority, are not required to take action in all cases. See 2 Restatement (Third), Property, Servitudes \u00a7 6.13 (1), p. 233 (2000) (\"[i]n addition to duties imposed by statute and the governing documents, the association has the following duties to the members of the common-interest community ...\n    <em>\n     to act reasonably in the exercise of its discretionary powers including ... enforcement\n    </em>\n    \" [emphasis added] ); see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=904%20A.2d%20188\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n    \u00a7 6.14, p. 268 (\"[t]he directors and officers of an association have a duty to act in good faith, to act in compliance with the law and the governing documents, to deal fairly with the association and its members, and to use ordinary care and prudence in performing their functions\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Finally, certain provisions of the Common Interest Ownership Act clarify which actions by an association are mandatory and which are discretionary, and support a clear inference that enforcement, on the whole, is generally subject to the association's and the directors' discretion. See General Statutes \u00a7 47-244 (a) ; see also Public Acts 2009, No. 09-225, \u00a7 20 (clarifications making more explicit which duties are discretionary and which are mandatory in \u00a7 47-244 [a], applicable as of date of passage, July 8, 2009). Other provisions provide that the board of directors is not required to take any enforcement action if it determines that one of four specified circumstances is met; General Statutes \u00a7 47-244 (g) ; and allows the board to choose to take an enforcement action in one case, but not another, as long as the choice is not arbitrary or capricious. General Statutes \u00a7 47-244 (h). These latter provisions, which would generally be applicable to condominiums that were created before 1984; see General Statutes \u00a7 47-216 (a) ; are technically inapplicable in this case, as they became effective after this case had commenced. See Public Acts 2009, No. 09-225, \u00a7 21 (added subsections [g] and [h] to \u00a7 47-244, effective July 1, 2010). Nevertheless, their existence provides further support for our position, in that they demonstrate legislative affirmance of preexisting common law principles.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"34\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    For instance, General Statutes \u00a7 47-84 (a) provides in relevant part that \"damage to or destruction of any building or improvement located on the condominium parcel or serving the condominium shall be promptly repaired and restored by ... the association, using the proceeds of insurance, if any, on such building or improvement for that purpose ....\" See also General Statutes \u00a7 47-71 (h) and (\n    <em>\n     i\n    </em>\n    ) (requiring association to record specified information on annual basis).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"35\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Article 25 (e) of the declaration requires the association to provide its books and records to a first mortgagee when the request is received reasonably in advance of the examination and in writing.

Prior to an amendment in 1987 that removed the article from the declaration, article 27 required that the association maintain a separate budget for the operation, care, and upkeep of the swimming pool, tennis court, and community building that would have been built on a separate tract.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"36\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Section 4 (i) of the bylaws requires that the board must elect certain officers at the annual organization meeting of each new board.
