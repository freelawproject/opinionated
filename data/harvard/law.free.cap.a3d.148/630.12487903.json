On appeal, the defendant claims that the court erred in dismissing his motion, in which he alleged that his criminal trial attorney had provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to advise him properly regarding the immigration consequences of entering guilty pleas to two separate counts of larceny in the sixth degree in violation of\n   General Statutes \u00a7 53a-125b. We conclude that the court properly dismissed the defendant's motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case is controlled by\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Casiano\n   </em>\n   , we explained: \"In order for the court to have jurisdiction over a motion to correct an illegal sentence after the sentence has been executed, the sentencing proceeding, and not the [proceedings] leading to the conviction, must be the subject of the attack. ... The defendant's claim does not attack the validity of the sentence. Instead, it pertains to ... alleged flaws in the court's acceptance of the plea. As such, it does not fit within any of the four categories of claims recognized under Practice Book \u00a7 43-22.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20A.3d%20491\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, the court properly dismissed the defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence because the defendant sought to attack the validity of his guilty pleas, via a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, rather than attacking the legality of\n   the sentencing proceeding or the sentence itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
