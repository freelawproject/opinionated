We hold that it does not. Our holding is at odds with the Court of Appeals decision in\n   <em>\n    Bowman v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2033010\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/314/725/\">\n    314 Md. 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2033010\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/314/725/\">\n    552 A.2d 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989). As we shall explain, the holding in\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   was based solely on an analysis of federal constitutional double jeopardy law that the United States Supreme Court has since rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George's County convicted Theodore Scott, the appellant, of attempted robbery with a deadly weapon, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and conspiracy to commit robbery with a deadly weapon. Scott committed the crimes on December 24, 2011, at a convenience store in Mt. Rainier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For Scott's attempted armed robbery conviction, the State sought a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years, without parole, for a third crime of violence, under Md. Code (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol.), section 14-101(d) of the Criminal Law Article (\"CL\"). The two predicate convictions for crimes of violence were Scott's prior conviction for first degree assault in Maryland\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and his prior conviction for aggravated assault in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia (\"the D.C. conviction\"). The D.C. conviction resulted from a guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under the D.C. aggravated assault statute, there are two modalities by which that\n   crime may be committed. First, a person commits the crime if \"(1) By any means, that person knowingly or purposely causes serious bodily injury to another person[.]\" Second, a person commits the crime if \"(2) Under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life, that person intentionally or knowingly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of serious bodily injury to another person, and thereby causes serious bodily injury.\" D.C. Code 22-404.01(a)(1)-(2). The first modality of aggravated assault is virtually identical to the Maryland crime of first degree assault, which, as noted, is a \"crime of violence\" under CL section 14-101(a)(19). The second modality is similar to the Maryland crime of reckless endangerment, which is not a \"crime of violence\" under that statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the sentencing hearing, the State introduced a certified copy of Scott's D.C. conviction. When defense counsel argued that the document was inadequate to prove the modality of the crime, and therefore that it was a crime of violence, the court postponed the sentencing hearing. At the reconvened sentencing hearing, the State introduced the statement of charges in the D.C. case. From that evidence, the sentencing court found that Scott's D.C. conviction was for a crime of violence and that his attempted armed robbery conviction was his third conviction for a crime of violence, under CL section 14-101(d). On that basis, it imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of\n   25 years' imprisonment, without parole, for attempted armed robbery. In addition, it sentenced Scott to 10 years, with all but 5 years suspended, for use of a handgun, to be served consecutively to the sentence for attempted armed robbery, and 10 years, all but 5 years suspended, for conspiracy, to be served consecutively to the sentence for use of a handgun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Scott noted an appeal to this Court in which he argued, among other things, that the State's evidence at sentencing was legally insufficient to prove that his D.C. conviction was for a crime of violence, as defined in CL section 14-101(a), and therefore to establish that his attempted armed robbery conviction was for a third crime of violence. We agreed and vacated the sentence for attempted armed robbery, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [T]he transcript of the D.C. plea hearing was not produced at [Scott's] Maryland sentencing hearing. We are unable to tell \"whether the statement of facts in support of the guilty plea tracked the Statement of Charges or whether other facts were subsequently developed or ignored for purposes of securing the plea.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Furthermore, the D.C. indictment alleged, in the alternative, conduct that the State concedes would have amounted to the Maryland crime of reckless endangerment, a crime not included as a \"crime of violence\" under C.L. \u00a7 14-101 [a].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   In the absence of evidence of a clear judicial admission by [Scott], we are persuaded that the State failed to meet its burden of proving the necessary predicates to support imposition of the mandatory sentence on Count 1 [attempted armed robbery] in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Theodore Scott v. State of Maryland,\n   </em>\n   No. 2491, September Term, 2012 (filed September 3, 2014), slip op. at 61. Citing Rule 8-604(d)(2), we remanded the case \"for resentencing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the resentencing hearing on remand, the State again sought to have Scott sentenced to a mandatory term of 25 years' imprisonment, without parole, for attempted armed robbery, under CL section 14-101(d), based on the same two\n   prior convictions.\n   This time, the State moved into evidence the transcript of the guilty plea hearing that led to Scott's D.C. conviction. Scott objected, arguing that, having failed to introduce legally sufficient evidence to prove that the D.C. conviction was for a crime of violence at the original sentencing, the State was prohibited, by principles of double jeopardy, from introducing evidence to prove the same thing on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The sentencing court overruled Scott's objection and, based on the guilty plea transcript, found that his D.C. conviction was for a crime of violence under CL section 14-101(a) and imposed the mandatory sentence of 25 years' imprisonment, without parole, for attempted armed robbery, under CL section 14-101(d). The court did not resentence Scott on the use of a handgun and conspiracy convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Scott noted this appeal, presenting four questions, which we have rephrased:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   I. Did the resentencing court violate his double jeopardy rights by imposing a mandatory twenty-five year sentence for attempted armed robbery, under CL section 14-101(d), based on prior convictions that included the D.C. conviction?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   II. Did the resentencing court exceed the scope of its authority under this Court's remand order?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   III. Did the resentencing court err by ruling the evidence legally sufficient to prove that the D.C. conviction was for a crime of violence?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   IV. Did the resentencing court err by refusing to consider making the sentences for use of a handgun and conspiracy concurrent with the mandatory twenty-five year sentence for attempted armed robbery?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   For the following reasons, we shall affirm the judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Federal Constitutional Law of Double Jeopardy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because the evidence adduced at his original sentencing hearing was legally insufficient to prove that his D.C. conviction\n   was for a crime of violence, Scott contends the State was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment from introducing new evidence at resentencing to prove that the D.C. conviction was for a crime of violence. He relies primarily on\n   <em>\n    Bowman v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2033010\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/314/725/\">\n    314 Md. 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2033010\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/314/725/\">\n    552 A.2d 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The State responds that double jeopardy principles did not bar it from introducing the new evidence on resentencing because the evidence was being used to prove \"sentencing factors,\" not to prove the elements of an offense.

The defense argued that, for double jeopardy purposes, no rational distinction could be drawn between an acquittal by the trial court for legally insufficient evidence and a reversal by a reviewing court for legally insufficient evidence. In the former situation, a retrial for the offense plainly is prohibited because the defendant was acquitted. In the latter situation, the only trial court error was to have not granted a judgment of acquittal, and therefore a retrial also should be prohibited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Recognizing that in some of its previous decisions it had permitted a retrial after a reversal for legally insufficient evidence, when the defendant had sought a new trial as one form of relief, the Court characterized its holdings in those cases as inconsistent and unclear and rejected them, adopting the defense's argument. It gave the following rationale for allowing a retrial after reversal for trial court error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [The reversal] does not constitute a decision to the effect that the government has failed to prove its case. As such, it implies nothing with respect to the guilt or innocence of the defendant. Rather, it is a determination that a defendant had been convicted through a judicial process which is defective in some fundamental respect .... When this occurs, the accused has a strong interest in obtaining a fair readjudication of his guilt free from error, just as society maintains a valid concern for insuring that the guilty are punished.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Burks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176664\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/1/#p14\">\n    437 U.S. at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176664\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/1/#p14\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That statute required the state to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, to a trier of fact (in his case a jury), that the defendant had a certain number of prior\n   convictions (in his case, four). The state introduced evidence of four prior convictions and the jury imposed an enhanced sentence. During that proceeding, the defendant testified that he had been pardoned for one of his prior convictions, but then agreed that his sentence on that conviction merely had been commuted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In a later habeas corpus proceeding, the defendant introduced evidence that he had in fact been pardoned for the conviction.

It held that the\n   <em>\n    Burks\n   </em>\n   exception did not apply, because the case involved an error by the trial court in admitting the evidence of a conviction for which, as was later revealed, the defendant was pardoned. As admitted, the evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury's finding of four prior convictions. The Court held that the fact that the evidence would not have been legally sufficient to support the jury's finding if the evidence that should not have been admitted had been excluded did not put the case within the\n   <em>\n    Burks\n   </em>\n   exception.

There, a jury found the defendant guilty of armed robbery and related crimes. The State sought a mandatory sentence of 25 years' imprisonment without parole for the armed robbery conviction, as a third crime of violence, under section 643B(c) of Article 27 of the Maryland Code, the predecessor statute to CL section 14-101(d). It relied upon two D.C. convictions for the predicate crimes of violence. The prosecutor and the sentencing judge were under the mistaken belief that the D.C. convictions both were for armed robbery. In fact, one was for\n   armed robbery and the other was for robbery. In D.C., robbery is a statutory offense that can be committed a number of ways, some of which would be a crime of violence within the meaning of CL section 14-101(a) and others of which would not (for example, pickpocketing). Although the prior robbery conviction could have resulted from a modality of perpetration that was a crime of violence, there was no evidence introduced at sentencing to show\n   that it was. The Court of Appeals concluded that the evidence presented at sentencing was legally insufficient to support a finding that the defendant had committed two prior crimes of violence, and therefore the trial court had erred by imposing the mandatory 25 year sentence without parole under section 643(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court then turned to the issue of resentencing. Reasoning that, for Fifth Amendment Double Jeopardy purposes, there is no distinction between a retrial of an offense and resentencing for a conviction, the Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   It is apparent that the case at hand does not fall within the holding of [\n   <em>\n    Lockhart\n   </em>\n   ]. There was never evidence\n   <em>\n    erroneously\n   </em>\n   admitted legally sufficient to establish the necessary proof that Bowman was a subsequent offender within the contemplation of \u00a7 643B. The trial judge simply completely misinterpreted the evidence. Only one qualifying predicate conviction was shown and there was no competent evidence to establish the second. ...\n   <em>\n    [T]he Burks exception to the general rule [as stated in Lockhart] is applicable\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2033010\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/314/725/\">\n    314 Md. at 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2033010\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/314/725/\">\n    552 A.2d 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (first emphasis in original).

The government countered that\n   <em>\n    Burks\n   </em>\n   did not apply because failure of proof of a sentencing enhancement factor is not tantamount or even comparable to an acquittal.

After the trial court ruled that the officers who had obtained the search warrant for the defendant's residence could not testify about the evidence on which they had based their warrant application, the prosecutor asked one of them to identify the \"target of that investigation.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658307\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/393/1/\">\n    393 Md. at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658307\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/393/1/\">\n    899 A.2d 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court held that the trial judge's comments about the evidence underlying the search warrant were not a substantive ruling on the evidence, however. They were observations about the admissibility, or more precisely, the inadmissibility, of that evidence. Accordingly, the mistrial motion ruling was not the functional equivalent of an acquittal, and a second prosecution for the same offense was not barred by\n   <em>\n    autrefois acquit\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The rulings in question in\n   <em>\n    State v.

First, it is clear from the holding in\n   <em>\n    Ashe\n   </em>\n   that collateral estoppel applies when there has been a factual finding favorable to the defendant that is central to his criminal liability for an offense. The doctrine has never been extended to apply to sentencing. Second, even if it applied to sentencing, the original sentencing court in this case found on the evidence submitted that the D.C. conviction was for a crime of violence, and on appeal this Court found that the evidence before the sentencing court was not sufficient to support that finding. There was no \"final adjudication\" by a court that,\n   <em>\n    as a matter of fact\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. conviction was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   for a crime of violence.

It did not concern resentencing under Rule 8-604(d)(2), and indeed did not concern sentencing at all. Rather, the issue there was whether, when the State failed to meet its burden to prove that the initial stop of the defendant was constitutional, but the trial court denied the defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained by virtue of the stop, this Court could dispose of the defendant's appeal by a limited remand, under Rule 8-604(d)(1), for a new suppression hearing at which the State could introduce additional evidence that the stop was constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Court of Appeals held that we could not. The limited remand rule \"does not afford parties who fail to meet their burdens on issues raised in a completed suppression hearing an opportunity to reopen the suppression proceeding for the taking of additional evidence after the appellate court has held the party has failed to meet its evidentiary burden.\"\n   <em>\n    Southern\n   </em>\n   , 371 Md. at 105,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1126312\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/371/93/\">\n    807 A.2d 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Temoney\n   </em>\n   is inapposite. There, the sentencing court refused to decide whether evidence of prior convictions supported the imposition of a mandatory sentence. The Court of Appeals upheld the sentence imposed, even though the sentencing judge should have considered the evidence before it, because, by the sentencing court's own analysis, the evidence was not legally sufficient to support imposition of the mandatory sentence. The Court did not decide whether, under\n   <em>\n    Burks\n   </em>\n   , additional evidence could be introduced on resentencing (the issue later decided in\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   ), because the State did not propose to introduce additional evidence on resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Here, the issue of the introduction of new evidence at resentencing is squarely before this Court. As we already have held, the introduction of new evidence does not violate double jeopardy protections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    Sufficiency of the Evidence that the D.C.

Superior Court on the offense of aggravated assault shows that the government proffered that Scott and two other men (Calvin Mason and Jeffrey Mason) got into a dispute with the victim over a North Face jacket. They surrounded the victim and the following events took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   At this point the [victim] retreated to a wall, and was covering his face in order to avoid being hit in the face and body by [Scott] and Calvin Mason. [Scott] and Calvin Mason continued to hit the [victim] until the [victim] fell to the ground, at which point Jeffrey Mason told [Calvin] Mason to stomp on the [victim].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   Calvin Mason and [Scott] then began to stomp on the [victim's] face and body while [Scott] was wearing boots.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   [A]t approximately this point the [victim] lost consciousness and began to suffer bruising, subdural bleeding and a fracture of the left orbital bone, the bone surrounding the eye.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   At the conclusion of this proffer, the judge asked Scott, \"So, ... that's the evidence the Government had in your case. Do you agree or disagree, sir?\" Scott replied, \"I agree.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   At the resentencing hearing on remand, the court observed that \"[s]tomping somebody around the face and the eye with boots on while he's on the ground obviously is an intent, obviously expresses an intent to cause serious bodily harm. I mean that's the whole purpose of doing it.\" The court found that the facts proffered by the government and accepted by Scott in support of the aggravated assault guilty plea would support a conviction for first degree assault, under CL section 3-202, and therefore the aggravated assault was a crime of violence under CL section 14-101(a)(19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Scott argues that because he did not admit at the plea hearing that he had the intent to cause serious physical injury, the evidence was insufficient to establish the elements of the offense of first degree assault. He relies on\n   <em>\n    Bowman.\n   </em>\n   There, despite efforts by the prosecutor on cross-examination, Bowman refused to admit that he had committed robbery with a deadly weapon, which would have qualified the D.C. robbery offense as a crime of violence under the Maryland predecessor statute to CL section 14-101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The State points out that here, in contrast to\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   , Scott agreed to facts proffered by the government that would constitute a crime of violence under CL section 14-101(a)(19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   It maintains that Scott's agreement, without reservation, to these facts was sufficient for the sentencing court to infer that he had an intent to cause serious physical injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   A factfinder \"may infer the necessary intent from an individual's conduct and the surrounding circumstances[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Chilcoat v.

Alternatively, the State argues that the resentencing court did not have the authority to make the sentences on Counts 5 and 7 concurrent with the reimposed sentence on Count 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In his reply brief, Scott asserts that the recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Twigg v.

The record discloses that the resentencing judge expressly recognized that Scott had the right to allocution and gave him the opportunity to allocute and present mitigating information. Through counsel, Scott declined, thereby waiving any right to complain on appeal that the court violated Rule 4-342(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The record also discloses that the argument Scott made below about the sentences on Counts 5 and 7 is not the argument he is advancing on appeal. At resentencing, Scott's counsel asked the judge to make the sentence it was imposing on Count 1,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the mandatory 25 years' imprisonment without parole, concurrent with the sentences previously imposed\n   on Counts 5 and 7. The judge declined to do so on the ground that the effect would be to alter the sentences on Counts 5 and 7, which had been imposed consecutive to Count 1 (for Count 5) and consecutive to Count 5 (for Count 7). The judge was of the view that because this Court had not vacated the sentences on Counts 5 and 7, he could not alter them. Defense counsel argued that doing so would not alter those sentences because\n   the sentence on Count 1 no longer existed, having been vacated on appeal, and therefore there was no sentence for the sentences on Counts 5 and 7 to run consecutively to.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   On appeal, Scott mischaracterizes his request of the resentencing judge, stating that he asked him to reconsider the sentences on Counts 5 and 7 to make\n   <em>\n    them\n   </em>\n   run concurrently with the newly imposed sentence on Count 1, but the judge refused. That plainly is not what happened below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Even if the issue whether the resentencing court had the authority to reconsider the sentences imposed on Counts 5 and 7 to make them run concurrently with the newly imposed sentence on Count 1 were properly preserved, we would not find merit in it. The cases Scott relies upon-\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Twigg\n   </em>\n   -are inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was convicted of first degree assault and robbery with a deadly weapon. This Court vacated both sentences on the ground that the convictions should have merged for sentencing, and remanded for resentencing. The trial court did not allow the defendant to allocute and present mitigating evidence on resentencing. The case reached the Court of Appeals, which held that on resentencing the defendant had a right to allocution and present mitigating evidence.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   did not concern a situation in which the defendant was seeking to have sentences that had not been vacated reconsidered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   , after holding that the mandatory 25 year sentence without parole was not supported by sufficient evidence\n   and the State could not offer otherwise sufficient evidence on resentencing, the Court of Appeals vacated that sentence\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   two sentences that had been imposed to run consecutively to it and directed that on remand there be resentencing on all those convictions. In the case at bar, this Court did not vacate the sentences on Counts 5 and 7. We only vacated the sentence on Count 1 and remanded for resentencing on that count alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Finally,\n   <em>\n    Twigg\n   </em>\n   does not lend support to Scott's contention. In that case, the defendant was convicted of child sexual abuse and three sex offenses (second degree rape, third degree sexual offense, and incest), \"any one of [which] could have provided the basis for the child abuse conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    Twigg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265644\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/1/\">\n    447 Md. at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265644\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/1/\">\n    133 A.3d 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
