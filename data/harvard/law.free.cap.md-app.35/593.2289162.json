What are the brush strokes that may be employed \u201cto retouch the fading daguerreotype of memory?\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The subject is that of Present Recollection Revived.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The appellant, Teretha McNeil Baker, was convicted by a Baltimore City jury of both murder in the first degree and robbery. Although she raises two appellate contentions, the only one which we find it necessary to consider is her claim that the trial judge erroneously refused her the opportunity to refresh the present recollection of a police witness by showing him a report written by a fellow officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The ultimate source of most of the evidence implicating the appellant was the robbery and murder victim himself, Gaither Martin, a now-dead declarant who spoke to the jury through the hearsay conduit of Officer Bolton.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When Officer Bolton arrived at the crime scene, the victim told him that he had \u201cpicked these three ladies up ... at the New Deal Bar\u201d; that when he took them to their stated destination, a man walked up to the car and pulled him out; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>that \u201cthe other three got out and proceeded to kick him and beat him.\u201d It was the assertion made by the victim to the officer that established that his money, wallet and keys had been taken. The critical impasse, for present purposes, occurred when the officer was questioned, on cross-examination, about what happened en route to the hospital. The officer had received a call from Officer Hucke, of the Western District, apparently to the effect that a suspect had been picked up. Before proceeding to the hospital, Officer Bolton took the victim to the place where Officer Hucke was holding the appellant. The appellant, as part of this cross-examination, sought to elicit from the officer the fact that the crime victim confronted the appellant and stated that the appellant was not one of those persons who had attacked and robbed him. To stimulate the present memory of Officer Bolton, appellant\u2019s counsel attempted to show him the police report relating to that confrontation and prepared by Officer Hucke.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The record establishes loudly and clearly that appellant\u2019s counsel sought to use the report primarily to refresh the recollection of Officer Bolton and that he was consistently and effectively thwarted in that attempt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">\u201cBY MR.

HARLAN: You have not afforded him the opportunity to do that yet, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-18\">THE COURT: He says he does not know who it was before.

HARLAN: I don\u2019t want him to read from that report. I want him to read it and see if it refreshes his recollection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">On so critical an issue as possible exculpation from the very lips of the crime victim, appellant was entitled to try to refresh the memory of the key police witness. She was erroneously and prejudicially denied that opportunity. The reason for the error is transparent. Because they both arise from the common seedbed of failed memory and because of their hauntingly parallel verbal rhythms and grammatical structures, there is a beguiling temptation to overanalogize Present Recollection Revived and Past Recollection Recorded. It is a temptation, however, that must be resisted. The trial judge in this case erroneously measured the legitimacy of the effort to revive present recollection against the more rigorous standards for the admissibility of a recordation of past memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">It is, of course, hornbook law that when a party seeks to introduce a record of past recollection, he must establish 1) that the record was made by or adopted by the witness at a time when the witness did have a recollection of the event and 2) that the witness can presently vouch for the fact that when the record was made or adopted by him, he knew that it was accurate. <em>Hall v. State, </em>223 Md. 158, 162 A. 2d 751; <em>Edwards and Person v. State, </em>31 Md. App. 562, 358 A. 2d 590; <em>Ringgold v. State, </em>34 Md. App. 286, 367 A. 2d 35. McCormick, <em>Law of Evidence </em>(1st Ed., 1954), describes the criteria, at 15:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">\u201cAppropriate safeguarding rules have been developed for this latter kind of memoranda, requiring that they must have been written by the witness or examined and found correct by him, and that they must have been prepared so promptly after the events recorded that these must have been fresh in the mind of the witness when the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>was made or examined and verified by him. We have treated such memoranda separately, as an exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Had the appellant herein sought to offer the police report as a record, of past recollection on the part of Officer Bolton, it is elementary that she would have had to show, <em>inter alia, </em>that the report had either been prepared by Officer Bolton himself or had been read by him and that he can now say that at that time he knew it was correct. Absent such a showing, the trial judge would have been correct in declining to receive it in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">When dealing with an instance of Past Recollection Recorded, the reason for the rigorous standards of admissibility is quite clear. Those standards exist to test the competence of the report or document in question. Since the piece of paper itself, in effect, speaks to the jury, the piece of paper must pass muster in terms of its evidentiary competence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Not so with Present Recollection Revived! By marked contrast to Past Recollection Recorded, no such testimonial competence is demanded of a mere stimulus to present recollection, for the stimulus itself is never evidence. Notwithstanding the surface similarity between the two phenomena, the difference between them could not be more basic.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>It is the difference between evidence and non-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>evidence. </em>Of such mere stimuli or memory-prods, McCormick says, at 18, \u201c[T]he cardinal rule is that they are not evidence, but only aids in the giving of evidence.\u201d When we are dealing with an instance of Present Recollection Revived, the only source of evidence is the testimony of the witness himself. The stimulus may have jogged the witness\u2019s dormant memory, but the stimulus itself is not received in evidence. Dean McCormick makes it clear that even when the stimulus is a writing, when the witness \u201cspeaks from a memory thus revived, his testimony is what he says, not the writing.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 15. McCormick describes the psychological phenomenon in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">\u201cIt is abundantly clear from every-day observation that the latent memory of an experience may be revived by an image seen, or a statement read or heard. It is a part of the group of phenomena which the classical psychologists have called the law of association. The recall of any part of a past experience tends to bring with it the other parts that were in the same field of awareness, and a new experience tends to stimulate the recall of other like experiences.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 14.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The psychological community is in full agreement with the legal community in assessing the mental phenomenon. See Cairn, <em>Law and the Social Sciences </em>200 (1935):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">\u201cIn permitting a witness to refresh his recollection by consulting a memorandum, the courts are in accord with present psychological knowledge. A distinction is drawn, in the analysis of the memory process, between <em>recall, </em>which is the reproduction of what has been learned, and <em>recognition, </em>which is recall with a time-factor added, or an awareness that the recall relates to past experience. It is with recognition that the law is principally concerned in permitting a witness to revive his recollection. The psychological evidence is clear that in thus allowing to be brought to mind what has been forgotten, the law is following sound psychological procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>And see Hutchins and Slesinger, <em>Some Observations on the Law of Evidence </em>\u2014 <em>Memory, </em>41 Harv. L. Rev. 860 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The catalytic agent or memory stimulator is put aside, once it has worked its psychological magic, and the witness then testifies on the basis of the now-refreshed memory. The opposing party, of course, has the right to inspect the memory aid, be it a writing or otherwise, and even to show it to the jury. This examination, however, is not for the purpose of testing the competence of the memory aid (for competence is immaterial where the thing in question is not evidence) but only to test whether the witness\u2019s memory has in truth been refreshed. As McCormick warns, \u201cBut the witness must swear that he is genuinely refreshed. . . . And he cannot be allowed to read the writing in the guise of refreshment, as a cloak for getting in evidence an inadmissible document.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> One of the most thorough reviews of this aspect of evidence law is found in <em>United States v. Riccardi, </em>174 F. 2d 883 (3rd Cir., 1949), where the court said at 888:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">\u201cIn the case of present recollection revived, the witness, by hypothesis, relates his present recollection, and under oath and subject to cross-examination asserts that it is true; his capacities for memory and perception may be attacked and tested; his determination to tell the truth investigated and revealed; protestations of lack of memory, which escape criticism and indeed constitute a refuge in the situation of past recollection recorded, merely undermine the probative worth of his testimony .\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>In solid accord with both the psychological sciences and the general common law of evidence, Maryland has long established it that even when a writing of some sort is the implement used to stir the embers of cooling memory, the writing need not be that of the forgetful witness himself, need not have been adopted by him, need not have been made contemporaneously with or shortly after the incident in question, and need not even be necessarily accurate. The competence of the writing is not in issue for the writing is not offered as evidence but is only used as a memory aid. <em>Adkins v. Hastings, </em>138 Md. 454, 114 A. 288 (book entries recording sale of goods as a memory aid); <em>McGuire v. State, </em>200 Md. 601, 92 A. 2d 582 (stenographic transcript of tape recording of telephone conversations); <em>Bulluck v. State, </em>219 Md. 67, 148 A. 2d 433 (police officer\u2019s notes of statement given by defendant); <em>Gault v. State, </em>231 Md. 78, 188 A. 2d 539 (unsigned transcript of oral confession); <em>Miller v. State, </em>251 Md. 362, 247 A. 2d 530, judgment vacated in part, 408 U. S. 934, 92 S. Ct. 2851, 33 L.Ed.2d 747 (typed but unsigned statement of defendant given to police used to refresh officer\u2019s recollection); <em>Scott v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 481, 231 A. 2d 728 (memorandum of sale); <em>Bull v. Schuberth, 2 </em>Md. 38 (newspaper); <em>Hubbard v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 364, 234 A. 2d 775 (statement of State\u2019s witness given to police); <em>Askins v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 702, 284 A. 2d 626 (State\u2019s witness permitted to refresh memory from memorandum of statement he had given to police); <em>Holloway v. State, </em>26 Md. App. 382, 339 A. 2d 319 (police report written by another officer).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">When the writing in question is to be utilized simply \u201cto awaken a slumbering recollection of an event\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in the mind of the witness, the writing may be a memorandum made by the witness himself, 1) even if it was not made immediately after the event, 2) even if it was not made of firsthand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>knowledge and 3) even if the witness cannot now vouch for the fact that it was accurate when made. It may be a memorandum made by one other than the witness, even if never before read by the witness or vouched- for by him. It may be an Associated Press account. It may be a highly selective version of the incident at the hands of a Hemingway or an Eliot. All that is required is that it ignite the flash of accurate recall \u2014 that it accomplish the revival which is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">McCormick wrote to just such effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">\u201c[I]t is probable that most courts today when faced with the clear distinction between the two uses of the memoranda, will adhere to the \u2018classical\u2019 view that any memorandum or other object may be used as a stimulus to present memory, without restriction by rule as to authorship, guaranty of correctness, or time of making.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The Texas dean is in good company, for no less eminent an authority than Lord Ellenborough said in <em>Henry v. Lee, </em>2 Chitty 124, 125 (1810):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">\u201cIf upon looking at <em>any </em>document he can so far refresh his memory as to recollect a circumstance, it is sufficient; and it makes no difference that the memorandum is not written by himself, for it is not the memorandum that is the evidence but the recollection of the witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Not only may the writing to be used as a memory aid fall short of the rigorous standards of competence required of a record of past recollection, the memory aid itself need not even be a writing. What may it be? It may be anything.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It may be a line from Kipling or the dolorous refrain of \u201cThe Tennessee Waltz\u201d; a whiff of hickory smoke; the running of the fingers across a swatch of corduroy; the sweet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>carbonation of a chocolate soda; the sight of a faded snapshot in a long-neglected album. All that is required is that it may trigger the Proustian moment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It may be anything which produces the desired testimonial prelude, \u201cIt all comes back to me now.\u201d <footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Of just such possibilities did Learned Hand speak in <em>United States v. Rappy, </em>157 F. 2d 964, 967 (2d Cir. 1946):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">\u201cAnything may in fact revive a memory: a song, a scent, a photograph, an allusion, even a past statement known to be false.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The United States Court, of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit addressed the same issue in <em>Jewett v. United States, </em>15 F. 2d 955 (1926), and concluded, at 956:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">\u201c[I]t is quite immaterial by what means the memory is quickened; it may be a song, or a face, or a newspaper item, or a writing of some character. It is sufficient that by some material operation, however mysterious, the memory is stimulated to recall the event, for when so set in motion it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>functions quite independently of the actuating cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Jerome Frank in <em>Fanelli v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>141 F. 2d 216, 217 (2d Cir. 1944), put it in these terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">\u201cCommon experience, the work of Proust and other keenly observant literary men, and recondite psychological research, all teach us that memory of things long past can be accurately restored in all sorts of ways. The creaking of a hinge, the whistling of a tune, the smell of seaweed, the sight of an old photograph, the taste of nutmeg, the touch of a piece of canvas, may bring vividly to the foreground [of] consciousness the recollection of events that happened years ago and which would otherwise have been forgotten. . . . The memory-prodder may itself lack meaning to other persons as a symbol of the past event, as everyone knows who has ever used a knot in his handkerchief as a reminder. Since the workings of the human memory still remain a major mystery after centuries of study, courts should hesitate before they glibly contrive dogmatic rules concerning the reliability of the ways of provoking it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Although the use of a memorandum of some sort will continue quantitatively to dominate the field of refreshing recollection, we are better able to grasp the process conceptually if we appreciate that the use of a memorandum as a memory aid is not a legal phenomenon unto itself but only an instance of a far broader phenomenon. In a more conventional mode, the process might proceed, \u201cYour Honor, I am about to show the witness a written report, ask him to read it and then inquire if he can now testify from his own memory thus refreshed.\u201d In a far less conventional mode, the process could just as well proceed, \u201cYour Honor, I am pleased to present to the court Miss Rosa Ponselle who will now sing \u2018Celeste Aida\u2019 for the witness, for that is what was playing on the night the burglar came through the window.\u2019' Whether by conventional or unconventional means, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>precisely the same end is sought. One is looking for the effective elixir to revitalize dimming memory and make it live again in the service of the search for truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Even in the more conventional mode, it is quite clear that in this case the appropriate effort of the appellant to jog the arguably dormant memory of the key police witness on a vital issue was unduly and prejudicially restricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">\n<em>Judgments reversed; case remanded for a new trial; costs to be paid by Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-9\">.

Marcel Proust, in his monumental epic <em>In Remembrance of Things Past, </em>sat, as a middle-aged man, sipping a cup of lime-flavored tea and eating a madeleine, a small French pastry. Through both media, two long-forgotten tastes from childhood were reawakened. By association, long forgotten memories from the same period of childhood came welling and surging back.

Generally speaking, the process of refurbishing a witness\u2019s memory will take place as a part of astute counsel\u2019s trial preparation. It is only when memory, through courtroom fear or otherwise, unexpectedly bogs down on the witness stand (or when the witness whose memory needs refreshing is one other than counsel\u2019s own) that the courtroom becomes the arena for the refurbishing. McCormick, <em>Law of Evidence </em>(2nd Ed., 1972), points out, at 14-15:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-10\">\u201cAs we have seen, the interviewing of witnesses by counsel who will examine them in court is a necessary step in preparing for trial. It is at this stage that the memory of the witness can best be refreshed about the facts of the ease, by giving him the opportunity to read his own written statements previously made, or the letters, maps, or other documents in the case. It is only when this review of the data is insufficient to enable the witness to recall the facts while testifying that refreshing his memory on the stand is advisable.
