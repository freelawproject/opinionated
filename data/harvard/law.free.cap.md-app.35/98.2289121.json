He was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The trial had been commenced on March 3,1976. The State rested its case after calling two witnesses. Trial counsel for the defendant moved for judgment of acquittal upon the ground that \u201cthe State has failed to make out a prima facie case requiring a defense in this case.\u201d The motion was overruled. The court then recessed for further proceedings on the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">When the case was resumed on the morning of March 4, 1976, trial counsel for the accused addressed the court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">\u201cMR. SCHAPIRO: Good morning, Your Honor. Initially, I wish to reiterate on the record what I advised you in chambers yesterday. The Defendant indicated at the conclusion of proceedings yesterday that his correct name is not Charles J. Hill but Brown J. Hill and the Defendant indicated to me further for the first time yesterday evening that one time in 1975 he had been at Clifton T. Perkins for seven months for some type of evaluation. He indicated he wishes me to interpose a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity at the time, not guilty by reason of insanity at the time of the alleged commission of the offense <em>and is not competent to stand trial at this time.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">The trial judge responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: This is the first time the attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>or the Court or the State\u2019s Attorney has learned of the Defendant\u2019s desire to file an insanity plea. The case is already in process and I don\u2019t think the plea is filed timely, and I will therefore overrule the Defendant\u2019s motion to be allowed to file an insanity plea at this juncture of the trial. We will proceed with the trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The trial judge did not respond to counsel\u2019s statement that \u201c[My] client wishes me to interpose a plea [that he] is not competent to stand trial at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Appellant in this Court makes the following single contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">\u201cThe trial judge committed reversible error by refusing to determine whether Appellant was legally competent to stand trial after Appellant, in open court, alleged he was incompetent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Article 59, \u00a7 23 reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\">\u201cWhenever prior to or <em>during the trial, any person charged with the commission of any crime shall </em>appear to the court, or <em>be alleged to be incompetent to stand trial, by the defendant himself, the court shall determine upon testimony and evidence preseyited oyi the record whether such person is unable to understand the nature or the object of the proceeding agaiyist him or to assist in his defeyise.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">We have pointed out that there is a marked difference in the tests to be applied with respect to the issue of \u201cresponsibility for criminal conduct\u201d and with respect to \u201ccompetency to stand trial.\u201d <em>Strawderman v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 689, 244 A. 2d 888 (1967); <em>Rozzell v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 167, 245 A. 2d 917 (1968); <em>Colbert v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 632, 308 A. 2d 726 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">In <em>Strawderman, supra, </em>we set forth the competency test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>and laid out the procedures to be followed when the latter issue was raised:</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u201cCOMPETENCY TO STAND TRIAL</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">\n<em>The Test</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">Under new \u00a7 7 [ijow \u00a7 23] the test for competency of an accused to stand trial is \u2018whether such person is unable to understand the nature or the object of the proceeding against him or to assist in his defense.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">\n<em>The Procedure</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">By new \u00a7 7 [now \u00a7 23] the lower court shall determine whether the accused is competent to stand trial \u2018upon testimony and evidence presented on the record,\u2019 <em>whenever prior to or during trial, the accused alleges he is so incompetent </em>or it so appears to the court. The court for good cause shown and after affording the accused an opportunity to be heard on his own behalf or through counsel may pass an order requesting an examination of the accused\u2019s competency to stand trial by the Department of Mental Hygiene and a full report of the findings shall be forwarded to the court, the State\u2019s Attorney and to counsel for the defendant. \u2018If the court after receiving testimony and evidence determines that the defendant is competent to stand trial within the meaning of this section (new \u00a7 7) [now \u00a7 23], the trial shall commence as soon as practicable or, if already commenced, shall continue. The court may in its discretion at any time during the trial and until the verdict is rendered, reconsider the question of competency of the defendant to stand trial as otherwise provided in this section.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) 4 Md. App. at 692-93, 244 A. 2d at 890.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">We added at 697 [892]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-12\">\u201cWith regard to competency to stand trial under new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>\u00a7 7 [now \u00a7 23], <em>we think that the court </em>in whom the final determination of the matter rests, <em>must determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is able to understand the nature or object of the proceeding against him and to assist in his defense.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">We reiterated that Art. 59, \u00a7 23, <em>supra, </em>mandates affirmative action by the trial court when the issue arises. <em>See Rozzell v. State, supra, </em>wherein we said at 173-74 [920]:</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u201cCOMPETENCY TO STAND TRIAL</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">In <em>Strawderman v. State, 4 </em>Md. App. 689, we discussed the provisions of Chapter 709. We stated that the test for competency of an accused to stand trial is \u2018whether such person is unable to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him or to assist in his defense\u2019 and we found that the procedure was that the lower court, <em>when the issue was before it, shall make such determination 'upon testimony and evidence presented on the record. </em>\u2019 See Code, <em>supra, </em>Art. 59, \u00a7 7.\u201d [<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">We added at 175 [921]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-10\">\u201cIn <em>Strawderman v. State, supra, </em>we said, with regard to competency to stand trial, that <em>the lower court, in whom the determination of the matter rests, must determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is able to understand the nature or object of the proceedings against him and to assist in his defense.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">Again, in <em>Colbert v. State, supra, </em>we made plain that \u00a7 23 mandated special procedural action and necessary substantive determination by the trial court when an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>accused is \u201calleged to be incompetent to stand trial.\u201d We said at 640-41 [731]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">\u201cIn passing we notice that appellant adduced no proof in support of his plea of insanity. While the plea was not withdrawn, we think it was implicitly abandoned. In any event, in the absence of proof to support the plea, the State had no burden with respect to it, and there was no issue to be presented to the trier of facts. <em>Strawderman, supra, </em>at page 698.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">\u201cHowever, the clearly different test for competency to stand trial, and the clearly different procedure for determining the issue, <em>Strawderman, supra, </em>at page 695, requires the court to make a determination when incompetency is alleged. Code, Art. 59, \u00a7 23, provides, in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">\u2018Whenever prior to or during the trial, any person charged with the commission of any crime shall appear to the court, or be alleged to be incompetent to stand trial, by the defendant himself, the court shall determine upon testimony and evidence presented on the record whether such person is unable to understand the nature of [or] the object of the proceeding against him or to assist in his defense.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">The statute requires that the determination be made \u2018upon testimony and evidence presented on the record\u2019, but it does not require that such testimony and evidence be presented in a separate hearing, as appellant contends. We said in <em>Strawderman, </em>at page 695, \u2018Of course, in a jury trial, evidence with regard to it should be received out of the presence of the jury\u2019, but we did not say, nor do we now say, that a judge with no jury present is required to use any magic words to designate as a separate hearing the presentation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>him of testimony and evidence for his determination of the competency of the accused to stand trial. It is sufficient if the testimony and evidence are on the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The State suggests that \u201cthe record fails to demonstrate a per se <em>refusal </em>by the trial judge to make [a competency] determination\u201d and that \u201call parties were directed toward the single aspect of the insanity plea as opposed to the alleged incompetency.\u201d From this premise the State argues that \u201cif the appellant intended his motion as an allegation of incompetency, he had the commensurate responsibility of bringing to the attention of the trial judge that he sought a determination as to such issue . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The language used by trial counsel unequivocally directed the attention of the trial court to the dual issues (a) of insanity as a defense to the crimes charged and (b) of the competency of the accused to stand trial. The issues are statutorially distinct. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 25 with \u00a7 23 of Article 59. We think that the peremptory requirement imposed upon the court by \u00a7 23 was activated by the clearly stated request of trial counsel. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">We consider <em>Alston v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 624, 276 A. 2d 225 (1971), and <em>White v. State, </em>23 Md. App. 151, 326 A. 2d 219 (1974), relied upon by the State, to be distinguishable. In both <em>Alston </em>and <em>White, </em>trial counsel had proceeded to trial without directing the court\u2019s attention to pending unresolved motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">In the subject case, trial counsel specifically directed the trial court\u2019s attention to an issue as to which its determination was mandated. He was required to do no more. <em>See Saunders v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 143, 146, 258 A. 2d 776, 777-78 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">In the subject case the trial judge failed to follow the course prescribed in <em>Strawderman, Rozzell </em>and <em>Colbert, </em>all <em>supra. </em>We now repeat, that whenever the issue of competency of an accused to stand trial is raised during the course of a jury trial, the trial judge <em>must </em>determine upon testimony and evidence presented on the record, out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>presence of the jury, whether the accused \u201cis unable to understand the nature or the object of the proceedings against him or to assist in his defense.\u201d The provision of Article 59, \u00a7 23 that the court must make determination \u201cupon testimony and evidence presented on the record\u201d is mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Unless and until the trial court makes a determination beyond a reasonable doubt upon testimony and evidence presented on the record that the accused is able to understand the nature or the object of the proceeding against him and to assist in his defense, the trial may not begin or if begun may not continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Because we are compelled to reverse and remand for a new trial at which proceedings to determine competency to stand trial may again become an issue, we feel obliged, for the guidance of trial judges in this or other cases, to retreat from certain dicta in <em>Colbert v. State, supra. </em>In <em>Colbert, </em>where we found that the trial court fully had complied with the mandate of Article 59, \u00a7 23, we stated in dicta at 641 [731-32]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">\u201cThe clear difference in procedure is this: although a defendant is presumed competent until the issue is raised, that presumption is overcome when it \u2018shall appear to the court or <em>be alleged\u2019 that he is incompetent to stand trial. The allegation may be made by the defendant himself, or by his counsel. When the original presumption is thus overcome there remains no presumption one way or the other. </em>The issue raised must be determined by the court, which must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is competent to stand trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The above quoted language used in <em>Colbert, </em>unnecessary to decision in that case, went too far. We agree that there is a presumption that one accused of criminal conduct is presumed to be competent to stand trial. That presumption, however, carries not less than co-equal force with an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>accused's presumed responsibility for criminal conduct in the face of a plea of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">That is to say, the presumption of competency to stand trial does not disappear merely because the issue is raised by allegations of the accused or his counsel, any more than the presumption of sanity disappears upon entry of an insanity plea. Such an <em>allegation </em>mandates no more than that the court make \u201ca determination upon testimony and evidence\u201d upon the issue whether an accused is competent to stand trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To hold otherwise would open the door to odious chicanery whereby an accused in a long jury trial, could subvert the trial without just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>The presumption of competency to stand trial continues until testimony and evidence presented on the record is of such character that the trial judge finds himself unable to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is able to understand the nature or the object of the proceeding against him or to assist in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">When such testimony and evidence produces such effect upon the mind of the court, the trial must not be commenced, or if commenced must be suspended, or a mistrial declared as the ends of justice in a particular case may require.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The mandated hearing and determination must, of course, comport with requirements of due process under the Fourteenth. Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>Pate v. Robinson, </em>383 U. S. 375, 86 S. Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966); <em>Drope v. Missouri, </em>420 U. S. 162, 95 S. Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">In <em>Drope v. Missouri, supra, </em>it was said at 174-75 [905] [115]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">\u201cIn the present case there is no dispute as to the evidence possibly relevant to petitioner\u2019s mental condition that was before the trial court prior to trial and thereafter. Rather, the dispute concerns the inferences that were to be drawn from the undisputed evidence and whether, in light of what was then known, the failure to make further inquiry into petitioner\u2019s competence to stand trial, denied him a fair trial. In such circumstances we believe it is \u2018incumbent upon us to analyze the facts in order that the appropriate enforcement of the federal right may be assured.\u2019 Norris v. Alabama, 294 US 587, 590, 79 L Ed 1074, 55 S Ct 579 (1935). \u2018When the corrective process is provided by the state but error, in relation to the federal question of constitutional violation, creeps into the record, we have the responsibility to review the state proceedings.\u2019 Hawk v. Olson, supra, at 276, 90 L Ed 61.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The continuing nature of the trial court\u2019s duty to be alert to a competency issue that may be introduced during the course of trial also was the subject of discussion in <em>Drope, supra, </em>at 181-82 [908-09] [119]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">\u201cEven when a defendant is competent at the commencement of his trial, a trial court must always be alert to circumstances suggesting a change that would render the accused unable to meet the standards of competence to stand trial. Whatever the relationship between mental illness and incompetence to stand trial, in this case the bearing of the former on the latter was sufficiently likely that in light of the evidence of petitioner\u2019s behavior including his suicide attempt, and there being no opportunity without his presence to evaluate that bearing in fact, the correct course was to suspend the trial until such an evaluation could be made. That this might have aborted the trial is a hard reality, but we cannot fail to note that such a result might have been avoided by prompt psychiatric examination before trial, when it was sought by petitioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">We also sound a cautionary note as to the following language used in <em>Colbert, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">\u201cAs in the case of insanity affecting criminal responsibility, the question of competence to stand trial is first and foremost a medical problem. An opinion as to the medical fact of competence to stand trial should be reached by a medical diagnosis. Thus the opinion must be that of a medically trained psychiatrist in order to be admissible in evidence. <em>Saul v. State, supra.\" </em>[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] 18 Md. App. at 642, 308 A. 2d at 732.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">There is no doubt that the issue of competency to stand trial in many cases may involve a necessity for the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>judge to have or indeed, perhaps to seek, the testimony of medically trained psychiatrists before making a determination of competency. It is for this reason that Article 59, \u00a7 23 contains a provision that, <em>\u201cThe court for good cause and after affording the defendant an opportunity to be heard on his own behalf or through counsel </em>may pass an order requesting an examination of the defendant by the Department of Mental Hygiene.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">We read the quoted portion of \u00a7 23 as manifesting a legislative intent to <em>require </em>such examination only when the testimony and evidence presented on the record raises a <em>bona fide </em>issue by demonstrating reasonable cause to believe that the accused may be incompetent to stand trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">This rule fixes a \u201cthreshold\u201d to be crossed in a separate hearing<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (in jury trials) akin to that required of the accused after a plea of insanity. There is, of course, a difference between the two rules, both in the requisites for crossing the threshold and with respect to the effect of a successful crossing. In <em>competency, </em>as distinguished from <em>insanity </em><footnotemark>6</footnotemark> hearings, the determination is exclusively a matter for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>determination by the trial court beyond a reasonable doubt. It is never a matter for the consideration of a jury. <em>Strawderman, supra, </em>at 695 and 697 [891 and 892]; <em>Rozzell, supra, </em>175 [921]; <em>Colbert, supra, </em>639 [730-31].</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">We find nothing in the statute to indicate that testimony by a medically trained psychiatrist that the accused is competent to stand trial is <em>necessarily required </em>before the court may make a determination of competency beyond a reasonable doubt. We did not intend the decision in <em>Colbert </em>to indicate otherwise. <em>See United States v. David, </em>511 F. 2d 355 (DC Cir. 1975), wherein the Court said at 360:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">\u201cThis court recognizes that in making a competency determination it may be very useful for the trial judge to question both the defendant and his counsel; the applicable criteria measure one\u2019s ability to consult <em>with his lawyer </em>and to understand the course of <em>legal </em>proceedings. Thus counsel\u2019s first-hand evaluation of a defendant\u2019s ability to consult on his case and to understand the charges and proceedings against him may be as valuable as an expert psychiatric opinion on his competency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-7\"><em>See also Wolcott v. United States, </em>407 F. 2d 1149 (10th Cir. 1969), wherein the scope of the trial court\u2019s duty was discussed at 1151:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">\u201cThe latest word on the scope of the court\u2019s duty to hear and decide mental competency to waive and plead or stand trial is Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 836 (1966). That case reaffirmed the test of competency as reiterated in Dusky, supra, and further articulated the standards by which a sentencing judge shall be guided in the discharge of his highly sensitive presentence responsibilities. It is there said that if any information coming to the attention of the court raises a \u2018bona fide doubt\u2019 of the defendant\u2019s competency to waive his constitutional rights and plead or to stand trial, it then becomes the inescapable duty of the court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>conduct a due process hearing to determine mental competency and to make appropriate findings thereon. The decision is for the court and both expert and lay testimony may be competent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\n<em>Case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AMq\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-12\">.

Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975), said at 172-73 [904] [113-14]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">\u201cIn Pate v Robinson, 383 US 375, 15 <em>L </em>Ed 2d 815, 86 S Ct 836 (1966), we held that the failure to observe procedures adequate to protect a defendant\u2019s right not to be tried or convicted while incompetent to stand trial deprives him of his due process right to a fair trial. Although in Robinson we noted that Illinois \u2018jealously guard[ed] this right,\u2019 id., at 385, 15 L Ed 2d 815, we held that the failure of the state courts to invoke the statutory procedures deprived Robinson of the inquiry into the issue of his competence to stand trial to which, on the facts of the case, we concluded he was constitutionally entitled. The Court did not hold that the procedure prescribed by 111 Rev Stat, c 38, \u00a7 104-2 (1963), was constitutionally mandated, although central to its discussion was the conclusion that the statutory procedure, if followed, was constitutionally adequate. See, e.g., United States v Knohl, 379 F2d 427, 434-435 (CA2), cert denied, 389 US 973, 19 L Ed 2d 465, 88 S Ct 472 (1967); United States ex rel. Evans v.

Nor did the Court prescribe a general standard with respect to the nature or quantum of evidence necessary to require resort to an adequate procedure.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Rather, it noted under the Illinois statute a hearing was required where the evidence raised a \u2018 \u201cbona fide doubt\u201d \u2019 as to a defendant\u2019s competence, and the Court concluded \u2018that the evidence introduced on Robinson\u2019s behalf entitled him to a hearing on this issue.\u2019 383 US, at 385, 15 L Ed 2d 815.

In discussing the evidence adduced at Robinson\u2019s trial, the Court did, however, indicate that a history of irrational behavior is a relevant factor which, on the record before it, was sufficient to require further inquiry notwithstanding Robinson\u2019s demeanor at trial and the stipulated opinion of a psychiatrist that Robinson knew the nature of the charges against him and could cooperate with counsel when the psychiatrist examined him two or three months before.

The requisites for and the effect of \u201ccrossing the threshold\u201d after a plea of insanity were set forth in Strawderman, <em>supra, </em>at 698 [893]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-11\">\u201cSo when a plea has been filed in writing alleging that the accused was insane at the time of the commission of the alleged crime, the court should determine preliminarily whether the proof adduced in support thereof is sufficient to raise a doubt as to the sanity of the accused, as defined, in the minds of reasonable men. If it finds that it is not, the State has no further burden with respect thereto and, in a jury trial, the question is not submitted to the jury. If the court finds that the proof adduced was sufficient to surmount the threshold question of doubt as to the accused\u2019s responsibility, the State has the burden of convincing the trier of facts that the accused was sane, and, in a jury trial, evidence on the issue should then be introduced before the jury with proper instructions.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
