We find there was no error and shall affirm the judgment of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">The facts are not in dispute. A clerk of the Princess Shop clothing store observed the appellant place some of the store\u2019s merchandise in a bag and proceed toward the exit of the store. She alerted the store manager, and as he approached the appellant who at this point was near the front exit, the appellant's female companion yelled to him to run. The appellant took foot in hand, exited the store and ran down the street with the manager chasing after him. While running, the appellant discarded the shopping bag which the manager picked up from the ground and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>continued his pursuit. A police officer on cruising duty saw the chase, apprehended the appellant and arrested him. The recovered shopping bag contained three jackets with the store\u2019s price tags still attached and indicating their value to be $38 each. It was at that point during the trial, when the value of the store\u2019s merchandise was adduced, that the State\u2019s Attorney moved to amend the original charge, and the trial court granted the amendments over the appellant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Maryland Rule 714 a. provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">\u201cOn Motion of the State\u2019s Attorney, or on its own motion, the court may permit an indictment to be amended as to matter of form at any time before verdict. The court may permit an indictment to be amended as to matters of substance only with the consent of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The Court of Appeals made the distinction between matters of form and those of substance in <em>Corbin v. State, </em>237 Md. 486, 489-90, 206 A. 2d 809, 811 (1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">\u201cAs to what constitutes substance and what is merely formal in an indictment, it may be said that all facts which must be proved to make the act complained of a crime are matters of substance, and that all else \u2014 including the order of arrangement and precise words, unless they alone will convey the proper meaning \u2014 is formal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">The appellant complains that the amendments of the charging document allowed by the trial court were of legal significance. He suggests that under the original charging document he could only have been found guilty of petit larceny which carries a maximum sentence of a $500 fine and/or imprisonment for not more than 18 months; whereas, under the amended charge he could be and was found guilty of larceny of goods over $100, which offense subjected him to a maximum penalty of not more than a $1,000 fine and/or imprisonment for not more than 15 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">Of significance here then is whether the crime of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>the appellant was convicted was \u201clarceny\u201d or \u201cgrand larceny.\u201d At common law, larceny was divided into two classes: simple, i.e., not accompanied by any circumstance of aggravation; and compound, i.e., committed under circumstances of aggravation. Simple larceny was further divided by law into the classes of grand and petit determined by the value of the property, but both were still felonies with mitigated punishment provided for petit larceny. Maryland law follows this classification by value of property for punishment purposes, and has made larceny under $100 a misdemeanor. <em>Melia and Shelhorse v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 354, 360 n.5, 247 A. 2d 554, 558 (1968); C. Moylan, <em>The Historical Intertwining of Maryland\u2019s Burglary and Larceny Law or the Singular Adventure of the Misunderstood Indictment Clerk, </em>4 U. Balt. L. Rev. 28, 34-38 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Thus, in Maryland our courts have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">\u201c[Ljarceny in this jurisdiction is a crime under the common law. Only the punishment authorized on conviction of it, more severe if the value of the goods stolen is $100 or upwards, and its classification as a felony in such case, are prescribed by statute. Simple common law larceny is the wrongful and fraudulent taking and removal of personal property from the possession of another against his will, with intent to deprive the person entitled, thereto of his ownership therein.\u201d <em>Farlow v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 515, 516-17, 265 A. 2d 578, 580 (1970) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The original charging document set forth all the facts necessary to state the crime of larceny. The value of the property is <em>not </em>an element of the offense and was <em>not </em>required to be stated in the charging document.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">In the early case of <em>Davis v. State, </em>39 Md. 355, 373 (1874), the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">\u201cIf the circumstances which constituted the crime, or increased the punishment, were not set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>out in the indictment, the accused would not be informed of the offense with which he was charged, or of the penalty to which he was liable. <em>These reasons do not apply to a statute, neither creating an offense nor enhancing its penalties, hut dividing a common law offense into degrees and diminishing the punishment. </em>The essential elements of all felonies at common law, such as murder, arson and robbery, have been ascertained and defined by innumerable decisions . . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">This Court had before it an analogous situation involving a charge of receiving stolen goods in <em>Jackson v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 337, 270 A. 2d 322 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>260 Md. 721 (1970). We said at page 348, 270 A. 2d at 327-28:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">\u201cThe value of the goods is not an element necessary to constitute the offense; it did not have to be alleged nor proved as alleged any more than it is necessary to allege in the indictment the name of the thief or the person from whom the property is received. Of course, the State must prove the value of the goods received to establish the punishment authorized and the classification of the offense.\u201d (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">It seems clear to us that the appellant was charged originally with common law larceny, and the question of whether this was petit or grand larceny became a matter of proof at the trial. The amendments allowed by the trial court were, in effect, surplusage; and the proof adduced at the trial could have been received without the necessity of any amendment. The appellant\u2019s contention that the addition of the word \u201cfelonious\u201d over his objection was error is not supported by the Maryland Rules. Rule 712 b. provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-9\">\u201cThe word \u2018unlawfully\u2019 shall cover both a felony and a misdemeanor and it shall not be necessary to use the word \u2018feloniously\u2019 in charging an offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>When in a charging document the facts as originally alleged constitute a crime, the addition by amendment of the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d has been held not to be a change of substance. <em>Woods v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 627, 288 A. 2d 215 (1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>266 Md. 745 (1972). It follows then that the addition of the word \u201cfelonious\u201d is likewise a change in form only, and was properly allowed by the trial court without the appellant\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Lastly, the appellant urges that had he known the value of the store\u2019s merchandise to be over $100 he might have prepared a different defense or adopted a different strategy. This complaint fails to impress us; the facts were available to him by discovery. Beyond that, if he was surprised by the amendments and unprepared to proceed with his defense, he could have requested a postponement of this portion of the trial. The granting of such a request in a nonjury trial would not have caused any serious delay in the disposition of the case. <em>See Gyant v. State, </em>21 Md. App. 674, 321 A. 2d 815 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>272 Md. 742 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
