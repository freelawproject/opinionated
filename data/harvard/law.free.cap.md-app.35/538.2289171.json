In addition to the general grounds customarily assigned, it was claimed in the motion that the trial court erred in certain rulings on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>admissibility of evidence. This appeal has been taken, not from the overruling of the motion, but from the verdict and judgment entered. It is contended on appellant\u2019s behalf that the trial court \u201ccommitted prejudicial errors which denied the plaintiff-appellant a fair trial and an adequate recovery for the injuries sustained.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, it is claimed that under the facts of this case, the trial court erred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">1. In refusing to allow redirect examination of appellant\u2019s neurological surgeon on the issue of causal relationship between the accident and the injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">2. In permitting defense counsel to establish that the appellant and her fiance shared a motel room on a trip to Florida;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">3. In permitting defense counsel to refer in opening statement to a Workmen\u2019s Compensation commission award to the appellant of 30% permanent disability by reason of a prior injury to her low back and in permitting counsel to read to the jury the Order of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">We find the second and third assignments of error to be without merit; and while in our judgment the court erred in refusing to permit redirect examination of appellant\u2019s neurological surgeon, such error has not been shown to have been prejudicial or to have affected the amount of the verdict. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Appellee, Donald Dolan, an employee of appellee, Charles Leitch, was driving a dump truck, owned by Leitch, in a northerly direction on Reisterstown Road, Baltimore County, on November 7, 1973, when he negligently turned in front of the appellant, Catherine H. Feeney,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> operating a 1969 Pontiac and traveling in the opposite direction. The inevitable collision resulted in property damages of $1,157.47 to appellant\u2019s car.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">According to Mrs. Feeney\u2019s testimony, upon impact she was thrown about in her vehicle, striking her head on the windshield, her knee on the steering column, and her side on the left door panel. She was driven from the scene to the law office where she was employed. A physician in the same building examined her. She complained at that time of head and neck pains and a sore knee. The doctor, according to Mrs. Feeney, prescribed bed rest and certain muscle relaxants. The next day she began to experience low back pain, in addition to her previous complaints. She was seen by Dr. Stuart H. Brager, a specialist in internal medicine, board certified, and an instructor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who undertook treatment as her primary care physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Dr. Brager\u2019s examination of the patient the day after the accident revealed a spasm in the paraspinal muscles from approximately the second through the fifth lumbar vertebrae. The palpable spasm in her lower back, he said, resulted in restricted movement not only in forward bending but also in extension and lateral tilt. He recommended a conservative treatment of physical therapy sessions with a \u201cwait and see\u201d attitude, and prescribed painkillers and muscle relaxants. After some 8 to 12 physical therapy sessions, Mrs. Feeney\u2019s office visits with Dr. Brager <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>terminated in January, 1974. Dr. Brager concluded that Mrs. Feeney had \u201ca reinjured lumbar sprain which was superimposed on this prior post-dissectomy status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">As suggested by the internist\u2019s diagnosis, Mrs. Feeney\u2019s back troubles predated the 1973 accident. In May of 1968, while working at the Townhouse Motor Hotel as a clerk, she injured her back in a fall down a flight of stairs. This incident resulted in surgery by the late Dr. Clinton Harrison in July, 1968 at Mercy Hospital. Dr. Harrison\u2019s operative notes were admitted into evidence. They disclosed that he had performed an excision of rupt\u00fcred discs at L4 and L5.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">After the operation by Dr. Harrison, appellant was seen by Dr. Edward G. Reahl, Chief of Orthopedics at Mercy Hospital, who testified that he first examined her in March, 1969, at the request of her attorney, in order to evaluate her condition for a pending Workmen\u2019s Compensation claim arising out of the stairway fall. Her complaints at that time consisted of pain beginning in her back radiating down her left leg all the way to her toes. His opinion was that as a result of the 1968 accident, \u201cshe sustained a herniated lumbar disc with persistent symptoms referable to her back and leg.\u201d On cross-examination he testified, without objection, that her post-operative condition in 1969 amounted, in his opinion, to a 35% permanent partial disability of the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">With respect to the 1973 accident, Dr. Reahl testified that he examined the appellant at the request of her internist, Dr. Brager, in December, 1975. In his opinion, she had a recurrence of the L4-L5 disc as well as a rupture of the L3-L4 disc as a result of the accident, and she had \u201ca significant, residual permanent disability in her back.\u201d He did not, however, recommend a spinal fusion because of her history of pulmonary embolism.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">According to Mrs. Feeney, she was unable to work for one year after the 1968 accident. By early 1970, however, improved by physical therapy, she resumed her employment and normal physical activities and her back presented no significant problems, except for sporadic episodes of pain. On cross-examination, without objection, she admitted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>she received a 30% permanent partial industrial disability from the Maryland Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission as a result of the fall.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">As previously stated, she stopped receiving treatment from Dr. Brager in January, 1974. However, she recounted at trial that her back was \u201cslowly getting worse\u201d during the following months. The appellant and her fiance took a motor trip to Disneyworld, Florida in April, 1974.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Her testimony reveals that the entire drive was uncomfortable and by the time she returned to Maryland, a week later, the deteriorating condition of her back forced her to see Dr. Brager on April 30. An examination disclosed, in Dr. Brager\u2019s opinion, the signs of a ruptured disc. He also stated that, in retrospect, the symptoms, as exhibited by the patient in her December 1973 \u2014 January 1974 examinations, coupled with Mrs. Feeney\u2019s medical history, indicated that the ruptured disc was present when he first saw the patient immediately after her accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Dr. Brager referred Mrs. Feeney to Dr. Jerome Reichmister, an orthopedic surgeon at Sinai Hospital, who placed her in traction and then arranged a consultation with Dr. Neal Aronson, Chief of Neurosurgery at the hospital. The patient remained in traction from May 3rd to May 20th. A myelogram was then performed. Dr. Aronson testified that he and Dr. Reichmister decided, \u201cafter careful consultation with the patient who said she couldn\u2019t live with the symptoms that she had even after a full trial of conservative treatment,\u201d to proceed with exploratory surgery. This decision was made \u201creluctantly\u201d because of appellant\u2019s history of pulmonary embolism after a hysterectomy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>According to Dr. Aronson, he removed a ruptured disc located in the midline between the 3rd and 4th lumbar vertebrae as well as a \u201crecurrent disc rupture\u201d between the 4th and 5th vertebrae. Dr. Aronson stated that the latter rupture was the same disc previously removed in Dr. Harrison\u2019s procedure in 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">On cross-examination, he testified that the results of his final examination of the patient in August, 1975 negatived a spinal fusion because of the success of the May surgery. Although the appellant still complained of occasional nagging backaches, Dr. Aronson found no objective abnormalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Appellant introduced into evidence medical bills aggregating in excess of $8,000. She also testified that as a result of the car accident her loss of wages was approximately $8,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">In his charge to the jury, the trial judge instructed that \u201cthere is no legally sufficient evidence in this case that the plaintiff will require any future medical treatment or incur any future medical expenses other than drugs.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">On direct examination, appellant\u2019s counsel elicited from Dr. Aronson, who performed the exploratory surgery of appellant\u2019s spine in May 1974, the medical history which he obtained from Mrs. Feeney, his findings upon examination, and the results of the operation. Based on the information derived from these three sources, in response to the inquiry whether there existed a causal relationship between \u201cthe rupture that you found\u201d (in May, 1974) and the automobile accident of November 1973, Dr. Aronson stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-10\">\u201cWell, this is a preamble that I always give when I am asked to testify. I was called in as a consultant and a treating doctor in this case. I was not the initial treating doctor who saw this lady after her injury. I have to rely upon her believability and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>honesty as a person in determining causal relationship. <em>If one takes for granted that the history she gave me was correct, then I would have to assume that the recurrence of her disc trouble was the result of the injury that she sustained. </em>But everything depends upon the honesty of the patient, because obviously I did not treat her initially, had not been treating her prior to this accident and was not intimately aware day to day what her symptoms were and how she was doing, remembering that she had prior disc trouble five years before. <em>So if a consultant or a secondary doctor that comes into the picture later on,\u25a0 the history as given by the patient to him is the only thing upon which I can base my conclusions. </em>And, I therefore have to say as I have already stated, <em>if the history given to me is correct, then a causal relationship exists in my opinion.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Apparently in the light of Dr. Aronson\u2019s expressed dependence upon the veracity of the patient in relating medical history, counsel for the appellees on cross-examination exposed certain discrepancies in the medical history upon which the physician had relied. Thus, counsel\u2019s cross-examination established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">1. Dr. Aronson was under the impression that appellant\u2019s low back pain in 1968 radiated into the <em>right </em>leg as compared to her complaint of <em>left </em>leg radiating pain in 1974.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">2. He believed that the appellant\u2019s back complaints began about one month before he saw her, that is, in April 1974, some five months after the car accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">3. He received no history that the appellant complained of her back or received any treatment for her back following the November 1973 accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>On all three points Dr. Aronson\u2019s history was in error. Both appellant\u2019s testimony and the medical records in evidence revealed that the 1968 back injury was productive of pain radiating to the <em>left </em>leg. Furthermore, the appellant\u2019s complaint of low back pain originated within forty-eight hours of the accident and she had received physical therapy treatments under the care of Dr. Brager.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Apparently disturbed by these revelations, Dr. Aronson altered his previous testimony when asked on cross-examination his opinion as to causal relationship. The following appears in the transcript:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">\u201cQ. So that there was a recurrence of the disc at L4-5 resulting from the previous surgery, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">A. <em>I cannot answer that question. I don\u2019t know what it resulted from.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">Q. So you have no opinion as to the cause of the recurrence of the ruptured disc at L4-L5 level, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-9\">A. Can I only say this? Trauma is a very important cause of disc protrusion, and <em>it is not unlikely that the injury that she sustained would have caused a recurrence, although if the symptoms had began immediately thereafter it would be easier to say that a definite causal relationship existed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-10\">Q. Do you have an opinion that you can state with a reasonable degree of medical certainty or probability that the accident of November 7, 1973 caused a recurrence of the ruptured disc at the L4-L5 level?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-11\">A. <em>In terms of reasonable medical probability, I would have to say I\u2019m not sure.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-12\">Q. Do you have an opinion that you can state with a reasonable degree of medical certainty or probability as to whether or not the accident on November 7, 1973 caused the ruptured disc that you found at the L3-L4 level?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>A. <em>The answer is the same, I\u2019m not sure. </em>I think it\u2019s highly possible but I can\u2019t \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">Q. Don\u2019t you know, Doctor, you have been in Court enough times that we do not talk about possibilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">A. That\u2019s right.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">With appellant\u2019s expert witness thus impeached, her counsel on redirect attempted to rehabilitate him. The following colloquy appears in the transcript:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. O\u2019Doherty) Dr. Aronson, in your direct examination you expressed the opinion that the condition you found based on the history was related to the accident of November 7, 1973, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-10\">Q. In your cross-examination \u2014 and you correct me if I\u2019m wrong \u2014 you said that you couldn\u2019t say for sure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-12\">Q. Why did you say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-13\">(Mr. Cadigan) Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-14\">(The Court) Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-16\">Q. (By The Court) Doctor, the question is why you said you were not sure in response to the questions of Mr. O\u2019Doherty and \u2014\u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-17\">A. Because I looked over my notes more carefully. Your Honor, and I saw that there were certain things lacking there that I would really need in order to give a valid answer to that question. <em>That information may exist, but I don\u2019t have it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-18\">Q. (By Mr. O\u2019Doherty) What is that information?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-19\">(Mr. Cadigan) Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-20\">(The Court) Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Q. (By Mr. O\u2019Doherty) You said there were certain factors lacking within the purview of your knowledge. What are those factors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">(Mr. Cadigan) Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">(The Court) Sustained. Come up to the Bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">At The Bench</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6n\">(The Court) I have sustained the objection because you have not gotten to the point the way you\u2019re going at it. You\u2019re taking the approach that you should have taken in direct examination, not in redirect examination. So I am not going to permit you to go any further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">(Mr. O\u2019Doherty) If you don\u2019t mind, since I have to protect the record, by putting my two cents in. I proffer now that I am entitled to know those factors; and I point out to Your Honor that he did not say that was the reason because she gave a history of sciatic pain on the right and not on the left side. <em>I proffer to you what he said before is that he would want to know the history of her condition from, the date of his first examination. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-11\">(The Court) Regardless of what he said, I\u2019m telling you what the impact was, that as soon as he learned that the pain in 1974 radiated down the left leg rather than the right, he said \u2014 the question was put to him immediately after that \u2014 and he said, I\u2019m not sure. My ruling is based upon the fact that you have an opinion which is negated by his cross-examination. You can\u2019t go ahead and try something on redirect that could have been done and should have been done on direct examination. If you want to make another proffer, go ahead.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-13\">The scope of redirect examination rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge, and his discretion is wide. <em>Bailey v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 83, 111, 294 A. 2d 123, 138-39 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>(1972); <em>Fisher Body Division v. Alston, </em>252 Md. 51, 56, 249 A. 2d 130, 133 (1969). Even inquiry into new matters, not within the scope of cross-examination, may be permitted; and a party is generally entitled to have his witness explain or amplify the testimony which he has given on cross-examination and to explain any apparent inconsistencies. <em>Mills v. State, </em>12 Md. App. 449, 461-62, 279 A. 2d 473, 482 (1971). As stated in <em>Poe\u2019s Pleading and Practice:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">\u201cUnder direct examination resumed, the damaging effect of the cross-examination (in cases where it has proved damaging) is sought to be remedied as far as possible. <em>Explanations may be asked and given of injurious matter elicited under </em>cross-examination; and the consistency and accuracy of the witness may be shown. Indeed, the redirect examination of a witness, whom a severe cross-examination has shaken, frequently furnishes occasion for the exhibition of great tact and skill, and an unfortunate mistake or expression may be so adroitly explained away or corrected as to remove the unfavorable impressions created by the cross-examination.\u201d 3 H. M. Sachs, <em>Poe\u2019s Pleading and Practice </em>\u00a7 281 (6th ed. 1975). <em>Accord, </em>4 S. Gard, <em>Jones on Evidence </em>\u00a7 26:30 (1972); 6 J. H. Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 1896 (Chadbourn rev. 1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">And in Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>the following rationale is presented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">\u201cHonest misjudgments and inadvertent omissions often occur during the direct examination, and the repetition of particular parts may be desirable; while, on the other hand, the only danger to be guarded against is the unfair misleading of the opponent by the reservation of important testimony until the redirect examination, when he may have dismissed the needed witnesses in opposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">\u201cAccordingly, the general principle of the <em>trial court\u2019s discretion </em>is here fully recognized as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>sanctioning, when necessary, the exceptional allowance of new testimony which could have been put in before, or of a repetition of matters already testified to.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1896.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">We believe the trial judge should have permitted redirect examination of Dr. Aronson concerning the reasons for his uncertainty on the issue of causation; and that the trial court took too narrow a view in its ruling that appellant\u2019s counsel was improperly seeking to probe, on redirect, into matters that should have been the subject, of direct examination. In the presentation of expert testimony by a treating physician, a party may elicit the witness\u2019 ultimate conclusion and \u201cany details which the expert has personally observed can be elicited on direct or on cross-examination.\u201d <em>Langenfelder v. Thompson, </em>179 Md. 502, 508, 20 A. 2d 491, 494 (1941). This was essentially the situation in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Furthermore, the facts tending to support the expert\u2019s conclusion had, without his knowledge, been testified to by other medical experts; and it was obviously this avenue of inquiry which appellant\u2019s counsel sought to pursue on re-direct. This should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Even if, however, the trial court erred in its ruling, it is incumbent upon appellant to establish that the error was prejudicial. <em>Beahm v. Shortall, </em>279 Md. 321 (1977). Unless the error was \u201cboth manifestly wrong and substantially injurious,\u201d this Court will not reverse. <em>Rotwein v. Bogart, </em>227 Md. 434, 487, 177 A. 2d 258, 260 (1962), <em>quoting 2 </em>J. P. Poe, <em>Pleading and Practice </em>\u00a7 287, at 249 (5th ed. 1925). \u201cAn error which does not affect the outcome of the case is \u2018harmless error.\u2019 \u201d <em>I. W. Berman Properties v. Porter Bros., </em>276 Md. 1, 11-12, 344 A. 2d 65, 72 (1975); <em>accord, Beahm, supra. See Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A. 2d 665 (1976). It is also appellant\u2019s burden, where the adequacy of the verdict is at issue, to show that the amount of the judgment is \u201cindicative of injury to the appellant.\u201d <em>White v. Parks, supra, </em>154 Md. at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Under the circumstances here presented, we conclude that error below was nonprejudicial. In appellant's case in chief, both Dr. Brager, a qualified internist, and Dr. Reahl, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>qualified orthopedist, testified, as treating physicians, that in their opinion the injuries and complaints exhibited by Mrs. Feeney subsequent to the automobile accident of November, 1973 were proximately cause by said accident. Appellant was not, by virtue of the court\u2019s ruling with respect to Dr. Aronson\u2019s redirect testimony, deprived of <em>any </em>expert testimony on the issue of causation. The jury obviously credited the other expert testimony they heard on this issue because they returned a verdict in favor of the appellant for $20,000. In order properly to have reached such a verdict, the jury must have concluded that the element of proximate cause was established. As for the effect of any error on the amount of the verdict, none has been suggested and we perceive none.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Appellant also objects to the trial court\u2019s ruling permitting the appellees to inquire, on cross-examination, whether Mrs. Feeney shared a motel room with her then fiance, now husband, while on a trip to Florida in April, 1974. The affirmative response, the appellant contends, raised \u201ca fair inference that the parties had sexual relations in the room,\u201d thereby prejudicing her in the eyes of the jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Matters concerning the nature and scope of cross-examination \u2014 like those with respect to redirect examination \u2014 are within the sound discretion of the trial court whose ruling will not be disturbed in the absence of a showing of prejudicial abuse of discretion. <em>Fleming v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>277 Md. 655, 679, 358 A. 2d 892, 905 (1976); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>Nottingham Village v. Baltimore County, </em>266 Md. 339, 356, 292 A. 2d 680 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In determining the merits of appellant\u2019s contention it is essential to consider (a) the relevancy or not of the challenged evidence and (b) whether, if it be relevant, any of the recognized exclusionary rules precluded its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">With respect to the first factor, the challenged evidence must be viewed not in isolation but in its circumstantial context. Here, the appellant\u2019s direct testimony tended to establish that the accident of November 7, 1973 was the sole cause of her back problem and her surgery in May 1974, that prior to the accident she was free of symptoms of any low back involvement relating to her 1968 accident. Her own testimony, however, also established that the onset of renewed complaints of pain in the low back area was after the Florida trip and that upon her return from the trip she developed, for the first time since the 1973 accident, radiation of low back pain into her left leg. Accordingly, counsel for the appellees on cross-examination sought to develop that the onset of her disc symptomatology within the time frame of her Florida trip might have been related to (a) the automobile drive itself and (b) appellant\u2019s activities while in transit and in Florida. In this respect she was interrogated about discomfort while driving, visiting Disneyworld, the extent to which she walked, used public transportation and went on the amusements. Because the case presented a large issue with respect to the causal relationship between the 1973 accident and her subsequent back condition and surgery, the relevancy of this evidence is plain; and it is fundamental that relevant evidence being in some degree evidence that advances the inquiry and thus has probative value, is <em>prima facie </em>admissible. <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 185, at 438 (2d ed. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">As for the second point of inquiry, were there counter-balancing factors which should have moved the court to exclude the challenged evidence on the ground that it outweighed its probative value? Chief among such counter-balancing factors is the danger that the fact offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>may unduly arouse the jury\u2019s emotions of prejudice. And as McCormick accurately observes, <em>supra, </em>at 439, n. 31, what is meant here is an undue tendency of the evidence to cause the trier of fact to decide the case on an improper basis \u201ccommonly, though not always, an emotional one.\u201d Because in the instant case all facets of appellant\u2019s trip to and from Florida were explored on cross-examination, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in not acceding to appellant\u2019s request that evidence relating to appellant\u2019s sharing of a motel room with her then fiance, to whom she is now married, was prejudicial and that its probative value was substantially outweighed by the risk that its admission would cause undue or unfair prejudice. <em>See </em>S. Gard, <em>Jones on Evidence </em>\u00a7 4:6 (6th ed. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Finally, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in permitting appellees\u2019 counsel to refer in opening statement to the fact that Mrs. Feeney received a 30% permanent partial industrial disability from the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission as a result of her 1968 low back injury; and also in permitting the same evidence to be read to the jury, during the trial, from the order of the Commission. It is contended that such evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">We find that appellant waived her right to object on appeal to the admission of this evidence, for two reasons. First, the rule is clear that in order properly to preserve an objection to opposing counsel\u2019s alleged prejudicial comments made during argument to the jury, there must be a request for remedial action. A curative instruction must be requested or a motion for mistrial made; a mere objection is insufficient. <em>Dorsey Bros. v. Anderson, </em>264 Md. 446, 454-55, 287 A. 2d 270, 275 (1972); <em>Tully v. Dasher, </em>250 Md. 424, 440, 244 A. 2d 207, 216 (1968). The same principle applies to an opening statement. Here, the appellant merely objected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>the alleged prejudicial comment. Secondly, <em>without objection, </em>the very testimony which appellant sought to exclude was elicited from Mrs. Feeney on cross-examination when she testified that she received a 30% rating as a result of her Workmen\u2019s Compensation claim. The subsequent reading of the percentage from the Commission\u2019s order was merely cumulative and the objection, made at that point, came too late. Maryland Rule 522 d. 2. states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">\u201cTime To Be Made \u2014 Waiver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">Every objection to the admissibility of evidence shall be made at the time when such evidence is offered, or as soon thereafter as the objection to its admissibility shall have become apparent, otherwise the objection shall be treated as waived.\u201d <em>See Forrester v. State, </em>224 Md. 337, 343-44, 167 A. 2d 878, 881 (1961).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Even if the questions were properly preserved, we would find that the trial court\u2019s actions in permitting introduction into evidence of the Commission's determination of percentage disability was proper.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The critical question in this case was whether the appellees\u2019 negligence caused Mrs. Feeney\u2019s injuries, and, assuming causation, to what extent the appellant\u2019s previous injury to her back in 1968 contributed to her present complaints. Evidence of the appellant\u2019s pre-existing back condition was, therefore, extremely relevant to the jury\u2019s determination. <em>See Burns v. Shields, </em>256 Md. 537, 261 A. 2d 161 (1970); <em>Kantor v. Ash, </em>215 Md. 285, 137 A. 2d 661 (1958). The importance of this issue was emphasized by the trial court in its charge to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\"><em>\u201cIt is for you to determine whether any of the plaintiffs present complaints or disability result from the automobile accident in November 1973, or whether they result from her accident at the Town House Motor Motel in May 1968, or a combination of both accidents. </em>If you should find from the evidence, that the plaintiff had disabilities which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>pre-existed the accident involved in this case, nevertheless, if you further find that such accident aggravated such pre-existing disabilities, then the defendants are not relieved of the responsibility for the consequences of their negligence by showing that the injury would have been of less severity if it had been inflicted on someone without the plaintiff\u2019s pre-existing disabilities. On the contrary, the defendants remain liable for all damages and injuries sustained by the Plaintiff, which you find resulted from the aggravation of her pre-existing disabilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\">\u201cIf you find that the plaintiff has a permanent disability to her low back, it is for you to determine whether any portion of that disability pre-existed the accident complained of in this case. <em>You are to award damages only for thdt portion of the permanent disability, if you so find, which you may find was caused by the November 197S accident.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The Commission\u2019s determination of disability was received as evidence of the appellant\u2019s pre-existing condition. Its order did in fact determine an issue relevant to the instant litigation. <em>See McCormick on Evidence, supra, </em>\u00a7 185. Its admissibility is clear. Also before the jury, without objection by appellant, was Dr. Reahl\u2019s evaluation of her disability at 35% and Dr. Harrison\u2019s assessment of 15% to 20%. The <em>weight </em>to be given by the jury to the respective evaluations was not the subject of a requested instruction and the trial court gave none. We find it unnecessary to decide the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\">. The situation here is unlike that presented when there is an alleged inadequacy of verdict but no claim of error by the trial court_ either in its rulings on evidence or in its instructions to the jury. See Kirkpatrick v. Zimmerman, 257 Md. 215, 262 A. 2d 531 (1970) where it was emphasized that the granting of a new trial solely because of inadequacy of damages awarded by a jury was within the sound discretion of the trial court, upon a motion for a new trial, whose action would not be disturbed by the Court of Appeals. <em>See also </em>Leizear v. Butler, 226 Md. 171, 179, 172 A. 2d 518 (1961), and see White v. Parks, 154 Md. 195, 203, 140 A. 70, 74 (1928), where it was held that the size of the verdict can be \u201cgiven weight\u201d in the Court of Appeals only where, \u201cif legal error is found in the rulings of the trial court, it becomes necessary to consider if the amount of the judgment is indicative of injury to the appellant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b563-8\">. At the time of trial appellant had remarried and was sometimes referred to in the proceedings as Catherine Simon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b563-9\">. The bill was introduced into evidence by stipulation between the parties only as evidence of the severity of the collision and not as an element of appellant\u2019s damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b565-7\">. Before the trial commenced, at proceedings in chambers, appellant\u2019s counsel had unsuccessfully sought a ruling by the trial judge that neither the percentage of disability found by the Commission nor the amount of the award was admissible. The trial court ruled, \u201cI am not going to admit the dollar amount, but I am going to admit the percentage. That is a judicial determination.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b565-8\">. At the same proceedings in chambers prior to trial, appellant\u2019s counsel asked for a ruling that the fact that appellant and her fiance shared the same room during this trip was irrelevant \u201cin the absence of any evidence to suggest that something happened in that room to cause her to have a back condition.\u201d This was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b566-11\">. There was no exception by appellant to the instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\">. Appellant, on redirect examination, denied that sexual relations had occurred. The trial court stated, in ruling the evidence admissible, \u201cIt\u2019s a fair inference that they did have sexual relations. Mr. Cadigan states that the lady had not had any medical attention of any kind for some three months prior to the trip, and after the trip the plaintiff complained of pain in her back. So that\u2019s the reason I am going to permit it.\u201d In appellant\u2019s brief, it is stated with some hyperbole, \u201cThe evidence disgraced, humiliated and degraded the witness\u201d and that members of the jury may have felt that her back pain and surgery were \u201cpunishment inflicted by her Creator for her moral transgression and she consequently got what she deserved.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b575-8\">. See n. 4, <em>swpm, </em>with reference to the denial by the court immediately before trial of appellant\u2019s request for the exclusion of this evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b576-11\">. The court did not permit the disclosure to the jury of the monetary amount of compensation awarded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
