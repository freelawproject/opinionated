Ramirez, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 630, 23 O.O. 2d 518, 433 N.E. 2d 586. Appellee essentially proposes two reasons why retirement negates temporary total compensation eligibility: (1) retirement is tantamount to a declaration that a claimant\u2019s condition has become permanent, and (2) retirement breaks the causal relationship between a claimant\u2019s inability to return and the industrial injury. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">In its initial contention, appellee reasons that retirement permanently prevents a return to claimant\u2019s former position of employment. \u201cPermanency,\u201d however, is not defined within that context. In <em>Vulcan Materials Co. </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St. 3d 31, 33, 25 OBR 26, 27, 494 N.E. 2d 1225, 1227, we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">\u201cThe commission\u2019s designation of a disability as permanent relates solely to the perceived longevity of the condition at issue. It has absolutely no bearing upon the claimant\u2019s ability to perform the tasks involved in his former position of employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">We then defined \u201cpermanent\u201d as a:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-13\">\u201c[CJondition which will, * *with reasonable probability, continue for an indefinite period of time without any present indication of recovery therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-14\">A claimant\u2019s permanent inability to return to his former position of employment does not mean the claimant\u2019s medical condition will not improve. Appellee\u2019s argument is thus unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-15\">Appellee also asserts that a retired claimant cannot be temporarily and totally disabled since it is the claimant\u2019s own act of retirement, not the industrial injury, that bars a return to the former job. We concur only with respect to claimants who <em>voluntarily </em>retire. See <em>State, ex rel. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1985), 29 Ohio App. 3d 145, 29 OBR 162, 504 N.E. 2d 451; <em>State, ex rel. Ashcraft, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St. 3d 42, 517 N.E. 2d 533; <em>State, ex rel. Rockwell Internatl., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St. 3d 44, 531 N.E. 2d 678. The \u201cvoluntary\u201d nature of retirement is a disputed factual question within the commission\u2019s final jurisdiction. <em>Rockwell, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-16\">The present commission order does not address the retirement issue. Because the commission improperly overlooked this element in awarding temporary total compensation, the appellate court correctly vacated the commission\u2019s order. However, we also find that the lower court erred in entering an order denying compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-17\">First, resolution of disputed fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>tual matters rests with the commission. Second, the appellate court\u2019s discussion of the retirement issue does not appear to address the element of volition. While its opinion does cite <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin, supra, </em>the present appellate court at no point qualifies its reference to claimant\u2019s retirement with the term \u201cvoluntary.\u201d Indeed, the appellate court\u2019s denial merely stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">\u201cClaimant retired on November 1, 1984, and is therefore precluded from recovering temporary total disability benefits * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Again, retirement <em>per se </em>does not preclude temporary total compensation, only that which is voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Accordingly, we affirm that portion of the appellate court\u2019s judgment vacating the commission\u2019s award of compensation. We reverse that portion of the judgment denying compensation and remand the cause to the commission for further proceedings on the question of temporary total compensation and retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b109-11\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, H.
