A party challenging the court\u2019s jurisdiction has an adequate remedy at law via appeal from the court\u2019s holding that it has jurisdiction. <em>Middleburg Heights </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1986), 24 Ohio St. 3d 66, 68, 24 OBR 215, 216-217, 493 N.E. 2d 547, 549; <em>State, ex rel. Gilla, </em>v. <em>Fellerhoff </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St. 2d 86, 73 O.O. 2d 328, 338 N.E. 2d 522. We therefore agree with the court of appeals that prohibition will not lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">Pearson argues that appeal is inadequate as a remedy because the municipal court may suspend his license pending trial. Such a suspension would not be a final appealable order. <em>Columbus </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St. 3d 57, 60, 10 OBR 348, 350-351, 461 N.E. 2d 887, 890. However, Pearson\u2019s situation is analogous to that of a litigant against whom a preliminary- injunction has been granted. Such an injunction is not a final order, either. See <em>State, ex rel. Add Venture, Inc., </em>v. <em>Gillie </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 164, 16 O.O. 3d 198, 404 N.E. 2d 151. Yet, in <em>Tilford </em>v. <em>Crush </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St. 3d 174, 529 N.E. 2d 1245, we denied prohibition in part because, \u201c* * * while the preliminary injunction cannot now be appealed * * *, review may be had in the event that it becomes permanent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 177, 529 N.E. 2d at 1247. Similarly, if Pearson is convicted, appeal will lie from any sanction, including suspension, that the municipal court may impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">The judgment of the court of appeals denying the writ is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-14\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b120-15\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
