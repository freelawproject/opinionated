The sole issue is whether the proper unit of prosecution for the killing of ducks under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 703 <em>et seq., </em>is each duck killed. The district court ruled that multiple bird deaths resulting from a single transaction cannot be separately charged under the MBTA. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-15\">The defendants were each involved in various capacities with the application of Furadan 4, a registered pesticide, to an alfalfa field which allegedly caused the death of more than 1,000 American Wigeons, a migratory duck. Corbin Farm Service is the dealer/distributor of the Fura-dan. John Richard Harris is an employee of Corbin who provided pesticide advice to farmers with the expectation that they would purchase from Corbin. Patrick W. Feeney is the owner of the alfalfa field which was sprayed. Frank H. Michaud, Jr., is the licensed aerial operator who sprayed the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-16\">The United States, contending it has prosecutorial discretion to charge a violation of the MBTA for each individual duck killed chose ten Wigeons and charged Feeney, Michaud and Harris with their deaths in ten separate counts of a twelve count information. The remaining two counts alleged violations of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136 <em>et seq,, </em>but are unrelated to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-17\">. The defendants filed numerous pretrial motions seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>dismissal of nine of the ten MBTA counts for multiplicity. After extensive briefing the district court filed a lengthy opinion disposing of each of the motions. We affirm the district court and adopt its opinion on the issue of multiplicity as our own. The relevant part of the district court\u2019s opinion can be found at <em>United States v. Corbin Farm Service, et al., </em>444 F.Supp. 510, 527-31 (E.D.Cal.1978) (We adopt the district court\u2019s decision beginning with \u201c(1) Multiplicity\u201d at the top of 444 F.Supp. 527 and continuing through the first full paragraph of the second column at 444 F.Supp. 531, ending with the sentence: \u201cAccordingly, nine of the ten counts brought against defendants Harris, Feeney and Michaud under the MBTA are dismissed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
