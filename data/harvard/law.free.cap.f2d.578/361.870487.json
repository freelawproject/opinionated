The order was issued on June 8, 1976, pursuant to section 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended (\u201cthe Act\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and required the Union to cease and desist from threatening to picket the A-l Security Service Company (\u201cthe Company\u201d) for recognition at a time when it was disqualified from filing a valid petition to be certified under section 9 of the Act as the bargaining representative of the Company\u2019s employees. The Board has cross-applied for enforcement of its order, and jurisdiction is conferred on this court by section 10(e) and 10(f) of the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>The factual setting of this case is not complex. The Company is in the business of providing guard services and had signed a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Guards and Watchmen of America, a rival union to petitioner. Sever<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>al months after the signing of this collective bargaining agreement, the attorney for the petitioner contacted the Company to complain both of contracts the latter had signed with allegedly nonunion contractors and also of the possibility that it was paying substandard wages and benefits. A conference was arranged between the Union\u2019s attorney and the President of the Company, at which the lawyer for the Union made clear to the Company\u2019s President the benefits his business would receive from joining the Union, and the retaliation it could expect if it did not do so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, the Union\u2019s lawyer contacted Illinois Bell, a major source of business for the Company, requested information concerning which Bell sites employed guards from the Company, and stated that the conditions of employment of the A-l Security Service Company were \u201csubstandard.\u201d At the same time, the Union sent a letter to the Company threatening it with what was referred to as \u201carea standards\u201d picketing, <em>i. </em>e., picketing to protest substandard working conditions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and requested certain information about the exact nature of those conditions. The letter disavowed any desire to encourage the Company to recognize the Union or to sign a collective bargaining contract with it. The Company did not respond, and no picketing ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Upon the Company\u2019s complaint, the NLRB, in a 3-2 decision,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> held that the letter threatening \u201carea standards\u201d picketing constituted an unfair labor practice under subparagraph 8(b)(7)(C)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Act because this threat was in fact \u2014 despite the terminology and disavowals of the Union \u2014 a threat to engage in recognitional picketing at a time when the Union was disqualified by law from filing a valid election petition and from being certified as the recognized collective bargaining agent. It is conceded that actual \u201carea standards\u201d picketing, or a threat to engage in such picketing, would not have constituted an unfair labor practice under 8(b)(7)(C).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The NLRB had occasion, however, in 1975 to \u201cpierce\u201d the veil of \u201carea standards\u201d picketing and find a recognitional motive in a decision holding that the same Union and the same lawyer that acted for the Union here had engaged in an unfair labor practice,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and it does so once again in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">Three issues are presented in the instant case. Two are purely legal and one is premised on a factual determination by the NLRB. First, should the Landrum-Griffin Act<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> be construed to proscribe, in certain circumstances, mere threats to picket as well as actual picketing. Second, does the Act allow the \u201creasonable period not to exceed thirty days\u201d provided for recogni-tional picketing under subparagraph 8(b)(7)(C) even though the Union involved is disqualified from certification as a recognized collective bargaining agent under the terms of section 9(b)(3) of the Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Third, is the determination by the NLRB that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>threats made by the Union were threats of recognitional, not \u201carea standards\u201d picketing supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We find that the Board\u2019s interpretation of the Landrum-Griffin Act is both more reasonable and more consonant with the legislative intent than the Petitioner\u2019s, and its characterization of the Union\u2019s threat as one involving recognitional picketing is supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we grant enforcement of the Board\u2019s order and deny the Union\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Petitioner contends that subparagraph (C) of paragraph 8(b)(7) of the Act regulates only actual picketing, not mere threats to picket. However, the Union concedes that the introductory language of 8(b)(7) and subparagraphs (A) and (B) of that paragraph<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> encompass threats to picket as well as picketing itself. Any party attempting to demonstrate that the introductory wording of a section in a statute should be deemed inapplicable to one of its subsections, despite this wording\u2019s conceded applicability to the entire rest of the section clearly must carry a heavy burden of persuasion, and we conclude that Petitioner has not successfully discharged that burden in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The basis for the Union\u2019s argument is that Congress, in prefacing subparagraph (C) with the phrase \u2014 not found in either subparagraph (A) or (B) \u2014 -\u201cWhere such picketing has been conducted,\u201d meant to exclude mere threats from the purview of that subparagraph.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Union maintains that there is an \u201cirreconcilible\u201d conflict between the introductory language of 8(b)(7) as a whole, which explicitly encompasses \u201cthreats to picket,\u201d and the opening phrase of subparagraph (C). Given such a conflict, Petitioner insists that one must examine the legislative intent in order properly to interpret the statute. Characterizing the Landrum-Griffin Act as the result of \u201clegislative compromise reached as a result of intense conflict between competing interests,\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the Union asserts \u2014 without adducing significantly more evidence from the legislative history than the general \u201ccompromise\u201d nature of the Landrum-Griffin Act<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u2014 that the final version of subparagraph 8(b)(7)(C) restricted the scope of that provision to regulating actual instances of picketing.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-18\">Assuming arguendo that there is an apparent inconsistency between the broad language introducing 8(b)(7) and the opening phrase of 8(b)(7)(C)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which necessitates an examination of the legislative history in order to illuminate the meaning of the statute (this history would, of course, be relevant even were there no such apparent conflict), we feel that Petitioner has misconstrued the intent of Congress. Certainly the fact that 8(b)(7)(C) begins with a reference to \u201csuch picketing\u201d rather than \u201csuch picketing or threats to picket\u201d is not persuasive indication of a legislative purpose not to regulate such threats. A statute is not to be read overliterally.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It has long been settled that acts of Congress must be interpreted in light of the spirit in which they were written and the reasons for their enactment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Grammatically, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>one does not usually speak of a threat \u201cbeing conducted,\u201d the introductory phrase of 8(b)(7)(C) is not easily amenable to an interpretation which includes threats to picket within the subparagraph\u2019s expressed purview. However, since we find that the manifest intent of Congress was to treat (1) picketing, (2) causing to be picketed, (3) threats to picket, and (4) causing (threats) to picket as being interchangeable, we restrict threats to picket to the same extent as actual picketing and also, of course, as causing to be picketed and causing threats to picket. We attribute 8(b)(7)(C)\u2019s arguable grammatical anomaly to the grammatical difficulty of literally including the other three objectives of subsection (7) and possibly to less than skillful draftsmanship,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> not to any legislative purpose to exclude the three other objects of subsection (7), and accordingly place little weight on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Were the legislative history silent or neutral on the question of whether the Land-rum-Griffin Act meant to regulate threats to picket under subparagraph 8(b)(7)(C), the phraseology chosen to introduce that subsection might give us pause. In fact, however, the proposal that eventually matured into the current subparagraph 8(b)(7)(C) was referred to throughout the legislative process as applying to both threats to picket and picketing itself<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u2014 as, indeed, did other amendments to the Taft Hartley Act suggested in the Eighty-Sixth Congress.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Senator (later President) Kennedy, the Chairman of the Conference Committee on the Landrum-Griffin Act, in a resolution of instruction explained the effect of 8(b)(7)(C) in terms alluding to situations of threats to picket:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">Under our substitute, if the result of picketing is to deny the entry of goods\u2014 in other words, if the Teamsters say <em>\u201csign up or you will not get any goods,\u201d </em>an early election may be obtained. (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">Senator Kennedy\u2019s remark may be dismissed as no more than merely suggestive of the extent to which it was assumed that instances of threats as well as actual picketing would be comprehended within the rules of the Landrum-Griffin Act, but other legislative statements on the Act are explicit in stating that subparagraph 8(b)(7)(C) was meant to cover both circumstances. The Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare in its \u201cSection-by-Section Analysis\u201d of the Landrum-Griffin Act \u2014 issued after the measure had passed both Houses\u2014 states straightforwardly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-12\">This section [8(b)(7)] makes it an unfair labor practice for a union to picket or threaten to picket where an object is to gain recognition or promote organization of employees <em>under three circumstances . </em>. (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">The \u201cthree circumstances\u201d alluded to can only defer to the three subparagraphs of 8(b)(7). There is no hint that subparagraph (C) was meant to be in any way more restricted in its scope than subparagraphs (A) and (B), and there is no question but that (A) and (B) both encompass threats to picket as well as picketing itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">To the same effect, Senator Goldwater, the ranking minority member of the Senate and Conference Committee, analyzing the Landrum-Griffin Act in an Extension of Remarks in the Senate on the day the President signed the bill, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-15\">Under this provision [8(b)(7)], it is an unfair labor practice for a union, <em>in three </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>specific </em>situations, to picket or cause to be picketed, or threaten to picket or cause to be picketed an employer. (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">This particular remark conformed to the explanatory comment of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare and is important not only because it explicitly states that 8(b)(7)(C) covers threats to picket, but also because it demonstrates that the phrase \u201csuch picketing\u201d in 8(b)(7)(C) on which Petitioner places so much emphasis is indeed only a shorthand for the longer phrase used in the introduction \u201cpicket or cause to be picketed, or threaten to picket or cause to be picketed.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> If Congress had not intended the terms \u201csuch picketing\u201d to refer to the entire antecedent phrase in 8(b)(7) \u2014 the only possible antecedent to which the \u201csuch\u201d might refer \u2014 but only to a part of it, it would normally have taken more care to enumerate exactly which parts of the antecedent language it intended to excise from the purview of subparagraph (C). The generality of the phrase \u201csuch picketing\u201d indicates, as does Senator Goldwater\u2019s comment, that it was meant simply as an abbreviation for the cumbersome introductory phrase \u201cpicket, or cause to be picketed, threaten to picket or cause to be picketed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Were it not for semantic difficulties with applying the verb form \u201chas been conducted\u201d to a threat to picket,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> there would be little reason to suppose that \u201csuch picketing\u201d did not refer to the entirety of the introductory phrase in 8(b)(7). This difficulty, however, is not of sufficient dimension to preclude our affirming the Board\u2019s interpretation by adopting what we take to be the most reasonable reading of the statute in light of both its syntactical structure and legislative history. Although the Union insists that the statutory language is utterly inconsistent with the position that threats to picket should be included in regulations established by subparagraph (C),<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> in fact, we find that this language in fact lends support to an interpretation of the Landrum-Griffin Act which treats picketing and threats to picket as on a par. Although the parties did not brief the issue, it is of significance that Congress in formulating the statute chose to repeat the phrase \u201cor cause to be picketed\u201d after both \u201cto picket\u201d and \u201cto threaten to picket\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents . to picket or cause to be picketed, or threaten to picket or cause to be picketed.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">The parallelism of the phrases in which \u201cto picket\u201d and \u201cthreaten to picket\u201d are used is an indication of the extent to which Congress considered picketing and threats to picket to present parallel problems. The syntax of the sentence supplies an affirmative statement \u2014 at least as persuasive as the grammatical anomaly of referring to threats \u201cbeing conducted\u201d is for the Union\u2019s position \u2014 that Congress desired to afford similar treatment to threats to picket and to actual picketing.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">Although the specific question of whether a threat to picket is within the purview of 8(b)(7)(C) is one of first impression, the NLRB has consistently interpreted this introductory language as applying to all three of the subparagraphs of 8(b)(7), and we see no reason in either the legislative history or in the plain words of the statute, to dispute the Board\u2019s interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-12\">At the risk of laboring the obvious, it is important to note that structurally as well as grammatically, the subparagraphs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>(a), (b), and (c) are subordinate to and controlled by the opening phrases of section 8(b)(7).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\"><em>Int\u2019l Hod Carriers, Local 840 (Blinne Construction Co.), </em>135 NLRB 1153, 1159 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Petitioner insists, supported by a dissenting member of the NLRB,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> that the interpretation of the statute which we embrace above has led the NLRB to deal more harshly with threats to picket than with actual picketing (thereby raising some possible First Amendment problems) and also is at odds with the spirit of the Landrum-Griffin Act which elsewhere specifically protects speech and publicity.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> This argument is premised on the concept that while actual picketing in order to continue for thirty days (and so exhaust the \u201cgrace period\u201d provided for recognitional picketing under 8(b)(7)(C)) must be actually engaged in during 30 days, the NLRB deems that a threat is \u201cbeing conducted\u201d until it is withdrawn, without need of constant renewal.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> It is, however, the nature of a threat to continue until it is retracted. If a man threatens an assault on a certain day, the effect of his statement can hardly be said to lapse by the next day. Furthermore, that the Act specifically protects speech in some instances is irrelevant to the question of whether or not it was intended to regulate threats to picket. To maintain otherwise would be no more convincing than to argue that as the Constitution protects some forms of speech, it must also protect threats and extortion. In fact, one of the primary concerns of the legislators who engineered the Landrum-Griffin Act \u2014 far from guaranteeing protection for all forms of speech \u2014 was providing for the control of extortionate behavior by the unions<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and such activity can take place through the medium of threats as easily as through actual picketing. It is also significant that section 8(c), which exempts discussion and argument from proscription as an unfair labor practice, does not protect expression that includes a <em>\u201cthreat </em>of reprisal or force . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Certainly the Constitution does not prohibit the regulation of such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">Whereas speech is oftentimes protected more than conduct because, <em>inter alia, </em>it has less tangible results,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> it is not the case that threats to picket usually tend to be less deleterious to the interests of an employer than actual picketing. Indeed, depending on how the threat is made known, it may have virtually the same effect as an actual picket line. To take an obvious example, if in a largely union town an important union announced \"in a local newspaper its threat to picket a certain employer, the results could be as devastating as those any actual picketing might produce; indeed, perhaps more so, as more persons might be reached by the advertisement than would actually have seen a picket line. There is, in fact, no rigid dichotomy possible between threatening to picket and picketing; threat is a significant aspect of picketing itself, and a threat to picket may accomplish the same coercive objective as actual picketing.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-13\">In sum, in light of the legislative history, the similarity in effect between threats to picket and actual picketing, and the wording of the Landrum-Griffin Act, it would have required a far more convincing demonstration of congressional intent to exclude threats to picket from the provisions of 8(b)(7)(C) than Petitioner has been able to supply for this Court to overturn the Board\u2019s decision. The Union has at most convinced us that the statute, like some others, is not a model of clarity,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> but it has produced no persuasive arguments that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Congress did not mean in 8(b)(7)(C) to reach the same type of conduct as is specifically covered by the other subparagraphs of 8(b)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Under the terms of 8(b)(7)(C), picketing, or a threat to picket, constitutes an unfair labor practice unless a petition is filed with the NLRB within a reasonable period not to exceed thirty days requesting an expedited certified election to determine the proper collective bargaining representative. A union may continue its recognitional picketing during this \u201creasonable period.\u201d In the instant case, the NLRB felt, however, that the time limitation was more or less inoperative, and that it was not necessary to determine whether or not Petitioner\u2019s threat to picket had continued for a reasonable period not exceeding thirty days, because the Board determined that, as the Union in question had voluntarily admitted into its membership employees other than guards, it had \u2014 under a long line of NLRB precedent<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and section 9(b)(3) of the Act<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> disqualified itself from being certified as the collective bargaining representative for guard employees. Because Petitioner could never be certified, the Board ruled that any petition for a certified election that it might file would be a nullity and that accordingly, \u201cany recognitional picketing of A-l Security that Respondent [here the Petitioner] might engage in for <em>whatever duration, </em>would be a violation of section [sic] 8(b)(7)(C).\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Thus, the Union violated 8(b)(7)(C) the moment it threatened recognitional picketing, not a month later.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Petitioner on the other hand, argues that the wording of 8(b)(7)(C) expressly makes irrelevant, insofar as the status of petitions for certified elections under that subpara-graph are concerned, considerations of whether or not the petitioner could ultimately be certified as a collective bargaining agent. 8(b)(7)(C) states that the NLRB shall consider petitions under that section \u201cwithout regard to the provisions of section 9(c)(1)<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> or the absence of a showing of a substantial interest on the part of the labor organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">The Union argues that the provision that the Board shall consider 8(b)(7)(C) petitions without regard to section 9(c)(1) mandates that issues of whether a valid question of representation has been raised are explicitly removed from the Board\u2019s consideration in acting upon such petitions. The proper course, in a.situation where the petitioner cannot be certified is, Petitioner maintains, for the Board to hold an election and certify the arithmetical result, even though it cannot certify the Union as the bargaining representative.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Petitioner contends that the point of 8(b)(7)(C) was not to bar all recognitional picketing by uncertifiable groups, but only such picketing which continues for more than a reasonable time. Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 24. The short answer to this contention is that any amount of recognitional picketing by an unrecognizable group is unreasonable. Because the petition process is not a nullity under this interpretation of 8(b)(7)(C), the Union contends that it cannot be held \u2014 due to the up to thirty day \u201cgrace period\u201d \u2014 in violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">We are unconvinced by this somewhat imaginative interpretation that the Petitioner would have us give to the statute, nor will we accept the Union\u2019s invitation to regard section 9(b)(3) of the Act, prohibiting the certification of unions containing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>both guards and non-guards as the collective bargaining agent for the guards, as totally unrelated to the status of petitions for certified elections under 8(b)(7)(C). The position the Board adopts on this point has recently been sustained by this court in <em>Drivers, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers Local No. 71 v. NLRB (Wells Fargo Armored Service Corporation), </em>180 U.S. App.D.C. 192, 553 F.2d 1368 (1977), and we see no reason to suggest deviation from the rationale or result there put forward. In that opinion, we pointed out that 8(b)(7)(C) \u201cappears to contemplate picketing by way of prelude to an election,\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> and drew the logical conclusion that where a party is disqualified from winning an election as certified bargaining representative, he cannot make use of the procedures that are intended to lead to that result.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Those cases in which the Board has allowed a non-certifiable union to participate in an election established not the <em>right </em>of such unions to participate, but rather only the discretion of the Board to allow them to do so, a discretion \u201cwithin that area of expertise in which courts hesitate to interfere,\u201d 180 U.S.App.D.C. at 200, 553 F.2d at 1376, citing <em>Miami Newspaper Printing Pressmen\u2019s Union, Local 46 v. McCulloch, </em>116 U.S.App.D.C. 243, 248 n.11, 322 F.2d 993, 998 n.11 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The present case is factually slightly different from <em>Wells Fargo </em>in that there the NLRB had actually dismissed petitioner\u2019s 8(b)(7)(C) request for an election, whereas here no such petition was filed; but the principle underlying <em>Wells Fargo </em>is on all fours with that we adopt in disposing of this appeal. When the characteristics of a union conclusively preclude it from becoming a certified representative, the Board in its discretion may consider an 8(b)(7)(C) petition by such a union a nullity on its face. That the Board has occasionally allowed a non-certifiable union to participate in a certified election and receive an arithmetical certification of the results <footnotemark>42</footnotemark> does not mean that the union has any <em>right </em>to participate, nor that the Board must delay the safeguards that 8(b)(7)(C) was designed to extend to the employer because of the possibility that a union may file a futile and dilatory petition for an election it cannot win and in which the union often may not even participate. It should also be noted that 9(c)(1), after specifying certain requirements for filing petitions relating to certification, additionally provides that the Board is not required to hold a hearing or to direct an election unless it first finds that \u201ca question of representation . exists . . . .\u201d It is hard to find that a question of representation exists if the petitioner is disqualified from being certified as a representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">The necessary consequence of our decision is that only groups eligible to be recognized can picket for recognition or take advantage of the up to thirty day \u201cgrace period\u201d provided in 8(b)(7)(C) for recogni-tional picketing. The reasonableness of this result suggests that it is in fact a far more rational and plausible interpretation of the congressional intent in legislating the Land-rum-Griffin Act than the tortured construction that Petitioner would have us adopt. Throughout paragraph 8(b)(7), Congress was explicitly concerned with the problems of recognitional picketing<footnotemark>43</footnotemark>; and it is farfetched to argue that it implicitly intended to establish a special procedure to allow non-recognizable unions to engage in such picketing. Prima facie it would seem logical to assume that such unions would be precluded from such picketing. It would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>require a much more affirmative statutory statement than we find in the Landrum-Griffin Act for us to agree that Congress had intended to establish as unlikely a procedure \u2014 a procedure in which, despite Congress\u2019 tying the strictly limited opportunity for recognitional picketing it provided to the expedited holding of an election,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> a union unable to participate in such an election would be granted recognitional picketing privileges \u2014 as Petitioner suggests we should discover here.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The Board\u2019s position on the status of 8(b)(7)(C) petitions is more consonant with the underlying purpose of the Landrum-Griffin Act than is Petitioner\u2019s. The objective of subsection 8(b)(7)(C) was to provide <em>employers </em>the relief afforded by an expedited election process in order to reduce the harassment of recognitional picketing, so that they in turn would not coerce employees to join unwanted unions.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark>' It would be a complete distortion of the legislative intent to allow the election petition, designed to protect the employer, to become a vehicle for allowing a month of recognitional picketing by a body which could never become a certified representative. The Landrum-Griffin Act may well have been, as the Union insists, the result of a legislative compromise \u2014 so indeed is most legislation; but the basic thrust of the portions of the statute considered here was clearly alleviating the hardships caused to employers by the unfair labor practices of unions. This being the case, it is hard to credit Petitioner\u2019s suggestion that Congress meant in 8(b)(7)(C) to provide a method by which unions, foreclosed from recognition, could be granted an opportunity to harass employers through recognitional picketing. One would more probably expect an absolute bar on such picketing by uncertifiable unions than an elaborate \u2014 and inexplicit\u2014 provision for its occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The fact that 8(b)(7)(C) states that the Board shall order an election \u201cwithout regard to the provisions of section 9(c)(1)\u201d\u2014 does not mean that the Board must hold elections even where the union is foreclosed from certification, but only that it should not go through the time-consuming process of investigating to determine whether \u201ca question of representation affecting commerce\u201d exists. This provision seems intended to protect the employer by assuring expedition of the election process, not to force the Board to conduct meaningless elections and employers to endure up to a month of futile picketing. If the union involved is certifiable, the NLRB is directed to hold an election without further inquiry; but the Board need not blink at the fact that the union is disqualified on its face, <em>i. e., </em>no \u201cquestion of representation ... exists\u201d (see 9(c)(1)). Were this an issue of first impression we would be inclined to agree with the NLRB\u2019s interpretation of the interrelationship of 8(b)(7)(C) and 9(c)(1); and we certainly see no reason to overrule either the previous decisions of the Board or to suggest overruling our own recent opinion on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The mere fact that subparagraph 8(b)(7)(C) covers threats to picket as well as actual picketing will not alone bring Petitioner\u2019s conduct within the purview of the Act unless there was a recognitional or organizational objective underlying the Union\u2019s activity.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> It is well settled that picketing merely to protest substandard working conditions is not an unfair labor practice under 8(b)(7)(C).<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Thus, a threat to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>engage in such picketing would also not be an unfair labor practice, and Petitioner maintains that the picketing it threatened was designed as just such a protest, not to secure recognition for the Union.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The NLRB, however \u2014 despite the protestations of the Union \u2014 determined that there was a reeognitional object in Petitioner\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> As this determination is a question of fact, it must be upheld here if it is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">There can be no question but that there was substantial evidence in support of the Board\u2019s findings concerning the Union\u2019s motivation. It is not necessary that the organizational or reeognitional motive be either the sole or even the predominant objective behind the conduct alleged to violate subparagraph 8(b)(7)(C).<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> This provision of the Landrum-Griffin Act applies so long as recognition or organization is even one among many objectives in the picketing or threat to picket, and it would strain credulity to maintain that recognition was not an objective here. A short description of the NLRB\u2019s evidence in this regard suffices to demonstrate that substantial evidence supported the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The evidence of substandard conditions at the Company which allegedly moved Petitioner to threaten picketing was unclear and not particularly convincing in the first instance,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> and even this information was refuted to some extent by the president of the Company at his conference with the Union\u2019s attorney. It is unlikely, and the Board was certainly justified in refusing to believe, that Petitioner was motivated to threaten picketing exclusively by such dubious evidence of substandard conditions at the Company. Indeed, the letter in which the Union threatened A-l Security with picketing also contained a first request for the type of information which the Union would need in order to know with confidence whether in fact the Company fell below the area standard.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Clearly this fact suggests that it was at least not solely information concerning the conditions of employment at the Company which had elicited the Petitioner\u2019s threat to picket.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">Not only is the evidence of area standards violations by the Company so sketchy that it is hard to believe that the Union would in fact have relied on it alone in deciding to threaten picketing, but also the NLRB had ample indications that a recogni-tional motive was in fact at work. During the conference with the President of A-l Security, Petitioner\u2019s lawyer was blunt in his encouragement to the Company to deal with the Union, and went so far as to emphasize the advantages to the employer of doing so and the retaliatory action that would attend a refusal to cooperate with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the Union.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> It is true that the Union\u2019s correspondence with A-l Security explicitly disclaimed any Union interest in reaching a contract with the Company,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> but such self-serving avowals need not necessarily be credited,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> and the NLRB was clearly acting within its statutory authority and on substantial evidence when it refused to take these remarks at face value. In this connection it is a fact of some consequence that the same Union and lawyer had recently been found in violation of 8(b)(7)(C) in a case where their correspondence with the company involved made similar ritualistic disclaimers of recognitional motives.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The Union may well have been acting partly out of concern over what it believed to be the possibility of substandard working conditions at A-l Security, but this is insufficient to immunize Petitioner from liability under the Landrum-Griffin Act.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Moreover, even if the Union\u2019s object was not to gain formal recognition, a union\u2019s purpose is deemed \u201crecognitional\u201d where it attempts to force its collective bargaining agreement upon persons it does not represent.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s insistence that the Company live up to its own \u201cBlue Book\u201d standards may reasonably be so characterized.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The NLRB cites other evidence probative of the recog-nitional aspects of the Union\u2019s threats to picket<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> but we find it unnecessary to discuss the further points they raise, because the few we have mentioned provide ample proof that the Board acted upon substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">Finding that threats to picket are regulated under subparagraph 8(b)(7)(C); that a union disqualified from certification as a recognized collective bargaining agent may not engage in recognitional or organizational picketing \u201cfor a reasonable period not to exceed thirty days\u201d under the provisions of 8(b)(7)(C); and that substantial evidence supported the Board\u2019s determination that the picketing which Petitioner threatened in this case was motivated at least in part by a recognitional objective, we deny the Union\u2019s petition and grant the Board enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-13\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et seq. </em>(1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b467-22\">.
