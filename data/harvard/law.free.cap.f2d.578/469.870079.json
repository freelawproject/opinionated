Stevenson High School in Bronx County. His work was rated as \u201csatisfactory\u201d for the year 1971-72, but for the year 1972-73 he was rated \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d by Leonard Littwin, the school\u2019s Principal, and Bertram Linder, the Assistant Principal and the Chairman of the Social Studies Department. Longarzo\u2019s certificate of unsatisfactory service was endorsed by Bertha Gordon, the Acting Assistant Superintendent for Bronx High Schools. Gordon failed to inspect Longar-zo\u2019s work or consult with him, in violation of \u00a7 41(3)(e) of the bylaws of the Board of Education.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-17\">Longarzo appealed the unfavorable rating pursuant to \u00a7 105a of the bylaws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Irving Anker, the Chancellor of the Board of Education, convened a three-member Chancellor\u2019s Review Committee comprised of Dennis A. Hayes, Norma Klass and Herbert Siegel to review the rating. The committee conducted a hearing on January 9, 1974, and later recommended to the Chancellor that the rating of \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d be upheld. On March 25, 1974, the Chancellor executed an order in which he sustained the rating and dismissed the appeal. Longarzo then instituted a special proceeding in the New York State Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the CPLR<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>sought to annul the Chancellor\u2019s determination. The state court held that \u00a7 41(3)(e) of the bylaws had been violated and that Lon-garzo had been denied liberty and property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>In re Longarzo v. Anker, </em>78 Misc.2d 977, 358 N.Y.S.2d 936 (Sup.Ct. Kings County 1974). The court entered a judgment which annulled the Chancellor\u2019s order dismissing the appeal, substituted an order sustaining the appeal, expunged the unsatisfactory rating from Longarzo\u2019s records, and returned to Lon-garzo all salary increments lost as a result of the unfavorable rating. The judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division, which agreed that the Board\u2019s bylaws had been violated but expressed no view on the due process issue. 49 A.D.2d 879, 373 N.Y. S.2d 199 (2d Dep\u2019t 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">On June 15,1975, Longarzo filed his complaint in the instant action; he alleged that his right to due process had been violated. His claim was based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983,1985 and 1986 and the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The basis for federal jurisdiction was 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. Although the complaint survived challenges based on claims of mootness, res judicata and the statute of limitations, it was nevertheless dismissed for a variety of other reasons: Littwin and Linder had never been served with process, so the complaint was dismissed as to them for lack of jurisdiction; the complaint failed to allege racial discrimination, so it failed, to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981; under <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>532 F.2d 259 (2d Cir. 1976), <em>cert. granted, </em>429 U.S. 1071, 97 S.Ct. 807, 50 L.Ed.2d 789 (1977), the Board of Education is not a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of the Civil Rights Act, so the district judge dismissed the claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985 and 1986 against the Board; the constitutional claims against the Board were dismissed on the theory that no direct cause of action lies under the Fourteenth Amendment; Longarzo\u2019s remaining claims against the remaining defendants were dismissed for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted because \u201cthere is nothing more a federal court could do to remedy his injuries than has already been accomplished in the state court proceedings.\u201d On this appeal, Longarzo argues that he has stated a claim because his expenses in the state court proceeding and his emotional distress are both compensable injuries. <em>See Davis v. Village Park II Realty Co., </em>578 F.2d 461 (2d Cir. 1978). We affirm the judgment below, but for reasons different from those relied on by the district court. <em>Helvering v. Gowran, </em>302 U.S. 238, 245, 58 S.Ct. 154, 82 L.Ed. 224 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides: \u201cnor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d To be entitled to the procedural protections of that amendment, Longarzo must allege that he has been deprived of an interest in \u201cliberty\u201d or \u201cproperty.\u201d An examination of the complaint discloses that he has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The closest Longarzo comes to alleging a deprivation of a property right is where he complains that the defendants deprived him of \u201chis right to tenure and illegally extended] his probationary year.\u201d In order to have a property right in their employment, teachers must have tenure or \u201cde facto tenure.\u201d <em>Gentile v. Wallen, </em>562 F.2d 193, 197 n.5 (2d Cir. 1977). Longarzo, as a probationary teacher, has no such right. <em>See Rocker v. Huntington, </em>550 F.2d 804 (2d Cir. 1977) (per curiam). If his dismissal would not have deprived him of \u201cproperty\u201d within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, then the mere extension of his probationary status certainly did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">More clearly articulated, but equally insubstantial, is Longarzo\u2019s allegation that he was deprived of a liberty interest. In <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>preme Court said that an employment termination could infringe a protected liberty interest if the State made \u201cany charge against [a teacher] that might seriously damage his standing and associations in his community,\u201d or if it \u201cimposed on him a stigma or other disability that foreclosed his freedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573, 92 S.Ct. at 2707. In later cases, however, the Court has made it clear that this interest cannot be infringed upon without a showing that the State publicized the reasons for the termination. <em>Board of Curators v. Horowitz, </em>435 U.S. 78, 83, 98 S.Ct. 948, 952, 55 L.Ed.2d 124 (1978); <em>Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 348-49, 96 S.Ct. 2974, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976). Longarzo has failed to allege that the defendants ever publicized the fact that he had received an unfavorable rating or the reasons for the rating. Thus, it is clear that Longarzo has failed to state a cause of action and his complaint was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-10\">. On January 5, 1977, the Board of Education adopted a resolution which had the effect of repealing \u00a7 41 as a bylaw and continuing it as a regulation of the Chancellor. Section 41(3)(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-11\">[Assistant superintendents] shall examine the work of teachers . . . who were rated unsatisfactory . . . . No certification of unsatisfactory service made by assistant superintendents shall be accepted and filed as an official report unless supplemented by proper data showing that the said certification is based upon inspection of work during the current school year and consultation with the teacher so rated, and that notice of the unsatisfactory rating has been given to such teacher.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b574-19\">.
