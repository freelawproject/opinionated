The initial order and the order denying rehearing were issued on October 4 and December 3, 1976, respectively, in response to the Tribe\u2019s application for a \u201csmall producer\u201d certificate to authorize sales of natural gas to pipeline companies. The denomination as a small producer<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> exempts an independent producer from many of the filing requirements under the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 717-717w, and normally allows the producer to charge a higher rate for its gas than that allowed to large gas producers. 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 157.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-20\">The Tribe applied for the certificate because it wished to sell for resale in interstate commerce royalty gas produced from wells on its reservation in New Mexico. The wells are located on land leased to El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Northwest Pipeline Corp. The leases <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> contain royalty provisions allowing the Tribe to take cash in payment or, on 30 days notice, to take payment in kind. It was the Tribe\u2019s election to take its royalty in kind which was the genesis of this appeal. The Tribe intended initially (for about 18 months) to sell all of its royalty gas to El Paso and Northwest for resale in interstate commerce. Ultimately, however, the Tribe intended to use most of the gas for its own industrial needs on the reservation, selling only the amount unused to El Paso and Northwest on a day-to-day basis. The Tribe\u2019s application for a certificate to authorize the sale of their gas was required under provisions of the Natural Gas Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 717a(6), 717f(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-21\">In the orders under review the FERC granted the Tribe a small producer certificate but restricted the price which could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>charged for the royalty gas to the lower rate applicable to large producers. The FERC further held that the Tribe would have to obtain abandonment authorization pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(b) before it could remove the royalty gas from the interstate market and apply it to their own industrial needs. The Tribe objects to both of these requirements 6n appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">I. Abandonment Authorization [1,2] Under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(b), no natural gas company may abandon all or any portion of any source rendered by means of facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC without Commission approval. This provision has been most recently construed by the Supreme Court in <em>California v. Southland Royalty </em>Co., \u2014\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014 , 98 S.Ct. 1955, 56 L.Ed.2d 505, a case which is directly relevant to the issue before us. <em>Southland Royalty </em>restated the established rule that once natural gas is \u201cdedicated\u201d to interstate commerce under a certificate of public convenience and necessity, that gas may not be withdrawn from the interstate market without prior Commission approval. 98 S.Ct. at 1958, <em>citing Sunray Mid-Continent Oil Co. v. FPC, </em>364 U.S. 137, 156, 80 S.Ct. 1392, 4 L.Ed.2d 1623. The Tribe asserts this rules is inapplicable in this case because their royalty gas has never been dedicated to the interstate market. Their argument is premised on the fact that they reserved the option to take their royalty in kind in the lease. El Paso and Northwest, being at all times subject to this provision as lessees, had no legal power to dedicate this gas to interstate commerce. This argument is made despite the fact that all the gas produced from the wells is either sold, or commingled with gas being sold, interstate by El Paso and Northwest under FERC certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">We believe the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Southland Royalty, supra, </em>requires rejection of the Tribe\u2019s arguments. The respondents in <em>Southland </em>made the identical claim as is made by the Tribe in this case, that is, \u201c \u2018no man can dedicate what he does not own.\u2019 \u201d 98 S.Ct. at 1960. The Supreme Court rejected this argument on the grounds that \u201cdedicating gas to the interstate market . . . does not effect a gift or even a sale of that gas, but only changes its regulatory status.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). The basic thrust of the Court\u2019s opinion was that the service obligation imposed by the Natural Gas Act is paramount to any private contractual arrangement. This obligation, once imposed, requires the flow of gas to the interstate market until abandonment authorization has been obtained. <em>Id. </em>at 1958.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We hold that the FERC did not err in that portion of its ruling regarding abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">II. Price Ceiling</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">Under applicable FERC regulations, a small producer is allowed to charge a higher price for its gas than the price ceiling set by the Commission for large producers. 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 157.40(c). The higher rates are in recognition of the generally higher risks, higher costs, and lower production of the small company. <em>See generally FPC v. Texaco Inc., </em>417 U.S. 380, 94 S.Ct. 2315, 41 L.Ed.2d 141. In anticipation of potential abuse, however, the FERC provided that the higher rates would not be available to a small producer whose gas reserves \u201cwere acquired by the <em>purchase </em>of developed reserves in place from a large producer.\u201d 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 157.40(c) (emphasis added). In the order before us the FERC held that the Tribe\u2019s election to take their royalty payments in kind rather than in cash was \u201ctantamount to a purchase\u201d of the gas from El Paso and Northwest within the meaning of \u00a7 157.40, thus disqualifying the Tribe from the small producer rates. With all due deference to the Commission\u2019s interpretation, we must disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>The provisions of the lease involved in this case are not disputed. The Tribe was to be paid a royalty of l/6th of the value or amount of all gas produced on the leased property. Section 4 of the lease provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">The lessor expressly reserves:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">(c) Royalty in kind \u2014 The right to elect on 30 days\u2019 written notice to take lessor\u2019s royalty in kind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">We believe this express reservation of the unqualified right to take royalty in kind precludes a conclusion that the Tribe has in any way \u201cpurchased\u201d this gas. We do not agree with the PERC\u2019s characterization of the election as an exchange of cash for gas. There is no exchange involved here at all, much less an exchange which could reasonably be deemed a purchase as that term is commonly understood. The Tribe was simply exercising its right to choose one means of payment over another.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Although we need not, and do not, base our decision on state law concepts of property interests created by oil and gas leases, we do find persuasive support from a number of cases discussing such interests. <em>See Waggoner Estate </em>v. <em>Wichita County, </em>273 U.S. 113, 47 S.Ct. 271, 71 L.Ed. 566; <em>Henley v. United States, </em>396 F.2d 956, 972-75, 184 Ct.Cl. 315. <em>Thompson v. Thompson, </em>149 Tex. 632, 236 S.W.2d 779, 784-85. In <em>Wag-goner, </em>a state tax case, the Supreme Court decided that a lessor\u2019s reserved right to receive a portion of the oil produced on the leased property as royalty was properly taxed as real property. The Court could find no basis in the lease provisions for concluding that the lessor had granted or conveyed away his entire interest in the oil. 273 U.S. at 118, 47 S.Ct. 271. The ownership of the royalty oil was deemed to have remained in the lessor \u201cwho retained the power of disposition and the right to receive possession . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>The other cases cited above reach a similar conclusion that a royalty owner who reserves the right to receive payment in kind has not conveyed away his entire interest in the oil or gas. Having retained a percentage interest in the property, it would be illogical to hold that the same percentage was subsequently \u201cpurchased\u201d by the royalty owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">In its brief, the FERC argues that its ruling is supported by <em>Mobil Oil Corp. v. FPC, </em>149 U.S.App.D.C. 310, 463 F.2d 256, <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 976, 92 S.Ct. 2409, 32 L.Ed.2d 676. That case held that lessors, royalty owners were not engaged in \u201csales\u201d of natural gas merely by accepting royalty payments pursuant to their leases. The FERC argues that this conclusion is correct because the entire ownership of the gas produced under the lease is in the lessee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The conclusion in <em>Mobil Oil </em>that royalty owners are not sellers of natural gas was not based on any concept of ownership or title, however. <em>See </em>464 F.2d at 259. The court found, rather, that a royalty owner was not a \u201cseller\u201d in any commonly understood sense of that term. Our decision that the Tribe is not a purchaser of its royalty gas is based on much the same reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">In sum, we find the FERC\u2019s application of its regulation so as to disqualify the Tribe from small producer rates because it \u201cpurchased\u201d its royalty gas from a large producer to be without legal foundation. We recognize the longstanding rule, cited by the FERC, that an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation is entitled to great deference on appeal. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Larionoff, </em>431 U.S. 864, 872, 97 S.Ct. 2150, 53 L.Ed.2d 48; <em>Bowles v. Seminole Rock Co., </em>325 U.S. 410, 414, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 89 L.Ed. 1700. The rule is based on the agency\u2019s greater expertise in the area they regulate. <em>See Perine v. William Norton &amp; Co., </em>2 Cir., 509 F.2d 114, 120. When the administrative interpretation is not based on expertise in the particular field, however, but is based on general common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>law principles, great deference is not required. <em>See Texas Gas Transmission Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., </em>363 U.S. 263, 270, 80 S.Ct. 1122, 4 L.Ed.2d 1208. In interpreting the word \u201cpurchase,\u201d the FERC relied primarily on property concepts developed and enunciated by the common law. <em>See </em>Brief for Respondent at 16 \u2014 17. \u201cSince the decision of the Commission was explicitly based upon the applicability of principles of [law] announced by courts, its validity must likewise be judged on that basis.\u201d <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 87, 63 S.Ct. 454, 459, 87 L.Ed. 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The orders are affirmed in part and reversed in part. The c\u00e1se is remanded to the FERC for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-16\">. A small producer is defined generally as an independent producer of natural gas whose sales in interstate commerce did not exceed 10,000,000 mcf (thousand cubic feet) at 14.65 p.s.i.a. during any calendar year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b394-23\">. The leases involved are on standard government form 5-157 (7/64) distributed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs for oil and gas leases covering tribal lands.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\">. We do note one difference between <em>South-land Royalty </em>and the case before us. The lessors in <em>Southland </em>did not reserve the right to take their royalty in kind. <em>Id. </em>at 1962, n.5 (Stevens, J., dissenting). This point does not support a different result. The fact remains that <em>all </em>of the gas covered by the lease here was initially dedicated to the interstate market. For the reasons stated above, any subsequent withdrawal by the Tribe, even by exercise of their reserved option, requires abandonment authorization.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b396-9\">. The FERC cites, in support of this conclusion, dictum in <em>J.M. Huber Corp. v. Denman, 5 </em>Cir., 367 F.2d 104, 113-14. However, the Fifth Circuit itself indicated that this statement should not be made without qualification. See 367 F.2d at 113 n.30, 114. In addition, the leases at issue in <em>Denman </em>apparently did not contain a reservation of the right to receive payment in kind, a distinction which we obviously believe to be critical. <em>See id. </em>at 107 n.4</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
