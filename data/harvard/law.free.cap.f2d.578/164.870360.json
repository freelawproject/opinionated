We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP0\">The District Court has jurisdiction of this action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (1970). <em>See also Bell </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678 [66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939] (1946). We believe the complaint states a cause of action under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388 [91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619] (1971). We recognize that <em>Bivens </em>dealt with a Fourth Amendment violation, but its logic appears to us to be equally applicable to a First Amendment violation. <em>See generally Moore </em>v. <em>Koel-zer, </em>457 F.2d 892 (3d Cir. 1972); <em>States Marine Lines, Inc. v. Shultz, </em>498, F.2d 1146 (4th Cir. 1974).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-15\"><em>Yiamouyiannis v. Chemical Abstracts Service, </em>521 F.2d 1392, 1393 (6th Cir. 1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-16\">As an instruction to the District Court as to which fact issues to try, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-17\">Fundamental to appellant\u2019s cause of action, of course, is proof that his discharge was state action. In this regard appellant contends (and appellee denies) that CAS is federally funded to the extent that his discharge must be regarded as governmental action. Alternatively appellant contends (and appellee denies) that the HEW exerted financial pressure upon CAS to silence or fire appellant. These assertions and denials pose questions of fact upon which findings must be made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-18\">If these questions are answered favorably to appellant, there must also be a finding of fact as to whether appellant was, in practical effect, discharged or whether, as appellee contends, he resigned voluntarily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av\"><em>Id. </em>at 1393.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-20\">On remand it appears that the District Judge conducted an evidentiary hearing limited to the state action question. The appeal currently before this court as to the issue of state action relies solely upon the fact that Chemical Abstracts Service has a charter from the federal government. We must therefore assume that no evidence, or insufficient evidence, was presented on the fact questions which we identified in our previous consideration of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-21\">The District Judge held that the chartering by Congress of this corporation was insufficient to establish state action, and again dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>The fact that Congress has seen fit to charter an organization otherwise private in character does not, by the mere fact of chartering, render the action of the officers of that organization \u201cstate action.\u201d This court previously passed on this question in <em>Northrip v. Federal National Mortgage Assn., </em>527 F.2d 23 (6th Cir. 1975). <em>See also Stearns v. Veterans of Foreign Wars, </em>394 F.Supp. 138 (D.D.C.1975), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>174 U.S.App.D.C. 78, 527 F.2d 1387, <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 822, 97 S.Ct. 72, 50 L.Ed.2d 83 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">We have considered appellant\u2019s reliance upon <em>McCulloch v. Maryland, </em>17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819), but do not find that it is applicable to either the facts or legal argument in our instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
