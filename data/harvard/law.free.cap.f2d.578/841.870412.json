The Union had earlier filed a petition for review of the Board\u2019s order, but that petition has been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">In our opinion, the issues in this case are the same as those decided in <em>Acco Construction Equipment, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>511 F.2d 848 (9th Cir. 1975). The Board correctly found that Article XIX affects secondary employers such as manufacturers and equipment dealers because it requires post-warranty workers utilized in repair or service work to be covered by the collective bargaining agreement. <em>See National Woodwork Mfrs. Ass\u2019n. v. NLRB, </em>386 U.S. 612, 644-45, 87 S.Ct. 1250, 18 L.Ed.2d 357 (1967). The Union\u2019s second contention is that, even if Article XIX is a hot cargo clause, it is permitted by the construction industry proviso of Section 8(e), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(e). In the Union\u2019s view, while the clause states that it covers work performed \u201cat or near\u201d the jobsite, the clause has actually been interpreted to mean \u201con\u201d the jobsite, and as so interpreted, the clause falls within the proviso. We find this argument unpersuasive. The clause must be considered to mean what it says.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">The order of the Board is enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b946-6\">. Article XIX reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-7\">Section 1. Employees covered by this Agreement shall be used on all maintenance, servicing and repair work except that machinery covered by a manufacturer\u2019s written guarantee is not subject to this Agreement under the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-8\">(a) No warranty shall run for a period of more than 1000 meter or working hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-9\">(b) The term \u201cequipment\u201d or \u201cmachinery\u201d means a complete unit such as a shovel, crane, tractor, scraper, compressor, etc., and does not include component assemblies such as motors, transmissions, etc., which are installed in equipment. The intent of this paragraph is to stop the practice of chain warranties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-10\">(c) Equipment which is rented, leased, or is on a rental purchase contract, in which ownership resides in the dealer, shall be considered to belong to the contractor for the purpose of this Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-11\">(d) On used equipment, a dealer\u2019s warranty shall not exceed 300 hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-20\">(e) Warranty mechanics shall supervise such work at or near the job site and use the tools of the trade, assisted on all work by employees covered by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Warranty Mechanics shall not work at a ratio greater than two Warr\u00e1nty Mechanics for each Contractor Mechanic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-21\">Section 2. It is expressly understood and agreed to by all parties hereto, that when the contractor\u2019s equipment is repaired (work other than warranty work) at or near a job site by a manufacturer, equipment dealer or individual, the contractor shall be required to see that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are complied with. The Employers shall not use any method or means to circumvent the intent of this Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-22\">Section 3. If the Employer violates the above it will not be a violation of this Agreement for the Union to refuse to operate such equipment until an arrangement has been reached with the Union.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
