VII.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The foundation is a nonprofit corporation which under contract with the federal government operates \u201cJob Corps\u201d centers at which underprivileged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>and minority youths are given vocational and academic training. The district court found that the Foundation had discriminated against Calc\u00f3te because of his race, in his starting salary and in his merit pay increase, and that Calc\u00f3te, who resigned, had been constructively discharged. The court granted back pay and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">We affirm on the opinion of the district court, as supplemented . and amended by this opinion. The underlying findings of fact are set out at length in the opinion of the district court. On this appeal the Foundation does not to any substantial extent question the underlying findings of fact but rather attacks the court\u2019s conclusions drawn from them. Plainly Calc\u00f3te made out a prima facie case of racial discrimination, and the burden shifted to the Foundation to refute it by a preponderance of evidence showing legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons. <em>Turner v. Texas Instruments, </em>555 F.2d 1251, 1256 (C.A.5, 1977). The facts adequately support the inferences drawn by the trial court that the Foundation was racially motivated in setting Calcote\u2019s original salary and in setting the amount of his merit pay increase and that Calcote\u2019s working conditions were made intolerable by these discriminations in pay and the harassment inflicted upon him by supervisor Dancy on racial grounds, so that Calc\u00f3te was constructively discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">With respect to the issue of discrimination against Calc\u00f3te in starting salary, under the undisputed testimony of defendant\u2019s personnel manager McClure, initial hiring classifications were based upon the applicant\u2019s training and experience. Under these standards Calc\u00f3te, hired as a residential counselor at $900 per month,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was entitled to a higher classification than Archie David, a black, who was employed shortly before Calc\u00f3te and given the higher classification of vocational counselor at $950 per month. McClure attempted to explain the differences in classification and salary on the ground that David was hired earlier and when Calc\u00f3te was hired no position as vocational counselor was open. The difficulty with this is that a few days after Calc\u00f3te complained to EEOC of racial discrimination in the setting of his salary David\u2019s salary was reduced to approximately that of Calc\u00f3te, and the explanation given for this is that there had been a \u201cregrettable error\u201d in setting David\u2019s salary when he was employed. In these circumstances the district court was entitled to, and impliedly did, reject time of employment and availability of positions as valid explanations for the disparities between Calc\u00f3te and David and to infer that the disparities were racially motivated.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Other evidence supports the court\u2019s conclusion of racial motivation in treatment accorded Calc\u00f3te in the terms of his hire. Approximately three months after Calc\u00f3te was employed as a residential counselor at $900 per month, the Foundation hired a black, DeShay, also as residential counselor, at $1,025 per month. His training and experience were less than Calcote\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">Ten months after Calc\u00f3te was hired the Foundation eliminated the two job classify cations of vocational and residential counselor and merged them into a single classification called simply \u201ccounselor\u201d and assigned to this new position the salary schedule previously followed for residential counselors. The revamping was arguably neutral to this point, although the Foundation acknowledges that the dual classification previously employed may have been illogical and unwise, but, as part of the revamping those persons formerly vocational counselors, including David, were permitted to retain their salary schedules, which were higher because of their previous classifications as vocational counselors. In short, Calc\u00f3te and other residential counselors were frozen into their lower pay scale while the vocational counselors, including David and other blacks, kept their higher scale. The only purported explanation for this disparity is testimony that upon reclassification everyone was permitted to keep his prior salary level so long as he was making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>the minimum for the new job classification. This was merely a restatement of what occurred and not an explanation of the reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">With respect to disparate treatment in merit pay increase, no explanation was given of why Calc\u00f3te, who received a higher performance rating than David, was given a smaller pay increase, or of why, in Cal-cote\u2019s case and contrary to usual practice, the recommendation of his supervisor was overridden at a higher level. The written recommendation of Calcote\u2019s supervisor had been changed, and the change bore the initials of a white personnel officer, but the evidence is silent on the personnel officer\u2019s reasons for departing from usual practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Calcote\u2019s claim of constructive discharge was based upon the salary and merit pay discrepancies already discussed and upon alleged harassment by Ras Dancy, a black supervisor. The court found that Dancy did harass Calc\u00f3te in several aspects, as described in findings 23 through 27. An additional and undisputed fact not noted by the district judge is that the meeting of counselors held for the purpose of writing a letter to assist former supervisor Wilson, a white, who had been fired and replaced by Dancy, was held with the knowledge and approval of the personnel officer who was himself present. Also Calc\u00f3te was one of a committee that drafted the letter of recommendation and prepared the inscription for a plaque which the counselors gave to former supervisor Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The deficiency report incident deserves further discussion. Dancy had a deficiency report placed in Calcote\u2019s file stating that Calc\u00f3te had been absent from the project eating a meal when he should have been on duty. The court accepted the testimony of Calc\u00f3te concerning this matter. Calc\u00f3te was deeply concerned about the report because he thought it would adversely affect his future as a professional counselor. He talked with Dancy and explained that he was not improperly off the project at the time Dancy reported him absent. Dancy acknowledged he only assumed that Calc\u00f3te had no authority to be off the project and promised to check into the matter. Dancy did nothing, and Calc\u00f3te made two additional requests of Dancy, but Dancy never took any action.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">After working three months under Dan-cy\u2019s supervision Calc\u00f3te resigned despite urgings by the assistant personnel director that he complain to EEOC of racial discrimination rather than resign.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">With respect to Dancy\u2019s attitudes toward whites in general, the testimony was in conflict. The district judge, however, considered that the testimony of Wilton Lo-max, a former counselor who had worked under Dancy at the job center and was the only disinterested witness, tipped the balance. The judge accepted Lomax\u2019s testimony that Dancy was a racist who tried to \u201ccut down\u201d whites, talked down to them for no apparent reason, seemed to be \u201cplaying with\u201d them, and was obsessed with \u201cgetting even\u201d with all whites.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">In Tit. VII cases this circuit and others have drawn from NLRB cases the constructive discharge doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-12\">[I]f the employer deliberately makes an employee\u2019s working conditions so intolerable that the employee is forced into an involuntary resignation, then the employer has encompassed a constructive discharge and is as liable for any illegal conduct involved therein as if it had formally discharged the aggrieved employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ae-dedup-0\"><em>Young v. Southwestern Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>509 F.2d 140, 144 (C.A.5, 1975). <em>See also Muller v. United States Steel Corp., </em>509 F.2d 923 (CA10), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 825, 96 S.Ct. 39, 46 L.Ed.2d 41 (1975); <em>Thompson v. McDonnell Douglas, </em>416 F.Supp. 972 (E.D.Mo.,1976); EEOC Decision No\u2019s 74-05, July 13, 1973; No. 71-1413, Mar. 12, 1971; No. 72-0779, Dec. 30, 1971; No. 71-1545, Mar. 30, 1971; No. 72-0661, Dec. 27, 1971; No. 72-1100, Feb. 17, 1972. The district judge in his \u201cDiscussion\u201d did not use the word \u201cdeliberately\u201d or \u201cintentionally\u201d in describing the constructive discharge doctrine, although the authorities he referred to contain that requirement. In his Conclusions of Law he held that \u201cPlaintiff was constructively discharged by defendant as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>result of the latter\u2019s making working conditions intolerable by allowing the violations of Title VII noted above.\u201d The defendant is a corporation which can only operate through its authorized personnel. The decision concerning Calcote\u2019s starting classification was made in the personnel office. The decision concerning his initial salary (reduced from $950 to $900) was made by someone further up the hierarchy than the person who interviewed Calc\u00f3te in the personnel office. The decision to give Calc\u00f3te a lower merit pay increase than his supervisor recommended was made by the personnel officer, either on his own or on the instruction of someone with more authority than he. With respect to the acts of Dancy specifically directed at Calc\u00f3te, Dancy was Calcote\u2019s supervisor, and the acts done by him were within the course of his duties as supervisor. This alone would, we think, support a finding that Dancy\u2019s acts were \u201cdeliberate\u201d acts of the Foundation. We also note, however, that the incident at the counselors\u2019 meeting occurred in the presence of the personnel officer, and Calc\u00f3te took up with the personnel office the matter of the deficiency report\u2019s having been placed in his file by Dancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">We think the Conclusions of Law of the district court should be expanded to reflect in Conclusion 3 that the actions which caused Calcote\u2019s working conditions to be intolerable were deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The Foundation has not attacked the award or the amount of attorney fees. In any event, in a Tit. VII case the award of attorney fees to the successful plaintiff is discretionary with the court. <em>Christianburg Garment Co. v.
