Subject Matter Jurisdiction\u201d and \u201cII. Standing,\u201d which reversed the district court\u2019s award of back pay to class members and held that though Thurston now lacked standing, we would reach the merits of the suspension and dismissal rules of the municipality. We substitute the following matter in place of the deleted sections:</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-21\">I. Subject Matter Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-22\">Thurston rests jurisdiction for this action upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The City of Jacksonville claims this suit is, in reality, a suit against the city; that the jurisdictional grant included in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 is limited to suits against \u201cpersons\u201d; that municipalities are not persons; and therefore, suits against municipalities are not allowed under \u00a7 1983. The legal principles upon which the city\u2019s claim was based have been substantially altered by the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services of City of New York, </em>436 U.S.-, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). That case overruled <em>Monroe v. Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-25\">Local governing bodies , . . can be sued directly under \u00a7 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where, as here, the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body\u2019s officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-26\">[However] ... a local government may not be sued for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents. Instead, it is when execution of a government\u2019s policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>government as an entity is responsible under \u00a7 1983.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1273-6\">436 U.S. at---, 98 S.Ct. at 2035.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-7\">Because the district court did not have the benefit of <em>Monel] </em>when it acted, we vacate its award of back pay to class members and remand this issue for further consideration in light of <em>Monell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-8\">II. Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-9\">To the extent that the district court may determine that Thurston\u2019s suit was directly maintainable against the city or its officials, Thurston clearly had standing to bring this action. However, even if it is determined that standing was legally lacking, the purposes of that legal theory were fulfilled by the presence of an adversary context which remained concrete throughout the entire proceedings. Even though standing were to be subsequently determined not to exist because of a change in law, this court should now reach the merits. We also delete the first sentence of the final paragraph of our judgment and substitute therefor the following sentence:</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-10\">The order of the lower court concerning the payment of back pay is VACATED and this portion of the cause is remanded for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-11\">Vacated and Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
