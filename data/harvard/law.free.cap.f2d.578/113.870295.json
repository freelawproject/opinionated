Bethlehem Steel contends that the ALJ erred in admitting, over objection, the ex <em>parte </em>report from Clayton\u2019s personal physician who had examined Clayton a number of times since the accident. Bethlehem Steel further contends that if the physician\u2019s report is excluded as hearsay there is insufficient evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s findings. No responsive brief has been filed. We agree with Bethlehem Steel and remand the case to the ALJ for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">Our decision in this case is controlled by <em>Southern Stevedoring Company v. Voris, </em>190 F.2d 275 (5th Cir. 1951). That case also involved a claim under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act as well as a challenge to the admission of ex <em>parte </em>statements from doctors. As we said in that case, \u201cBy admitting these ex <em>parte </em>statements, upon which the deputy commissioner apparently based his decision, at least in part, the right of cross examination was effectively denied appellants upon a crucial issue. Even under the liberal provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, we can not sanction this practice.\u201d 190 F.2d at 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\"><em>Southern Stevedoring </em>has not been overruled by later cases. Dicta in <em>Young and Company v. Shea, </em>397 F.2d 185, 188 (5th Cir. 1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>395 U.S. 920, 89 S.Ct. 1771, 23 L.Ed.2d 237 (1969), stated that hearsay was admissible in proceedings under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act. But <em>Shea </em>did not purport to announce a different rule and, in fact, depended upon <em>Southern Stevedoring. </em>Moreover, <em>Shea </em>directly relied upon a Second Circuit case, <em>Rocker v. Celebrezze, </em>358 F.2d 119 (2d Cir. 1966), which had held that hearsay was admissible in Social Security hearings. In a later Fifth Circuit case, however, this court carefully distinguished claims under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act from those under the Social Security Act. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Perales, </em>412 F.2d 44 (5th Cir. 1969). <em>Perales </em>reasoned that because of the different statutory provisions, ex <em>parte </em>statements could be admitted under the Social Security Act though they could not be used under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act. In reversing this court\u2019s decision, the Supreme Court did not disturb this analysis of proper procedures; instead the Supreme Court reached a different conclusion based upon the facts. <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">The decision and order is vacated and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-15\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
