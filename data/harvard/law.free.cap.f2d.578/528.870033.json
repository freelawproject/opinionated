After arraignment and the entry of a plea of not guilty, he moved the District Court for an order protecting him from cross-examination at trial with reference to any criminal convictions more than ten years old, pursuant to Rule 609(b), Federal Rules of Evidence. The motion was overruled. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>He renewed his motion at the conclusion of the Government\u2019s evidence at trial; the District Court again denied it. In this posture of the case, the defendant chose not to testify. Following submission of the cause to the jury, a verdict of guilty was returned. The defendant appeals, claiming error in the denial of his motions to bar his criminal convictions which were more than ten years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Whether the District Court committed error in denying appellant\u2019s motions turns on the proper application of subdivision (b), Rule 609, Federal Rules of Evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That subdivision forbids the use of any criminal conviction more than ten years old for purpose of impeaching the credibility of a defendant \u201cunless the court determines, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Senate Report on this subdivision made it crystalline that the District Court was only to depart from the prohibition against the use for impeachment purposes of convictions more than ten years old \u201cvery rarely and only in exceptional circumstances.\u201d It went further and marked out the strict limits within which the District Court must act if it exercises a discretion to permit the use of such convictions for impeachment, <em>i. </em>e., it must determine that the probative value of the conviction, <em>\u201csupported by specific facts and circumstances * * * substantially </em>outweighs its prejudicial impact\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is significant that the Rule prescribes not simply a determination or finding by the District Court but one supported by <em>\u201cspecific,\u201d i. e., </em>articulated, facts. And the burden of establishing such \u201cspecific facts and circumstances\u201d supportive of the District Court\u2019s determination is imposed on the Government.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nor is it improper for the defendant, in order to determine his course at trial, to move in advance of trial, as did the appellant, for a ruling by the District Court on the admissibility of any conviction more than ten years old, which the Government might intend to offer for purposes of impeaching the defendant\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>There were four convictions of the appellant found by the District Court admissible at trial, in the exercise of its discretion under 609(b). The first of these convictions was sodomy and was twenty-five years old; the second, twenty-one years old, was for probation violation; the third, fifteen years old, was for forgery, and the final one, seven years old, involved the interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle. In finding such convictions admissible, the District Court made no express finding that the probative value of any of the convictions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201csubstantially\u201d outweighed their prejudicial impact nor did it state any \u201cspecific facts and circumstances\u201d in support of any such finding; it simply denied the motions. And it denied the motions without any information about the convictions beyond their mere identification and without any real argument on the impeachment value of the several crimes held admissible or of the facts involved in the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Despite the language of the Rule requiring a finding based on \u201cspecific facts and circumstances\u201d as a predicate for admitting the three convictions more than ten years old, it is the position of the Government on this appeal that the District Court, in the exercise of its discretionary power under 609(b) is not required to make any express or \u201cspecific\u201d findings and that it is perfectly permissible under the Rule for the Court simply to rule as did the District Court here that the motion to exclude is denied.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">The Rule is plain and unambiguous in our opinion. It obligates the District Court, as we read it, to make a finding and that finding must be, not, as in subdivision (a)(1) of the Rule, a mere finding that probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect, but that the probative value of the conviction \u201csubstantially\u201d outweighs its prejudicial effect. Moreover, since the power is to be exercised only in the \u201crare\u201d and \u201cexceptional\u201d case,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the District Court is required under the Rule to support its finding with \u201cspecific facts and circumstances.\u201d This requirement of a finding supported by \u201cspecific facts and circumstances\u201d is, as we see it, entirely inconsistent with the Government\u2019s argument that such requirement may be satisfied simply by the bare ruling on the part of the District Court that the conviction is admissible. That argument might be made in connection with 609(a), which includes no requirement of supporting reasons for the District Court\u2019s determination but it cannot be ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>vanced under 609(b). The Senate Report which recommended the relevant language of 609(b) stated in explanation of the language of the subdivision unequivocally that the decision to admit a conviction more than ten years old had to \u201cbe supported by specific facts and circumstances thus requiring the court to make specific findings on the record as to the particular facts and circumstances it has considered in determining that the probative value of the conviction substantially outweighs its prejudicial impact.\u201d U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. at p. 7062 (1974).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, Congress in giving the District Court a narrow and limited discretion under its formulation of 609(b) to admit a conviction more than ten years old for purposes of impeachment, hedged the exercise of that discretion about by a clearly defined constraint capable of being satisfied only by a specific finding resting on \u201cspecific facts and circumstances.\u201d This conclusion follows, also, from the Government\u2019s own admission that the District Court\u2019s decision to admit such conviction is subject to appellate review for abuse.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is axiomatic that in the absence of any findings by the District Court and any articulation of the \u201cspecific facts and circumstances\u201d supporting its decision, there can be no meaningful appellate review of that decision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As we have suggested in a number of decisions, appellate review in such circumstances would be a \u201cmeaningless gesture,\u201d an empty formality, and a \u201cgame of blindman\u2019s buff.\u201d <em>Appalachian Power Co. v. Environmental Pro. Agcy. </em>(4th Cir. 1973) 477 F.2d 495, 507, with cases cited, <em>modified on other grounds Union Electric Co. v. Environmental Protection Agency, </em>427 U.S. 246, 254, 96 S.Ct. 2518, 49 L.Ed.2d 474; <em>see, also, </em>the cases discussed in Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise, </em>1970 supp., \u00a7 1612. We conclude that 609(b) requires the District Court, if it concludes to admit thereunder a conviction more than ten years old, to find that the probative value of such conviction \u201csubstantially outweighs\u201d its prejudicial impact and to support that finding with an identification of the \u201cspecific facts and circumstances\u201d which support its decision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">It may be that no appellate court has given to the Rule the precise construction in this regard which we have. In fact, two recent cases may appear superficially inconsistent with such view. <em>United States v. Mahone,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>United States v. Cohen.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Mahone, </em>the District Court, unlike the District Court here, did, however, hear argument \u201cregarding the nature of the prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>conviction\u201d and did make an express finding that the probative value of the conviction outweighed its prejudicial effect \u201c \u2018on the basis of the record now before it.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Circuit Court concluded that the District Court\u2019s declaration that its finding was based on \u201cthe record\u201d represented an implicit indication that the Court had \u201cweighed the prejudicial effect against the probative value of the evidence.\u201d It did proceed, though, to urge prospectively that trial judges make explicit Rule 609 findings on the record. In <em>Cohen, </em>the Court \u201cfound that trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the prior [state] conviction where it made a thorough and thoughtful analysis of the pertinent factors though it did not explicitly make findings which appellate court suggests should be done pursuant to Rule 609(b).\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Court did add, however, that \u201cRule 609(b) may envision a more explicit proceeding with full findings setting forth the quality and nature of any possible prejudice to the defendant,\u201d [544 F.2d 786] and it had earlier stated that, \u201c[t]he Rule requires a finding of specific facts and circumstances that prejudicial effect will be outweighed by probative value.\u201d [544 F.2d at 785]<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">As we have already stated, we are convinced that the Rule <em>did </em>envision \u201cexplicit proceeding with full findings\u201d to which <em>Cohen </em>adverted as a basis for the District Court\u2019s exercise of discretion under 609(b). And we think that <em>United States v. Smith, supra, </em>which is the most complete exposition of the Rule to date, points rather clearly in the direction we have taken in our construction of 609(b) and would seemingly find that the positive commands of the Rule were to be observed as written.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Similarly, <em>United States v. Townsend </em>(7th Cir. 1977) 555 F.2d 152, 159, suggests the same construction of the Rule. There, the Court, though it was dealing with a trial antedating the effective date of 609(b), found that the District Court had intended to abide with the Rule and that, in his comments to counsel in ruling on the issue, \u201cadequately indicated why he thought \u2018the probative value of the conviction[s] supported by specific facts and circumstances substantially outweighs * * * [this] prejudicial effect,\u2019 as <em>required by the new Rule.\" </em>(Italics added.) Finally, Judge Weinstein in his text on the Rules takes this same view. He states:</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">\u201c[T]rial judges should make their determination after a hearing on the record * *, at which the pertinent factors are explicitly identified and weighed.\u201d 3 Weinstein &amp; Berger, Rules, at 609-79 (1977 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">Even if it be assumed that the District Court was not obligated under the Rule to make an express finding based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>\u201cspecific facts and circumstances\u201d as authority for admitting a conviction more than ten years old, it would seem difficult, if not impossible, in any event for a court to find on a bare record such as that here that the probative value of a twenty-five year old sodomy conviction on a party\u2019s credibility \u201csubstantially\u201d outweighed its prejudicial impact. Under the Rule, the pivotal issue of the probative value of a conviction turns largely on a consideration of the nature of the conviction itself. This follows because the purpose of impeachment is not \u201cto show that the accused who takes the stand is a \u2018bad\u2019 person but rather to show background facts which bear directly on whether jurors ought to believe him * <em>Gordon v. United States </em>(1967) 127 U.S. App.D.C. 343, 347, 383 F.2d 936, 940, <em>cert. denied </em>390 U.S. 1029, 88 S.Ct. 1421, 20 L.Ed. 2d 287. Accordingly, in general it is a conviction which bears on \u201cwhether jurors ought to believe\u201d the witness or party that' qualifies for impeachment purposes.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The crimes which are generally spoken of as meeting this test of giving a basis for an inference of a \u201cpropensity to lie\u201d and which \u201cbear directly on whether jurors ought to believe him\u201d are those which \u201crest on dishonest conduct,\u201d <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>or carry \u201ca tinge of falsification,\u201d <em>United States v. Ortega </em>(9th Cir. 1977) 561 F.2d 803, 806, or involve \u201c \u2018some element of deceit, untruthfulness, or falsification,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Thompson </em>(9th Cir. 1977) 559 F.2d 552, 554.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>See, also, United States </em>v. <em>Cox </em>(5th Cir. 1976) 536 F.2d 65, 71; <em>United States v. Bastone </em>(7th Cir. 1975) 526 F.2d 971, 982-3, <em>cert. denied </em>425 U.S. 973, 96 S.Ct. 2172, 48 L.Ed.2d 797; Note, <em>California\u2019s Use of Prior Convictions to Impeach a Criminal Defendant, </em>9 <em>U. of San Francisco L.Rev. </em>491, 505 (1975); Krauser, <em>The Use of Prior Convictions as Credibility Evidence: A Proposal for Pennsylvania, </em>49 <em>Temple L.Q. </em>291, 302 (1973). The prejudicial effect arising out of the admission of the sodomy conviction against the defendant in this case was obviously substantial and the Government in its brief in this Court so concedes. Without more in this record, we would conclude that the ruling that the conviction of sodomy was permissible under Rule 609(b) was a manifest abuse of discretion and would require a reversal, unless it can be said such error was harmless.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">In determining whether the error in ruling that the sodomy conviction was usable in cross-examination of the appellant under 609(b) was harmless, we are left with the same problem faced by the Court in <em>United States v. Smith, supra, </em>179 U.S.App. D.C. at 180, 551 F.2d at 366, <em>i. e., </em>the standard of harmlessness to be applied. The Government\u2019s case here was purely circumstantial. . The defendant\u2019s connection with such circumstances was the critical issue of the case. Only the appellant was in a position to offer any explanation with reference to those circumstances which might be helpful to the appellant. When the prosecution rests on the effect to be given to a chain of circumstances, a court can never be sure that a defendant\u2019s own testimony and explanation of such circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>stances, if given, may not have influenced the jury. We cannot, therefore, say any more than the Court in <em>Smith </em>was able to say, \u201cwith fair assurance * * * that the judgment [of the jury] was not substantially swayed by the error\u201d arising from the ruling that the out-of-date convictions was admissible, since, by reason of the District Court\u2019s erroneous ruling, the appellant was denied the opportunity to give his explanation of the incriminating circumstances to the jury. Accordingly, whether we apply the standard of harmless error as articulated in Kotteakos<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> or <em>Chapman,</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it cannot be said that the error in the ruling of the District Court with reference to the sodomy conviction in particular was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED FOR A NEW TRIAL.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-6\">.

In particular, we need not decide whether the lack of such a finding inevitably implies a failure to exercise meaningfully the discretion conferred upon the trial court by Rule 609. Likewise we do not reach the question of whether a trial judge must provide an on-the-record explanation of his Rule 609 findings. However, it must be obvious to any careful trial judge that an explicit finding in the terms of the Rule can be of great utility, if indeed not required, on appellate review, <em>see Dorszynski v.

For failure by the District Court to state its \u201cspecific\u201d reasons for finding them admissible, the probation violation conviction and the forgery conviction of the appellant were, in our opinion, as inadmissible as the sodomy conviction under 609(b). However, if this procedural defect were not present, it might be that the forgery conviction would have probative value on credibility, though we do not have occasion to rule on that point at this stage, but, in any event, whether such probative value would have outweighed \u201csubstantially\u201d prejudicial impact should have been carefully considered. Since the record is barren of any details of the probation violation it is difficult, however, to see how the District Court could have justified the ruling as to this conviction.

I have examined West Virginia Code, Chapter 62, Article 12, especially \u00a7 62-12-10, and do not find that violation of probation is a separate crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">I further think the judgment remanding the case for a new trial is sustainable for somewhat the same reasons given by the panel as its opinion requires an express finding that the probative value of the convictions substantially outweigh their prejudicial effect, and I might not comment on the requirement of stating specific facts and circumstances as mentioned in the rule were that all.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">But the breadth of the opinion of the panel is so great that I think an analysis of it and the rule should be undertaken. Not the least of my objections is its discussion of the consideration, by their nature, to be given various felonies when offered for the purpose of impeachment. The majority opinion seems to fly in the face of the congressional history of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">In all of the discussions, we must keep in mind that admissibility under Rule 609(b) is forever tied to admissibility under Rule 609(a), for Rule 609(b) is nothing more nor less than an added limitation on the admissibility of conviction of other crimes already limited by 609(a). In order to be admissible, a previous criminal conviction must pass the test of both 609(a) and 609(b). A discussion of them cannot be, in the circumstances presented here, nicely parsed so that what is said of \u00a7 (a) does not apply to \u00a7 (b) and vice versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">As sent to Congress by the Supreme Court, Rule 609(a) provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">\u201cFor the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, evidence that he has been convicted of a crime is admissible but only if the crime (1) was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year under the law under which he was convicted or (2) involved dishonesty or false statement regardless of the punishment.\u201d U.S.Code and Administrative News, 93rd Congress, 2nd Session, 1974, House Report 93-650, p. 7084 (Legislative History).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">The House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice added to the Supreme Court\u2019s proposal, in subsection 1, the words \u201cunless the court determines that the danger of unfair prejudice outweighs the probative value of the evidence of the conviction,\u201d essentially the same wording which presently appears in that rule with emphasis perhaps slightly changed. The House Judiciary Committee, however, further amended the provision \u201cto permit attack upon the credibility of a witness by prior conviction only if the prior crime involved dishonesty or false statement.\u201d Leg.Hist. p. 7084. The House Judiciary Committee provision providing for proof of prior conviction of a crime only if the crime involved dishonesty or false statement became a part of the House Bill. Conference Report 93-1597, Leg.Hist. p. 7102; Senate Report 93-1277, Leg.Hist. p. 7061. The Senate, however, on the floor, disagreeing with its Judiciary Committee, amended the House Bill to adopt the original language submitted by the Supreme Court. See <em>United States v. Smith, </em>179 U.S.App.D.C. 162, 175, n. 24, 551 F.2d 348, 361, n. 24 (1976); Senate Report 93-1277, Leg.Hist. pp. 7060-61. The Conference Committee adopted the Senate amendment with an amendment similar to that originally added by the House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice to the Supreme Court\u2019s submitted language to subsection (1) that such evidence be admissible if \u201cthe court determines that the probative value of the conviction outweighs its prejudicial effect to the defendant.\u201d Conference Report 93-1597, Leg.Hist. p. 7102.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">It is seen, I think beyond doubt, that the language of the House limiting the introduction of evidence of conviction of previous crime only if the crime involved dishonesty or false statement<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was positively rejected. If this is not shown by an analysis of the legislative history, as I think it is, when recourse is had to the proceedings in the Senate, there can be no doubt of what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>happened. The Senate Judiciary Committee, as to defendants and not other witnesses, concurred in the House version of the bill. Senate Report 93-1277, Leg.Hist. pp. 7060-61. On the Senate floor, however, Senator McClellan led an attempt to scrap the Senate Judiciary Committee version, which had adopted the House bill, in favor of a return to the original Supreme Court version of Rule 609(a). A part of his statement of position is worthy of quotation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbV\">\u201cI cannot accept that conclusion [limiting convictions shown to those involving dishonesty or false statement and make ineligible crimes of murder, rape, armed robbery, and other serious felonies]. Surely a person who has committed a serious crime \u2014 a felony, will just as readily lie under oath as someone who has a misdemeanor involving lying. Would a convicted rapist, cold-blooded murderer, or armed robber really hesitate to lie under oath any more than a person who has previously lied? Would a convicted murderer or robber be more truthful than such a person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATk\">\u201cOf course not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The Senate agreed with Senator McClellan and Senators Hart, Hruska, and Thurmond taking similar positions. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>179 U.S.App.D.C. 162, 175, n. 24, 180, Appendix 551 F.2d 348, 361, n. 24, 366 Appendix (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">The language as well as the theme of the House Bill were thus rejected and the original language of the Supreme Court adopted subject only to the qualification that, other than for a crime involving dishonesty or false statement, the court should determine that the probative value of admitting the prior conviction outweighs its prejudicial effect to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">With this in mind, I think the discussion of the panel on pages 533, 534 of the slip opinion is largely not consistent with that which Congress intented when it passed the rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">While the opinion may seem at first glance to concern itself only with a general rule relating to \u201ccrimes which are generally spoken of as meeting this test of giving a basis for an inference of a \u2018propensity to lie\u2019 \u201d, its clear import is to limit the consideration of felonies which may be introduced for impeachment to those which \u201c \u2018rest on dishonest conduct\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018a tinge of falsification\u2019 \u201d, or involve \u201c \u2018some element of deceit, untruthfulness, or falsification\u2019 \u201d. P. 534. This is so because the opinion predicates its discussion with the sentence that \u201cUnder the Rule, the pivotal issue of probative value of a conviction turns largely on a consideration of the nature of the conviction itself.\u201d P. 534. The opinion thus apparently adopts the version of the Rule as passed in the House Bill and which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>specifically rejected. This is additionally shown by the fact that it holds that the admission of the sodomy conviction on its face, \u201cwithout more in this record,\u201d P. 534, is \u201ca manifest abuse of discretion,\u201d P. 534, thus necessarily holding that the sodomy conviction, although a felony, necessarily did not go to the witness\u2019 credibility absent something mor\u00e9. Had the ruling of the majority been based upon the absence of explicit findings when requested, I think it well might be consistent with the intent of the rule, but when it bases its ruling alternately on the \u201cnature of the conviction itself,\u201d I think it departs from the clear intent of Congress which expressed in no uncertain terms that felonies generally were admissible, subject to the balancing tests of \u00a7\u00a7 609(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">As I will demonstrate later, those crimes which are <em>crimen faisi </em>are necessarily probative. It is the other felonies which the rule intended to admit under the circumstances provided for either in \u00a7 609(a) or \u00a7 609(b) with which we are here concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">While it may be argued that some convictions of sodomy might not affect the credibility of a witness, it is more realistic to argue that most would, especially when a prison sentence has resulted, for I think the setting of a felony for the purpose of trial impeachment should be in at least a relatively contemporaneous time frame and that we may not depend on the mores of ancient Athens or Sparta in ascertaining whether or not a conviction for sodomy has to do with the credibility of one convicted of that crime. Perhaps the defendant may offer an explanation but perhaps he may not. Here, he has not, and I could not say that on its face and absent explanation, the admission of the crime is a manifest abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Not only do I believe the opinion is over-broad in the discussion just mentioned, I think the same is true in another particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The opinion does not mention, or base its judgment on, the fact that the defense attorney on two occasions requested the trial court to make the very findings which the opinion faults the trial court for not making. For example, this is one request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"avu-dedup-0\">\u201cMr. Stowers: Well, your Honor, I just respectfully request, and I don\u2019t want to push you on this, but it is my feeling that the law requires you to make specific findings on the record for your reasons for allowing this in and I think that is what the law requires.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Rather than base its opinion on the denial of the reasonable request of the defense attorney, which may well have been contemplated by the new rules, the court paints with a broad brush to cover all situations, and the clear implication of the opinion (for it reverses) is that it is the rule in this circuit to be followed in each instance for it is not predicated on the denial of the reasonable request of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">I do not agree with such action of the panel. Unless the reversal is based on the denial of the reasonable request of the defense attorney, as it might be, and I think it ought to be, I would affirm with respect to that point as was done in <em>United States v. Cohen, </em>544 F.2d 781 (5th Cir. 1977), on facts almost indistinguishable from those here. Not mentioned in the opinion of the panel is the fact that the district judge heard the defense attorney on more than one occasion on this matter, and it was argued at least at length. The only thing the district judge did not do was to make explicit findings. With nothing shown by the defendant, or even offered, despite the hearings on the matter, I do not see how it can reasonably be said that the ruling of the district court as to the convictions for forgery and sodomy necessarily constitute an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">I find a possible implication in footnote 18 of the opinion that the forgery convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>tion might not have probative value on credibility. While that footnote may be read in more than one way, I caution that I think it should be construed in the light of Conference Report 93-1597 previously mentioned. That report states that \u201cBy the phrase \u2018dishonesty and false statement\u2019, the Conference means crimes such as perjury or subornation of perjury, false statement, criminal fraud, embezzlement, or false pretense, or any other offense in the nature of <em>crimen falsi, </em>the commission of which involves some element of deceit, untruthfulness, or falsification bearing on the accused\u2019s propensity to testify truthfully.\u201d Leg.Hist. p. 7103.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Forgery clearly falls within this definition and thus the statute declares its probative value on credibility.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The only question before the district court on remand as to the forgery conviction should be whether or not its probative value \u201csupported by specific facts and circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect,\u201d and this due only to lapse of time. For if the lapse of time had been less than 10 years, admitting the conviction of forgery would be mandatory for \u201cjudicial discretion granted with respect to the admissibility of other prior convictions is not applicable to those involving dishonesty or false statement.\u201d Conference Report 93-1597, Leg.Hist. p. 7103.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">One further matter deserves comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">In footnote 6, p. 531, is the statement that each prior conviction is to be considered separately. I do not find the legislative history necessarily supports that construction, and it seems to me it might legitimately be found that the commission of a string of felonies would more likely show a tendency to lie than would an isolated incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">While there does not appear in the record a detailing of the various prior convictions of this defendant, an examination of the FBI report would make the following conclusions entirely reasonable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He was convicted in 1951 of sodomy, at which time the imposition of sentence may have been withheld, and he was placed on probation for five years. Or, instead of the imposition of sentence being withheld, he may have been sentenced to 1-10 years and placed on probation. He remained on probation until 1955, at which time he broke probation for a cause not appearing in the record unless it was that he went to Montana, as suggested in argument.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In all events, he violated his probation, and in 1955 he was sentenced to 1-10 years. He remained in prison until 1957, when he was paroled. He was discharged from parole in 1966. During the time he was on parole, in 1961, he was convicted of forgery and sentenced to 1-10 years. The record does not disclose when he was released from prison on the forgery charge but apparently prior to 1968. Neither does the record disclose when any parole on account of the forgery charge expired. He was convicted in 1969 for bond default, which I believe, as previously explained, may well have been bail jumping and a felony, and was sentenced to 12 months for that offense. In 1970, he was convicted of violation of the Dyer Act, interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle, and received three years\u2019 probation. Whether he received a fixed sentence subject to probation or a suspended imposition of sentence is not disclosed. Cavender\u2019s record does not disclose a blameless life other than the sodomy conviction. Indeed, a fair reading of his record reveals that for a substantial majority of the time for the past 27 years he has either been confined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>for the conviction of felony, or on probation or parole as a result of such conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Rule 609(b) as submitted by the Supreme Court provided that a conviction otherwise admissible under Rule 609(a) would not be admitted \u201cif a period of more than 10 years has elapsed since the date of the release of the witness from confinement imposed for his most recent conviction, or the expiration of the period of his parole, probation, or sentence granted or imposed with respect to his most recent conviction, whichever is the later date.\u201d As the legislative history states, under this wording the witness\u2019 entire past record of criminal convictions could be used for impeachment if the witness had been released most recently from confinement or parole or probation within 10 years of the trial. House Report 93-650, Leg.Hist. p. 7085.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The House Judiciary Committee amended the rule as submitted by the Supreme Court \u201cto provide that upon the expiration of 10 years from the date of a conviction of a witness, or of his release from confinement for that offense, that conviction may no longer be used for impeachment.\u201d Undoubtedly this is where the thought arose that previous convictions should be considered one at a time. The Committee was of the view that after ten years following release from confinement or the date of conviction the probative value of the conviction had diminished to a point where it should no longer be admitted. House Report 93-650, Leg.Hist. p. 7085. The House Bill thus excluded from consideration all convictions more than 10 years old or for which confinement had expired more than 10 years before the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The Senate, however, added to the House Bill an amendment granting the court discretion to admit convictions over 10 years old but only upon determination by the court that the probative value of a conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect. Senate Report 93-1277, Leg. Hist. pp. 7061-7062.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The Conference adopted the Senate amendment with an amendment requiring notice by a party that he intended to request the court to allow him to use a conviction older than 10 years. Conf.Rep. 93-1597, Leg.Hist. p. 7103. I find nothing in the legislative history explaining the meaning of the finding which the rule requires a court to make that such evidence may be admitted if the court determines \u201cin the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.\u201d The just quoted language is that which gives effect to the Senate amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">I do not think on the record before us that we can say it is necessarily an abuse of discretion for the district judge to consider all the felonies a defendant has committed in determining whether to admit any of them into evidence. If the district court is going to be allowed any latitude in determining what is the interest of justice, it seems to me that should include multiple felony convictions such as possessed by the defendant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">I do not say that the record of the defendant as it appears before us necessarily makes those convictions admissible. What I do say is that the district court should be allowed to consider all of them in its determination as to whether or not to admit any of them. At least if the facts behind the convictions are to be inquired into, as well as the facts surrounding them, I think the district court should be allowed to consider all of this evidence together prior to a direction from us to that court to consider the convictions one at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">In the hop\u00e9 of publicizing to some small extent the dilemma in which district judges presently find themselves, I cannot help but comment on the Congressional amendments to the rule offered by the Supreme Court, and especially to the weighing of probative value against prejudice which appears in one form or another in both Rules 609(a) and 609(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>It is at once apparent that in <em>many </em>cases the more probative a prior conviction is, the more prejudicial it will be. So the prejudice in many cases will increase as does the probative value. The end result then, if the introduction of the conviction is held to be objectionable, is that it will be so \u201c. not because it has no appreciable probative value, but because it has too much.\u201d <em>Wig-more on Evidence, </em>3d Ed., Vol. I, p. 646. The provision in the rule providing for balancing has been called by McCormick in only slightly different context the \u201cSerpent of uncertainty crawling into the Eden of trial administration.\u201d <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>2d Ed., pp. 85-86. The only guidance I can find in the congressional history into the administration and application of the balancing test provided for in the rule is in the Conference Report where it is stated that \u201cSuch evidence [meaning all admissible under 609(a)(1)] should only be excluded where it presents a danger of improperly influencing the outcome of the trial by persuading the trier of fact to convict the defendant on the basis of his prior criminal record.\u201d Leg.Hist. p. 7103. If this is the guideline to use, then it would seem that under Rule 609(a)(1) the conviction of any crimes so described in that rule is generally admissible unless the defendant has committed before the same or a quite similar crime to that with which he is presently charged. For it seems inescapable that conviction of the same or a clearly related offense would certainly be the most persuasive conviction to a trier of fact in ascertaining guilt or innocence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Along the same line, the apparent admonition of the panel to ascertain \u201cthe facts involved in the crimes,\u201d p. 531, would seem to me to place the defendant at a terrible disadvantage in the ordinary case. While it is true that the defendant is bound to know of the facts surrounding his previous convictions, he has formerly been protected by the law as to the disclosure of their specific factual background. That has been the law in this circuit. <em>United States v. Samuel, </em>431 F.2d 610 (4th Cir. 1970). See also <em>Cox, </em>p. 71, for the same rule in the Fifth Circuit. While the new rule may require some departure from <em>Samuel </em>(as to dates), I would only alter it the minimum required. If the district court in each instance must ascertain the facts surrounding the previous crimes of which defendant has been convicted in determining its application of Rule 609(a) and (b), then the administration of the new rule is self-defeating and falls squarely against the reasons for the general rule that evidence of prior convictions is inadmissible in a criminal case, i. e. the trial of collateral issues and the danger of unfair surprise. It will thus enable the government to get the facts on which the defendant was previously convicted before the court in each instance, instead of merely the fact of conviction. I suggest that even in the instant case, while the defendant may enjoy the temporary advantage of a new trial, spreading the facts surrounding his previous convictions into the record cannot improve his position with the court, but only furnish the basis of a factual finding to support admitting them should the district court be so inclined after hearing the evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-30\">.

Apparently the conviction was for bail jumping under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3150, and if in connection with his Dyer Act charge would have been an additional felony not pressed by the government at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b640-9\">. A concise and readable discussion, editorial comment, and Legislative History is found in Redden and Saltzburg, <em>Federal Rules of Evidence Manual, </em>p. 180 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b640-13\">. See ALI, Model Code of Evidence, Rule 106 (1942).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b641-7\">. I also do not think the holdings of the cases cited support the court\u2019s conclusion to a reasonable degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\"><em>Gordon </em>was not decided under the Federal Rules of Evidence, and even that case noted, as it upheld the admission of a previous conviction of larceny for impeachment purposes, that . . the case had narrowed to the credibility of two persons \u2014 the accused and his accuser \u2014 and in those circumstances there was greater, not less, compelling reason for exploring all avenues which would shed light on which of the two witnesses was to be believed.\u201d 127 U.S.App.D.C., p. 348, 383 F.2d p. 941. <em>Bastone </em>and <em>Cox </em>were also not decided under the Federal Rules of Evidence. <em>Bastone </em>said by way of dictum the rules would have barred the use of a rape conviction because it occurred 22 years ago, and that the prejudicial effect far outweighed the probative relevance of the prior conviction. <em>Cox </em>was a conviction for prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">1 suggest that <em>Ortega </em>would not be followed by this circuit if the question there were squarely before us. It held under the Federal Rules of Evidence that a conviction for shoplifting was not a crime involving \u201cdishonesty or false statement,\u201d despite an apparent holding of the Fifth Circuit to the contrary in <em>United States v. Carden, </em>529 F.2d 443 (5th Cir. 1976). In <em>Ortega, </em>the rationale of the court was: \u201cAn absence of respect for the property of others is an undesirable character trait, but is not an indicium of a propensity toward testimonial dishonesty.\u201d P. 806. It is at once apparent that this holding is quite to the contrary of <em>Gordon. </em>In <em>Thompson, </em>the court held, under the new rules, that a misdemeanor conviction involving marijuana was not admissible because not for a crime involving \u201cdishonesty or false statement,\u201d and while less controversial than the <em>Ortega </em>holding, it is nevertheless in apparent conflict with the District of Columbia Circuit, as explained in the text of the opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b642-13\">. I think a reasonable rule would be to require specific explicit findings if requested. Cf. FRCrP 23(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b643-9\">. There is no occasion here to comment on one Conference use of \u201cdishonesty and false statement\u201d and the statutory use of \u201cdishonesty or false statement.\u201d See <em>Smith, </em>Appendix, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b643-10\">. These are facts which might be revealed upon inquiry. See p. 531, and part VI of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b643-13\">. The FBI report suggests Cavender\u2019s trip to Montana may have broken another probation, not for the sodomy conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b645-6\">. See statement by Congressman Hungate in presenting the Conference Report to the House, Leg.Hist. p. 7108, and <em>Ortega, </em>p. 806, for the proposition that the balancing test of Rule 609(a) and (perhaps 609(b)) does not apply in the impeachment of a government witness, but that the conviction of felony is ipso facto admissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b645-9\">. A reasonable construction of the new rules might permit the introduction of facts surrounding the offense by the defendant, should he contest admissibility, but not require it. Neither I think should the government be permitted to introduce such facts merely by offering to use the conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
