BRYAN, Senior Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1077-14\">This is an appeal from a determination of the Tax Court upholding the Commissioner\u2019s assessment of an income tax deficiency for 1972 in the amount of $593 against David I. Hitchcock. 66 T.C. 950 (1976). The deficiency arose from the disallowance of deductions taken by Hitchcock (taxpayer) for expenditures made by him as a Foreign Service Information Officer for food, lodging and transportation \u2014 for himself only \u2014 while on mandatory \u201chome leave\u201d in the United States from Japan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-26\">It is conceded by the Commissioner that these outlays were for \u201cordinary and necessary expenses\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 162(a)(2), Internal Revenue Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The sole point of contest is whether these sums were incurred in pursuit of his business.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-27\">Home leave is periodically <em>ordered </em>by law for all Foreign Service Officers stationed abroad, so that they may and will reorient themselves to the American ways of life. Section 1148 of the Foreign Service Act of 1946, ch. 957, Title IX, sec. 933(a), 60 Stat. 1028, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Tax Court agrees: \u201cAfter considering the mandatory statutory language, the legislative history, and the record in this case, we have concluded that home leave is indeed compulsory.\u201d 66 T.C. at 959, footnote omitted. However, the Court held that the instant expenses were so \u201cinherently personal and unrelated to the conduct of a trade or business\u201d as to be nondeductible. 66 T.C. at 960. Judgment went for the Commissioner September 3, 1976. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-28\">As a Foreign Service Information Officer, Hitchcock was assigned in 1970 to official duty in Tokyo, Japan. His family ac-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>companded him. In 1972 he was ordered to return to the United States on home leave, and they all flew back at Government expense in June 1972. From August 4 until September 1, 1972 he was on home leave. During this interval he engaged in the following incidents with these expenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-4\">(a) Cottage rental \u2014 August 4 through 20 $ 29</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-5\">(b) Auto rental \u2014 August 4 through 18 227</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-6\">(c) Auto rental \u2014 August 18 through 20 89</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-7\">(d) Auto rental \u2014 August 21 19</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-8\">(e) Trail Creek Ranch lodging\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-9\">August 22 through 28 216</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-10\">(f) Yellowstone National Park lodging\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-11\">August 28</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-12\">TOTAL $593</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1078-13\">These expenditures are acknowledged by the Commissioner as \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d. The list includes the costs, first, of a stay of some two weeks in a rented New Hampshire cottage; then taxpayer drove a rental car to Washington, D. C.; next was a drive through Massachusetts to Boston; next a tour of Denver, visiting the United States Mint and a zoo; then six days\u2019 lodging at the Trail Creek Ranch in Wilson, Wyoming; further, a lodging for the night of August 28 at Yellowstone National Park; and finally, boarding a plane on September 1 for return to Tokyo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-14\">Since these trips and stays concededly were \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d, the next question is whether the expenditures therefor were incurred <em>in the pursuit of a trade or business. </em>Considering the language of the law commanding home leave as well as the Congressional purpose of its enactment, we conclude that all of these items should be so classified. The Congress determined that this periodic return is essential to the duties of a Foreign Service Officer in a career or the <em>business </em>of representing the United States abroad. The Foreign Service Act itself announced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-15\">\u201cThe Congress declares that the objectives of this chapter are to develop and strengthen the Foreign Service of the United States so as\u2014 ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-18\">(2) to insure that the officers and employees of the Foreign Service are <em>broadly representative of the American people </em>and are aware of and <em>fully informed in respect to current trends </em>in American life;\u201d (Accent added.) ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-20\">Section 111(2) of the Foreign Service Act of 1946, ch. 957, Title I, \u00a7 111(2), 60 Stat. 999, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 801(2). <em>See also </em>92 Cong. Rec. 9587, 9589 (1946).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1078-21\">Further, the House Foreign Affairs Committee in considering this legislation reported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-22\">\u201c. . [Ojne of the prime objectives of the act . . . is to insure that the officers and employees of the Service shall return more often to the United States <em>to renew touch with the American way of life and so become better representatives of this country abroad.\u201d </em>(Accent added.) H.Rept.No.2508, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. 139 (1946).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1078-25\">Also, the Congress was concerned about the \u201cre-Americanization\u201d of Foreign Service personnel stationed abroad as is re-emphasized in the legislative history of the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-26\">\u201c <em>\u2018Re-Americanization </em>\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-27\">There is perhaps no phase of Foreign Service administration about which there is more general agreement than that connected with the problem of insuring that Foreign Service personnel should come to the United States as often as possible to renew their knowledge of developments in the United States and their feeling for the American way of life. The new bill, as noted above, provides compulsory home leave -after 2 years\u2019 service abroad as against the present 3 years. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> H.Rept.No.2508,79th Cong., 2d Sess. 10 (1946).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1078-30\">The travels of the present taxpayer provided him opportunity to sense the trend of life throughout a large segment of the nation'. The circumstance that it may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>been pleasant or, indeed, have the flavor of a vacation does not negate its nature as an obligation. Surely, the Congress was aware of this pleasurable potential, but nevertheless <em>required </em>it of Foreign Service Officers. Discharge might well have followed a failure to comply with the practice. In obeying, the taxpayer was pursuing his professional employment. He was meeting his duty to its full extent when he did not confine his stay to his Maryland home. No matter how understandably enjoyable his visit in Maryland, it could not have provided him the opportunity either to share with his fellow Americans the knowledge he had gained of Japan, or to inform himself of the advances or other changes in life in this country, as broadly as did his travel in the New England and Western States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">Our view of this case is reinforced by <em>Stratton v. </em>Commissioner, 448 F.2d 1030 (9 Cir. 1971), especially in this from its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-6\">\u201cTo be sure, home leave is akin to a \u2018vacation\u2019. In fact, that is probably what Congress intended. By what better method could a foreign service officer reorient himself with the American way of life in a short period of time than by osmosis, through travel, observation, reading, and communication with people, unburdened by the mundane duties of his everyday job? The Department realizes direct, albeit intangible, benefits in terms of the effectiveness of its employees by virtue of just such \u2018vacations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1033, footnote omitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">We therefore conclude that home leave is an unavoidable expense exacted under law of an employee. Because the travel expenses, including food and lodging, attributable solely to David Hitchcock while he was on home leave relate primarily to his trade or business as a Foreign Service Officer, we hold they fall within the meaning of \u00a7 162(a), Int.Rev.Code of 1954. The judgment on appeal will be reversed and the case remanded to the Tax Court for entry of an order in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">Reversed and Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1077-15\">. In the 1972 taxable year, \u00a7 162(a), Int.Rev. Code of 1954, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-17\">\u201cSEC. 162. Trade or business expenses. (a) In general. \u2014 There shall be allowed as a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business, including\u2014 ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-21\">(2) traveling expenses (including amounts expended for meals and lodging other than amounts which are lavish or extravagant under the circumstances) while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business;\u201d * * * * * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1077-22\">. The amount originally claimed was $950.00, but on the Commissioner\u2019s objection that $357.00 thereof had not been substantiated under Tax Code Section 274(d), the taxpayer has not pressed his suit for the items of the $357.00, leaving on appeal only the remaining $593.00 of deductions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AyH\">. This section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-31\">\u201c\u00a7 1148. Return of personnel to United States, its Territories and possessions on leaves of absence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-32\">(a) The Secretary may order to the continental United States, its territories and possessions, on statutory leave of absence any officer or employee of the Service who is a citizen of the United States upon completion of eighteen months\u2019 continuous service abroad and <em>shall so order </em>as soon as possible after completion of three years of such service.\u201d (Accent added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1078-17\">. The compulsory service term was later again fixed at 3 years by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, Pub.L. 87-195, 75 Stat. 464, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 1148.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
