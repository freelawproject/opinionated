Cantrell sought judicial review of the final decision of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare that Cantrell was not entitled to \u201cblack lung\u201d benefits under Part B of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as amended in 1972, 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>The district court concluded that the Secretary\u2019s decision was supported by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d which is the applicable standard of judicial review under the 1969 Act. 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 923(b); 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 421(d). We agree that the Secretary\u2019s decision was supported by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d and therefore we must affirm the denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">Cantrell submitted with his application for benefits several x-rays, which entitled him to a rebuttable presumption that he was \u201ctotally disabled due to pneumoconio-sis.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.490(b)(l)(i). Unless this presumption were rebutted, it entitled Cantrell to an award of benefits, <em>provided </em>Cantrell could prove that his impairment \u201carose out of coal mine employment.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.490(b)(2). Whether Cantrell proved that element is the issue raised on this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">The permanent and interim regulations also provide that a miner-claimant who was employed for ten years or more in the Nation\u2019s coal mines and who is suffering from pneumoconiosis, generally is entitled to another presumption, that his pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mine employment. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 410.416(a), 410.-490(b)(3). The Appeals Council, which reversed an award of benefits by an ALJ, concluded that Cantrell had been a \u201ccoal miner\u201d employed in a \u201ccoal mine\u201d for only <em>eight years. </em>Thus, Cantrell was not entitled to the favorable presumption about the origin of his pneumoconiosis. We conclude that the Appeals Council correctly interpreted the applicable regulations and decided that Cantrell had only eight years of coal mine employment. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 410.-410, 410.110.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-15\">Claimants such as Cantrell, who are unable to rely upon the ten-year presumption, \u201cmust submit the evidence necessary to establish that the pneumoconiosis arose out of employment in the Nation\u2019s coal mines.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 410.416(b), 410.-490(b)(2). The Appeals Council found that Cantrell had not presented sufficient evidence to meet his burden of proof under this provision. Cantrell only worked in the coal mines from 1934 to 1942; he admittedly did not notice any breathing difficulties until 1959, and his first x-ray revealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>pneumoconiosis was made on March 27, 1973. Cantrell held a number of non-mining jobs between 1942 and 1959 that exposed him to substantial dust from coal, coke, charcoal, and lime. The Appeals Council noted that the conditions associated with these jobs are known to cause \u201cchronic respirable diseases including pneumoconio-sis.\u201d The claimant has not referred us to any persuasive evidence or authority to the contrary. Considering all of he evidence and its implications, we conclude that the Appeals Council\u2019s finding that Cantrell had not proved that his pneumoconiosis arose out of his eight years of coal mine employment, as opposed to other working conditions, was supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d Our role is not to pretend to be physicians and second-guess the Secretary; we can decide only whether the Secretary\u2019s decisions are sufficiently supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Finding no error in the Appeals Council\u2019s conclusion that Cantrell failed to establish one of the necessary elements for entitlement to \u201cblack lung\u201d benefits, we affirm the final decision of the Secretary and the district court. The claimant, of course, is entitled to request administrative reconsideration of his claim under \u00a7 15 of the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-11\">. We have analyzed the claimant\u2019s claim for benefits under the more favorable interim criteria, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.490. If Cantrell is not entitled to benefits under these provisions, given the nature of his evidence, neither will he be entitled under the less favorable permanent regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">Cantrell\u2019s x-rays revealed the presence of simple, not complicated, pneumoconiosis. Cantrell\u2019s pulmonary function study did not support his claim under the interim criteria because he unquestionably had less than fifteen years of coal mine employment, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.-490(b)(1)(h), nor was the study probative of the origin of Cantrell\u2019s pneumoconiosis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b654-17\">. Although the permanent and interim regulations are structured somewhat differently, we believe the ten-year presumption is identical with respect to each set of regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
