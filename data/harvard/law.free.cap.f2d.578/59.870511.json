Warmus pursuant to Title IV of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as amended by the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>Pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 928(a), Bethlehem was also ordered to pay attorneys fees and costs. After this case was submitted, we received additional briefing from the parties regarding the effect of recently enacted amendments to the statutes which govern this case. We conclude that there existed substantial evidence for the Board\u2019s decision to award benefits, and that Bethlehem is responsible to Warmus for attorneys fees incurred in the prior proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">\n<em>I.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">Warmus, who is now 70 years old, began working in Pennsylvania coal mines in 1927 and continued this work until 1949. Between 1950 and 1960, he worked in an automobile assembly plant; for thirteen years thereafter he worked as a janitor, until his retirement in July 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-16\">On July 30, 1973, Warmus filed a claim with the Department of Labor for benefits, alleging total disability due to pneumoconi-osis contracted during his years in the mines. Based upon testimonial and documentary evidence presented at a hearing on this claim, the hearing officer concluded that Warmus was totally disabled from pneumoconiosis \u201cas that term is defined in Section 402(f) of the Act (30 U.S.C. \u00a7 902) and 20 C.F.R. 410.412\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-17\">In the subsequent appeal, the Benefits Review Board based its finding of total disability on 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.426(d), which permits such a finding when pneumoconio-sis is medically demonstrated and when other relevant evidence<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> establishes that the miner has a chronic pulmonary or respiratory impairment which prevents him from engaging in comparable employment, regardless of whether that impairment is related to or caused by the pneumoconiosis. 20 C.F.R \u00a7 410.426(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-18\">Where a ventilatory study and/or a physical performance test is medically contraindicated, or cannot be obtained or where evidence obtained as a result of such tests does not establish that the miner is totally disabled, pneumoconiosis may nevertheless be found totally disabling if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>other relevant evidence (see \u00a7 410.414(c)) establishes that the miner has or had a chronic respiratory or pulmonary impairment, the severity of which prevents (or prevented) him not only from doing his previous coal mine work, but also, considering his age, his education, and work experience, prevents (or prevented) him from engaging in comparable and gainful work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Bethlehem alleges that there was not substantial evidence supporting the findings; that the Board\u2019s interpretation of the applicable regulations was incorrect; and that, if that interpretation <em>was </em>correct, it is inconsistent with the rest of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\n<em>A.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Bethlehem does not challenge the propriety of the findings that Warmus suffers from pneumoconiosis and that his pneumoconiosis results from his mine employment. Its only challenge goes to the finding of total disability due to pneumoconiosis. \u201cBethlehem\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that there is not substantial evidence in the record to support a finding that claimant\u2019s pneumoconiosis has caused and is causing the chest pain, breathlessness, and coughing and choking of which claimant complains.\u201d Bethlehem\u2019s Reply Brief at 1. We disagree. The following summary of the medical evidence supports the conclusion that substantial evidence on the record as a whole is in accordance with the agency\u2019s findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">1. The miner\u2019s subjective symptoms, including shortness of breath, coughing, \u201ccatching\u201d of phlegm in his throat, and limited physical actions were described by claimant. Appendix at 19a <em>et seq.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">2. The claimant described the continuing effects of his illness and his inability to fully perform janitorial duties. <em>Id. </em>at 24a <em>et seq.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">3. Dr. G. F. Schwartzberg found \u201cvery minimal but definite abnormalities which are probably classified as Vi, maybe <em>lh . . . </em>.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54-55a.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">4. Dr. L. T. Smyth studied x-rays of claimant\u2019s chest and also found \u201csmall, rounded nodular densities with a profusion of V2\u201d in claimant\u2019s lungs. Dr. Smyth\u2019s impression was stated as \u201c[pjneumoconiosis, simple type. Category V2.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107a.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-12\">5. Dr. N. K. Villamin conducted a physical examination of claimant in which she noted a persistent cough, shortness of breath and other symptoms. Pneumoconiosis \u201crelated to dust exposure in the patient\u2019s coal mine employment\u201d was Dr. Villamin\u2019s concluding diagnosis. <em>Id. </em>at 108-09a.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-13\">6. Dr. P. L. Bell\u2019s impression, following an examination of claimant, was an \u201c[ojbstructive abnormality of ventilation of moderate degree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110a.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-14\">7. Dr. W. C. Weese, who examined claimant less than one month before the administrative hearing, noted the miner\u2019s complaint of \u201calmost constant chest pain\u201d since 1936. A chest x-ray revealed \u201csmall, irregular opacities (classification V2) in the mid and lower zones on the left and less prominently in the mid and upper zones on the right.\u201d Dr. Weese concluded that claimant \u201chas coal workers\u2019 pneumo-coniosis\u201d and that his condition probably precluded him from \u201cextensive heavy lifting or strenuous labor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at lll-13a. Dr. Weese also found a \u201cleft bundle branch block\u201d of the heart which was \u201calmost certainly not related to the lung disease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-15\">Our review of the factual findings made by the hearing officer and accepted by the Board is limited to a determination whether these findings are supported by substantial evidence. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3), incorporated by reference in 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(a). After a careful review of the record, we conclude that they are.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-16\">\n<em>B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b166-17\">Our review of the Board\u2019s interpretation of the relevant regulations and stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>ute is plenary. At bottom, Bethlehem\u2019s main contention in this regard is that the Act demands a causal relationship between the pneumoconiosis and a claimant\u2019s pulmonary impairment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The short answer is that the statute\u2019s language does not include this specific requirement. Indeed, support for Bethlehem\u2019s proposition is lacking throughout the legislative history which, to the contrary, suggests \u201ca clear need to resolve doubts in favor of the disabled miner or his survivors.\u201d 1972 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 2305, 2315, and \u201cto insure as broad coverage as possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2321.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Moreover, we are not convinced that the hearing officer, in the first instance, neglected the possibility of a causal relationship. He stated that \u201c[n]o evidence whatever was offered to suggest a possible explanation for this impairment apart from the effects of [claimant\u2019s] long exposure to coal mine dust and his affliction by pneumoconiosis as a result thereof. The record thus warrants the conclusion that Claimant\u2019s pneumoconiosis totally disabled him . \u201d Appendix at 126-27a. We think this may be read as an inference that War-mus\u2019 respiratory disability was caused by his pneumoconiosis, and we find such an inference to be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">\n<em>C.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Bethlehem\u2019s further argument that, if the regulations can be read to reach this result,' they are inconsistent with the Act, again ignores the express intent of Congress, in this instance to \u201c[p]rovide that additional tests, medical and lay evidence be utilized, where relevant, to establish eligibility for benefits.\u201d 1972 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News pp. 2305-06. If petitioner\u2019s argument is correct, it is difficult, if not impossible, to justify the generous provisions in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 410.426(d) and 410.-414(c) which allow proof of total disability through other relevant evidence \u201cwhere evidence obtained as a rqsult of [a ventilatory study and/or a physical performance test] does not establish that the miner is totally disabled\u201d and therefore eligible for benefits. Petitioner\u2019s argument in this regard appears to be based more in policy than in law. Confronted with a similar challenge to the Act in <em>Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., </em>428 U.S. 1, 21, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 2895, 49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976), the Supreme Court answered that this \u201cis a public policy matter left primarily to the determination of the legislature.\u201d Accordingly, the Board\u2019s adherence to the statutory guidelines warrants affirmance of its eligibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">On March 1, 1978, President Carter signed into law the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, Pub.L. No. 95-239, 92 Stat. 95. In conjunction with its previously enacted companion measure, the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977, Pub.L. No. 95-227, 92 Stat. 11, the new legislation amends Title IV in significant ways. Under the recent amendments, no operator is required to pay benefits for any miner whose last coal mine employment occurred prior to January 1, 1970; the responsibility for benefits payments to these miners is shifted to the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. Thus in the instant action, Bethlehem is effectively relieved of all liability for benefits payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">The new amendments, however, do not address the question of attorneys fees. Under the prior schema, where an operator denies liability but cannot sustain that denial in litigation, attorneys fees may be assessed against it. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 928, incorporated by reference in 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-14\">The parties agree that because the provision regarding attorneys fees remains the same, the validity of Warmus\u2019 claim for benefits must be determined on the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the Act and the regulations as they existed prior to the recent amendments, but that, even if we affirm the eligibility determination, under the new amendments Bethlehem will be obligated to pay only attorneys fees and costs. Since Warmus has successfully established entitlement to benefits, Bethlehem must pay those attorneys fees and costs which are assessed against it in the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the Benefits Review Board will be affirmed insofar as it awards attorneys fees, and the cause remanded to the Secretary for the necessary order regarding benefits payments under the new amendments.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-11\">. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(f) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-12\">The term \u201ctotal disability\u201d has the meaning given it by regulations of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, except that such regulations shall provide that a miner shall be considered totally disabled when pneumoconiosis prevents him from engaging in a gainful employment requiring the skills and abilities comparable to those of any employment in a mine or mines in which he previously engaged with some regularity and over a substantial period of time. Such regulations shall not provide more restrictive criteria than those applicable under Section 423(d) of Title 42.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.412 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-14\">(a) A miner shall be considered totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-15\">(1) His pneumoconiosis prevents him from, engaging in gainful work in the immediate area of his residence requiring the skills and abilities comparable to those of any work in a mine or mines in which he previously engaged with some regularity and over a substantial period of time (that is, \u201ccomparable and gainful work\u201d; <em>see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 410.424-410.426); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-20\">(2) His impairment can be expected to result in death, or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b165-21\">. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.414(c) provides that \u201cother relevant evidence\u201d may include \u201cmedical tests such as blood gas studies, electrocardiograms, pulmonary function studies, or physical performance tests, and any medical history, evidence submitted by the miner\u2019s physician, his spouse\u2019s affidavits . . and other supportive materials.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b167-9\">. We admit to a certain difficulty in separating conceptually Bethlehem\u2019s \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d claim, <em>supra, </em>and its claims regarding the Board\u2019s statutory interpretation. The former is somewhat dependent upon the latter\u2019s theory of a causal relationship. Nevertheless, because we reject the causal relationship theory, we felt it important to address as well any attack on the basic factual findings involved in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
