KAUFMAN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1009-20\">When financial storms rage, unsecured creditors take on collateral as ballast. The security thus gained is often tenuous, however, for if bankruptcy is involved, it may be dissolved by the trustee\u2019s challenge. In this case, we are called upon to decide whether Manufacturers &amp; Traders Trust Company (\u201cthe Bank\u201d) may enforce a security interest in the property of the bankrupt Ollag Construction Equipment Corp. (\u201cOllag\u201d), or whether, as Ollag\u2019s trustee contends, the Bank\u2019s claim is a voidable preference under \u00a7 60 of the Bankruptcy Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since we believe that the courts below inadequately considered the crucial issue of Ollag\u2019s solvency when the security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>interest was created, we reverse and remand to the bankruptcy court for further findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">Ollag\u2019s financial demise was triggered when the construction business operated in Lancaster, New York, by the four Gallo brothers \u2014 Leopold, Anthony, Michael, and James \u2014 fell on hard times. An equipment leasing firm, Ollag was but one of the three corporate constituents of this family enterprise. It was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Deplan Contracting Inc. (\u201cDeplan\u201d), a construction firm that accounted for more than ninety percent of Ollag\u2019s rentals. The third Gallo corporation, Sheldon Builders Supply Corp. (\u201cSheldon\u201d), owned the real estate quartering the Deplan and Ollag facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">In late 1972, the Gallos learned that De-plan\u2019s financial condition was grave because approximately $300,000 in accounts payable had not been recorded in the company\u2019s books. Deplan\u2019s creditors became aware of this state of affairs in January 1973, as Deplan began to default on a number of construction projects. Meetings were held to discuss refinancing the stricken business. The principal creditor participants were the Bank and the Traveler\u2019s Indemnity Company (\u201cTravelers\u201d). The Bank held Deplan\u2019s note in the sum of $200,000, collateralized by a security interest in equipment Deplan owned separately from Ollag. It had also obtained a mortgage on Sheldon\u2019s real estate, and payment guaranties from Ollag and the Gallos and their wives. Travelers had written performance and payment bonds for Deplan\u2019s projects, and Ollag, Sheldon, and the Gallos had also agreed to indemnify Travelers against liability on these bonds,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a fact of which the Bank claims ignorance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">While the discussions continued, the security interest at issue in this case came into being. In February 1973, Leopold Gallo, Ollag\u2019s president, executed at the Bank\u2019s request a chattel mortgage on Ollag\u2019s inventory and equipment to serve as security for Ollag\u2019s guaranty of Deplan\u2019s note.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The proposed refinancing never occurred. By March 1973, it was readily apparent that, even with an infusion of new funds, Deplan would soon be insolvent again. Although Deplan attempted to avert disaster by filing a petition under Chapter XI to rearrange its debts, even that maneuver failed. To no one\u2019s surprise, Deplan was adjudicated a bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-11\">In June, Travelers, having undertaken to finish Deplan\u2019s construction projects after the latter\u2019s default, filed an involuntary petition against Ollag. The Bank, without delay, submitted a reclamation petition asserting its security interest in Ollag\u2019s equipment. The trustee counterclaimed, seeking an avoidance of the Bank\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The rather complex issues presented by these stratagems are now before us. Bankruptcy Judge McGuire decided that the Ollag security interest was invalid both under New York law and as a voidable preference under \u00a7 60 of the Bankruptcy Act. On review by the district court, Judge Elfvin reversed the determination that the security interest transgressed New York law, but affirmed the judgment on the basis of \u00a7 60. Both the Bank and the trustee appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-13\">We have little difficulty in disposing of the trustee\u2019s contention on his appeal that the security agreement was void because it did not further any of Ollag\u2019s corporate purposes and had not been ratified by Ollag\u2019s shareholders in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>N.Y. Bus. Corp. Law \u00a7 908.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is clear that the security agreement did in fact serve a valid corporate purpose by attempting to avert the bankruptcy of Ollag\u2019s parent and principal customer, Deplan.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, under N.Y. Bus. Corp. Law \u00a7 202(a)(7), shareholder ratification of the agreement was unnecessary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">Nevertheless, the trustee argues that even if shareholder approval was not required, the security agreement is without force because Leopold Gallo, president of Ollag, did not have authority to execute it on its behalf. But Leopold\u2019s right to act for Ollag was conclusively established by a resolution adopted by Ollag\u2019s board of directors before any suggestion of trouble in the Gallo enterprises. It granted any one officer of Ollag authority to execute security agreements with the Bank on behalf of Ollag. Accordingly, we have no hesitation in finding that the security agreement complied with New York law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">We now turn to the trustee\u2019s assertion that the Bank\u2019s security interest in Ollag\u2019s inventory and equipment is a voidable preference. The Bank argues that of the seven prerequisites for voidability under \u00a7 60 of the Act,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the trustee has failed to establish two. It asserts that Ollag was not insolvent when the security interest was taken and, moreover, that the Bank did not have reasonable cause to believe that Ollag was then insolvent. We remand for further findings on both issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-12\">A debtor is insolvent under the Bankruptcy Act if \u2018\u2018the aggregate of [its] property . . . shall not at a fair valuation be sufficient in amount to pay [its] debts.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For purposes of \u00a7 60 of the Act, insolvency is determined as of the time of the alleged preferential transfer.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-14\">In February 1973, Ollag\u2019s physical assets consisted entirely of construction equip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>ment valued at approximately $100,000 to $165,000.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Its only liabilities of any significance were its contingent obligations as guarantor of Deplan\u2019s note and as indemnitor on Deplan\u2019s performance and payment bonds. But these liabilities were tied to certain intangible assets. For example, although the face amount of Ollag\u2019s guaranty on Deplan\u2019s note was $200,000, Ollag had a right of subrogation to recover against De-plan on the Bank\u2019s claims. Moreover, Ollag could demand contribution from the co-guarantors, Sheldon and the Gallos. Similarly, Ollag\u2019s indemnity liability to Travelers might have been offset by a recovery over against Sheldon and the Gallos, who were also co-indemnitors. All of this leads us to the conclusion that there were important factors weighing on the question of Ollag\u2019s insolvency which were not considered below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">Learned Hand\u2019s landmark opinion in <em>Syracuse Engineering Co. v. Haight, </em>97 F.2d 573, 576 (2d Cir. 1938), taught us that contingent subrogation and contribution rights must be valued as assets in determining solvency. <em>See also Updike v. Oakland Motor Car Co., </em>53 F.2d 369, 371 (2d Cir. 1931); <em>Wingert v. President Director &amp; Company of Hagerstown Bank, </em>41 F.2d 660 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>282 U.S. 871, 51 S.Ct. 77, 75 L.Ed. 769 (1930). <em>Cf. Schwartz v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>560 F.2d 311, 317 (8th Cir. 1977). In the case at bar, we are left in murky obscurity regarding the actual value of Ollag\u2019s contingent assets. The courts below treated Ollag\u2019s subrogation right against Deplan as effectively valueless.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is obvious, however, that, holding a valid security interest in Deplan\u2019s equipment as collateral for the $200,000 note, the Bank could expect to collect a substantial portion of its debt even if Deplan were insolvent. Indeed, the Bank eventually recovered approximately $139,-000 through the sale of Deplan\u2019s equipment. As subrogee, Ollag was the successor to all of the Bank\u2019s rights against Deplan, including the Bank\u2019s security interest in Deplan\u2019s equipment. N.Y.U.C.C. \u00a7 9-504(5). <em>See, e.g., First National Bank v. Jefferson Sales &amp; Distributors, Inc., </em>341 F.Supp. 659 (S.D. Miss.1971), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>460 F.2d 1059 (5th Cir. 1972). Accordingly, we must conclude that the bankruptcy judge\u2019s finding, affirmed by Judge Elfvin, that Ollag\u2019s sub-rogation right against Deplan was of minimal worth is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">But we must also consider the extent, if any, of Ollag\u2019s liability to Travelers under the indemnity agreement. The Bank contends that the trustee has failed to meet his burden of proof in establishing this liability, <em>see Cohen v. Sutherland, </em>257 F.2d 737 (2d Cir. 1958), and if it is excluded, Ollag was almost certainly solvent in February 1973.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On the record before us, however, we cannot agree. Although the liability was not specifically assessed below, there is evidence in the record from which a valuation might be estimated.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We leave the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>tion of the sufficiency of this evidence to the bankruptcy court in the first instance. Accordingly, we reverse the determination that Ollag was insolvent in February 1973 and remand to the bankruptcy court for specific findings of the value, as of February 1973, of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-5\">(1) Ollag\u2019s physical assets;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-6\">(2) Ollag\u2019s right of subrogation to the Bank\u2019s secured claim against Deplan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-7\">(3) Ollag\u2019s rights of contribution against Sheldon and the Gallos as co-guarantors of Deplan\u2019s note to the Bank and co-indemnitors on Travelers\u2019s performance and payment bonds;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-8\">(4) Ollag\u2019s expected liability to Travelers under the indemnity agreement covering the performance and payment bonds, assuming that liability is established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">These assessments are to be made with \u201csuch detail and exactness as the nature of the case permits.\u201d <em>Kelley v. Everglades Drainage District, </em>319 U.S. 415, 420, 63 S.Ct. 1141, 1144, 87 L.Ed. 1485 (1943). We recognize that valuation of contingent assets and liabilities is, an arduous task, and on occasions only approximations can be made. For this reason, reversals under Bankruptcy Rule 752<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> are appropriate only when the reviewing court cannot determine the basis of the ruling below. <em>In re D. H. Overmyer Co., </em>510 F.2d 329 (2d Cir. 1975). Nevertheless, although we do not decide whether the decision below would have passed muster under Rule 752 absent the clear undervaluation of Ollag\u2019s subrogation claim against Deplan, we note that more detailed findings originally could have obviated the need to remand the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-14\">Since we do not decide whether Ollag was insolvent when the security interest was taken, we cannot resolve the related question whether the Bank had reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent at that time. But we must conclude that, as a sophisticated creditor deeply involved in Deplan\u2019s financial woes and well aware of the close relationship between Deplan and Ollag, the Bank was \u201con inquiry\u201d with respect to matters affecting Ollag\u2019s financial condition. <em>See In re Hygrade Envelope Corp., </em>366 F.2d 584, 588-89 (2d Cir. 1966); <em>Miller v. Wells Fargo Bank International Corp., </em>406 F.Supp. 452, 464-65 (S.D. N.Y.1975), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>540 F.2d 548, 555-56 (2d Cir. 1976). Proper inquires would certainly have disclosed the existence of Ollag\u2019s indemnity agreement with Travelers. Accordingly, we hold that the Bank is chargeable with knowledge of that arrangement. If the bankruptcy court determines on remand that Ollag had a negative net worth in February 1973, it should then consider whether, with knowledge of all information available upon diligent inquiry into the Gallo enterprise\u2019s affairs, the Bank would have had reasonable cause to conclude that Ollag was insolvent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1009-13\">.

Judge McGuire originally found that Leopold did not have the requisite authority, but he withdrew that finding as unnecessary in view of his holding that the security agreement was void under \u00a7 908. Judge Elfvin stated that he would have remanded for a finding were he not affirming the holding that the security interest was a voidable preference. But an appellate court is as well placed as a trial court to construe a written instrument, <em>Adler v. Nicholas, </em>381 F.2d 168, 170-71 (5th Cir. 1967); <em>cf. In re Morasco, </em>233 F.2d 11, 14-15 (2d Cir. 1956), and we therefore see no need for further findings on the issue.

Judge McGuire held that because Deplan, . Sheldon, and the Gallos were all insolvent when the transfer was effected, subrogation and contribution rights against them would be worth little.

The claim record for the Erie County Water Authority project, Defendant\u2019s Exhibit J, shows credits of some $65,230.90. We do not pass on whether these documents are sufficient to establish a value for Ollag\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>contingent liability as of February 1973, but in the absence of a finding below we cannot say that there is so little evidence concerning that liability as to justify excluding the liability from consideration on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">.
