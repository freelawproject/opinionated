Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., </em>5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1160-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1160-9\">Defendant James Richard Cleckler, convicted of unlawful and knowing possession of an unregistered firearm [26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5861(d)], attacks the validity of the search of his residence because the affidavit supporting the warrant (1) did not set forth the time when the informer saw the homemade bomb described in the warrant, (2) used the past tense in describing the informer\u2019s observations, (3) described only an isolated offense, and (4) failed to properly support the need for timeliness. The homemade bomb sought was not found, but the illegal gun was.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-10\">Reading the affidavit in a realistic and commonsense manner, <em>United States v. Maestas, </em>546 F.2d 1177, 1180 (5th Cir. 1977), the affidavit supports the finding of probable cause necessary to validate the warrant. <em>See United States v. Guinn, </em>454 F.2d 29 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>407 U.S. 911, 92 S.Ct. 2437, 32 L.Ed.2d 685 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-12\">The affidavit states that within the last 24 hours affiant received confidential information that \u201csaid Informer has seen with his own eyes a homemade bomb made with four sticks of dynamite taped together around an alarm clock with four wires connected to said clock,\u201d and that the device \u201cis\u201d hidden in a closet of Cleckler\u2019s residence. The clear inference to be drawn from the affidavit is that the information is recent, so that the exact time the informer saw the article is unimportant in context. The affidavit went on to state that such device is dangerous and \u201cmay easily be used to create an explosion or to set a fire as some of the arson cases which are under investigation appear that they may have been started by a type of explosion.\u201d These facts support affiant\u2019s statement that there is need for an immediate search.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-13\">All defendant\u2019s objections to the affidavit are technical and without sufficient merit to overcome the legal principles which require only a showing of probability of criminal activity, <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969), and admonish that doubtful or marginal cases \u201cshould be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants.\u201d <em>United States v. Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 109, 85 S.Ct. 741, 746, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965). <em>See also, Franks v. Delaware, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014 , \u2014 \u2014 , 98 S.Ct. 2674, 2684, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
