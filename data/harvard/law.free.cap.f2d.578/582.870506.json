Although some state and federal courts have spelled the petitioner\u2019s surname \u201cSpinkellink,\u201d the correct spelling, according to the petitioner\u2019s brief, is \u201cSpenkelink.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b690-7\">AINSWORTH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">This case involves the petition for a writ of habeas corpus by a Florida state inmate under sentence of death. On February 4, 1973, petitioner John A. Spenkelink, a 24-year-old white male and twice convicted felon, who had escaped from a California correctional camp, murdered his traveling companion, Joseph J. Szymankiewicz, a white male, in their Tallahassee, Florida motel room. Spenkelink shot Szymankiew-icz, who was asleep in bed, once in the head just behind the left ear and a second time in the back, which fragmented the spine, ruptured the aorta, and resulted in the victim\u2019s death. The petitioner then recounted a cover story to the motel proprietor in order to delay discovery of the body and left.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Authorities apprehended him less than one week later in Buena Park, California. On December 20, 1973, subsequent to a jury verdict of guilty of first degree murder, Spenkelink was sentenced to the death penalty by a Florida state court trial judge on the jury\u2019s recommendation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Now, five years later, following an unsuccessful direct appeal and unsuccessful collateral review in the Florida state courts, and two unsuccessful petitions for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court, Spenkelink seeks federal habeas corpus relief. He asks this Court, in effect, to reverse his conviction and annul the decision that he must die for his premeditated act of murder. After reviewing the record with painstaking care and considering each of the petitioner\u2019s contentions, we have determined that Spenkel-ink\u2019s conviction and sentence were proper. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-14\">I. Statement of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"AWA\">A. State Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b690-15\">Spenkelink was found guilty of first degree murder by a jury in the Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit in Leon County, Florida.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under Florida law first degree murder is a capital felony, Fla.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 782.04(1),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> punishable either by life imprisonment with eligibility for parole af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>ter twenty-five years or by death, Fla.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 775.082(1),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which in Florida is by electrocution. Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 922.10. <em>See </em>id. \u00a7 922.11. In response to <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972), Florida by legislative act has provided that a defendant convicted of a capital felony must be provided a bifurcated trial, with a separate sentencing proceeding following his conviction to determine whether he shall receive the death penalty or life imprisonment. The relevant statute, Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 921.141, which is set forth in footnote<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> below, requires that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>the sentencing proceeding be held before the trial jury,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which is to reach its decision by a majority vote after considering whether there are sufficient statutorily-defined aggravating circumstances and, if so, whether sufficient statutorily-defined mitigating circumstances exist that outweigh the aggravating circumstances. The jury\u2019s determination is advisory only. That recommendation notwithstanding, the trial court must make the final sentencing decision, but if the court imposes a sentence of death, it must set forth written findings of fact to support its decision. Thus the trial court, in order to impose the death penalty, must find that sufficient statutorily-defined aggravating circumstances exist to justify the death penalty and that there are insufficient statutorily-defined mitigating circumstances to outweigh the aggravating circumstances found to exist. Additionally, \u201c[i]n order to sustain a sentence of death following a jury recommendation of life, the facts suggesting a sentence of death should be so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ.\u201d <em>Tedder v. State, </em>322 So.2d 908, 910 (Fla. 1975). The Florida Supreme Court automatically reviews each conviction and sentence of death on an expedited basis.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-15\">The trial jury recommended that Spen-kelink receive the death penalty. The trial court agreed. Pursuant to Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 921.141(3), it found that the felony \u201cwas committed for pecuniary gain, either for another person\u2019s money or to re-coup his own,\u201d that the crime \u201cwas especially heinous, atrocious and cruel,\u201d that Spenkelink \u201cwas previously convicted of a felony involving the use, or threat of violence to another, to-wit: armed robbery,\u201d and that Spenkelink committed the crime while \u201cun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>der sentence of imprisonment: mitigating circumstance found by the trial court was \u201cthat possibly the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance,\u201d a consideration which, \u201cbased on the record as a whole,\u201d the court did not regard \u201cas a substantial factor.\u201d <em>See </em>Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 921.141(5), (6). The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed both the conviction and sentence. <em>Spinkellink </em>v. <em>State, </em>313 So.2d 666 (Fla.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>428 U.S. 911, 96 S.Ct. 3227, 49 L.Ed.2d 1221 (1976). With respect to the sentence of death, the Florida Supreme Court stated: The only</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-3\">As more fully set out above the record shows this crime to be premeditated, especially cruel, atrocious, and heinous and in connection with robbery of the victim to secure return of money claimed by Appellant. The aggravating circumstances justify imposition of the death sentence. Both Appellant and his victim were career criminals and Appellant showed no mitigating factors to require a more lenient sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">313 So.2d at 671. The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. <em>Spenkelink v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. 911, 96 S.Ct. 3227, 49 L.Ed.2d 1221 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The petitioner next sought executive clemency. Article IV, section 8(a) of the Florida Constitution provides that the governor of Florida, with the approval of three members of the cabinet, may commute punishment. Pursuant to rules adopted by the governor and the cabinet regarding executive clemency, Spenkelink appeared first before the Florida Parole and Probation Commission, which recommended to the governor that clemency be denied. Counsel for Spenkelink and for the State then appeared before the governor and cabinet to argue the clemency issue. On September 12, 1977, the governor denied clemency and signed a death warrant setting Spenkelink\u2019s electrocution for 8:30 a. m. on September 19, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">On September 13, the petitioner, pursuant to Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.850, filed a motion to vacate, set aside or correct sentence in the Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit in Leon County, Florida. The motion was dismissed and the Supreme Court of Florida affirmed. <em>Spenkelink v. State, </em>350 So.2d 85 (Fla.1977). The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. <em>Spenkelink v. Florida, </em>434 U.S. 960, 98 S.Ct. 492, 54 L.Ed.2d 320 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">B. Federal Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"Azk\">Having exhausted his state court remedies, Spenkelink turned to federal court. On September 14 he filed a petition for habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, which transferred the case to the Northern District of Florida. Judge William Stafford of the Northern District stayed the execution and scheduled an evidentiary hearing for September 21. At that time a hearing was held, which began during late morning and lasted into the evening, and which produced over 300 pages of testimony. On September 23 the district court dismissed the petition and ordered that the stay of execution expire at noon on September 30. The district court also granted Spenkelink a certificate of probable cause to appeal, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. This Court then stayed the execution pending further order.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">II. The Petitioner\u2019s Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"alq-dedup-0\">On appeal Spenkelink urges three general contentions through which he asserts the contentions in his habeas corpus petition. First, he contends that the district court erroneously denied him the right to submit evidence during the evidentiary hearing on some of the contentions in his petition, which the district court found to \u201chave been authoritatively disposed of by the United States Supreme Court.\u201d Second, he contends that the district court erroneously denied his motion for a continuance and therefore denied him an adequate opportunity to present evidence during the eviden-tiary hearing on other contentions in his petition. Third, he asserts that the district court erroneously ruled against him on the merits of several of the contentions in his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>In support of his contentions that the trial court erred in not holding an evidentiary hearing on some of his claims and that the trial court held an inadequate hearing on others, the petitioner points to <em>Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 313, 83 S.Ct. 745, 757, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), where the Supreme Court set forth the circumstances under which a federal district court must hold an evidentiary hearing on allegations in a habeas corpus petition. The requirements of <em>Townsend </em>as to when a hearing must be held are now codified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When, however, it affirmatively appears from the petition that a petitioner is not entitled to the writ, an evidentiary hearing is unnecessary. <em>Guillory v. Allgood, </em>5 Cir., 1967, 379 F.2d 273, 274. <em>See also Coco v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 569 F.2d 367, 369. For example, if a petitioner\u2019s habeas corpus allegations raise legal questions only, a district court\u2019s refusal to hold an evidentiary hearing does not violate the directives of <em>Townsend </em>or Section 2254(d). <em>Anderson v. Maggio, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 555 F.2d 447, 453. This rule would also apply when a trial court holds an inadequate evidentiary hearing, for if only questions of law \u00e1re involved, an evidentiary hearing to develop fully the facts underlying a petitioner\u2019s complaints would be pointless. This Court views those of Spen-kelink\u2019s contentions on which the trial court did not conduct a hearing and those on which the court conducted an allegedly inadequate hearing as containing legal questions only. We assume for the sake of argument that the factual allegations underlying these contentions are true, because, even if they are, the petitioner cannot prevail on them as a matter of law for reasons soon to be discussed. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in its conduct with respect to the evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>With this procedural question behind us, we turn to the substantive contentions urged in the petition for habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">A. Exclusion of Veniremen</p>\n<p id=\"A8-\">Spenkelink contends first that at his trial the exclusion for cause of two veniremen who had conscientious scruples against the death penalty (1) violated the requirements of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments set forth in <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968), (2) violated his right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to trial by an impartial jury, (3) violated his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to trial by a jury selected from a representative cross-section of the community, and (4) subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">During the voir dire examination of the jury, counsel for Spenkelink contemporaneously objected to the exclusion for cause of the two veniremen in question. His counsel did not, however, raise any of these contentions regarding the veniremen\u2019s exclusion on direct appeal to the Florida Supreme Court. Additionally, although a court reporter recorded the voir dire testimony, neither Spenkelink nor his trial attorney requested the court reporter to transcribe it, and his trial attorney even expressly excluded the voir dire examination from testimony designated to be transcribed for the appellate record.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Florida Supreme Court on collateral review, <em>Spenkelink v. State, supra, </em>and the district court below, both relying on <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977), found that Spenkelink had waived his contentions regarding the exclusion of the two veniremen.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">In <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a defendant who did not contemporaneously object, and whose attorney did not contemporaneously object, during the defendant\u2019s state trial to the involuntariness of the defendant\u2019s confession waived his objection- and could not thereafter raise the issue on federal habeas corpus review. Justice Rehnquist, writing for the majority, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvN\">We therefore conclude that Florida procedure did, consistently with the United States Constitution, require that petitioner\u2019s confession be challenged at trial or not at all, and thus his failure to timely object to its admission amounted to an independent and adequate state procedural ground which would have prevented direct review here. See <em>Henry v. Mississippi, </em>379 U.S. 443, 85 S.Ct. 564, 13 L.Ed.2d 408 (1965). We thus come to the crux of this ease. Shall the rule of <em>Francis v. Henderson, supra </em>[425 U.S. 536, 96 S.Ct. 1708, 48 L.Ed.2d 149] barring federal habeas review absent a showing of \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d attendant to a state procedural waiver, be applied to a waived objection to the admission of a confession at trial? We answer that question in the affirmative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">433 U.S. at 86, 97 S.Ct. at 2506. The Supreme Court made clear that federal habeas corpus review would not be barred if a defendant could show actual \u201cprejudice\u201d from or \u201ccause\u201d for his failure to follow the state procedural rule. <em>Id. See Francis v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number><em>Henderson, </em>425 U.S. 536, 542, 96 S.Ct. 1708, 1711, 48 L.Ed.2d 149 (1976). As to whether the defendant in <em>Wainwright v. Sykes </em>had shown cause or prejudice, the Court stated that \u201c[wjhatever precise content may be given those terms by later cases, we feel confident in holding without further elaboration that they do not exist here.\u201d 433 U.S. at 91, 97 S.Ct. at 2508. <em>Compare Sincox </em>v. <em>United States, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 571 F.2d 876; <em>Jiminez v. Estelle, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 557 F.2d 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Whether Spenkelink\u2019s procedural default actually falls within the ambit of <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, supra, </em>and, concomitantly, whether sufficient cause or prejudice exists in this case so as not to bar federal habeas corpus review, are difficult questions on which we need not pass. Spenkelink\u2019s contentions regarding the exclusion of the two veniremen must fail on their merits as a matter of law for reasons to be discussed; the petitioner thus is not entitled to relief on the basis of these contentions even if <em>Wainwright v. Sykes </em>does not prevent him from raising them. Therefore, we proceed to a consideration of the merits of the contentions themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, supra, </em>the Supreme Court held that the jury impartiality to which a criminal defendant is entitled under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> precludes a state from executing a person if the jury that imposed or recommended the death penalty \u201cwas chosen by excluding veniremen for cause simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction.\u201d 391 U.S. at 518, 522, 88 S.Ct. at 1775, 1777. It cannot be assumed, the Court stated, that such veniremen will never vote in favor of the death penalty or would not consider doing so in the case from which they were excluded. Consequently, to exclude them for cause results in the selection of \u201ca tribunal organized to return a verdict of death.\u201d 391 U.S. at 515 n. 9, 521, 88 S.Ct. 1773 n. 9, 1776. Only when a venireman is \u201cirrevocably committed, before the trial has begun, to vote against the penalty of death regardless of the facts and circumstances that might emerge in the course of the proceedings\u201d can he be struck for cause. 391 U.S. at 522-23 n. 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1777 n. 21. The <em>Witherspoon </em>Court more carefully defined its holding through a paragraph in footnote 21 of its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-10\">We repeat, however, that nothing we say today bears upon the power of a State to execute a defendant sentenced to death by a jury from which the only veniremen who were in fact excluded for cause were those who made unmistakably clear (1) that they would <em>automatically </em>vote against the imposition of capital punishment without regard to any evidence that might be developed at the trial of the case before them, or (2) that their attitude toward the death penalty would prevent them from making an impartial decision as to the defendant\u2019s <em>guilt. </em>Nor does the decision in this case affect the validity of any sentence <em>other </em>than one of death. Nor, finally, does today\u2019s holding render invalid the <em>conviction, </em>as opposed to the <em>sentence, </em>in this or any other case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApR3\"><em>Id. </em>[emphasis in original]</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">The transcript of the voir dire examination of the two excluded veniremen is set forth in Appendix A. A reading of the transcript demonstrates that both veniremen stated unambiguously that they could fairly judge Spenkelink\u2019s guilt or innocence. However, both veniremen also made it \u201cunmistakably clear . . . that they would <em>automatically </em>vote against the imposition of capital punishment without regard to any evidence that might be developed at the trial of the case before them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>response to the question \u201c[W]ould you automatically vote against the imposition of capital punishment without regard to the evidence?\u201d, venireman Ferrell stated, \u201cCapital punishment, yes.\u201d In response to the same question venireman Colson replied, \u201cI would.\u201d The record could not be clearer. The veniremen were properly excluded for cause and there was no <em>Witherspoon </em>violation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See, e. g., Davis v. Georgia, </em>429 U.S. 122, 97 S.Ct. 399, 50 L.Ed.2d 339 (1976); <em>Maxwell v. Bishop, </em>398 U.S. 262, 90 S.Ct. 1578, 26 L.Ed.2d 221 (1970); <em>Boulden v. Holman, </em>394 U.S. 478, 89 S.Ct. 1138, 22 L.Ed.2d 433 (1969); Note, <em>Jury Selection and the Death Penalty: Witherspoon in the Lower Courts, </em>37 <em>U.Chi.L.Rev. </em>759, 762-63 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The petitioner's second argument is that even if the two veniremen were properly excluded for cause under <em>Witherspoon </em>from recommending his sentence, their exclusion for cause still violated his right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to trial by an impartial jury, because the exclusion of the two veniremen resulted in the selection of a \u201cdeath-qualified\u201d jury that was \u201cprosecution-prone\u201d with respect to the question of guilt or innocence. Spenkelink acknowledges that this contention was submitted to the Supreme Court in <em>Wither-spoon </em>and that the Court expressly declined to embrace it, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-9\">We simply cannot conclude, either on the basis of the record now before us or as a matter of judicial notice, that the exclusion of jurors opposed to capital punishment results in an unrepresentative jury on the issue of guilt or substantially increases the risk of conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArK\"><em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, supra, </em>391 U.S. at 518, 88 S.Ct. at 1774-75. Spenkelink suggests nonetheless that if this Court will remand his case for an additional evidentia-ry hearing, he will develop a more complete record than the one before the Supreme Court in <em>Witherspoon </em>and prove the contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">The petitioner complains of jury partiality. He alleges that the exclusion for cause of the two veniremen resulted in a \u201cdeath-qualified\u201d jury that was \u201cprosecution-prone.\" From this he concludes, by implication, that a nondeath-qualified jury \u2014 in this case a jury which includes the two excluded veniremen \u2014 would be impartial with respect to the question of guilt or innocence. This is not necessarily so. When the petitioner asserts that a death-qualified jury is prosecution-prone, he means that a death-qualified jury is more likely to convict than a nondeath-qualified jury.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Proof that this proposition is true is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>far from conclusive,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> but for the moment we will assume its validity. Even if it is true, the petitioner\u2019s contention still must fail. That a death-qualified jury is more likely to convict than a nondeath-qualified jury does not demonstrate which jury is impartial. It indicates only that a death-qualified jury might favor the prosecution and that a nondeath-qualified jury might favor the defendant. The pivotal question, therefore, is which appearance most closely reflects reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">In the instant ease a reading of the transcript of the voir dire examination demonstrates that those veniremen who were chosen to be jurors in no way indicated that they were biased for the prosecution or against the defendant. None of the veniremen indicated, for example, that he had a preconceived opinion as to the petitioner\u2019s guilt or innocence, compare <em>Williams v. </em>Wainwright, 5 Cir., 1970, 427 F.2d 921, 924, <em>modified, </em>408 U.S. 941, 92 S.Ct. 2864, 33 L.Ed.2d 765 (1972), or that he believed it would be his duty in every case to recommend that the trial court sentence a defendant found guilty of first degree murder to capital punishment. <em>Compare Stroud v. United States, </em>251 U.S. 15, 20-21, 40 S.Ct. 50, 52, 64 L.Ed. 103 (1919); <em>Crawford v. Bounds, </em>4 Cir., 1968, 395 F.2d 297, 301-04, <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 936, 90 S.Ct. 941, 25 L.Ed.2d 117 (1970); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Puff, </em>2 Cir., 211 F.2d 171, <em>184, cert. denied, </em>347 U.S. 963, 74 S.Ct. 713, 98 L.Ed. 1106 (1954). Had a venireman expressed either attitude, he could appropriately be described as prosecution-prone and would properly have been struck for cause. <em>E. g., Witherspoon v. Illinois, supra, </em>391 U.S. at 521, 88 S.Ct. at 1776; <em>Fay v. People of State of New York, </em>332 U.S. 261, 294, 67 S.Ct. 1613, 1630, 91 L.Ed. 2043 (1947); <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 83-87, 62 S.Ct. 457, 471-72, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>Stroud v. United States, supra, </em>251 U.S. at 20-21, 40 S.Ct. at 52; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Wainwright, supra, </em>427 F.2d at 923-24; <em>Crawford v. Bounds, supra, </em>395 F.2d at 303-04; <em>United States v. Puff, supra, </em>211 F.2d at 184; Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.330, 3.340. Instead, the veniremen chosen to be jurors indicated only that they had no conscientious scruples against the death penalty and that in a proper case they would recommend capital punishment which, as the Supreme Court made clear in, e. <em>g., Proffitt v. Florida, supra, </em>and <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976), is constitutional if administered through a properly drawn statute. In other words, the veniremen indicated only that they would be willing to perform their civic obligation as jurors and obey the law. Such persons cannot accurately be branded prosecution-prone. Consider in this regard the comments of the late Judge Prettyman of the D.C. Circuit: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>[O]ur own inquiry has brought to our attention another thesis in this area of the law. It is that persons who are not opposed to capital punishment are psychologically inclined against criminals and therefore a jury composed of such persons is not an impartial jury. We understand that this thesis has not as yet received the sanction of any court. We cannot accept it. We examine it because this is a serious case, and if the thesis were tenable it might cause reversal. No proof is available, so far as we know, and we can imagine none, to indicate that, generally speaking, persons not opposed to capital punishment are so bent in their hostility to criminals as to be incapable of rendering impartial verdicts on the law and the evidence in a capital case. Being not opposed to capital punishment is not synonymous with favoring it. Individuals may indeed be so prejudiced in respect to serious crimes that they cannot be impartial arbiters, but that extreme is not indicated by mere lack of opposition to capital punishment. The two antipathies can readily coexist; contrariwise either can exist without the other; and, indeed, neither may exist in a person. It seems clear enough to us that a person or a group of persons may not be opposed to capital punishment and at the same time may have no particular bias against any one criminal or, indeed, against criminals as a class; people, it seems to us, may be completely without a controlling conviction one way or the other on either subject. We think the premise for the thesis has no substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\"><em>Tuberville v. United States, supra, </em>112 U.S. App.D.C. at 409, 303 F.2d at 420-21. <em>See Pope v.

They also represented that they would fairly judge the petitioner\u2019s guilt or innocence. The state trial court, nonetheless, struck them for cause, thus excluding them completely from the trial. We find nothing constitutionally impermissible by a state following such a procedure. Florida apparently has concluded that, if for whatever noble reason \u2014 religious conviction, philosophical posture, intellectual stance, or some other reason \u2014 a venireman clings so steadfastly to the belief that capital punishment is wrong that he would never under <em>any </em>circumstances agree to recommend the sentence of death, it is entirely possible \u2014 perhaps even probable \u2014 that such a venireman could not fairly judge a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence when a capital felony is charged. Suppose, for example, that the evidence at trial proved the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and demonstrated, within the meaning of the Florida death penalty statute, that capital punishment could be warranted. A juror who had such deeply-seated conscientious scruples against the death penalty might find himself confronting a grisly choice. If, because of his scruples, he votes to acquit, he must risk hanging the jury.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Similarly motivated votes by other jurors in subsequent trials and retrials could, in effect, result in near immunity from crimes for which the death penalty can be imposed, which would frustrate Florida\u2019s interest in the just and evenhanded application of its laws, including its death penalty statute. If the juror votes to convict, he must risk betrayal of his principles should the death penalty eventually be imposed. Even under Florida\u2019s bifurcated trial procedure in these cases, the situation would be no less problematic. Although the juror could be excused from the jury during the sentencing phase of the trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>during the guilt-determination phase he still would know that a vote to convict could eventually mean the death penalty, a result to which he would have contributed, if only indirectly. His choices as to how to vote on the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence would remain equally troublesome.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The right under the- Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to trial by a jury guarantees to the criminally accused \u201ca fair trial by a panel of impartial, \u2018indifferent\u2019 jurors.\u201d <em>Irvin v. Dowd, supra, </em>366 U.S. at 722, 81 S.Ct. at 1642. <em>Accord, </em>e. <em>g., Murphy v. Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 799, 95 S.Ct. 2031, 2036, 44 L.Ed.2d 589 (1975). But the state also enjoys the right to an impartial jury, <em>Williams v. Wainwright, supra, </em>427 F.2d at 923, and impartiality requires not only freedom from jury bias against the accused and for the prosecution, but freedom from jury bias for the accused and against the prosecution. <em>Hayes v. Missouri, </em>120 U.S. 68, 70-71, 7 S.Ct. 350, 351, 30 L.Ed. 578 (1887). <em>See </em>Comment, 21 <em>Vand.L.Bev. </em>864, 865 (1968). Florida has reasoned that a person may so cherish his conscientious scruples against the death penalty that he would favor the acquittal of a defendant charged with a capital felony. This is not, of course, necessarily true of all persons who would refuse under any circumstances to recommend death. Some such veniremen might be able to subordinate their personal views to their duty to abide by their oaths as jurors and to obey the law of Florida. <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, supra, </em>391 U.S. at 514 n. <em>7, </em>88 S.Ct. at 1773 n. 7, and cases cited therein. Florida, however, has determined that even though a venireman states he can fairly judge guilt or innocence, if he also states that he is irrevocably committed before the trial has begun to vote against the penalty of death, regardless of the facts and circumstances that might emerge at trial, he must be excluded completely. The state has decided that the parties\u2019 right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to an impartial trial and the state\u2019s interest in the just and evenhanded application of its laws, including Florida\u2019s death penalty statute, are too fundamental to risk a defendant-prone jury from the inclusion of such veniremen.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Constitution does not prohibit this judgment. <em>See Logan v.

Louisiana, </em>419 U.S. 522, 95 S.Ct. 692, 42 L.Ed.2d 690 (1975), the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional Louisiana\u2019s jury selection process whereby women, who represented 53 per cent of the eligible jurors in the parishes in question, had to register in order to be called for jury duty, a requirement that systematically excluded- most eligible women from the jury venire. The Court held that such a jury selection system violated the criminal defendant's right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to trial by a jury selected from a representative cross-section of the community, which is \u201can essential component\u201d of the fundamental right under the Sixth Amendment to trial by a jury in non-petty criminal cases. 419 U.S. at 525-26, 528, 530-31, 537-38, 95 S.Ct. at 695, 697-98, 701-02. See <em>Duncan v. Louisiana, supra. </em>As justification for its exclusion of women, Louisiana argued \u201cthat women as a class serve a distinctive role in society\u201d as the center of home and family life and \u201cthat jury service would . . . substantially interfere with that function.\u201d 419 U.S. at 533, 534 n. 15, 535 n. 17, 95 S.Ct. at 699 &amp; n. 15, 700 n. 17. To this argument the Court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">The right to a proper jury cannot be overcome on merely rational grounds.

As we have already noted, Florida has reached the reasoned determination that the parties\u2019 right under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to an impartial jury and the state\u2019s interest in the just and evenhanded application of its laws, including Florida\u2019s death penalty statute, are too fundamental to risk a defendant-prone jury from the inclusion of such veniremen. As the petitioner in his brief concedes, a defendant would be unjustified in objecting, for instance, to the exclusion for cause of a class composed of veniremen who are related to him, even if the veniremen stated they could impartially judge his guilt or innocence, because the chance that such veniremen would be biased in favor of the defendant is too great. Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 57. Such danger is no less real when the excluded class is those veniremen properly struck under <em>Witherspoon </em>because of their conscientious scruples against capital punishment.

The Florida Death Penalty Statute</p>\n<p id=\"AIo_\">Spenkelink\u2019s next series of contentions are directed against the Florida death penalty statute, Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 921.141.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The petitioner attacks the statute as applied, pointing out that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s comprehensive review of the statute in <em>Proffitt v. Florida, supra, </em>resulted only in a declaration that Section 921.141 was constitutional on its face. Specifically, Spenkelink contends (1) that the death penalty under Section 921.141 is being applied arbitrarily, capriciously, excessively, and disproportionately in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, (2) that the death penalty under Section 921.141 is being systematically administered so as to induce guilty pleas from defendants charged with capital felonies, which allegedly penalizes these defendants\u2019 exercise of their right under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to plead not guilty, (3) that Section 921.141 contains unreliable procedures and standards for determining aggravating circumstances in violation of the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments, (4) that the death penalty under Section 921.-141 is being applied in a discriminatory fashion against defendants convicted of murdering whites, as opposed to blacks, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and in violation of Fourteenth Amendment equal protection, (5) that electrocution, which is Florida\u2019s method of carrying out a sentence of capital punishment, is unnecessarily torturous and wantonly cruel in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and (6) that the death penalty under Section 921.141 is being applied in a discriminatory fashion against males and poor persons in violation of Fourteenth Amendment equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">In his first contention the petitioner charges that the death penalty under Section 921.141 is being applied arbitrarily and capriciously, as well as excessively and disproportionately,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> in violation of the prohi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>bition against cruel and unusual punishment in the eighth and fourteenth amendments. Spenkelink points to his own case as evidence of these allegations, contending that \u201cit is apparent that virtually every death sentence reversed by the Florida Supreme Court has involved a more gruesome set 'of facts than the instant case.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 37. He contends further that \u201c[i]f the homicide in this case occurred today, it is inconceivable that [he] would be sentenced to death, for a plethora of Florida cases \u2014 all decided after <em>Spinkelink </em>\u2014 indicate that this sort of homicide is not deemed sufficiently heinous in Florida to merit the penalty of death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The Florida Legislature enacted Section 921.141 at least in part as a response to <em>Furman v. Georgia, supra. </em>In <em>Furman </em>the Supreme Court held that statutes which grant a jury unbridled discretion in the imposition of the death penalty allow the penalty to be imposed arbitrarily and capriciously, thus violating the ban under the eighth and fourteenth amendments against cruel and unusual punishment. <em>Furman </em>was a 5-4 per curiam decision with each Justice writing a separate opinion in which none of the others joined. Justices Douglas, Brennan, Stewart, White, and Marshall were in the majority, while Chief Justice Burger and Justices Blackmun, Powell, and Rehnquist dissented. Of those in the majority, only Justices Brennan and Marshall found the death penalty unconstitutional per se. 408 U.S. at 370-71, 92 S.Ct. at 2793-94 (Marshall, J., concurring); 408 U.S. at 305-06, 92 S.Ct. at 2760 (Brennan, J., concurring). Justice Douglas, on the other hand, emphasized that standardless capital punishment statutes allow the death penalty to be inflicted in a discriminatory fashion; as he put it, such statutes \u201care pregnant with discrimination.\u201d 408 U.S. at 257, 92 S.Ct. at 2735 (Douglas, J., concurring). Justice White stressed that discretionary statutes result in the death penalty being extracted so infrequently, even for the most atrocious crimes, \u201cthat there is no meaningful basis for distinguishing the few cases in which it is imposed from the many cases in which it is not,\u201d which causes the penalty to lose its deterrent effect. 408 U.S. at 312-13, 92 S.Ct. at 2764 (White, J., concurring). Justice Stewart felt that such statutes allow the death penalty to be applied \u201cwantonly\u201d and \u201cfreakishly\u201d to \u201ca capriciously selected random handful.\u201d 408 U.S. at 309-10, 92 S.Ct. at 2762-63 (Stewart, J., concurring). <em>See The Supreme Court, 1975 Term, </em>90 <em>Harv.L.Rev. </em>56, 63 &amp; n.3 (1976). <em>Fur-man, </em>then, did not hold that imposition of the death penalty per se violates the Constitution, but only that the manner in which it was being imposed \u2014 arbitrarily and capriciously \u2014 was unconstitutional. <em>See, e. g., Roberts v. Louisiana, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 335, 92 S.Ct. at 3007 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); <em>Woodson v.

In 1976 the Court returned to the subject of capital punishment in <em>Roberts v. Louisiana, supra; Woodson v. North Carolina, supra; Jurek v. Texas, supra; Proffitt v. Florida, supra; </em>and <em>Gregg v. Georgia, supra. </em>In <em>Gregg, Proffitt, </em>and <em>Jurek </em>the Court found constitutional, in light of <em>Furman, </em>death penalty statutes that articulated standards in the form of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>aggravating and mitigating circumstances concerning the nature of the crime as well as the nature of the criminal, which judges and juries were to follow in exercising their discretion as to which convicted murderers were to die for their crimes and which were to receive life sentences. In <em>Woodson </em>and <em>Roberts </em>the Court struck down statutes that made the death penalty mandatory for the commission of certain crimes; such statutes, stated the Court, necessarily run afoul of <em>Furman\u2019s </em>proscription of unbridled jury discretion in the imposition of capital punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The Florida statute held constitutional in <em>Proffitt v. Florida, supra, </em>was Section 921.-141, the identical statute the petitioner challenges in the case at hand. <em>See also State v. Dixon, </em>283 So.2d 1 (Fla.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 943, 94 S.Ct. 1950, 40 L.Ed.2d 295 (1974) (Section 921.141 held constitutional by Florida Supreme Court). Although the Court in <em>Proffitt </em>indicated that its concern was with the constitutionality of the statute on its face, 428 U.S. at 251-54, 96 S.Ct. at 2966-67 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.), we find quite instructive certain <em>Proffitt </em>passages in considering Spenkelink\u2019s contention that the death penalty under Section 921.141 is now being applied arbitrarily, capriciously, excessively, and disproportionately. In <em>Proffitt </em>the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">The Florida capital-sentencing procedures thus seek to assure that the death penalty will not be imposed in an arbitrary or capricious manner. Moreover, to the extent that any risk to the contrary exists, it is minimized by Florida\u2019s appellate review system, under which the evidence of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances is reviewed and reweighed by the Supreme Court of Florida \u201cto determine independently whether the imposition of the ultimate penalty is warranted.\u201d <em>Songer v. State, </em>322 So.2d 481, 484 (Fla.1975). See also <em>Sullivan v. State, </em>303 So.2d 632, 637 (Fla.1974). The Supreme Court of Florida, like that of Georgia, has not hesitated to vacate a death sentence when it has determined that the sentence should not have been imposed. Indeed, it has vacated eight of the 21 death sentences that it has reviewed to date. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>State, </em>294 So.2d 648 (Fla.1974); <em>Lamadline </em>v. <em>State, </em>303 So.2d 17 (Fla.1974); <em>Slater v. State, </em>316 So.2d 539 (Fla.1974); <em>Swan v.

Moreover, their decisions are reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with other sentence imposed in similar circumstances. Thus, in Florida, as in Georgia, it is no longer true that there is \u201c \u2018no meaningful basis for distinguishing the few cases in which [the death penalty] is imposed from the many cases where it is not.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gregg v.

On its face the Florida system thus satisfies the constitutional deficiencies identified in <em>Fur-man.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">428 U.S. at 253, 96 S.Ct. at 2967 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). Later the Court added:</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">Nonetheless the petitioner attacks the Florida appellate review process because the role of the Supreme Court of Florida in reviewing death sentences is necessarily subjective and unpredictable. While it may be true that that Court has not chosen to formulate a rigid objective test as its standard of review for all cases, it does not follow that the appellate review process is ineffective or arbitrary. In fact, it is apparent that the Florida Court has undertaken responsibly to perform its function of death sentence review with a maximum of rationality and consistency. For example, it has several times compared the circumstances of a case under review with those of previous cases in which it has assessed the imposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>death sentences. See, e. <em>g., Alford v. State, </em>307 So.2d 433, 445 (Fla.1975); <em>Alvord </em>v. <em>State, </em>322 So.2d 533, 540-541 (Fla.1975). By following this procedure the Florida Court has in effect adopted the type of proportionality review mandated by the Georgia statute. Cf. <em>Gregg v. Georgia, ante, </em>428 U.S. 204, 206, 96 S.Ct. pp. 2939-2941. And any suggestion that the Florida Court engages in only cursory or rubber stamp review of death penalty cases is totally controverted by the fact that it has vacated over one-third of the death sentences that have come before it. See p. 2967, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">428 U.S. at 258, 96 S.Ct. at 2969-70 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). Finally, in responding to the argument that Section 921.141\u2019s eighth aggravating circumstance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, the Court in <em>Proffitt </em>even mentioned the case of petitioner Spenkel-ink:</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The Supreme Court of Florida has affirmed death sentences in several cases, including the instant case, where this eighth statutory aggravating factor was found, without specifically stating that the homicide was \u201cpitiless\u201d or \u201ctorturous to the victim.\u201d See, e. <em>g., Hallman v. State, </em>305 So.2d 180 (1974) (victim\u2019s throat slit with broken bottle); <em>Spinkel-link </em>v. <em>State, </em>313 So.2d 666 (1975) (\u201ccareer criminal\u201d shot sleeping traveling companion); <em>Gardner v. State, </em>313 So.2d 675 (1975) (brutal beating and murder); <em>Alvord </em>v. <em>State, </em>322 So.2d 533 (1975) (three women killed by strangulation, one raped); <em>Douglas v. State, </em>328 So.2d 18 (1976) (depraved murder); <em>Henry v. State, </em>328 So.2d 430 (1976) (torture murder); <em>Dobbert v. State, </em>328 So.2d 433 (1976) (torture and killing of two children). But the circumstances of all of these cases could accurately be characterized as \u201cpitiless\u201d and \u201cunnecessarily torturous,\u201d and it thus does not appear that Florida Court has abandoned the definition that it announced in <em>Dixon </em>and applied in <em>Alford, Tedder, </em>and <em>Halliwell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">428 U.S. at 255 n. 12, 96 S.Ct. at 2968 n. 12 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Nonetheless, Spenkelink contends that his crime, in comparison to the crimes in other Florida death penalty cases, was insufficiently gruesome or heinous to warrant the death penalty.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In this regard, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Petitioner next claims that the death penalty is being imposed in an arbitrary, capricious, and irrational manner. In support of this contention petitioner points to other cases in which the Florida Supreme Court has commuted death sentences to life imprisonment and claims that his case is no worse than the majority of these and cannot, therefore, be reconciled with them. As the court noted at the beginning of the September 21 hearing, this line of inquiry has apparently been foreclosed by the decision rendered in <em>Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. 242, [96 S.Ct. 2960, 49 L.Ed.2d 913] (1976) . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\">Even if this issue had not been previously decided by the United States Supreme Court, petitioner has shown no basis to conclude that the Florida Supreme Court has failed to discharge its statutory duties responsibly. This court has considered the other death cases decided by the Florida Supreme Court and has compared the facts involved in those cases with the facts of petitioner\u2019s crime. In those instances where a sentence of death has been reversed by the Florida court, there appear significant mitigating circumstances that serve to fairly distinguish those cases from petitioner\u2019s. Thus, the petitioner has not shown anything to indicate that the death penalty has been imposed by the Florida judicial system in an irrational, arbitrary or capricious fashion, and the petitioner cannot prevail on this point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">It was not necessary for the district court to undertake such a case-by-case comparison. This conclusion rests upon which we believe the Supreme Court meant in <em>Prof-fitt </em>when it found Section 921.141 constitutional \u201con its face.\u201d The Court used the expression only twice. On the first occasion the Court stated that \u201c[o]n their face these procedures [provided for in Section 921.141], like .those used in Georgia, appear to meet the constitutional deficiencies identified in <em>Furman.\u201d </em>428 U.S. at 251, 96 S.Ct. at 2966 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). On the second occasion the Court stated that \u201c[o]n its face the Florida system thus satisfies the constitutional deficiencies identified in <em>Furman.\u201d </em>428 U.S. at 253, 96 S.Ct. at 2967 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). The second quotation implies that on its face Section 921.-141 conclusively removes the arbitrariness and capriciousness which Furman held vio-lative of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. If this is so, our concern here in this attack on Section 921.141 as applied would be whether the Florida courts have followed the statute in imposing Spenkel-ink\u2019s death sentence, and a comparison of Spenkelink\u2019s case with other Florida death penalty cases would be unnecessary. The first quotation, on the other hand, implies that Section 921.141 only potentially satisfies Furman\u2019s concern for arbitrariness and capriciousness. If this is so, our task in the instant case would be to compare Spenkel-ink\u2019s case with all other Florida death penalty cases in order to determine if Spenkei-ink was sentenced to death when other convicted murders, equally or more deserving to die, were given life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">If this latter interpretation is the correct reading of <em>Proffitt, </em>serious problems arise. First, every criminal defendant sentenced to death under Section 921.141 could through federal habeas corpus proceedings attack the statute as applied by alleging that other convicted murderers, equally or more deserving to die, had been spared, and thus that the death penalty was being applied arbitrarily and capriciously, as evidenced by his own case. The federal courts then would be compelled continuously to question every substantive decision of the Florida criminal justice system with regard to the imposition of the death penalty. The intrusion would not be limited to the Florida Supreme Court. It would be necessary also, in order to review properly the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decisions, to review the determinations of the trial courts. And in order to review properly those determinations, a careful examination of every trial record would be in order. A thorough re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>view would necessitate looking behind the decisions of jurors and prosecutors, as well. Additionally, unsuccessful litigants could, before their sentences were carried out, challenge their sentences again and again as each later-convicted murderer was given life imprisonment, because the circumstances of each additional defendant so sentenced would become additional factors to be considered. The process would be never-ending and the benchmark for comparison would be chronically undefined. Further, there is no reason to believe that the federal judiciary can render better justice. As the Florida Supreme Court itself so candidly admits, see <em>Provence v. State, supra, </em>337 So.2d at 787, reasonable persons can differ over the fate of every criminal defendant in every death penalty case. If the federal courts retried again and again the aggravating and mitigating circumstances in each of these cases, we may at times reach results different from those reached in the Florida state courts, but our conclusions would be no more, nor no less, accurate. Such is the human condition. <em>Cf. Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 493 n. 35, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 3051-3052 n. 35, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976) (condemning the respondents\u2019 \u201cbasic mistrust of the state courts as fair and competent forums for the adjudication of federal constitutional rights.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">The Supreme Court in <em>Proffitt, </em>or in <em>Furman, Gregg, Jurek, Woodson, </em>or <em>Roberts, </em>could not have intended these results. We understand these decisions to hold that capital punishment is not unconstitutional per se, and that a state, if it chooses, can punish murderers and seek to protect its citizenry by imposing the death penalty \u2014 so long as it does so through a statute with appropriate standards to guide discretion. If a state has such a properly drawn statute \u2014 and there can be no doubt that Florida has \u2014 -which the state follows in determining which convicted defendants receive the death penalty and which receive life imprisonment, then the arbitrariness and capriciousness condemned in <em>Furman </em>have been conclusively removed.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> For us to read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>these cases otherwise would thrust this Court and the district courts into the substantive decision making of the state court sentencing process which is rightfully reserved to the Florida state judiciary under Section 921.141. Under the Constitution, as well as fundamental notions of federalism and comity, that is not the role of the federal courts. Cf. <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">A review of the record demonstrates dramatically that the Florida state trial court and the Florida Supreme Court performed their unenviable duty of sentencing Spenkelink under Section 921.141 with care and concern.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Our inquiry must end there. As for Spenkelink\u2019s contention that this Court should go further, we think the remarks of Justice White in his concurring opinion in <em>Gregg v. Georgia, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 226, 96 S.Ct. at 2949 (White, J., concurring), are responsive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">Petitioner\u2019s argument that there is an unconstitutional amount of discretion in the system which separates those suspects who receive the death penalty from those who receive life imprisonment a lesser penalty or are acquitted or never charged seems to be in final analysis an indictment of our entire system of justice. Petitioner has argued in effect that no matter how effective the death penalty may be as a punishment, government, created and run as it must be by humans, is inevitably incompetent to administer it. This cannot be accepted as a proposition of constitutional law. Imposition of the death penalty is surely an awesome responsibility for any system of justice and those who participate in it. Mistakes will be made and discriminations will occur which will be difficult to explain. However, one of society\u2019s most basic tasks is that of protecting the lives of its citizens and one of the most basic ways in which it achieves the task is through criminal laws against murder. I decline to interfere with the manner in which Georgia has chosen to enforce such laws on what is simply an assertion of lack of faith in the ability of the system of justice to operate in a fundamentally fair manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-LW\">The petitioner\u2019s contention is without merit.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">In his second contention Spenkelink asserts that the death penalty under Section 921.141 is being systematically administered so as to induce guilty pleas from defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>charged with capital felonies, which allegedly penalizes exercise by these defendant? of their right under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to plead not guilty. According to the petitioner, this has the same effect as the federal statute condemned in <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>390 U.S. 570, 88 S.Ct. 1209, 20 L.Ed.2d 128 (1968), and thus is unconstitutional.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Succinctly stated, Spenkelink complains of abuse of discretion. Charles William Proffitt and Troy Gregg had similar complaints. In <em>Proffitt v. Florida, supra, </em>428 U.S. 254, 96 S.Ct. at 2967 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.), the Supreme Court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">The petitioner first argues that arbitrariness is inherent in the Florida criminal justice system because it allows discretion to be exercised at each stage of a criminal proceeding \u2014 the prosecutor\u2019s decision whether to charge a capital offense in the first place, his decision whether to accept a plea to a lesser offense, the jury\u2019s consideration of lesser included offenses, and, after conviction and unsuccessful appeal, the Executive\u2019s decision whether to commute a death sentence. As we noted in <em>Gregg, </em>this argument is based on a fundamental misinterpretation of <em>Furman, </em>and we reject it for the reasons expressed in <em>Gregg. </em>See <em>ante, </em>p. 2937.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">In <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 199, 96 S.Ct. at 2937 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">First, the petitioner focuses on the opportunities for discretionary action that are inherent in the processing of any murder case under Georgia law. He notes that the state prosecutor has unfettered authority to select those persons whom he wishes to prosecute for a capital offense and to plea bargain with them. Further, at the trial the jury may choose to convict a defendant of a lesser included offense rather than find him guilty of a crime punishable by death, even if the evidence would support a capital verdict. And finally, a defendant who is convicted and sentenced to die may have his sentence commuted by the Governor of the State and the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-12\">The existence of these discretionary stages is not determinative of the issues before us. At each of these stages an actor in the criminal justice system makes a decision which may remove a defendant from consideration as a candidate for the death penalty. <em>Furman, </em>in contrast, dealt with the decision to impose the death sentence on a specific individual who had been convicted of a capital offense. Nothing in any of our cases suggests that the decision to afford an individual defendant mercy violates the Constitution. <em>Furman </em>held only that, in order to minimize the risk that the death penalty would be imposed on a capriciously selected group of offenders, the decision to impose it had to be guided by standards so that the sentencing authority would focus on the particularized circumstances of the crime and the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">In footnote 50 in <em>Gregg, </em>the Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-14\">The petitioner\u2019s argument is nothing more than a veiled contention that <em>Fur-man </em>indirectly outlawed capital punishment by placing totally unrealistic conditions on its use. In order to repair the alleged defects pointed to by the petitioner, it would be necessary to require that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>prosecuting authorities charge a capital offense whenever arguably there had been a capital murder and that they refuse to plea bargain with the defendant. If a jury refused to convict even though the evidence supported the charge, its verdict would have to be reversed and a verdict of guilty entered or a new trial ordered, since the discretionary act of jury nullification would not be permitted. Finally, acts of executive clemency would have to be prohibited. Such a system, of course, would be totally alien to our notions of criminal justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-4\">Moreover, it would be unconstitutional. Such a system in many respects would have the vices of the mandatory death penalty statutes we hold unconstitutional today in <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, post, </em>428 U.S., p. 280, 96 S.Ct. p. 2978, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 and <em>Roberts v. Louisiana, post, </em>428 U.S., p. 325, 96 S.Ct. p. 3001, 49 L.Ed.2d 974. The suggestion that a jury\u2019s verdict of acquittal could be overturned and a defendant retried would run afoul of the Sixth Amendment jury-trial guarantee and the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In the federal system it also would be unconstitutional to prohibit a President from deciding, as an act of executive clemency, to reprieve one sentenced to death. U.S. Const., Art. II, \u00a7 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">428 U.S. at 198 n. 50, 96 S.Ct. 2937 n. 50 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The complaints of prosecutorial discretion in <em>Gregg </em>and <em>Proffitt, </em>as well as in <em>Jurek v. Texas, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 273, 96 S.Ct. at 2957 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.), were made and rejected in the context of Furman\u2019s concern for arbitrariness and capriciousness in the imposition of the death penalty. Here, of course, petitioner Spenkelink complains that the discretion approved in <em>Gregg, Proffitt, </em>and <em>Jurek </em>is now being systematically abused. <em>See generally Gregg v. Georgia, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 225, 96 S.Ct. at 2949 (White, J., concurring). Like the petitioner\u2019s argument in <em>Gregg, </em>Spenkelink\u2019s argument appears to be \u201cnothing more than a veiled contention that <em>Furman </em>indirectly outlawed capital punishment by placing totally unrealistic conditions on its use,\u201d <em>Gregg v. Georgia, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 198 n. 50, 96 S.Ct. 2937 n. 50, (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.), which <em>Furman </em>did not. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, we cannot say with assurance that the petitioner\u2019s allegation was answered in <em>Gregg, Proffitt, </em>or <em>Jurek, </em>so we must look further.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">Spenkelink\u2019s contention is without merit for several reasons. First, in Florida a defendant may be sentenced to death whether he pleads guilty or not guilty. <em>E. g., Surace v. State, </em>351 So.2d 702 (Fla.1977); <em>Thompson v. State, </em>351 So.2d 701 (Fla.1977); <em>Lamadline v. State, </em>303 So.2d 17 (Fla.1974). <em>United States v. Jackson, supra, </em>therefore, is inapplicable to the petitioner\u2019s contention because there the condemned statute provided in effect that a defendant could receive the death penalty only if he pleaded not guilty and went to trial. See note 29 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text. Second, the Supreme Court in <em>Bordenkircher </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 365, 98 S.Ct. 663, 669, 54 L.Ed.2d 604 (1978), recently held that plea-bargaining, in which the prosecutor openly presents a defendant with the unpleasant alternatives of pleading guilty to a lesser charge and foregoing trial or pleading not guilty and facing a more serious charge on which he plainly is subject to prosecution, and for which he would receive upon conviction life imprisonment, does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The fact that the prosecutor\u2019s plea-bargaining tool in <em>Bordenkircher </em>was life imprisonment and in this case it allegedly is the death penalty is a distinction without a difference. <em>Bordenkircher </em>controls the instant case. <em>See, e. g., Montgomery v. Estelle, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 568 F.2d 457. Finally, it is well settled that a plea bargain is not invalid per se because it is induced by fear of receiving the death penalty or because in agreeing to the plea bargain the defendant averts the possibility of receiving the death penalty. <em>See, e. g., Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 747, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 1468, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>(1970). Thus, if Florida prosecutors actually are using the threat of the death penalty under Section 921.141 in their plea-bargaining to induce guilty pleas, the practice is permissible,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and the petitioner\u2019s contention is without merit.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Spenkelink\u2019s third attack on Section 921.141 is that the statute contains unreliable procedures and standards for determining aggravating circumstances. First, the petitioner contends that the indictment alleged no aggravating circumstances, and no other form of notice informing him of the aggravating circumstances on which the State would rely in seeking the death penalty, or which the trial court would consider in imposing it, was given to him prior to the sentencing proceeding. According to the petitioner, this violated his right under Fourteenth Amendment due process and his right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to be informed of the nature of the charges against him,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and hindered his preparation for the rebuttal of the aggravating circumstances found in his case. This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-17\">Spenkelink cites no case, federal or state, which requires the prosecutor to list in the indictment the aggravating circumstances on which he will rely in seeking the death penalty. Whether such a requirement exists is an issue we need not reach in this case. A review of the record indicates that neither Spenkelink nor his attorney objected at trial to the indictment, which Fla.R. Crim.P. 3.190(c) requires in order for the alleged defect to be preserved for appellate review.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defect, if any, was waived.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, supra; Tennon v. Ricketts, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 574 F.2d 1243 [1978]; <em>St. John v. Estelle, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 563 F.2d 168 (en banc); <em>Nichols v. Estelle, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 556 F.2d 1330; <em>Loud v. Estelle, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 556 F.2d 1326, 1329-30. As for Spenkelink\u2019s contention that he had no other notice of the aggravating circumstances on which the State would rely or which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>trial would consider, we need only point to Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 921.141(5), which defines the aggravating circumstances that may be considered by both judge and jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Second, Spenkelink contends that Section 921.141 does not prescribe the standard of proof to govern factual determinations with regard to aggravating circumstances at the sentencing proceeding, and suggests that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the appropriate standard be beyond a reasonable doubt. The Florida Supreme Court agrees, as evidenced by its holding in 1973 in <em>State v. Dixon, supra, </em>283 So.2d at 9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">The aggravating circumstances of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 921.141(6) [sic], F.S.A., actually define those crimes \u2014 when read in conjunction with Fla.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 782.04(1) and 794.01(1), F.S.A. \u2014 to which the death penalty is applicable in the absence of mitigating circumstances. As such, they must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt before being considered by judge or jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">In accordance with <em>Dixon, </em>the trial court instructed the jury at Spenkelink\u2019s sentencing proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">Aggravating circumstances must be established <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>before they may be considered by you in arriving at your decision. Proof of an aggravating circumstance <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>is evidence by which the understanding, judgment and reason of the jury are well satisfied and convinced to the extent of having a full, firm and abiding conviction that the circumstance has been proved to the exclusion of and <em>beyond a reasonable doubt, </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">The petitioner\u2019s contention is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Finally, Spenkelink contends that the aggravating circumstance set forth in Fla. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 921.141(5)(h), that \u201c[t]he capital felony was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel,\u201d is vague and overbroad in violation of Fourteenth Amendment due process. In <em>Proffitt v. Florida, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 255, 96 S.Ct. at 2967-68 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.), the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-11\">[T]he petitioner asserts that the enumerated aggravating and mitigating circumstances are so vague and so broad that \u201cvirtually any first degree murder convict [is] a candidate for a death sentence.\u201d In particular, the petitioner attacks the eighth and third statutory aggravating circumstances, which authorize the death penalty to be imposed if the crime is \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious, or cruel,\u201d or if \u201c[t]he defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons.\u201d \u00a7 921.141(5)(h), (c) (Supp.1976-1977). These provisions must be considered as they have been construed by the Supreme Court of Florida.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-12\">That Court has recognized that while it is arguable \u201cthat all killings are atrocious, . . . [s]till we believe that the Legislature intended something \u2018especially\u2019 heinous, atrocious, or cruel when it authorized the death penalty for first degree murder.\u201d <em>Tedder v. State, </em>322 So.2d 908, 910 (Fla.1975). As a consequence, the Court has indicated that the eighth statutory provision is directed only at \u201cthe conscienceless or pitiless crime which is unnecessarily torturous to the victim.\u201d <em>State v. Dixon, </em>283 So.2d 1, 9 (Fla.1973). See also <em>Alford v. State, </em>307 So.2d 433, 445 (Fla.1975); <em>Halliwell v. State, </em>323 So.2d 557, 561 (Fla.1975). We cannot say that the provision, as so construed, provides inadequate guidance to those charged with the duty of recommending or imposng sentences in capital cases. See <em>Gregg v. Georgia, ante, </em>428 U.S. pp. 200,203, 96 S.Ct. p. 2938.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-14\">Nonetheless, the petitioner points out that the Court in <em>Proffitt </em>examined the claims of vagueness and overbreadth of the statutory aggravating circumstances \u201conly insofar as it is necessary to determine whether there is a substantial risk that the Florida capital-sentencing system, when viewed in its entirety, will result in the capricious or arbitrary imposition of the death penalty,\u201d and thus violate the prohibition under the Eighth and Fourteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Amendments of cruel and unusual punishment. 428 U.S. at 254 n.ll, 96 S.Ct. at 2967 n.ll (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). <em>See Gregg v. Georgia, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 201 n.51, 96 S.Ct. at 2938 n.51 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). In the instant case, the petitioner contends, his vagueness and overbreadth challenges are made through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. A review of the record indicates that Spenkelink\u2019s allegations of vagueness and overbreadth do not appear in his habeas corpus petition, and therefore were not argued to the district court on the basis of any constitutional amendment. Rather than dismiss his contentions summarily, as we ordinarily would do, only to have them resurface again through another habeas petition, we have decided in the interest of time and judicial economy to address them on their merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Dixon, supra, </em>the Florida Supreme Court, in holding constitutional Fla. Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 775.082, 782.04, and 921.141, see note 23 <em>supra, </em>also considered the certified question of whether the aggravating circumstance in Section 921.141 (5)(h) is so \u201cvague, indefinite and uncertain,\u201d 283 So.2d at 3, as to violate, <em>inter alia, </em>Fourteenth Amendment due process. The court answered this question in the negative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">The aggravating circumstance which has been most frequently attacked is the provision that commission of an especially heinous, atrocious or cruel capital felony constitutes an aggravated capital felony. Fla.Stat. \u00a7 921.141(6)(h), F.S.A. Again, we feel that the meaning of such terms is a matter of common knowledge, so that an ordinary man would not have to guess at what was intended. It is our interpretation that heinous means extremely wicked or shockingly evil; that atrocious means outrageously wicked and vile; and, that cruel means designed to inflict a high degree of pain with utter indifference to, or even enjoyment of, the suffering of others. What is intended to be included are those capital crimes where the actual commission of the capital felony was accompanied by such additional acts as to set the crime apart from the norm of capital felonies \u2014 the conscienceless or pitiless crime which is unnecessarily torturous to the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">283 So.2d at 9. This definition has been followed repeatedly by the Florida Supreme Court. <em>See, e. g., Proffitt v. Florida, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 255 n.12, 96 S.Ct. at 2968 n.12 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); <em>Halliwell v. State, supra, </em>323 So.2d at 561; <em>Tedder v. State, supra, </em>322 So.2d at 910; <em>Alford v. State, </em>307 So.2d 433, 444-45 (Fla.1975). Nothing in <em>Smith v. Goquen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 39 L.Ed.2d 605 (1974); <em>Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, </em>405 U.S. 156, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110 (1972); <em>Thornhill v.

Lowry, </em>301 U.S. 242, 57 S.Ct. 732, 81 L.Ed. 1066 (1937), the cases cited by the petitioner in support of his vagueness and overbreadth contentions, persuades us that the Florida Supreme Court is in error. We agree on Fourteenth Amendment due process grounds with the United States Supreme Court in <em>Proffitt </em>that Section 921.-141(5)(h), as construed by the Florida Supreme Court, provides adequate guidance to those charged with the duty of recommending or imposing sentences in capital cases. <em>See Proffitt v. Florida, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 255, 96 S.Ct. at 2968 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). The contentions that Section 921.141(5)(h) are vague and overbroad are therefore without merit.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number><em>See, e. g., </em>the cases cited in <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108 n.4, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2299 n.4, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972); Note, <em>The Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine in the Supreme Court, </em>109 <em>U.Pa.L.Rev. </em>67 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Spenkelink\u2019s next contention is that the death penalty under Section 921.141 is being applied in a discriminatory fashion against defendants convicted of murdering whites, as opposed to blacks, in violation of the prohibition under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of cruel and unusual punishment and in violation of Fourteenth Amendment equal protection.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Spenkel-ink\u2019s contention appears to be that Florida prosecutors, jurors, trial judges, and supreme court justices value black lives less than they do white lives, and thus are more likely to seek, recommend, impose, and affirm the imposition of the death penalty when a defendant murders a white victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">During the evidentiary hearing below the petitioner introduced evidence through an expert witness that, although the estimated number of black felony murder victims and white felony murder victims for 1973-1976 is the same, 92 per cent of the inmates on Florida death row had murdered white victims, while only 8 per cent had murdered black victims. The State responded by arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that murders involving black victims have, in the past, generally been qualitatively different from murders involving white victims; as a general rule, the State contended, murders involving black victims have not presented facts and circumstances appropriate for imposition of the death penalty.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The State also challenged the accuracy and reliability of the methodology used by the petitioner\u2019s expert witness. Many of these imperfections the witness himself admitted. For example, he conceded that factors other than race could have caused the disparate figures:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-10\">Q. With regard to the conclusions that you have reached that there is a variance of black victims and white victims as to who gets the electric chair in Florida. What are the other variables?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-11\">A. I don\u2019t understand your question, Mr. Shevin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-12\">Q. Well, for instance, would the prose-cutorial discretion as to what charges be filed, would that be relevant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-13\">A. Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-14\">Q. And would the prosecutor\u2019s decision as to whether or not to take the case to the Grand Jury be a relevant variable? A. Well, as I testified, I have no knowledge of the process that stands between the arrest and the final disposition, and that is exactly the thing one should explore in order to find out how these differences come about. All I have is the final difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-15\">Q. So in analyzing what happens from the arrest to the final judgment, your rule could be affected, could they not, by decisions of whether or not to prosecute? A. Oh, sure. I said that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-16\">Q. And it could be affected by what verdicts the juries returned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-17\">A. Could, although my guess \u2014 yes, it could, sure. I said it could be affected at all stages, Mr. Shevin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-18\">Q. And it could be affected by whether the defendant pleads guilty or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-19\">A. If this \u2014 if this \u2014 I\u2014if this saves many people, I have \u2014 I have seen \u2014 .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Q. Can it be affected by whether the prosecutor is asking for the death penalty, could it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\">A. I said so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">Q. All right. And it could be affected by the elements of aggravation and mitigation that are set forth in the Florida statutes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">A. Of course.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">The witness also was unable to point to any defendant convicted of first degree murder for killing a black who, under the facts and circumstances of the case, should have received the death penalty but did not. Nevertheless, petitioner Spenkelink contends that he has made a prima facie case of racial discrimination in the imposition of the death penalty in Florida, and that we should remand his case to the district court for additional evidentiary proceedings to provide him the opportunity to present further evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Assuming for the sake of argument that the petitioner\u2019s statistics are accurate, his contention must fail as a matter of law on both of the constitutional grounds relied upon. The allegation that Florida\u2019s death penalty is being discriminatorily applied to defendants who murder whites is nothing more than an allegation that the death penalty is being imposed arbitrarily and capriciously, a contention we previously have considered and rejected. To allege discriminatory application of the death penalty, as meant in the context of this case, is to argue that defendants who have murdered whites have received the death penalty when other defendants who have murdered blacks, and who are equally or more deserving to die, have received life imprisonment. In order to ascertain through federal habeas corpus proceedings if the death penalty had been discriminatorily imposed upon a petitioner whose murder victim was white, a district court would have to compare the facts and circumstances of the petitioner\u2019s case with the facts and circumstances of all other Florida death penalty cases involving black victims in order to determine if the first degree murderers in those cases were equally or more deserving to die. The petitioner thus requests the same type of case-by-case comparison by the federal judiciary that we have previously rejected in considering the petitioner\u2019s contention that Florida\u2019s death penalty is being imposed arbitrarily and capriciously. We need not repeat the myriad of difficult problems, legal and otherwise, generated by such federal court intrusion into the substantive decision making of the sentencing process which is reserved to the Florida state courts under Section 921.141. As we previously noted, this Court reads <em>Furman, Gregg, Proffitt, Jurek, Woodson, </em>and <em>Roberts </em>as holding that if a state follows a properly drawn statute in imposing the death penalty, then the arbitrariness and capriciousness \u2014 and therefore the racial discrimination \u2014 condemned in Furman<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>been conclusively removed.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Florida has such a statute and it is being followed. The petitioner\u2019s contention under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments is therefore without merit.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Spenkelink also raises his claim under Fourteenth Amendment equal protection. He concedes that Section 921.141 is facially valid and neutral with respect to race. He contends nonetheless that the administration of the statute has resulted in \u201cdramatic racial inequity,\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 36, which allegedly violates equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">The petitioner\u2019s suggestion that a violation of equal protection is proved by a showing of disparity in the race of first degree murder victims, which allegedly results from the administration of a facially valid and neutral statute, ignores the holdings of two recent United States Supreme Court opinions. In <em>Washington v. Davis, </em>426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976), the Court held that a District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department entrance examination designed to test verbal ability, vocabulary, reading, and comprehension did not violate Fourteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Amendment equal protection, even though the examination had a racially disproportionate impact in that far more blacks than whites failed to pass it. In so holding, the Court noted that while \u201c[t]he central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is the prevention of official conduct discriminating on the basis of race,\u201d prior Court decisions \u201chave not embraced the proposition that a law or\u2019 other official act, without regard to whether it reflects a racially discriminatory purpose, is unconstitutional <em>solely </em>because it has a racially disproportionate impact.\u201d 426 U.S. at 239, 96 S.Ct. at 2047 (emphasis in original). The Court also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>It is undeniable that the Supreme Court considered each and every phase of the Florida system and, based upon that examination, concluded that it is a reasonable one. Although there is no mention of the race of the victims of murderers in the <em>Proffitt </em>opinion, it is clear that the United States Supreme Court was confident that the safeguards which are provided are sufficient to insure evenhanded application. It is for this reason that this court must conclude that the focus of any inquiry into the application of the death penalty must necessarily be limited to the persons who receive it rather than their victims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-9\">There are, of course, many reasons which could explain the decision to sentence one defendant to death and another to life imprisonment. But it now seems clear that a decision to afford a defendant mercy violates no constitutional precepts. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>44 U.S.L.W. 5230, 5243 [428 U.S. 153, 98 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859] (1976) , there are many stages of the criminal justice system in which a decision may be made which will remove a defendant from consideration as a candidate for a death sentence. So long as the system is designed to minimize the risk of capricious imposition of the death penalty by providing standards which enable those who must impose sentences to focus on the circumstances of the crime of each defendant, the dictates of <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238 [92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346] (1972) are satisfied. Florida now has such a system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Necessarily, an invidious discriminatory purpose may often be inferred from the totality of the relevant facts, including the fact, if it is true, that the law bears more heavily on one race than another. It is also not infrequently true that the discriminatory impact \u2014 in the jury cases for example, the total or seriously disproportionate exclusion of Negroes from jury venires \u2014 may for all practical purposes demonstrate unconstitutionality because in various circumstances the discrimination is very difficult to explain on nonracial grounds. Nevertheless, we have not held that a law, neutral on its face and serving ends otherwise within the power of government to pursue, is invalid under the Equal Protection Clause simply because it may affect a greater proportion of one race than of another. Disproportionate impact is not irrelevant, but it is not the sole touchstone of an invidious racial discrimination forbidden by the Constitution. Standing alone, it does not trigger the rule, <em>McLaughlin v. Florida, </em>379 U.S. 184, 85 S.Ct. 283, 13 L.Ed.2d 222 (1964), that racial classifications are to be subjected to the strictest scrutiny and are justifiable only by the weightiest of considerations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">426 U.S. at 242, 96 S.Ct. at 2049. A year later, in <em>Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., supra, </em>the Court held that the refusal of the Village of Arlington Heights to rezone a tract of land in order to allow the Metropolitan Housing Development Corporation to build racially integrated low and moderate income housing did not violate Fourteenth Amendment equal protection, because the Village\u2019s rezoning denial was motivated not by racial discrimination but by its desire to protect property values and maintain its zoning plan.' The Court relied on <em>Washington v. Davis, supra, </em>in announcing that \u201cofficial action will not be held unconstitutional solely because it results in a racially disproportionate impact,\u201d and that \u201c[p]roof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d 429 U.S. at 265, 97 S.Ct. at 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Assuming for the sake of discussion that Section 921.141 does have a racially disproportionate impact with respect to the race of first degree murder victims, <em>Washington v. Davis, supra, </em>and <em>Arlington Heights </em>mandate that the petitioner\u2019s equal protection challenge must fail, because the discrimination is explainable on nonracial grounds. Florida offered credible evidence, evidently believed by the district court, that murders involving black victims generally have been qualitatively different from murders involving white victims. The petitioner\u2019s own expert witness also testified that factors other than race could have caused the disparate figures, and could single out no defendant convicted of first degree murder for killing a black who, under the facts and circumstances of the case, should have received the death penalty instead of life imprisonment. The petitioner\u2019s witness testified further that he found no evidence of intentional or purposeful discrimination; \u201cI\u2019m far from suggesting,\u201d he stated, \u201cthat there is any deliberate effort anywhere in the system to achieve this goal [of racially disproportionate impact].\u201d In sum, this is not a case in which a petitioner proved a prima facie case of discrimination that the state could not rebut. <em>Compare, e. g., Castaneda v. Partida, </em>430 U.S. 482, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 51 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977). This is a case in which the State, with the assistance of the petitioner\u2019s own expert witness, provided several lawful explanations totally unre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>lated to race for the racially disproportionate impact of its statute.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Stated otherwise, it is a case in which the petitioner could not prove racially discriminatory intent or purpose as required by <em>Washington v. Davis, supra, </em>and <em>Arlington Heights. See Nevette v. Sides, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 571 F.2d 209. Spenkelink\u2019s challenge to Section 921.-141 on the basis of Fourteenth Amendment equal protection is therefore without merit as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">5.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The petitioner\u2019s fifth contention is that electrocution, which is Florida\u2019s method of carrying out a sentence of capital punishment, <em>see </em>Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 922.10, is unnecessarily torturous and wantonly cruel and therefore constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Supreme Court has previously considered this assertion in <em>In re Kemmler, </em>136 U.S. 436, 10 S.Ct. 930, 34 L.Ed. 519 (1890), <em>quoted in Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 170, 96 S.Ct. at 2924 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.), where the Court held that a New York statute providing for electrocution as the method of carrying out a sentence of capital punishment was constitutional. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">Undoubtedly the [fourteenth] amendment forbids any arbitrary deprivation of life, liberty, or property, and secures equal protection to all under like circumstances in the enjoyment of their rights; and, in the administration of criminal justice, requires that no different or higher punishment shall be imposed upon one than is imposed upon all for like offenses. But it was not designed to interfere with the power of the state to protect the lives, liberties, and property of its citizens, and to promote their health, peace, morals, education, and good order. <em>Barbier v. Connolly, </em>113 U.S. 27, 31, 5 Sup.Ct. Rep. 357, 28 L.Ed. 923. The enactment of this statute was, in itself, within the legitimate sphere of the legislative power of the state, and in the observance of those general rules prescribed by our systems of jurisprudence; and the legislature of the state of New York determined that it did not inflict cruel and unusual punishment, and its courts have sustained that determination. We cannot perceive that the state has thereby abridged the privileges or immunities of the petitioner, or deprived him of due process of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az8\">136 U.S. at 448-49, 10 S.Ct. at 934. <em>Accord, Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, </em>329 U.S. 459, 67 S.Ct. 374, 91 L.Ed. 422 (1947), <em>quoted in Gregg v. Georgia, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 170, 96 S.Ct. at 2924 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). <em>See generally Ex parte Granviel, </em>561 S.W.2d 503 (Tex.Cr.App. 1978) (execution by intravenous injection of lethal substance is not cruel and unusual punishment). The petitioner\u2019s contention is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">6.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">The petitioner, an indigent male, contends finally that the death penalty under Section 921.141 is being applied in a discriminatory fashion against males and poor persons in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Although the petitioner asserts his claim under the guise of Fourteenth Amendment equal protection, closer examination reveals that at its core lies the charge of arbitrary and capricious conduct. Male and indigent murderers, the petitioner in effect contends, have in Florida received the death penalty under Section 921.141, while women and nonindigent murderers, equally or more deserving to die, have received life imprisonment. For reasons that we have already detailed at length, the contention that the death penalty under Section 921.141 is being applied arbitrarily and capriciously must fail as a matter of law except under exceptional circumstances.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Accordingly, the petitioner\u2019s contention is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>C. Florida\u2019s Clemency Procedures</p>\n<p id=\"AqkE\">The petitioner\u2019s next contention is that the Florida Rules of Executive Clemency violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Article IV, section 8(a) of the Florida Constitution provides that \u201c[e]xcept in cases of treason and in cases where impeachment results in conviction, the governor may, by executive order filed with the secretary of state, . . . and, with the approval of three members of the cabinet, grant full or conditional pardons, restore civil rights, commute punishment, and remit fines and forfeitures for offenses.\u201d The governor and the cabinet of Florida, \u201cin order to assist in the orderly and expeditious exercise of this clemency power,\u201d Fla.R.Exec. Clemency 2, established by executive order the Florida Rules of Executive Clemency, which are set forth in Appendix B of our opinion. The procedures provided for in these rules ar\u00e9 detailed and comprehensive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apf\">[T]he newly devised death sentence review process operates very much like all other administrative processes in the executive branch of Florida\u2019s government. The rules adopted for this purpose establish an \u201cOffice of Executive Clemency\u201d headed by a \u201ccoordinator\u201d and staffed by assistants. A \u201cproper record\u201d of all proceedings is maintained. Precise steps for review are prescribed, channeled by precise time frames, and the process once triggered requires (i) a hearing examiner to take written or oral testimony, (ii) an informal evidentiary proceeding, (iii) a required report to be filed by the hearing examiner within 60 days, (iv) a required hearing before the Governor and cabinet, (v) notice to applicants\u2019 attorneys and to counsel for the state, (vi) authority for both counsel to file \u201cexceptions, briefs or memoranda\u201d concerning the examiner\u2019s report, (vii) a prohibition against direct communications to the Governor or any cabinet member during the pendency of the proceedings, and (viii) a public explanation for granting or not granting clemency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-9\"><em>Sullivan v. Askew, </em>348 So.2d 312, 318 (Fla.) (England, J., concurring), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 878, 98 S.Ct. 232, 54 L.Ed.2d 159 (1977). Their constitutionality has been reviewed and upheld by the Florida Supreme Court. <em>Sullivan v. Askew, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">Spenkelink contends nonetheless that these procedures are fundamentally unfair and violate Fourteenth Amendment due process because they allegedly (1) denied him an impartial tribunal because the state attorney general who defended his death sentence in the courts sits as a member of the cabinet and reviews death sentences, (2) denied him the privilege of personally attending the hearing conducted by the governor and cabinet, (3) denied him disclosure of the evidence relied upon by the Florida Parole and Probation Commission in reaching an adverse recommendation with respect to his clemency, which was forwarded to the governor and cabinet, and (4) denied him notice of the standards and criteria followed by the governor and cabinet in reaching their clemency decisions. The issues presented by the petitioner, therefore^ are whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to clemency decisions by the governor and cabinet of Florida, and, if so, whether the Rules of Executive Clemency comport with the standards of procedural due process. Our answer to the first question renders unnecessary our consideration of the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>In <em>Sullivan v. Askew, supra, </em>the Florida Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of the Rules of Executive Clemency. The court held that the petitioner\u2019s complaint, which raised the same contentions as Spenkelink raises here, failed to state a cause of action because \u201cthe clemency power is exclusively in the executive branch.\u201d 348 So.2d at 314. The court relied heavily on the doctrine of separation of powers and cited with approval its opinion in <em>Ex parte White, </em>131 Fla. 83,178 So. 876 (1938), which declared a state legislative enactment unconstitutional because it was \u201cin conflict with and in derogation of the constitutionally established execution [sic ]&lt; power of clemency.\u201d 348 So.2d at 316. \u201cThis prohibition against legislative encroachment upon the executive\u2019s clemency power,\u201d stated the court in <em>Sullivan, </em>\u201cis equally applicable to the judiciary.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">The opinion in <em>Sullivan, </em>while instructive and well reasoned, is not dispositive, because it is unclear whether the justices were relying on the Florida Constitution or the United States Constitution. Our inquiry, of course, involves the latter. Two other decisions, both by the United States Supreme Court and both involving federal constitutional law, provide us further guidance. In <em>Schick </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>419 U.S. 256, 95 S.Ct. 379, 42 L.Ed.2d 430 (1974), the Supreme Court turned away the petitioner\u2019s challenge to the president\u2019s <em>pre-Furman </em>clemency decision in his case. The Court held that the president, acting under article II, section 2, clause 1 of the United States Constitution, which provides in part that the president \u201cshall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment,\u201d could commute a prisoner\u2019s sentence from death to life imprisonment, subject to the condition that he would not thereafter be eligible for parole. Chief Justice Burger, writing for the Court, delved into the historical origins of the president\u2019s clemency power, and then wrote a thoughtful analysis of the limits of that power. The Chief Justice concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">A fair reading of the history of the English pardoning power, from which our Art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 1, derives, of the language of that clause itself, and of the unbroken practice since 1790 compels the conclusion that the power flows from the Constitution alone, not from any legislative enactments, and that it cannot be modified, abridged, or diminished by the Congress. Additionally, considerations of public policy and humanitarian impulses support an interpretation of that power so as to permit the attachment of any condition which does not otherwise offend the Constitution. The plain purpose of the broad power conferred by \u00a7 2, cl. 1, was to allow plenary authority in the President to \u201cforgive\u201d the convicted person in part or entirely, to reduce a penalty in terms of a specified number of years, or to alter it with conditions which are in themselves constitutionally unobjectionable. We therefore hold that the pardoning power is an enumerated power of the Constitution and that its limitations, if any, must be found in the Constitution itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">419 U.S. at 266-67, 95 S.Ct. at 385. <em>Schick, </em>therefore, stands for the proposition that the substantive discretion of the president in the exercise of his clemency power is all but absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">In <em>Meachum </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976), the Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not entitle \u201ca state prisoner to a hearing when he is transferred to a prison the conditions of which are substantially less favorable to the prisoner, absent a state law or practice conditioning such transfers on proof of serious misconduct or the occurrence of other events.\u201d 427 U.S. at 216, 96 S.Ct. at 2534. The Court found that such transfers do not infringe or implicate a \u201cliberty\u201d interest within the meaning of the Due Process Clause, because \u201cgiven a valid conviction, the criminal defendant has been constitutionally deprived of his liberty to the extent that the State may confine him and . . . subject him to the rules of its prison system so long as the conditions of confinement do not otherwise violate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Constitution.\u201d In short, \u201c[t]he conviction has sufficiently extinguished the defendant\u2019s liberty interest to empower the State to confine him in <em>any </em>of its prisons.\u201d 427 U.S. at 224, 96 S.Ct. at 2538. To hold otherwise, stated the Court, \u201cwould place the [Due Process] Clause astride the day-today functioning of state prisons and involve the judiciary in issues and discretionary decisions that are not the business of federal judges.\u201d 427 U.S. at 228, 96 S.Ct. at 2540<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> <em>Accord, Montanye v.

As we have already held, Spenkelink was constitutionally sentenced to die upon affirmance of his sentence by the Florida Supreme Court. That affirmance empowered the State then to execute him. <em>See Cruz v.

Ohio</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Spenkelink has submitted a post-argument brief in which he contends that Florida\u2019s Section 921.141 is unconstitutional under the recent United States Supreme Court holding in <em>Lockett v. </em>Ohio,-U.S. -, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978). In <em>Lockett </em>the Court held \u201cthat the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer, in all but the rarest kind of capital case, not be precluded from considering <em>as a mitigating factor, </em>any aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d 98 S.Ct. at 2965 (plurality opinion) (emphasis in original). On the basis of language in <em>Cooper v. State, </em>336 So.2d 1133, 1139 (Fla.1976),<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Spenkelink contends that Section 921.141 impermissibly limits the mitigating factors which the judge and jury can consider in assessing the death penalty, and therefore must be declared unconstitutional. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">When the Supreme Court in <em>Proffitt </em>v. <em>Florida, supra, </em>first approved the constitutionality of Florida\u2019s death penalty statute, it stated that Section 921.141 contains no limiting language with respect to the mitigating circumstances that the judge and jury can consider. In footnote 8 of their <em>Proffitt </em>opinion, Justices Stewart, Powell, and Stevens said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-16\">In one case the Florida Court upheld a death sentence where the trial judge had simply listed six aggravating factors as justification for the sentence he imposed. <em>Sawyer v. State, </em>313 So.2d 680 (1975). Since there were no mitigating factors, and since some of these aggravating factors arguably fell within the statutory categories it is unclear whether the Florida Court would uphold a death sentence that rested entirely on nonstatu-tory aggravating circumstances. It seems unlikely that it would do so since the capital-sentencing statute explicitly provides that \u201c[ajggravating circumstances shall be <em>limited </em>to the following [eight specified factors.].\u201d \u00a7 921.141(5) (Supp. 1976-1977). (Emphasis added.) There is no such limiting language introducing the list of statutory mitigating factors. See \u00a7 921.141(6) (Supp.1976-1977). See also n. 14 <em>infra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-17\"><em>Proffitt v. Florida, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 250 n. 8, 96 S.Ct. at 2965-66 n. 8 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). Justice White, joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justice Rehnquist, accepted this interpretation of the Florida statute. <em>Id., </em>428 U.S. at 260, 96 S.Ct. at 2970 (White, J., con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>curring). Later, in <em>Lockett, </em>affirmed the constitutionality of Florida\u2019s Section 921.141: the Court re-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-3\">Although the Florida statute approved in <em>Proffitt </em>contained a list of mitigating factors, six members of this Court assumed, in approving the statute, that the range of mitigating factors listed in the statute was not exclusive. None of the statutes we sustained in <em>Gregg </em>and the companion cases clearly operated at that time to prevent the sen-tencer from considering any aspect of the defendant\u2019s character and record or any circumstances of his offense as an independently mitigating factor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-5\"><em>Lockett v. Ohio, supra, </em>98 S.Ct. at 2966 (plurality opinion). The Ohio statute, noted the Court, is \u201csignificantly different,\u201d and therefore must fall. <em>Id. </em>It is unmistakably clear from this language in <em>Lockett </em>that the Court still views <em>Gregg v. Georgia, supra, </em>and the companion cases, one of which was <em>Proffitt v. Florida, supra, </em>as sound law. The conclusion is inevitable that the Court continues to view Section 921.141 as constitutional, as it did in 1976 when it decided <em>Proffitt. </em>Obviously, we are without power or authority to overrule the express finding of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The Court\u2019s language in <em>Lockett, </em>to the effect that when <em>Proffitt </em>was decided, Section 921.141 did not \u201cat that time . prevent the sentencer from considering any aspect of the defendant\u2019s character and record or any circumstances of his offense as an independently mitgating factor,\u201d <em>Lockett v. Ohio, supra, </em>98 S.Ct. at 2966 (plurality opinion), is also important. <em>Cooper v. State, supra, </em>the case relied upon by Spenkelink, was not decided until July 8, 1976. Spenkelink was sentenced on December 20,1973, and his conviction affirmed by the Florida Supreme Court on February 19, 1975. At the time of the sentencing proceeding, Spenkelink was afforded, and exercised, without limitation, every opportunity to set forth any and all mitigating factors in his favor. He contended, for example, that he should not receive the death penalty because his killing of Szymankiewicz was in self-defense, though that defense is not one of the mitigating circumstances expressly set forth in Section 921.141(6). Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury that, in addition to the evidence presented at the sentencing hearing; it was to consider also the evidence presented at trial. The mitigating circumstance of provocation, possibly resulting from the alleged episodes of homosexuality and \u201cRussian roulette,\u201d see note 3 <em>supra, </em>was thus before the jury and the judge, even though provocation also is not one of the mitigating circumstances expressly mentioned in Section 921.141(6). A reading of the transcript of the sentencing hearing therefore indicates that the hearing was full, fair, and thoroughly complete. We find no merit to the post-argument contention of the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">After considering each of the petitioner\u2019s contentions and finding them to be without merit, we agree with the district court\u2019s denial of a writ of habeas corpus and accordingly affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b690-9\">. Spenkelink told the proprietor that Szymank-iewicz was his brother, that Szymankiewicz was so drunk that Spenkelink could not get him into their automobile, and that Szymank-iewicz therefore would be left behind. Spen-kelink then paid for an extra night\u2019s lodging.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b690-10\">. Spenkelink contends that he murdered Szy-mankiewicz in self-defense following a scuffle between the two after Spenkelink had returned to the motel room to retrieve certain belongings that Szymankiewicz allegedly had stolen. Florida contends that Spenkelink murdered Szymankiewicz while he was asleep in bed. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. 242, 255 n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 2960, 2968 n. 12, 49 L.Ed.2d 913 (1976) (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) described the circumstances in Spenkelink\u2019s case as \u201c \u2018career criminal\u2019.shot sleeping traveling companion.\u201d Spenkelink contends also that some time before the shooting Szymankiewicz had antagonized and provoked him by, among other things, using him as the target for a game of \u201cRussian roulette\u201d and forcing him to commit oral sodomy at gunpoint. Unfortunately, the only witness to these alleged activities is Szy-mankiewicz, who is now dead.

Underlying the guilt-bias argument is the premise that jurors who have no scruples against capital punishment will necessarily be more prone to convict than jurors who express some reservations regarding the death sentence. Support for this premise is drawn from psychological studies documenting the thesis that a given individual will tend to run a coherent, discernible pattern with respect to attitudes and values. A juror unopposed to capital punishment, according to the thesis, fits into the mold of the so-called \u201cauthoritarian personality\u201d who tends to be more condemning, suspicious, and non-love-seeking than one who has some reservations about the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">Comment, 1969 <em>Utah L.Rev. </em>154, 162. <em>See, e. g., Turberville v.

In contending that the death penalty under Section 921.141 is being applied excessively and disproportionately, allegedly as evidenced by his own case, Spenkelink cites <em>Coker v. Georgia, </em>433 U.S. 584, 97 S.Ct. 2861, 53 L.Ed.2d 982 (1977), in which the Supreme Court held that the sentence of death for the crime of rape is excessive and disproportionate and therefore cruel and unusual punishment.

The allegations of excessiveness and disproportion-ality, at least as used by the petitioner in this case in challenging the death penalty as applied, appear to be synonymous with the allegations of arbitrariness and capriciousness. For example, according to the petitioner, the tests for determining if the death penalty is being applied arbitrarily and capriciously and if it is being applied excessively and disproportionately are the same: one must compare the facts and circumstances of cases in which convicted murderers have been sentenced to death with the facts and circumstances of cases in which convicted murderers have received life imprisonment. The two sets of allegations, therefore, do not constitute separate issues in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b706-6\">. Spenkelink highlights seven other cases in particular, all of which allegedly involved defendants equally or more deserving of the death penalty than he but in all of which the Florida Supreme Court reversed sentences of death. The first case cited by the petitioner is <em>Swann </em>v. <em>State, </em>322 So.2d 485 (Fla.1975). In <em>Swann </em>the defendant gagged his victim, bound her so that \u201cany efforts she might have made to free herself could have choked her to death,\u201d severely beat her, and then robbed her. The victim later died. <em>Id </em>at 486. The jury convicted the defendant of first degree murder but recommended a life sentence. The trial court imposed the death penalty. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but, noting that the defendant was a nineteen-year-old with no significant history of criminal conduct, as well as the fact that \u201cthere is a specific duty imposed on this Court to consider the record in order to assure that the punishment accorded a criminal will meet the standards prescribed in <em>Furman v. Georgia,\u201d </em>the court reversed the sentence. It found \u201cthat there were insufficient aggravating circumstances to justify the imposition of the death penalty\u201d and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 489. In <em>Halliwell </em>v. <em>State, </em>323 So.2d 557 (Fla.1975), the second case cited by the petitioner, the defendant beat his victim to death with a breaker bar and then dismembered the body. The jury convicted him of first degree murder and recommended the death penalty, which the trial court imposed. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but reduced the sentence to life imprisonment. The court found that the defendant had no prior arrests and was a decorated Green Beret in the Vietnam War. It found further that the defendant had acted \u201cunder emotional strain over the mistreatment of [the women he loved] by the victim\u201d and that the dismemberment occurred after death. Thus, the death penalty was not warranted. <em>Id. </em>at 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">In the third case cited by Spenkelink, <em>Tedder v. State, supra, </em>the defendant, who recently had been separated from his wife, shot to death his mother-in-law. 322 So.2d at 909. The jury convicted him of first degree murder and recommended life imprisonment. The trial court imposed a sentence of death. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but reduced the sentence to life imprisonment after determining that the murder was not heinous, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>atrocious, or cruel within the meaning of Section 921.141 (5)(h). Additionally, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">With respect to the trial court\u2019s sentence, we agree with appellant that the death penalty was inappropriate and that a life sentence should have been imposed. A jury recommendation under our trifurcated death penalty statute should be given great weight. In order to sustain a sentence of death following a jury recommendation of life, the facts suggesting a sentence of death should be so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ. That is not the situation here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 910. <em>Jones v. State, </em>332 So.2d 615 (Fla. 1976), is the fourth case upon which the petitioner relies. The defendant in <em>Jones </em>raped his victim and then murdered her by stabbing her 38 times. <em>Id. </em>at 616. The jury convicted him of first degree murder and recommended life imprisonment. The trial court sentenced him to death. The Florida Supreme Court found that the defendant \u201csuffered a paranoid psychosis to such an extent that the full degree of his mental capacities at the time of the murder is not fully known.\u201d This mitigating circumstance, according to the court, was \u201cdeterminative,\u201d and sufficiently outweighed the aggravating circumstances. The defendant\u2019s sentence was therefore reduced to life imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 619. In <em>Thompson v. State, </em>328 So.2d 1 (Fla. 1976), Spenkelink\u2019s fifth case, the defendant stabbed his victim to death while robbing him. <em>Id. </em>at 3. Once again the jury convicted the defendant of first degree murder and recommended life imprisonment, and the trial court sentenced the defendant to death. The Florida Supreme Court, in affirming the conviction but reducing the sentence to life imprisonment, stated that the recommendation of the jury, although advisory only, merits \u201cserious consideration,\u201d especially when that recommendation is life imprisonment. The court found that the 17-year-old defendant had no prior criminal record and that the evidence failed to establish that the murder was deliberate. In short, \u201cthe mitigating circumstances were such that the death penalty would not be proper.\" <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The final two cases cited by Spenkelink are <em>Burch v. State, </em>343 So.2d 831 (Fla.1977), and <em>Provence v. State, </em>337 So.2d 783 (Fla.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 969, 97 S.Ct. 2929, 53 L.Ed.2d 1065 (1977). In <em>Burch, </em>the defendant murdered his victim by stabbing her over 30 times after an unsuccessful rape attempt. 343 So.2d at 832. Following a jury conviction of first degree murder with a recommendation of life imprisonment, the trial court imposed capital punishment. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but reduced the sentence to life imprisonment. The court first quoted <em>Tedder v. State, supra, </em>322 So.2d at 910, in recognizing that a jury recommendation of life is entitled to great weight. It then found \u201cthat at the time of the offenses the defendant was mentally disturbed.\u201d 343 So.2d at 834. Burch also had no prior history of criminal conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 833-34. These mitigating circumstances, held the court, were sufficient to preclude imposition of the death penalty. Finally, <em>Provence </em>involved a defendant who robbed his victim of $1,500 and then murdered him by stabbing him eight times with a hunting knife. 337 So.2d at 784-85. The jury convicted the defendant of first degree murder and recommended life imprisonment, but the trial court sentenced him to the death penalty. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but reduced the sentence to life imprisonment. In doing so the court noted the mitigating circumstance that the defendant had never been convicted of any previous crimes as well as the aggravating circumstance that the murder had been committed for pecuniary gain. The court then compared the defendant\u2019s case to other death penalty cases, finding the circumstances in the defendant\u2019s case to be \u201cless aggravated\u201d than those in <em>Halliwell v. State, supra, </em>and <em>Swann v. State, supra, </em>where the court reversed the trial court\u2019s imposition of capital punishment. Next the court quoted once again from <em>Tedder v. State, supra, </em>322 So.2d at 910, in recognizing that a jury recommendation of life is entitled to great weight. Finally, the court decided that the balance tipped in favor of life imprisonment. 337 So.2d at 786-87. The first and certainly foremost impression one receives after considering these cases in light of Spenkelink\u2019s case is that all of the murders involved, including the murder of Joseph J. Szymankiewicz, were senseless and atrocious. Nonetheless, in six of these <em>cases </em>\u2014 Swann, <em>Halliwell, Jones, Thompson, Burch, </em>and <em>Provence </em>\u2014 the Florida Supreme Court, after balancing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, found that sufficient mitigating circumstances existed to outweigh the aggravating circumstances and preclude imposition of the death penalty. In the case of Spenkelink, the Florida Supreme Court found otherwise. In fact, it found no mitigating circumstances at all. (The trial court\u2019s treatment of Spenkel-ink\u2019s possible mental or emotional disturbance as an insubstantial factor apparently was accepted by the Florida Supreme Court.) In <em>Ted-der, </em>the only case in which the court did not appear to balance, at least not expressly, aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the court announced the rule that when the jury recommends life imprisonment the trial court should impose capital punishment only when \u201cthe facts suggesting a sentence of death [are] so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ.\u201d <em>Tedder v. State, supra, </em>322 So.2d at 910. That was not the situation there, so the Florida Supreme Court reversed the death sentence. That also is not the situation here, because the jury recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>mended that Spenkelink receive the death penalty. . In any event, <em>Tedder </em>was decided after the Florida Supreme Court reviewed Spenkel-ink\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b709-5\">. The concluding paragraph of the <em>Proffitt </em>opinion of Justices Stewart, Powell, and Stevens supports our interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">Florida, like Georgia, has responded to <em>Fur-man </em>by enacting legislation that passes constitutional muster. That legislation provides that after a person is convicted of first-degree murder, there shall be an informed, focused, guided, and objective inquiry into the question whether he should be sentenced to death. If a death sentence is imposed, the sentencing authority articulates in writing the statutory reasons that led to its decision. Those reasons, and the evidence supporting them, are conscientiously reviewed by a court which, because of its statewide jurisdiction, can assure consistency, fairness, and rationality in the evenhanded operation of the state law. <em>As in Georgia, this system serves to assure that sentences of death will not be \u201cwantonly\u201d or \u201cfreakishly\u201d imposed. </em>See <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S., at 310, 92 S.Ct., at 2762 (Stewart, J., concurring). Accordingly, the judgment before us is affirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"acq-dedup-0\">428 U.S. at 259, 96 S.Ct. at 2970 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (emphasis added). Similarly, in <em>Gregg v. Georgia, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 206, 96 S.Ct. at 2940-41 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (emphasis added), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">The basic concern of <em>Furman </em>centered on those defendants who were being condemned to death capriciously and arbitrarily. Under the procedures before the Court in that case, sentencing authorities were not directed to give attention to the nature or circumstances of the crime committed or to the character or record of the defendant. Left unguided, juries imposed the death sentence in a way that could only be called freakish. The new Georgia sentencing procedures, by contrast, focus the jury\u2019s attention on the particularized nature of the crime and the particularized characteristics of the individual defendant. While the jury is permitted to consider any aggravating or mitigating circumstances, it must find and identify at least one statutory aggravating factor before it may impose a penalty of death. In this way the jury\u2019s discretion is channeled. <em>No longer can a jury wantonly and freakishly impose the death sentence; it is always circumscribed by the legislative guidelines. In addition, the review function of the Supreme Court of Georgia affords additional assurance that the concerns that prompted our decision in Furman are not present to any significant degree in the Georgia procedure applied here.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">In <em>Coker v. Georgia, supra, </em>433 U.S. at 591, 97 S.Ct. at 2865, the Court, citing <em>Furman, Gregg, Proffitt, Jurek, Woodson, </em>and <em>Roberts, </em>stated further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-12\">It is also established that imposing capital punishment, at least for murder, in accordance with the procedures provided under the Georgia statutes saves the sentence from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>infirmities which led the Court to invalidate the prior Georgia capital punishment statute in <em>Furman v.

Spenkelink\u2019s attorney suggested that the court has engaged in little more than rubber stamp review and that it \u201cshould stand on its own and should make their [sic] own decisions independently of what the juries do or do not recommend.\u201d We agree with the United States Supreme Court that the Florida Supreme Court \u201chas undertaken responsibly to perform its function of death sentence review with a maximum of rationality and consistency,\u201d and that \u201cany suggestion that the Florida Court engages in only cursory or rubber stamp review is totally controverted.\u201d <em>Proffitt v.

This is not to say that the federal judiciary should never concern itself on habeas corpus review with whether Section 921.141 is being applied arbitrarily and capriciously. If a petitioner who has been sentenced to death can show that the facts and circumstances of his case are so clearly undeserving of capital punishment that to impose it would be patently unjust and would shock the conscience, which is not so in Spenkelink\u2019s case, see notes 2, 3, and 25 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text, then federal court intervention might be warranted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b711-9\">.

The Court held that the statute was unconstitutional, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-10\">The inevitable effect of any such provision, is of course, to discourage assertion of the Fifth Amendment right not to plead guilty and to deter exercise of the Sixth Amendment right to demand a jury trial.

First, he contends that his murder of Szymankiewicz was not \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious, or cruel,\" Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 921.141(5)(h), as those words have been construed and applied in other Florida death penalty cases, and therefore he was sentenced to death arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the prohibition under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of cruel and unusual punishment. We have already addressed this contention and decided it adversely to the petitioner. Second, Spenkelink contends that he did not murder Szymankiewicz \u201cfor pecuniary gain,\u201d Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 921.141 (5)(f), as those words have been construed and applied in other Florida death penalty cases, but in fact was attempting only to recover those possessions and money which his victim allegedly had sto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>len from him. The trial court and the Florida Supreme Court acknowledged as much, but still defined his act as murder \u201cfor pecuniary gain.\u201d According to Spenkelink, this too constitutes arbitrary and capricious application of the death penalty, a contention, as noted above, that we already have considered and rejected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b716-8\">. Spenkelink has standing to raise the equal protection issue, even though he is not a member of the class allegedly discriminated against, because such discrimination, if proven, impinges on his constitutional right under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. <em>See Taylor v.

That racial discrimination in the imposition of the death penalty was one of the Supreme Court\u2019s concerns in <em>Furman </em>is evidenced by the concurring opinion of Justice Douglas. In determining that capital punishment was not unconstitutional per se, but that standardless death penalty statutes as they were being applied violated the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment, Justice Douglas quoted with approval from a study of capital cases in Texas from 1924 to 1968. That study concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-11\">\u201cApplication of the death penalty is unequal: most of those executed were poor, \u25a0young, and ignorant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-12\">\u201cSeventh-five of the 460 cases involved co-defendants, who, under Texas law, were given separate trials. In several instances where a white and a Negro were co-defendants, the white was sentenced to life imprisonment or a term of years, and the Negro was given the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-15\">\u201cAnother ethnic disparity is found in the type of sentence imposed for rape. The Negro convicted of rape is far more likely to get the death penalty than a term sentence, whereas whites and Latins are far more likely to get a term sentence than the death penalty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-16\"><em>Furman v.

As we pointed out in footnote 28 <em>supra </em>with respect to the contention that Florida\u2019s death penalty is being imposed arbitrarily and capriciously, this is not to say that federal courts should never concern themselves on federal habeas corpus review with whether Section 921.141 is being applied in a racially discriminatory fashion. If a petitioner can show some specific act or acts evidencing intentional or purposeful racial discrimination against him, <em>see Village of Arlington Heights v.

We emphasize once again, see note 28 <em>supra, </em>that this Court anticipates that such intervention will be infrequent and only for the most compelling reasons. Mere conclusory allegations, as the petition makes here, such as that the death penalty is being \u201cadministered arbitrarily and discrimina-torily to punish the killing of white persons as opposed to black persons,\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 2, do not constitute such reasons and would not warrant an evidentiary hearing.

Conclusory allegations, as the petitioner makes here, such as that the death penalty is being \u201c \u2018exacted pursuant to a pattern or practice of Florida prosecuting authorities, courts, juries, and Governors to discriminate on grounds of sex and poverty in the administration of capital punishment,\u2019 \u201d Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 24, do not constitute sufficiently compelling reasons for district court intrusion. Under these circumstances, an evidentiary hearing, either on Eighth Amendment grounds or on Fourteenth Amendment equal protection grounds, would not be warranted. <em>See Village of Arlington Heights v.
