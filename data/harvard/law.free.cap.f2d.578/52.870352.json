LEON HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b157-18\">We hold today that an insurance carrier providing coverage for non-occupational injuries and illnesses may intervene in proceedings under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Act (the Act), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq., </em>and recover amounts paid out for injuries or illnesses that are found to be work-related.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-19\">Raymond Harris filed two claims against his employer, the Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company (Sun), alleging that he suffered hernias as a result of his employment. Sun is a self-insurer with respect to work-related illnesses and injuries. Aetna Life Insurance Company (Aetna) insures Sun against non-work-related illnesses and injuries. Aetna had paid Harris a total of $4,844.17 under this latter coverage for the injuries which Harris now claims are work-related.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-20\">A hearing was held before Administrative Law Judge Joyce Capps. Aetna moved to intervene in order to recover the benefits it had previously paid out. The Administrative Law Judge granted the motion to intervene, found that Harris was entitled to compensation from Sun and that Aetna was entitled to reimbursement out of the compensation award payable by Sun.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-21\">Pursuant to a petition for review by Harris and the Director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (the Director), the Benefits Review Board (the Board), in a two-to-one decision, vacated the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision and Order and held that the Administrative Law Judge erred in allowing Aetna to intervene and in allowing reimbursement to Aetna out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>compensation award. Aetna and Sun filed petitions for review in this Court pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These petitions have been consolidated and are considered together here. The issues presented here are purely questions of law over which we exercise our power of plenary <em>de novo </em>review. The views of the Board with respect to these issues are not entitled to special deference. <em>Director, O.W.C.P. v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>545 F.2d 337, 343 (3rd Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">If Aetna has a right to obtain the reimbursement it seeks in proceedings under the Act, it certainly has a right to intervene in such proceedings. We, therefore, will first discuss Aetna\u2019s right to reimbursement. This issue has not, to our knowledge, been \u25a0addressed by any federal court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 919 provides the following with respect to what issues may be heard in proceedings under the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">\u00a7 919. Procedure in respect of claims (a) Subject to the provisions of section 913 of this title a claim for compensation may be filed with the deputy commissioner in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary at any time after the first seven days of disability following any injury, or at any time after death, and the deputy commissioner shall have <em>full power and authority to hear and determine all questions in respect of such claim.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, any hearing held under this chapter shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of section 554 of Title 5. Any such hearing shall be conducted by a hearing examiner qualified under section 3105 of that Title. All powers, duties, and responsibilities vested by this chapter, on October 27, 1972, in the deputy commissioners with respect to such hearings shall be vested in such hearing examiners, (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">The issue here is thus whether the question of Aetna\u2019s entitlement to reimbursement is a question in respect to a compensation claim. We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Aetna\u2019s claim for reimbursement is derived from the same nucleus of operative facts as Harris\u2019 claim for compensation. A finding that a claimant\u2019s injuries are work-related is, in operative effect, a finding that payments should not have been made under a policy covering non-occupational injuries. Deciding reimbursement claims at the same time as compensation claims avoids essentially duplicative litigation thus reducing the expenditure of time and money by the parties and the courts. Facilitating reimbursement of improperly paid benefits also encourages insurance companies such as Aetna to make swift payment of legitimate claims. Thus on the basis of these policy considerations and the close factual relationship between reimbursement and compensation claims, we hold that claims for reimbursement are questions in respect of compensation claims and may therefore be decided in the same proceedings in which the compensation claims are decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">In arguing for the contrary result, Harris and the Director rely most heavily on 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 916 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-12\">\u00a7 916. Assignment and exemption from claims of creditors</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-13\">No assignment, release, or commutation of compensation or benefits due or payable under this chapter, except as provided by this chapter, shall be valid, and such compensation and benefits shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>exempt from all claims of creditors and from levy, execution, and attachment or other remedy for recovery or collection of a debt, which exemption may not be waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">\u201cCreditor\u201d is not defined in the Act. We conclude, however, that Aetna is not a creditor within the meaning of \u00a7 916. Congress\u2019 obvious intent in enacting \u00a7 916 was to insure that payments under the Act which are meant to cover medical and living expenses are not gobbled up by hungry creditors thereby leaving claimants and their families without the means to cover day to day expenses. Allowing reimbursement here does not defeat that intent. Harris will receive the full amount to which he is entitled. He will be deprived only of payments which were improperly paid in the first instance. Aetna is not in the position of an ordinary creditor whose claim pre-dates and is independent of a claimant\u2019s right to compensation under the Act. Aet-na\u2019s right to reimbursement arises precisely because Harris is found to be entitled to compensation under the Act and therefore not entitled to compensation under Sun\u2019s policy with Aetna. Since we hold that Aet-na is not a creditor, nothing in the Act prevents Aetna from making its claim for compensation in proceedings pursuant to the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The Act does not explicitly provide procedures for intervention. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 919 provides that interested parties should be notified of the filing of a claim (\u00a7 919(b)) and of a hearing on such claim (\u00a7 919(c)). \u00a7 919(c) also provides that hearings may be ordered on the application of interested parties. \u201cInterested party\u201d is not defined in the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because we have found, however, that a claim for reimbursement may be made at a hearing provided for by \u00a7 919, there can be no doubt that Aetna has a substantial interest in making such a claim and in obtaining a decision upon it. We, therefore, hold that the Board erred in deciding that Aetna could not intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">The Order of the Board will be vacated and this case will be remanded to the Board for the entry of an order consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-7\">. Harris and the Director claim that the order being reviewed here is not \u201cfinal\u201d and, therefore, this court has no jurisdiction since 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c) permits review only of final orders of the Board. Although the Board order here did remand to the Administrative Law Judge for action consistent with its opinion, all issues were, for all practical purposes, resolved by the Board\u2019s order. <em>See Sea-Land Service, Inc. v. Director, O.W.C.P., </em>540 F.2d 629, 631 n.1 (3rd Cir. 1976). In particular, the Board finally decided the intervention and reimbursement issues. The Administrative Law Judge\u2019s Decision and Order on remand was handed down on October 14, 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-15\">. <em>Compare Lemmer v. Batzli Electric Co., </em>267 Minn. 8, 125 N.W.2d 434 (1963) (allowing similar claim for reimbursement in proceeding under state compensation act) <em>with In re Gould\u2019s Case, </em>355 Mass. 66, 242 N.E.2d 748 (1968) (disallowing such a claim).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b159-6\">. The regulations under the Act provide little assistance. \u00a7 702.333 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">\u00a7 702.333 Formal hearings; parties.
