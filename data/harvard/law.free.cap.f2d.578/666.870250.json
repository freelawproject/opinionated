Other individual cases, in addition to presenting one or more of the general issues, also present specific issues of fact. These are reserved pending a review of and reports on the factual disputes between the United States EPA and the individual petitioners. * * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">2) No other material issues are presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">3) One petition pending before this court from the Northern Ohio Lung Association attacks United States EPA\u2019s failure to promulgate a separate implementation plan for the \u201csecondary standards\u201d for the ambient air. This petition will be the subject of separate consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">4) <em>Similarly, this opinion does not govern any petitions where the RAM model was not used. We do not decide any specific fact disputes raised by any petitioner as to plants other than those treated in this </em>opinion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Decision of these cases will follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">5) For the reasons stated above, the decision of the Administrator in imposing the SO2 control plan is affirmed subject to the reservations indicated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-12\"><em>Id., </em>at 1165 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-20\">The petitioners\u2019 Motion to Clarify, filed February 27, 1978, states accurately that this court\u2019s opinion disposed of five issues, which it stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-21\">(1) The appropriateness of the use of RAM (raised in the joint RAM brief and incorporated by reference in the utilities\u2019 brief),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-23\">(2) The claims \u25a0 for needed procedural safeguards of cross examination on remand (raised in the utility brief),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-24\">(3) The economic and technical arguments (raised in the utilities\u2019 brief), and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-25\">(4) The urban/rural designation issue (raised in the utilities\u2019 brief).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-26\">(5) The urban dispersion coefficients used in RAM (raised in the joint RAM brief).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-27\">Subsequently, said petition lists the following five issues as unresolved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-28\">(1) Failure of U. S. EPA to utilize monitor data in regulation development (utilities\u2019 brief),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-29\">(2) Improper use of Class A Assumption in the rural model (utilities\u2019 brief),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-30\">(3) Improper terrain adjustment features to the rural model (utilities\u2019 brief),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-31\">(4) Failure of EPA to correct background and data errors (utilities\u2019 brief), and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-32\">(5) Invalidity of the plan for vagueness, and failure to consider sulfur-in-coal variability (utilities\u2019 reply brief).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-33\">Issues 2 and 3 are disposed of by this court\u2019s opinion issued this date in <em>Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. EPA, </em>578 F.2d 660 (6th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Issues numbered 1 and 5 above we deem disposed of by affirmance of EPA\u2019s employment of the RAM and MAXT-24 models and the discussion in <em>Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. v. EPA, </em>and <em>Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. EPA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Issue number 4 we consider to be fact questions which are subject to agreed-on administrative review. <em>See Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. EPA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">For the information of these petitioners, and others, we call attention to the fact that by order dated February 9, 1978, the petition of the Northern Ohio Lung Association (No. 76-2282) was remanded to the United States EPA for further consideration. <em>Northern Ohio Lung Ass\u2019n v. EPA, </em>572 F.2d 1182 (6th Cir. 1978). Additionally, as of today, an order is being entered denying the petition of the Ohio Mining &amp; Reclamation Association and the Ohio Coal Operators\u2019 Association, Inc. (No. 77-3290) because it seeks relief which can only be had from the Congress of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">As of this present date, this court considers that the United States EPA control plan for all Mahoning and Summit County facilities belonging to certain petitioners in these cases is under voluntary re-evaluation by United States EPA due to factual disputes. As these and other fact disputes are resolved, stipulations for dismissal should be submitted promptly to this court. When factual disputes cannot be resolved, the parties should make every effort promptly to stipulate the disputed issue, or, failing that, to stipulate the opposing positions of the parties on the issue or issues.</p>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b771-10\"> <em>See note 1, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-13\">.

(Although there was some confusion on this point in the briefs, the record makes clear that White-Westinghouse\u2019s Franklin County facility is subject to the RAM model. <em>See </em>EPA Final Technical Support Document at IV-57.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-35\">(g) Standard Oil Co. of Ohio \u2014 Lucas County steam generating units.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-36\">(h) Interlake, Inc. \u2014 all steam generating units.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-37\">(i) Coulton Chemical Corp. \u2014 all steam generating units.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-38\"><em>Id., </em>at 1152 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
