The dispute arising out of the discharge was submitted to an arbitrator pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between the Union and the Nevada Resort Association. The arbitrator concluded that Sewall\u2019s discharge was not for good cause, reduced the discharge to suspension without pay for two months, and ordered reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-27\">Appellant argues that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by failing to defer to a previous \u201cbinding\u201d arbitration award that interpreted the \u201cgood cause\u201d provision of the same agreement in relation to excessive absenteeism and tardiness, though involving a different arbitrator, employer, and employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-28\">The arbitrator was empowered to review the propriety of the discharge under the provision of the collective bargaining agreement that \u201cno regular employee . shall be discharged except for just cause.\u201d Moreover, the agreement contemplated imposition of a suspension as a lesser discipli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>nary penalty for employee misconduct. The arbitrator was cognizant of and took into consideration the prior arbitration award to which appellant referred, apparently distinguishing or disapproving the pri- or ruling. He resolved the dispute by considering the proper sources \u2014 the terms of the collective bargaining agreement and the \u201ccommon law\u201d of the industry. <em>Anaconda Co. v. Great Falls Mill &amp; Smeltermen\u2019s Union, </em>402 F.2d 749, 751-52 (9th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Judicial Review of arbitration awards is limited. An award is legitimate so long as it \u201cdraws its essence\u201d from the collective bargaining agreement and does not \u201cmanifest an infidelity\u201d to the agreement. <em>United Steelworkers of America </em>v. <em>Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 597-99, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960). \u201c[I]f, on its face, the award represents a plausible interpretation of the contract in the context of the parties\u2019 conduct, judicial inquiry ceases and the award must be affirmed.\u201d <em>Holly Sugar Corp. </em>v. <em>Distillery Union, </em>412 F.2d 899, 903 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The award in this case satisfies these criteria. We reject appellant\u2019s contention that the arbitrator was bound by the prior arbitration award. Absent a provision in the contract to the contrary, the arbitrator could reasonably conclude that strict adherence to stare decisis would impair the flexibility of the arbitral process contemplated by the parties. But even if the arbitrator were incorrect in this assessment of the parties\u2019 intent and erred in not following the prior arbitral award, we would not for that reason vacate the award. <em>See Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild v. Washington Post Co., </em>143 U.S.App. D.C. 210, 215, 442 F.2d 1234, 1239 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The Union\u2019s request for costs and damages under Rule 38, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
