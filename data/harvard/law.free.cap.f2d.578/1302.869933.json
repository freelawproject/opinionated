Cummings, United States Circuit Judge for the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1407-8\">J. BLAINE ANDERSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1407-9\">In 1971 and 1972, appellant-taxpayer amended his tax returns for 1964-1967,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claiming for the first time credit for foreign income taxes paid in 1961-1963. The Internal Revenue Service allowed the credits and granted refunds. Subsequently, it decided this determination was incorrect and sued to recover the sums refunded. The district court granted summary judgment for ap-pellee (388 F.Supp. 36),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and taxpayer appealed. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-10\">During the years 1961-1963, taxpayer lived in Germany; his entire income for these years was exempt from U.S. income tax. He did, however, pay income tax to Germany. \u00a7 901 of the Internal Revenue Code permits a United States taxpayer to take either a credit or deduction for foreign income taxes. Under \u00a7 904(c), the credit may be carried back 2 years and forward 5 years;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the carryover is available only if \u201cthe taxpayer chooses to have the benefits of this subpart.\u201d Deduction treatment is allowed only in the year the foreign tax is paid.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1407-18\">Appellant first indicated which treatment \u2014 deduction or credit \u2014 he preferred when he filed his amended returns in 1971 and 1972. For the years 1961-1963, appellant had no income, taxable under U.S. law, against which to claim either a deduction or a credit. In 1964, 1965, and 1967, he apparently was unaware he could claim a credit for the foreign taxes previously paid. The issue before us is whether his 1971-1972 amendments were too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-19\">The government argues that under I.R.C. \u00a7 6511(a) a taxpayer must elect credit treatment within three years of the year in which the return is filed. Appellant coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>ters that the ten-year limitation period of \u00a7 6511(d)(3) is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-4\">There is merit in appellant\u2019s argument that the language of the statute supports his position. Yet, on the other hand, the legislative history shows Congress intended the three-year limitation period to be applied as a general rule. S.R.No. 1393, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 U.S.Cong. &amp; Admin.News pp. 3770, 3778-79, 3784-85 (1960); H.Rep. No. 1358, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., 1960-2 Cum. Bull. 865, 869. We do not decide which is the appropriate general rule, however, for here we are faced with an unusual twist of fact: choosing between a credit and a deduction was an empty formality for appellant inasmuch as his entire income was exempt from U.S. tax.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, appellant had no taxable income to deduct from and no federal tax to take a credit against. Under these particular facts,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> equity dictates the ten-year limitation period be applied.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1408-5\">Finally, appellant\u2019s amended return for 1967 is challenged as untimely because he did not make a \u00a7 901 election for 1967 until 1972.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The government argues \u00a7 904(c) also requires the taxpayer to elect \u00a7 901 treatment for any year to which a credit is carried<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and appellant\u2019s failure to do so within three years bars his claim. The election requirement asserted by the government is again an empty formality. Therefore, the ten-year statute of limitations should have been applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-6\">The order granting summary judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1407-12\">. Since only appellant W. Keith Woodmansee\u2019s income is in question, we refer to appellants in the singular.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-13\">Appellant\u2019s 1966 return is no longer disputed; hence, this appeal concerns only his 1964, 1965, and 1967 amended returns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1407-14\">. The District Court granted summary judgment for the Government, sua sponte, on the theory that the foreign taxes paid in 1961 through 1963 were not eligible for treatment as foreign tax credits in any year (even assuming proper and timely election), since the foreign source income upon which such foreign taxes were paid was exempt from taxation in the United States pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 911 of the I.R.C. of 1954 (26 U.S.C.). On this appeal, although favorable to the position of the Government, it does not support or endorse the rationale of the District Court. That position was rejected in <em>Helvering v. Campbell, </em>139 F.2d 865 (4th Cir. 1944), among others, and the Commissioner acquiesced in those decisions. See Rev.Rul. 54-15, 1954-1 Cum.Bull. 129, and Rev.Rul. 75-268, 1975-28, Int.Rev.Bull. 11. As demonstrated, <em>infra, </em>we do not support or endorse the opinion of the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1407-20\">. \u201c(d) <em>Carryback and carryover of excess tax paid. </em>\u2014 Any amount by which any such tax paid or accrued to any foreign country or possession of the United States for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, for which the taxpayer chooses to have the benefits of this subpart exceeds the applicable limitation under subsection (a) shall be deemed tax paid or accrued to such foreign country or possession of the United States in the second preceding taxable year, in the first preceding taxable year, and in the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth succeeding taxable years, in that order . . . .\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 904(d), now slightly modified and designated \u00a7 904(c). (For convenience, we refer to this section by its present designation.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1407-23\">. \u201cSuch amount deemed paid or accrued in any year may be availed of only as a tax credit and not as a deduction and only if taxpayer for such year chooses to have the benefits of this subpart as to taxes paid or accrued for that year to foreign countries or possessions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1408-7\">. When the return shows no taxes are due, the Sixth Circuit has said: \u201cAssuming that the section requires the taxpayer to make an election, there is, then, no basis for choice.\u201d <em>Gentsch v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>151 F.2d 997, 1001 (6th Cir. 1945). <em>Cf. Buckley v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>158 F.2d 158, 162 (2d Cir. 1946); <em>Connor v. United States, </em>19 F.Supp. 97 (D.N.H.1937); <em>Raymond v. Commissioner, </em>34 B.T.A. 1171 (1936).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1408-8\">. The government has not contended the omission was motivated by bad faith or manipulative purpose; appellants were simply unaware the foreign tax credit was applicable to income exempt under \u00a7 911. Nor is the availability of the credit provisions otherwise disputed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1408-20\">. We note that other courts have reasoned similarly, and the ten-year statute has been applied in certain circumstances. <em>Bank of America v. United States, </em>377 F.2d 575 (Ct.C1.1967); <em>see Morrison-Knudsen Co., Inc. v. United States, </em>22 AFTR 2d 5753 (N.D.Cal.1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1408-21\">. In 1964 and 1965, appellant did make a \u00a7 901 election for foreign taxes paid in the same years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1408-22\">.
