While we were talking about the lease, Mr. De Koven made the remark to Mr, Osgood, 1 It won\u2019t make any difference to you; you haven\u2019t signed the lease.\u2019 I told him: \u2018Then,\u2019 says I, \u2018I won\u2019t accept the lease.\u2019 Mr. De Koven then said, \u2018Now, Mr. Warren, I will tell you what I will do; I will accept Mr. Fleming- in here; put Fleming\u2019s name in the lease instead of Osgood\u2019s, and I will indorse a release of you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>on the back of the loase.\u2019 I told him that was all right. Mr, Fleming signed his name while I was there, and returned it to Mr. De Koven, and left it there. I haven\u2019t seen tho lease since. I never had anything to do with the document. I told De Koven, as Osgood would not sign the lease I would not accept. De Koven said ho would put in Fleming\u2019s name <em>instead'Of </em>Osgood\u2019s, as Osgood hadn\u2019t signed it, and he would indorse to me a release on tho back of the lease, giving as a reason for doing so, that it would save the time of sending the lease to New York.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-6\">This testimony was supported by that of Osgood and Fleming.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-7\">On a duplicate of the lease, signed and sealed, like the other by Wadsworth (the landlord and plaintiff), and by Warren and Fleming, the following indorsement, executed by Fleming, appeared:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-8\">\u201cAssignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-9\">\u201c <em>State of </em>Illinois, <em>Cook County, ss.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-10\">\u201cIn consideration of one dollar, to me in hand paid, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, I have sold, assigned, and set over to the said William Fleming, all my right, title, and interest to tho within lease; said Fleming assuming all liabilities under, said lease, and releasing me, the undersigned, from any and all liabilities whatever under the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-11\">\u201c Given under my hand and seal, at Chicago, April 27th, A.D. 1867.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-13\">\u201c J.

If not accepted by Warren, he would not be bound to pay. If a lease was signed by Warren on condition that Osgood was to be a party to it, and if Osgood refused to sign it, with the knowledge of Wadsworth or his \u00e1gent, De Koven, then Warren would not bo bound to accept that lease. [If Warren refused to accept the lease with Fleming, and the agent, of Wadsworth agreed that to save trouble of sending another lease to Wadsworth for his signature, if Warren would put his name to the lease he should not be bound, and that Warren did not accept the lease with Fleming, then Warren would not be bound on the last lease.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-11\">\u201cThen com.e the witnesses on the part of the plaintiff. And then if all the matter is laid aside that was presented by the defendants\u2019 witnesses, and you take up the case upon the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, then, if the evidence as to the acceptance of the lease by Warren does not satisfy the jury that it was not ' accepted by Warren in the way I <em>mention </em>\u2014 then <em>comes the alleged promise of De Koven, the agent of Wadsworth, that he would release </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>Warren from the lease </em>\u2014 that <em>is, a verbal promise, not executed to this day; and if such was the agreement, then Warren would \u25a0have to look to Be Kovenfor a breach of that agreement, and would have no defence here.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-6\">[\u2018\u2022As to that assignment on the lease, if this was all the understanding between these parties, that Mr. Warren, was not to be liable, there was his name, and it would show; and if Fleming wanted to dispose of it or do anything with it, he could not do it legally without Warren\u2019s consent.

The best way I\u2019can instruct you is to take up that given on the part of the defendant, which we admit so as to satisfy the jury on the subject of acceptance; and then, if they are not satisfied with that, <em>the mere verbal promise of Be Iioven to release Mr. Warren would not be good defence here, I think, but would leave Warren to turn over on Be Kovenfor a breach of his promise ; </em>arid that is the way, I suppose; the thing might turn possibly on your verdict for the plaintiff; but we leave the matter with you to make the best you can of the case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-8\">To the parts of the charge within brackets the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-9\">\n<em>Mr. J. Van Arman, for the plaintiff in error:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-10\">The case, in its best view for the defendant below, shows that all parties intended that the lease should take effect as a legal instrument, and operate, in form, at least,, as a demise to Warren and Fleming, and that Warren should be <em>subsequently released </em>from his covenants in the lease. The very term- \u201c <em>release \u201d </em>implies that the party'who is to have the benefit of it has, at the time of receiving such benefit, already assumed an obligation from which he is thereby discharged; and the assignment of all his interest in the lease made by Warren to Fleming, seven days after the lease was made, shows that they both then understood that they were jointly vested with the title to the demised term. The question then is, whether a.,verbal agreement, at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>execution of a deed, that one of the parties to it shall be released from the covenants contained in the deed, or that he shall not be bound by these covenants, can-be given in evidence to defeat an action brought for an alleged breach of them. It is settled by authorities both ancient and modern that it cannot be.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-5\">The lease, after it was signed and sealed by Warren and Fleming, was delivered by Fleming in Warren\u2019s presence to De Koven, the plaintiff's agent. When a deed is delivered to the grantee or obligee, and retained by him, he setting up that the delivery was absolute, parol proof that the delivery was conditioned or otherwise than absolute, is incompetent in a contest between such obligee and the obligor. <footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-6\">The release was never executed, nor was De Koven ever called upon to execute or procure the execution of it. To be effectual it must have been evidenced by a sealed instrument executed by the plaintiff\u2019 himself, or by his duly authorized agent. It will not of course be contended that a mere verbabagreement to release a party from his covenants can bar a suit for the non-performance of them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b329-7\"><em>Messrs. F. Anthony and C. F. </em>Peck, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ2\">submitted that there was no error in the charge, and that the verdict was warranted, and is supported by the testimony.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-11\"> See Sheppard\u2019s Touchstone, 59; Coke Littleton, 36; Whyddon\u2019s Case, Croke Elizabeth, 520; Countess of Rutland\u2019s Case, 5 Reports, 26; Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Howard, 13 Howard, 334.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b329-12\"> Braman <em>v. </em>Bingham, 26 New York, 491.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b329-8\">Mr. Justice STRONG</author>\n<p id=\"AGh\">delivered the opinion of the, court.</p>\n<p id=\"AFp\">Were this case before us on a motion for a new trial we might feel constrained to send it back to another jury. \u25a0 But it has been brought here by a writ of error, and we cau, therefore, reverse the judgment only for errors of law apparent in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">The testimony respecting the circumstances attending the transaction in question is contradictory. On the part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>defendant it is that he refused to accept the lease without having Osgood bound with him; that the plaintiff\u2019s agent 'agreed to take Fleming in his and Osgood\u2019s place, and agreed that when Fleming signed the contract ho would indorse on it a release of Warren, saying it Avould avoid the necessity of sending'a new lease to Wadsworth, the plaintiff, for his signature. On the other hand the plaintiff\u2019s agent denies that he promised to release Warren, and states that he told him he was the only man he looked to for the rent. lie states .further that the defendant brought Fleming to him, that both signed the lease and a duplicate thereof, and that the duplicate Avas delivered to Fleming and the defendant. The lease is dated April 20th, 1867, and on the duplicate retained by the plaintiff\u2019s agent there appears an assignment of all his interest in the lease by the defendant to Fleming. This assignment is dated April 27th, 1867, but it was evidently made on the day on which Fleming\u2019s signature to the lease Avas made, for there is no evidence that the duplicate retained by the plaintiff\u2019s agent Avas ever seen by the defendant after Fleming signed it. Coupling this with the evidence that He Koven, the plaintiff\u2019s agent, had agreed to take Fleming in the place of Osgood aud Warren, and had said that signing the instrument in the manner in which it was signed, would avoid the necessity of sending a new lease to WadsAvorth, the lessor, for his signature; coupling it also with the other evidence, given by the defendant himself, that he did not accept the lease, or deliver the deed, we think it was a question to be submitted to the jury whether the contract had ever been consummated, or, in other words, whether it had been delivered and accepted as the contract of the defendant. It was not, therefore, erroneous to refuse the instruction prayed for, namely, \u201cthat the jury, upon the evidence given, should find the issue for the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The other prayer of the plaintiff for instruction was substantially granted. The court, Avhen speaking of the alleged promise of De Koven to' release Warren from the lease, said it Avas a verbal promise not executed, and, \u201c if such was the agreement, Warren would have to look to He Koven for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>breach of it, and would have no defence here.\u201d And again\u2019 the court said: \u201c The mere verbal promise of De Koven to release Mr. Warren would not be a good defence here, I think, but would leave Warren to turn over on De Koven for a breach of promise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Tlie remaining exceptions taken to the charge cannot be sustained.' It may be admitted, as contended for, by the plaintiff in error, that when a deed has been delivered, and the delivery has been accepted, a verbal agreement between the parties, made at the time of the delivery, or previous thereto, that one of them should be released from the covenants contained in the deed, cannot defeat an action at law brought for an alleged breach of those covenants; but the charge of the court was in harmony wdth this doctrine. It may also be conceded that there can be no conditional delivery of a deed to the grantee, or covenantee, therein named; but nothing in the charge intimated that there could he. The question submitted to the jury was, whether there had been any acceptance of the lease by the defendant. This was equivalent to submitting the inquiry, not whether the deed had been delivered on condition that Warren should be released afterward, but whether it had been delivered at all as the deed of the defendant. That such a submission was proper, in view of the evidence, we have already said.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
