Although under the act of Congress of July 1st, 1863, a bank created by a Territorial legislature cannot legally exercise its powers until the charter creating it ,is approved by Congress, yet a conveyance of land to it, if the charter authorize it to hold land, cannot be treated as a nullity by the grantor who has received the consideration for the grant, there being no judgment of ouster against the corporation at the instance of the government.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-12\">Error to the Circuit Court for the District of Nebraska; the case being thus :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-13\">In February, 1857, Mitchell being an <em>occupant </em>of part of a lot in the now city of Omaha \u2014 a site which at that time was still part of the public lands \u2014 gave to Redick a power of a'ttorney to \u201csell and convey\u201d it.

The terms of the charter gave it \u201cpower to issue bills, deal in exchange, and to buy and possess property of every kind.\u201d Congress, however, as long ago as 1836, had passed an act<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> providing\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-8\">\u201c That no act of the Territorial legislature of any of the Territories of the United States, incorporating any bank or any institution with banking powers or privileges, hereafter to bo passed, shall have <em>any force or effect </em>whatever, <em>until approved and confirmed by Congress.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-9\">The act of the Nebraska legislature never was approved or confirmed by Congress.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>In this condition of things Mitchell, in May, 1863, in consideration of $1, as appeared by the instrument, made a deed of quit-claim of the same lot to one Smith, the lot being then worth $2000, and under that title Smith brought ejectment in the court below.

The authority <em>to </em>Redick limited, in express terms, his power to-convey such title as Mitchell at the time of making the power had. Mitchell at that time had no title to the lot'. He occupied it only. This uncertain and shadowy right he authorized Redick to convey, and no other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-8\">2. The charter of the so-called \u201cNehama Valley Bank\u201d had not \u201c <em>any </em>force or effect whatever.\u201d It was therefore void. There was thus no grantee. The deed conveyed nothing, and Mitchell still remained owner. Being owner, his title passed to Smith, who ought to have had judgment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b376-9\">\n<em>Messrs. J. I. Redick and 0.

In <em>Orchard </em>v. <em>Hughes,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this same act of Congress, of 1836, was set up to avoid paying a debt. The defence was not sustained. The effort here is of as bad a kind.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-10\"> Act of July 1st, 1836, 5 Stat. at Large, 61.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-14\"> 1 Wallace, 73.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b376-12\">Mr. Justice DAVIS</author>\n<p id=\"AvK\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">\u2018 It is insisted, in behalf of the plaintiff'in error, that Redick had no authority to make this deed in Mitchell\u2019s name, because the power under which he acted directed him to convey such title as Mitchell then had, which was only a possessory right. It is true that in February, 1857, when the power of attorney was given, Mitchell had not the legal title to the lot, but as the mayor of Omaha conveyed it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>him a short time afterwards, it is a fair presumption that he was, at the date of the execution of the power, one of the class of persons who were entitled to a deed from the mayor under the provisions of the Town Site Act of 1844. If so, he was to all practical purposes the real owner of the property, and intended that Redick should sell and convey something more than a \u201c mere uncertain and shadowy right,\u201d as the plaintiff in error claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">But, in the state of the pi\u2019oof it is not necessary to look into the power of attorney to see the extent of the authority conferred, because the subsequent conduct of Mitchell renders it an unimportant subject of inquiry. It would be grossly unjust for Mitchell, having acquired the legal title, to let Redick, under a power of attorney executed before the title was obtained, make a deed in his name to the bunk, appropriate to himself the money received for the sale of the property, and then, six years afterwards, disavow the act of his attorney on the plea that he had exceeded his authority. The law will not permit this to be done, and estops Mitchell from setting up-such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">It is insisted, however, as an additional ground of objection 'to this deed, that the bank was not a competent grantee to receive title. It is not denied that the bank was duly organized in pursuance'of the provisions of ah act of the legislature of the Territory of Nebraska, but, it is said it bad no right to transact business until the charter creating it was approved by Congress. This is so, and it could not legally exercise its powers until this approval was obtained, but this defect in its constitution cannot be taken advantage of collaterally. No proposition is more thoroughly settled than this, and it is unnecessary to refer to authorities to support it. Conceding the bank to be guilty of usurpation, it was still a body corporate <em>de facto, </em>exercising at least one of the franchises which the legislature attempted to confer upon it, and in such a case the party who makes a sale of real estate to it, is not in a position to question its capacity to take the title, after it has. paid the consideration for the purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>If, prior to the execution of the deed, there had been a judgment of ouster against the corporation at the instance of the government, the aspect of the case would be different.</p>\n<p id=\"AdS\">There is no error in.the record, and the-judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
