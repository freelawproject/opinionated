The policy was on one side of a sheet of paper sixteen inches long by ten wide; the upp.er seven being left blank for the name.of the person insured, and a description in writing of the property insured. Pour printed lines, in the type known as minion,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> but leaded so as to be sufficiently legible,, declared that \u201c the company agreed to makegood as to the assured his loss to the amount insured, to be estimated according to the actual -cash value of the property at the time of the loss, and to bo paid sixty days after due notice and proofs of the same made by the assured and received at this office, <em>in accordance with the terms of this policy hereinafter mentioned\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-11\">Then followed, in a smaller type, not leaded,\u2022 eight paragraphs, covering- the rest of the sheet, and making a solid body of finely printed matter, most of the matter being provisions in favor of the company; some of them restricting the liability apparently incurred in the body of the instrument, and not a few making the policy eutirely void. There was abundant room on the sheet, if less blank space had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>been left, to have printed all these terras of the policy-in a^ larger type. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-4\">The fourth subdivision of these, terms ran thus, the size of the typo and leading being here reproduced. Th$commas and semicolons were the same .as here given, though here, for the benefit of the. reader\u2019s eye, the pointing in some places is made more conspicuous than on the policy itself:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-5\">\u201cIf the assured shall have or shall hereafter make auy other insurance of the property hereby insured, or any part thereof, without\u2019 tba consent of the company written hereon; or if the above-mentioned premises shall be occupied so' as to increase\u2019the risk, or become vacant and unoccupied for a period of more than thirty days, or the risk he increased by any means whatever within the control of the assured, without the consent of this company indorsed hereon <em>% </em>or if the property be sold or transferred, or any change take place in- title or possession whatever, by legal process, judicial decree, voluntary transfer, or conveyance <em>% </em>or if this policy shall be assigned, either before or after a loss, without the consent of the-company indorsed hereon; or if the assured is not the unconditional and sole owner <em>at </em>the property 5 or if the interest of the assured in the property, whether as owner, trustee, consignee, factor, mortgagee, lessee, or otherwise, is not truly statcd\u201ein this policy; <em>or if gunpowder, phosphorus, saltpetre, naphtha, befizine, benzoin, </em>varnish, <em>benzole, petroleum, or crude earth oils are kept on the premises, or if </em>camphene, <em>burning-fluid, refined coal or earth oils are kept for sale, stored, or used on the premises in quantities exceeding one barrel at any one time, without written permission in, or indorsed </em>upon, this policy *, then, and in every such case, this policy .shall be void.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-6\">The goods having been destroyed by fire, Slaughter sued the company, which set up as a plea that \u2018\u2018the plaintiffs, contrary to the terms and provisions of the policy, without the written permission, or permission indorsed on it by the company, did keep gunpowder on the premises, and in the said storehouse described where the goods so insured were kept.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ApU2\">The plaintiffs demurred, and the demurrer being sustained, and judgment given against the company, it brought .the case here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-7\">\u25a0 \u2019Whether or not the plea was good, and the judgment rightly given, depended of course upou the proper construction of the part above italicized of the portion of the conditions of the policy.in which it was found. It was contended by the insurance company that keeping gunpowder in the store <em>in any quantity </em>vacated the policy, while the assured insisted that the policy was not defeated if they did not keep\u2019 more than <em>one barrel </em>at a time. Which was the right conclusion was the matter to be now decided.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-8\">\n<em>No counsel appeared for the insurance company, the plaintiff in error.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN6\"><em>Messrs. </em>W. <em>P.

But such is not the ease. It is the last clause in, the fourth subdivision of the conditions embraced in the body of the policy, and in this subdivision a number of causes are set forth which shall operate to avoid the policy. These causes are all embraced-in separate clauses, each class being separated from the others by a semicolon. If there were in the clause in dispute a semicolon where the word premises is first used, it may- be, in view of the punctuation adopted in reference to the other clauses, that this clause would be complete in itself, and exclude wholly from the premises gunpowder, saltpetre, and the other articles in the same class. But in the absence of the semicolon, it is manifest that no greater restriction can be applied to gunpowder and saltpetre than to camphene and burning fluid, and that, therefore, the words \u201c in quantities exceeding one barrel at any one time,\u2019\u2019\u00bfare applicable alike to all the materials which are specified in the clause in controversy. This construction is fortified by the-nature of the forbidden articles. Saltpetre is not a dangerous substance; and yet, according to the view of the counsel for the plaintiff' in error, it is prohibited altogether,' while a barrel of camphene and burning fluid, which'are inflammable, can be stored with impunity; A construction.that would lead to such a result canuot be adopted, unless the_Jang\u00fc\u00e1'ge employed leaves no other alternative. ' .</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Besides, if the contract is as contended \u00ed\u00f3r, it.'would'impeach the good faith' and fair dealing-.of the insurance company, for it would be deceptive, and calculated to mislead those who are not well informed on matters of this kind. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>It is well known that the agencies of this company are located in all parts of tlie country, and that, in many places where they are established, housekeepers generally keep on hand, for their own use, in small quantities, gunpowder, saltpetre, benzine, and perhaps other interdicted articles. It would never occur to this class'of persons, on making application ' atone of these agencies for insurance,'that they were forbidden to keep these things in their houses, and unless their attention was particularly called to the subject, which would be an unusual occurrence, they would take out their'policies ini the belief that they could keep and use the substances required for their necessities as they had been in the habit of doing; and, if they should happen to-read over the schedule of conditions annexed to the policy, usually printed in the smallest type, not being accustomed to a critical examination of the structure of sentences, they would naturally conclude, as saltpetre and gunpowder are classed together, and as saltpetre is comparatively harmless, while eamphene and burning-fluid are quite dangerous, that the restriction at the end of the enumerated articles wras intended to be applied to all of them alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">This, too, is the i'ational construction of the clause in-question, and we cannot suppose the company which framed this policy intended it to be interpreted differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">If insurance companies do not mean to take risks .on property where gunpowder, Saltpetre, and tbe like substances are kqpt, even for ordinary use, then good faith totheassured requires that they should declare their intention in terms which -cannot admit of controversy; and, in order to avoid just cause of complaint, it would be better for them to employ type, in relation to this important subject, large enough to-arrest the attention of an interested party.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">In our opinion the Circuit Court did not err in sustaining the demurrer to the third' plea, and the judgment of that court is, accordingly, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The motion for damages is disallowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
