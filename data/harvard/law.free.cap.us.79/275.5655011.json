The statement was indeed agreed on by counsel, and was not a \u201cfinding\u201d by the court. But it fell within <em>Insurance Company </em>v. Tweed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> There counsel for both parties in <em>this </em>court had agreed to certain parts of the opinion of the court below, as containing the material facts of the case, and to\u2019treat them as facts found by that court though not so found. That agreement of counsel was held as good as a finding under the act of March 3d, 1865. So the statement here was filed after the judgment. But in this point it was saved by <em>Flanders </em>v. <em>Tweed;</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for there the statement of the judge had not been filed till three months after the judgment. But the ease being (as is this one)'from Louisiana, .where the civil law practice prevails, and the p\u00e1rties haviug meant to' put the case in form for review, and having believed that it was so put in form, the court did not affirm the judgment, but sent the case baqk for a new trial. .</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b294-7\"><em>Mr. B. H. </em>Bristow, <em>Solicitor-General, contra:</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-8\">The statement of facts was not filed until many months after the issue and filing of,the writ, and cannot be'-regarded as part of the record, or as anything on which error can be assigned.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> <em>Flanders </em>v. <em>Tweed </em>was a special case, and almost in terms declared'not to be a precedent.

If the verdict of the court be a general verdict, only such rulings of the court, <em>in the progress of the trial,, </em>can be reviewed as are presented by bill of exceptions, or as may arise on the pleadings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-7\">\u201c 2. In such cases, a bill of exceptions cannot be used to \u2022bring up the whole testimony for review7 any more than in a trial by jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-8\">. \u201c3. That if the parties desire a review of the law involved in the case, they must either get the court to find a special verdict, which raises the legal propositions, or they must present to the court their propositions of law, and'require the court to rule on them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-9\"><em>\u25a0 \u25a0 \u201c4. </em>That objection to the admissiou or exclusion of evidence, or to such ruling on the propositions of law as the party may ask, must appear by bill of exceptions.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-10\">Here the court found no special verdict, nor does the statement which was filed after judgment even purport to have been submitted to the court, or to set. forth the facts upon which its judgment was founded. In the latter respect, more especially, is the case under consideration clearly distinguishable from <em>Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Tweed, </em>w7here certain parts of the opinion of the court below, which appeared in the record, having been agreed to by the parties as containing the material facts of the case,, were treated here as-facts found by the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-11\">As there is no question of law open to re-examination here, there being no bill of exceptions nor anything upon'which error can be assigned, the judgment must be presumed to be right; and on that ground should be affirmed.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-12\">In this view, it is thought unimportant to argue merits.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b294-9\"> 7 Wallace, 44.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"Af3\"> 9 Id. 426.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"ArqX\"> Avendaro <em>v. </em>Gay, 8 Wallace, 376.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b295-13\"> 9 Wallace, 125.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b295-14\"> James v.

That statement is signed-by the defendant in error and by the counsel for the plaintiff\u2019; and do\u00e9s not profe\u00e1s to.be facts'found by the judge. The writ of error had been sued out nine months before this paper was signed and filed with the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">It needs no argument to show that this court cannot look into such a paper as part of the record, nor make it the foundation of revising the judgment, though both parties consent to it. The case here must be tried on the rulings of the court below on what was before it, and this must appear by the record; and if the facts are to be considered they must appear by bill of exceptions, or by an agreed statement submitted to the court for its judgment, or by the finding of the court under the statute. It cannot be permitted for the parties, by consent to make up a case for this court after}it has passed from the control of the court below. The case of <em>Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Tweed </em>is not a parallel case. There the\u2018statement, such as it was, was made by the judge, and on it he founded his judgment. It was made and filed at the time the judgment was rendered, and, although defective in many respects, there was sufficient in it to present the legal propositions, if the confused character of the paper was waived. This the counsel here desired to do, and the court permitted. We are .all of opinion, therefore, that the paper called a statement of facts must be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">But what judgment must follow ? If the transcript.of the record contained the written agreement of the parties submitting the case to the court, as provided by the act of March 8d, 1865, we should have no difficulty in affirming the judgment. But not only is there.no such paper found, but there is no statement anywhere in the record that the parties did agree, either in writing or otherwise, to submit the case to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The Judiciary Act of 1789, \u00a7 12,- declares that the trial of issues in fact in the Circuit Courts shall, in all suits, except those of equity and of ,admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, be by jury. This provision and that found in the seventh amendment of the Constitution, adopted after the Judiciary Act, namely, \u201c that in suits at law, where the vajtue in coutrqversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved,\u201d constituted the only legislative ru~\u00bf for the Federal courts, except in Louisiana, until the act of 1865. Undoubtedly both the Judiciary Act and the amendment to the Constitution secured the <em>right </em>to either party in a suit at common law to a trial by jury, and we are also of opinion that the statute of 1789 intended to point out this as the mode of trial in' issues of fact in such cases. Numerous decisions, however, had settled that this right to a jury trial might be waived by the parties, and that the judgment of the court in such cases should be valid.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Notwithstanding, however, the number of cases in which the waiver of this right is mentioned, and either expressly or tacitly held, to be no objection to the judgment, it is remarkable that so little is said as to the mode in which this waiver shall be made to appear. In most of the cases it is somewhere in the record stated affirmatively that the parties did waive a jury, or did consent to the trial by the court without a jury. In the case <em>o\u00ed Bank of Columbia </em>v. <em>Okely,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court held that there was an implied waiver of this right when the defendant made his note negotiable at the Bank of Columbia, there being, in the charter of that bank a provision authorizing the collection of such debts by a summary proceeding, which did not admit of,a jury trial. In <em>Hiriart </em>v. <em>Ballon,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where a summary judgment was rendered against a surety in an appeal bond, it was held that the defendant, by be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>coming surety in a court whose rules provided for such summary judgment, had waived liis right to a trial by jury. It seems, therefore, that both by express agreement in open, court, and by implied consent, the right to a jury trial could be waived.* But as was shown in the recent case of <em>Flanders v. Tweed,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this court had held that no review of the decision of the court below could be had of any ruling at the trial where the parties had consented to accept the court, instead of a jury to decide issues of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In this state of the law the act of 1865 was passed. The first two sections are devoted to prescribing the manner in', which grand and petit juries shall be selected and impanelled in criminal trials. The fourth section enacts that issues of fact in civil cases, in any Circuit Court of the United States, may be tried and determined by the court without the intervention of a jury, whenever the parties or their attorneys of record, file a stipulation in writing with <em>the clerk </em>of the court waiving a jury. Tt then proceeds to prescribe the mode of finding the facts, and the effect to be given to such finding,.and provides for a.review of the-case by this court. The manner in which the record is to be prepared for this and the extent of the inquiry in this court . are-specifically pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The question arises on this statute whether this mode of submitting a case to the court without a jui\u2019y was intended to be exclusive of all- other modes, so that if there is no stipulation in writing waiving a jury, there is error, for which the judgment must be reversed. Although the language of the section might admit of that construction, it is not the only one of which it is susceptible. As stated in the case already referred to, of <em>Flanders </em>v. <em>Tweed, </em>the main\u2019 purpose of the act undoubtedly was to enable the parties who were willing to waive a jury to have the case reviewed oh writ of error when tried by the court- alone. This was rendered necessary, as shown by Mr. Justice Nelson in the \u2022 opinion in that case, by the former decisions, based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>idea that in such cases the court did not sit as a court of law, but as <em>quasi </em>arbitrators. To remove this difficulty, the statute provided a mode by which the parties who agreed to waive\u2018a jury should have the benefit of a writ of error to the rulings of the court on questions of law. The language of the section is that the stipulation may be <em>filed with the clerk of the court, </em>which is undoubtedly designed to enable the parties to make agreements in vacation; and it is required to be in writing, to prevent either party demanding a jury unexpectedly at the-trial. In those courts where juries are called from a great distance and detained at a heavy sacrifice, the courts usually give jury trials the preference. The benefit, therefore, of an announcement by which the number of these trials is diminished, and the case placed in an attitude to be taken up at the convenience of the court and the'parties is obvious. We cannot believe that Congress intended to say that the parties shall not, as heretofore, submit their cases to the court unless they do so by a written stipulation, but that it was the intention to enact, that if parties who consent to waive a jury desire to secure the right to a review in the Supreme Court of any question of law arising in the trial, they must first file their written, stipulation, and must,'then ask the court to make a finding of such facts as they deem essential to the review, and ask the ruling of the court on points to which they wish to except. ' If this is not done the parties consenting to waive a jury stand as they did before the statute, concluded by the judgment of the court on all matters submitted to it. This we understand to be the effect of the opinion in <em>Flanders </em>v. <em>Tweed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">But, although a written stipulation, in the Circuit Court is essential to a review in this court, is the presence of the agreement or its copy in the transcript sent here indispensable.? A copy of it should .come up, as observed by Mr. Justice Nelson, and that is the more appropriate evidence of compliance with the statute. Still we are not prepared to say that if it shall affirmatively appear in \"any other part of the record proper, that such - p, writing was made by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>parties, that it will not be sufficient here. If, for instance,' it is stated in the finding of facts by the court, or in the bill, of exceptions, or in the record of the judgment'entry^ that such a stipulation was made in writing, the: record would show that the condition in which a review is allowed existed, and we would not feel at liberty to contradict the record in this respect. In a case where there is no evidence that it was submitted in writing under the statute, but the record shows affirmatively that the parties waived a jury, we hold such evidence of waiver to be sufficient to support the judgment, but not sufficient to- authorize a, review of the rulings of the court at the trial. But the record before us contains no statement that the parties agreed in writing to-submit the case to the court, nor any expi\u2019ess statement that they waived a jury at all. The language of the judgment is that \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">\u201cThis cause came up for trial; J. D. Bouse and Elmer and King for plaintiffs; Gr. L. Bright and Bradford, Lea, and Finney, for defendants; when, after hearing 'the pleadings, evidence, and argument, the court considering the same, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed,\u201d &amp;c.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Is this court at\u2019liberty to infer from the entry a waiver of the right to a jury trial? When we consider the cases already cited, in which such a waiver has-been implied, and that the right to have a jury when a party demands it is so universally known and respected, we think'that it is almost a necessary inference, where a party is present by counsel and goes to .trial before the court without.objection of exception, he has voluntarily waived his right to a jury, and'must be held in this court to the legal consequences of such a waiver.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> But we are not prepared to go further..</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">If the- state of the pleadings presents issues of fact to be tried, and there is nothing to show that the party complaining of the error was present by himself 01; counsel at -the trial, and no jury was called, we think it is error for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>court to try those issues without a jury, because there can be no presumption that the party has waived his legal and constitutional right to have a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">The record before us presents, in the light of the,se views, a case where the parties consented to waive a jury, but did not take the steps necessary to secure the right to a review of the findings of the court as provided by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">There is, therefore, no. error of which we can take cognizance, and the judgment of the Circuit Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Affirmep.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-6\"><em> </em>Bank of Columbia v.
