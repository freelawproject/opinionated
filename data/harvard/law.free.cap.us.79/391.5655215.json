A certificate of such sale was afterwards made out, signed by <em>tioo </em>of the commissioners, dated March 13th, 1865 (the act of th,e 3d. of March, 1865, just above set out, being now in force), and given to the purchasers. It set forth that at a sale made under the act of Congress above noted, held pursuant to notice at Beaufort, in the State of South Carolina, on the 13th of March, 1863, the tract or parcel of land, the title to which was now in controversy, was sold to the United States for the sum of $125, the receipt of which it-acknowledged. The defendants were mere tenants of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-7\">Whether this tax sale was valid and effective to divest the ownership of Mrs. O\u2019Connor, and to vest the property in the United States, was the single subject of contest in the court below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-8\">The declaration in the act was the ordinary one in trespass, <em>guare clausum fregit; </em>with an indorsement that \u201c the action was brought to try title as well as for damages.\u201d The <em>locus in quo </em>was described as \u201c in the town of Beaufort, and county aforesaid, containing eighty feet front, more or less, and in depth running from north to south, down to low-water mark, three hundred feet, more or less; butting and bounded north on Bay Street, south on the river, and east on the lands of the plaintiff\u2019; west on lands of the plaintiff\u2019.\u201d Plea, \u201cNot guilty.\u201d The defence set up was, that the defendants entered and held the property as tenants of the United'States, and that the United States had become owners by virtue of the tax sale already mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-9\">On the trial the plaintiff introduced evidence'tending to show that for many years before the rebellion, she had owned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>the lot described in the declaration, aud owned it when the ' rebellion bl-oke out; that in November, 1861, in consequence of the Federal fleet having arrived off Beaufort, and of her being informed of an order from the commander of the rebel forces, she with nearly all the other inhabitants of Beaufort, except colored persons, left the place; that after leaving Beaufort she resided in Columbia until it was burnt in 1865; that she never saw any advertisement nor received any notice, nor in any way became aware that any tax had ever been placed on her property by the government of the United States, until the close of the rebellion in 1865, when she discovered that her house and lot had been sold, aud was in the possession of strangers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-6\">.The United States gave evidence tending to prove that when the three commisssioners appointed for South Carolina, entered upon their duties at Beaufort, they searched, for records of the titles to lands there, through the town.and parish, and also for the records of the assessment and valuation--of. the lots as the same were enumerated aud'valued under the last assessment and valuation thereof, made under the State of South Carolina previous to the 1st of January-,-1861; that they could not find either the records (.of titles) or the records of the State assessment and valuation, the same having been either destroyed, coucoaled, or lost; that the town and parish of Beaufort were at the time occupied 'by United States soldiers and a few colored people; that none or but fewof the owners of the lands were present, having left the.town prior to the entrance of the United States troops, But that they did find an old assessment-roll of the town of Beaufort and parish of St. Helena, dnd the comptroller-general\u2019s report of the State for the years 1857 or 1858. The old assessment-rolls aud the comptroller-general\u2019s report for the State, in default of better evidence, were used as evidence in making up the judgment of the comriiissioners, although they were very indefinite, giving the' names of the taxpayers and describing the property or land simply as so many \u201c acres;\u201d without locating the same, aud the lots in the town of Beaufort were described only as \u201c town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>lots,\u201d without any other description. The commissioners then proceeded to obtain all the evidence in their power as to the assessment and valuation of the lots of land both in the town of Beaufort and in the parish of St. Helena, and to value and assess the same in their own judgment upon. such evidence. They found au old plat of the town of Beaufort of the date of 1799, by which it appeared that the town had been laid off into lots and blocks. But they found that many ofthe streets described were not opened, and also that additions had been made to some parts of the town, and that these parts were not on the plat. The commissioners finally all resolved that said plat should be used as a basis of description for their assessment-rolls, and ordered a survey of the additions to the town to be made, and thus made a new plat of the town of Beaufort. In the plat thus made by the commissioners the blocks throughout th\u00e9 town were designated by numbers, and the lots in. each block by letters of the alphabet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-6\">The commissioners then proceeded to value the property, using said plat as a basis for description, according to their best judgment, and the best evidence they could obtain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-7\">The defendants gave evidence tending to show that the commissioners had made such advertisement and given such notices, so far as mode, time, and number of advertisement were concerned, as the act of Congress required. But it appeared that in these the description of the lot in controversy was thus made:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-8\">\u201c The following is a description of said lands forfeited as aforesaid, together with the amount of the quota of said tax and penalty charged upon each of said tracts or lots of land respectively :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-9\">Town Lots and Lands in the Parish of St. Helena.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-10\">Lots.

The court, however, overruled the objection, aud admitted the certificate. Being thus in proof, the court rul\u00e9d it defective aud void, because signed but by two commissioners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-6\">The-eourt also instructed the jury, <em>as a matter of pure laxo and expressly taking the consideration of the matter from them, </em>that the advertisement was \u201c not such a notice as the law required.\u201d Having read the 14th section, to the jury, and referring to the advertisement, the court proceeded:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-7\">&lt;fIt docs not give notice, either directly or by implication; that is, inevitable notice, so as to make the owner aware that his particular property had been assessed, and was up&gt; for sale.

But neither directly or indirectly, by necessary implication, is this notice such-as the law requires.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-8\">The court added:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-9\">\u201c A notice published within military lines, is as it were a notice only in a fortified camp.

The proceedings of the commissioners are not according to the course of common law, but a special jurisdiction and authority conferred by statute. It should appear, therefore, upon the face of the proceedings, that all has been done which the law required should be-done. The certificate is thus fatally defective.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-13\">2d. In an action of trespass to try title, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>cannot justify under plea of tlie general issue.

The act of Congress does not contemplate any certificate of purchase when the United States become purchasers. Practically, then, no injury was done to -the defendants below by refusing to receive the certificate, as they could have recovered if their own evidence had not shown that the sale was void, by reason of failure in the tax commissioners to.pursue the requirements of the law in the sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-7\">4th; That the so-called \u201c description,\u201d even if it had been seen a hundred times, could, as a matter of fact, have given no notice to Mrs. O\u2019Connor that it was <em>her </em>property which was to be sold, no one can deny. The commissioners get an old plot of the town, which designated streets, numbers of lots, and names of owners, and, without seeking information from any source, they proceed to survey and .map out the town anew after their own fashion, and by the new plot, incomprehensible to every one but themselves, advertise and sell every lot in Beaufort. This notice would have been no notice to Mrs. O\u2019Connor if she had been on the spot. And if there can be a notice less than none, this was so under <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Nelson</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where it was held i\u2018 that notice to parties within Confederate lines was not obtained by publication within Union lines.\u201d A \u201cdescription,\u201d which the 14th section of the act expressly requires, means something more thau \u201clot E, block 61,\u201d on a plot that no one but the commissioners ever saw. Description is the delineating a thing by a mention of its properties; in describing land, its length, breadth, and situation should be indicated. The property had metes and bounds, and is described by them in the declaration in this case.. The worthlessness of the notice was so gross, so palpable in bur case, that the court assumed it to be a question of law, as perhaps what amounts to a \u201cdescription \u201d truly is.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\n<em>Mr. B.

It is obvious that the ruling was hurtful to the defendants. Had the certificate been admitted it would, by force of the statute, have amounted to <em>primd facie </em>evidence as well of the regularity and validity of the sale as of the title of the purchasers. It would, therefore, have .cast upon the plaintiff, the burden of showing affirmatively that the sale was irregular and invalid, and that the title was not in the United States. And we think it was erroneously excluded. It is true that when an authority is given jointly to several persons they must generally act jointly, or their acts are invalid. This is a general rule for private ageiicies, though it is not universal in its application. But the rule is otherwise when the authority \u00cd3 of a public nature, as it wfis in this case. The commissioners were public agents, clothed with public authority. They were created a board to perform a governmental function, and it is a familiar principle that an authority given to several for public purposes may be executed by \u00e1 majority of their number.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In one of the cases cited in the note<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> it was held that two of three trustees of a school district might issue a warrant for the collection of a tax, and that the presence of the third' trustee at the issuing thereof would be. presumed until the contrail was shown. The authorities cited are enough to show that the certificate of sale was not void or inoperative because signed by onl3T two of the commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>In addition to this there is also the act of Congress of March 3d, 1865,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> in force when this certificate was given, under which, certainly, the validity of the certificate of sale is beyond doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">It has been argued, however, mn behalf of the defendant in error, that inasmuch as the plea was only that of the general issue, the. defendants were not at liberty to set up th\u00e1t the United, States were the owners, and that they entered as tenants or licensees of the United States.' It is doubtless true that a license from the plaintiff, or a justification,under an incorporeal right, or an excuse of the trespass founded on fault of the plaintiff, or an entry by authority of .law, with or without process, must- be pleaded specially to an action of trespass. The reason is that these defences all admit the trespass and the possession of the plaintiff'. But in trespass to real property, a freehold, or mere possessory right in the defendant, may be given in evidence under the general issue, though it is often advisable to plead <em>liberum tenementum,</em><footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> And there is a double reason for this when, as in this case, the action is brought by \u00e1 plaintiff out of possession professedly to try the title. The action has then the nature of an ejectment, the plaintiff, if recovering at all, recovering possession as well as damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">It has been further argued that the act of 1862 does not contemplate a certificate of sale in cases where the United States becomes the purchaser, but we are clearly of opinion that it does as fully as in any other..</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">The second assignment of error is, that the court instructed the jury the advertisement of sale ivas not such a notice as the lew requires. The act of Congress required the board of commissioners to advertise for sale the parcels or lots, the taxes upon which were not paid withirr sixty days after the amount 'of the tax had been fixed, in a newspaper published in,the town, parish, district, or county where the property was situated, and also by posting notices in at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>least three public places iu the town, parish, district, or county, The evidence given at the trial teuded to prove that such advertisement had been made, and that such notices had been posted; nor was this contested. But the court held, and so instructed the jury, that the notice was not such as the lp.w required. The reasons assigned for this ruling were that the advertisement did not state that the whole town of Beaufort was to be sold, and that, being a notice published within military lines, it was like a notice only in a fortified camp, and could not, in fact, be supposed to reach a citizen. We think, however, that neither of these reasons, nor any other not referred to, justified the court in ruling, as a legal conclusion, that-the notice giv'cn in this case was not-such as the law required. Whether the demands of the statute respecting notice of sale had been complied with was a mixed question of law and of fact, and it should have been submitted to the jury. Undoubtedly the advertisement must have been such as to inform persons who read it what property was intended to be exposed for sale. Any description that gave such information was sufficient. Whether the advertisement gave it or not depended not alone upon its contents. It was necessary to compare the description with the property described, and that was the province of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Judgment reversed and a venire de novo awarded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\"> Commonwealth ex rel.
