The information then charged that the defendants, with other persons unknown, usurped and used, without lawful warrant or charter, the franchise Of being the said Northern Railroad Company. It was then prayed that the court might decree that the Northern Railroad Company had remained insolvent for more than one whole year; that it had for more than one year neglected to pay its notes, and. that it had surrendered its franchises and is dissolved; and that it be forever excluded from all corporate rights.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-5\">The answer of the defendants, which one of the courts below characterized as \u201cstuffed with irrelative and redundant matter,\u201d did not deny the preceding facts. It contained, however, this passage:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-6\">\u201c And the defendants further say that at the time of the passage of the above and foregoing act, the said Northern Railroad Company was a company, in law and in fact, an existing railroad company, never having been dissolved, and were and are the owners in fact of said corporate property, and had then and now have the legal title thereto,; and that the <em>legislature had no right or power to authorize the said second mortgage bondholders to form a corporation for and to take the property and effects of this defendant, the Northern Railroad Company, </em>or of said other defendants, the stockholders of said company, <em>\u2022without due process of law.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-7\">After the answer had been filed, the attorney-general moved the court for judgment <em>on the complaint and answer </em>at special term. The defendants resisted the motion, on the ground that they were issues of fact to be tried by a jury.. The court, however, decided that all the material facts averred in the complaint were admitted by the answer; and that, as there were no issues of fact to be determined by the court or jury, judgment, as matter of local practice, could properly be rendered on the complaint and answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-8\">The <em>judgment </em>of the court at special term was:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-9\">\u201c That the Northern Railroad Company has surrendered and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>forfeited the franchises granted by any acts of incorporation, and is hereby dissolved,\u201d &amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-5\">Exception was taken to the decision, \u201c that prior to the passage of the act of March 31st, 1857, the said Northern Bailroad Company had surrendered to the people of this State its franchise of being a corporation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-6\">The decision of the court at general term affirmed the judgment-of forfeiture, but did not found it in any way on the act of 1857.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-7\">The Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> which affirmed this judgment of dissolution and forfeiture, held that the court, at special term, had a right to render judgment on the complaint and answer, as there were no issues of fact to be tried ; that the admitted facts showed. that the company had forfeited its charter; that no sufficient excuse therefor was alleged in the answer'; and that the individual defendants, having acted with knowledge of the previous forfeiture, -were liable to be fined under the New York code.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-8\">To remove this judgment of the Court of Appeals to this court a -writ of error was taken in June, 1870. Such writs are authorized in certain cases by the 25 th section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, already quoted in-the preceding case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-9\">\n<em>Messrs. W. M. Evarts and J. Subley Ashton, in support of the motion:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-10\">The court adjudged that <em>prior </em>to 1857 the company had, on the admitted facts, done and omitted acts amounting in law to a surrender and forfeiture of its franchises to the State, and that by the act of March 31, 1857, the State had <em>accepted </em>this previous surrender of its charter. No question touching the corn stitutionality of the act of 1857 was, therefore, decided by The court- at special term. Nothing whatever was determined about that act, except incidentally that it was in effect an acceptance by the people of a previous surrender of its charter by the company, in virtue and by operation of the general law of the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-11\">This appears:</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-12\">1. By the terms of the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-13\">2. By the character of the exception.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The judgment was affirmed at general term aud in the Court of Appeals. We have the opinion of this latter court in the official State reports. But it is not based on the constitutionality of\u201etke act of 1857. That act did not purport to dissolve the company, nor did any of the courts treat it as so doing. The company had by its own doings, and pi-evious to the passage of that act, worked a surrender of its charter. It had done so under other and general laws. The fact that the act is inserted in' the answer, along with other \u201cirrelative and redundant\u2019\u2019 matter, don\u2019t help the case, in this court, of the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b404-5\">Mr. <em>G. Gushing, contra:</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-6\">The point was distinctly presented to the State court, in the pleadings on which of course-the judgment is given, that the legislature \u201chad no-right or power\u201d to pass the act of March 31,1857. The'point thus appeared \u201c on the face of the record.\u201d The effect of the objection was to raise the question that the act was in violation of the clause of the Constitution which pro- . hibits a Slate from passing any \u201claw impairing the obligation of contracts.\u201d We do not assert that the question was decided by the State court in <em>ipsissimis verbis, </em>but we submit i-t was necessarily decided in order to induce the judgment rendered.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-11\"> Banks <em>&amp; </em>Brother\u2019s ed., vol. 2, p. 600.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"AzV\"> Ib., sec. 441.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b401-14\"> Ib., sec. 442.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"\u00a7\">\n<p id=\"AqD\"><em> </em>Ib., sec. 444.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-14\"> The People <em>v. </em>Northern Railroad Company, <em>42 </em>New York, 227.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-6\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b404-7\">Mr. Justice MILLER</author>\n<p id=\"Asb\">delivered tile opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The principles announced in the preceding case of <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Exchange Bank </em>govern the present one.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">We are unable to see that the judgment of the State court, declaring the dissolution of the Northern Railroad Company, rested in any manner on the act of the New York legislature of March, 1857. It is true that that company, the plaintiff in error in the case, both in the pleading which it filed and in argument, here assails that statute as taking property without due process of law, and impairing the obligation of contracts; but, as the defendant in error claims nothing under that statute, and as the validity or invalidity of that statute is in no way involved in the judgment of dissolution rendered by the State court, there is no question here of which this court has jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">Writ dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
