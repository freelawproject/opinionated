Mason and L. B. Duke brought suit in the court below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>against Jules Germain to recover a balance due for work aud materials furnished in building a house, and to enforce \u2022a mechanic\u2019s lieu against the house and the lot on which it wa\u00a7 built for the debt. One C. L. Nahler, A. J. Navis, and eighteen other persons, who the petition stated \u201c had or claimed to have some interest, claim, or lien on the incumbered.premises,\u201d were made defendants, but the petition alleged that their interest, claim, or lien, if any, had accrued subsequently to that of the plaintiffs; and it prayed \u201cfor judgment <em>against the said Jules Germain in the sum </em>o/'$6651,\u201d and that it be adjudged that the defendants, C. L. Nahler, A. J. Navis, and the eighteen others named, and all persons claiming under them subsequently to the commencement of the action, be barred and foreclosed of all right, claim, lieu, &amp;c., in, on, or to- the incumbered premises, \u201cand that the premises be decreed to be sold,\u201d &amp;c. The court decided that the-lien of the plaintiffs was paramount to that of all other persons, and gave judgment against Germain <em>in personam </em>for the debt, with an order that if it could not otherwise be'made out of him, the real estate on which the lien was claimed should be sold, and out of the proceeds of the sale the debt of the plaintiffs should be first paid. To this judgment Germain alone sued out a writ of error. The writ purported to be taken\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-6\">\u201c Because in the records aud proceedings, as also in the rendition of fhe judgment of a plea between J.

Cavazos,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> and it is there said that they rest upon the principle that all the parties to the original judgment must, when it is a <em>joint </em>judgment, be brought before this court, and that this is not done by a writ which does not give their names.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">In the case before us the writ is sued out by Germain alone, who is the only party mentioned as damaged by the alleged error of the court, and who alone gives the appeal' bond. If, therefore, Germain can bring the writ without joiuing other parties as plaintiffs in error, the writ is not defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">We have examined the record \u2014 a very confused one \u2014 but from it we gather enough to satisfy us that the judgment of which Germain complains is such a separate judgment against him as 'authorizes him to ask a review of it here without joining his co-defendants in the court below, who have not thought proper to disturb the judgment-<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">The lien creditors, co-defendants with Germain, have not sought to reverse the judgment; but Germain, who has a separate, distinct, personal judgment against him for money, in which the other defendants have no interest, has a right, we think, to prosecute a writ of error in his own name without joining them.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Motion overruled.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"A4K\"> 6 Wallace, 355</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b277-14\"> Masterson <em>v. </em>Herndon, 10 Wallace, 416.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
