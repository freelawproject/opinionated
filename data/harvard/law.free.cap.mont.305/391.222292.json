(Debcon), appeals the Order entered by the Seventeenth Judicial District Court, Valley County, that granted summary judgment in favor of Respondents City of Glasgow and Delta Engineering, Inc. (hereinafter the City and Delta, respectively), and denied Debcon\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and motion to amend its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">\u00b63 Debcon raises two broad issues, which we have recast as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-11\">1. In granting summary judgment in favor of Delta, did the District Court correctly conclude that Delta owed no duty of care to Debcon in fulfilling its contractual obligation to the City to make recommendations concerning the lowest responsible bid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-12\">2. Did the District Court correctly conclude that as a matter of law Debcon could not assert a bad faith claim against Delta, and therefore the denial of Debcon\u2019s motion to amend its complaint was proper?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">\u00b64 In January of 1997, the City contracted with Delta, a Great Falls engineering firm, to prepare plans, specifications, and bid documents for a municipal improvement project known as the Combined Sewer Separation Project, Phase I, Southside (hereinafter the Project). Delta also agreed to perform design engineering, construction inspection, and administration work on the Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-15\">\u00b65 Under Article 1, section 3.0, of the contract, Delta agreed to perform \u201cbidding phase services.\u201d This included providing \u201caward recommendations.\u201d Delta also agreed to \u201cattend the bid opening\u201d and \u201creview bid results.\u201d Thus, Delta produced for dissemination a document entitled \u201cContract Documents and Specifications for Southside Stormwater Collection System, Glasgow, MT\u201d in June of 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-16\">\u00b66 Under section 1.1, the bid specification document provided that the \u201cright is reserved to reject any or all bids, to waive any defect or informality in any bid therein, and to accept the bid or bids which the Council feels is in the best interest of the City.\u201d Under section 1.2, instruction number 11, the document provided that \u201c[t]he Contract will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>be awarded to the lowest responsible Bidder\u201d and the lowest responsible Bidder \u201cshall be the Contractor whose Bid is the lowest for each individual Bid Schedule.\u201d Under instruction 11(c), however, the document provided once again that the \u201cOwner,\u201d meaning the City, reserved \u201cthe right to reject any or all Bids or to waive any informality or technicality in any Bids received.\u201d The instructions further provided that the \u201cContract will be awarded in conformance with the laws of the State of Montana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b67 Under instruction 11(e), the document provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">The Owner may make such investigations as it deems necessary to determine the ability of the Bidder to perform the work, and the Bidder shall furnish to the Owner all such information and data for this purpose as the Owner may request. The Owner reserves the right to reject any Bid if the evidence submitted by, or investigation of, such Bidder fails to satisfy the Owner that such Bidder is properly qualified to carry out the obligations of the Agreement and complete the work contemplated therein. The ability of a Bidder to obtain a Performance Bond and/or Bid Bond shall not be regarded as the sole test of such Bidder\u2019s competency or responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The bid sheet that Debcon filled out and submitted likewise included the provision that \u201cBidder understands that the Owner reserves the right to reject any or all bids and to waive any informalities in the bidding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">\u00b68 Bids were accepted and opened on the same day, July 7,1997. The Appellant Debcon\u2019s bid of $1,486,504 was by far the lowest. Debcon is a Montana corporation located in Lewistown, Montana. The undisputed facts show that Debcon\u2019s bid was 15 percent lower than the other six bids, and that the other bids were within one percent of each other, and were consistent with Delta\u2019s pre-bid estimate of $1,765,561.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqm\">\u00b69 According to an affidavit submitted by John Juras, a Delta employee and licensed professional engineer, two mathematical errors were discovered in Debcon\u2019s bid, both in excess of $100,000. It is undisputed that once corrected, Debcon\u2019s bid-$l,554,945-was still lower than the closest bid. According to Juras, who was assigned as project engineer for the project, \u201c[tjhese two very large mathematical errors increased my concern about the advisability of accepting Debcon\u2019s bid.\u201d Juras further attested that because Delta\u2019s contract called for him to provide a contract award recommendation, \u201cI made some telephone calls to learn what I could about Debcon, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">\u00b610 According to Juras\u2019s affidavit, he learned that Debcon might be \u201cover-extended\u201d with other projects and that the company may be difficult to work with and \u201cquick to file lawsuits.\u201d Other sources of information-i.e., other parties that had dealt with Debcon in the past-offered for the most part neutral feedback. Additionally, Juras stated that he was concerned that the low bid price might lead to the contractor \u201closing money, cutting corners, and other problems.\u201d Juras <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>also attested to his observations concerning Debcon\u2019s vice president, who apparently filled out the bid documents just moments before submitting them, and did not ask any questions at a bidders conference held in June, which led Juras to believe that Debcon was \u201cinadequately prepared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\u00b611 Consequently, Juras on behalf of Delta recommended to the Glasgow City Council that Debcon\u2019s bid was not in its best interest, and that it should accept the next lowest bid. The City Council, in turn, issued Resolution No. 1553, which listed the seven submitted bids. The bid attributed to Debcon was the uncorrected bid of $1,486,504. The Resolution provided that \u201cthe mistakes in Debcon\u2019s bid are deemed to be material\u201d and \u201cthe Engineer has recommended that the contract be awarded to Northern Line Layers, Inc. as the lowest responsible bid.\u201d The Resolution resolved that \u201cthe bid of Debcon, Inc. is rejected because it contains errors which are both significant and material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A_a\">\u00b612 Debcon brought suit against the City and Delta on December 4, 1997, alleging negligence in the award of the construction contract. On May 7, 1999, Debcon sought to amend its complaint. Again, Debcon claimed that the City and Delta had negligently failed to follow \u201ctheir own bid specifications.\u201d Debcon further claimed, under a second count, that Delta\u2019s recommendations to the City included misrepresentations. Apparently, Count II was a claim that Delta acted in bad faith in the \u201ccircumstances surrounding the rejection of Debcon\u2019s low bid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\u00b613 Delta moved for summary judgment on May 5, 1999. In part, Delta claimed that it owed no duty of care to Debcon, as a stranger to the contract between Delta and the City, regarding any of its recommendations. Debcon moved for summary judgment on May 17.</p>\n<p id=\"Afqv\">\u00b614 Following a hearing, the District Court determined, as a matter of law, that Debcon lacked standing to assert \u00e1 duty of care owed to it by the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b615 The District Court then concluded that Debcon\u2019s negligence claim against Delta must fail as a matter of law as well. The court ruled that \u201c[a]n essential element for asserting negligence as a claim of relief is existence of a duty flowing from the alleged wrongdoer to the claimant.\u201d The court determined that Delta owed no duty of care to Debcon under the circumstances. \u201cDelta is an independent project engineer whose obligations are by contract with [the City of Glasgow].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AV9\">\u00b616 Further, the court observed that, under this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating Serv., Inc. v. HEM Assoc. </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 494, 878 P.2d 248, where this Court relied on Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552, there was no allegation that Delta\u2019s recommendations to the City contained false information concerning Debcon. The court further observed that Debcon had not alleged that Delta knew or should have foreseen that its actions would be relied upon by Debcon. Thus, the court concluded that the duty of care established in <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating </em>concerning project engineers' obligations to third parties did not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\u00b617 Finally, the court determined that because Debcon\u2019s amended complaint asserting bad faith asserted \u201cno special relationship\u201d between itself and Delta, \u201cthere can be no bad faith claim against Delta.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u00b618 Debcon appeals from that part of the order that granted summary judgment in favor of Delta. Debcon does not appeal the summary judgment granted in favor of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\u00b619 This Court reviews an order granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>using the same Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., criteria applied by the district court. <em>See Spinier v. Allen, </em>1999 MT 160, \u00b6 14, 295 Mont. 139, \u00b6 14, 983 P.2d 348, \u00b6 14. This Court looks to the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and affidavits to determine the existence or nonexistence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Erker v. Kester, </em>1999 MT 231, \u00b6 17, 296 Mont. 123, \u00b6 17, 988 P.2d 1221, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"AU92\">\u00b620 When we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law, our standard of review is plenary and we must determine whether the court's conclusions are correct as a matter of law. <em>See Lane v. Farmers Union Ins., </em>1999 MT 252, \u00b6 15, 296 Mont. 267, \u00b6 15, 989 P.2d 309, \u00b6 15 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">\u00b621 Ordinarily, summary judgment is not granted in causes grounded in negligence claims due to the requisite finding that no material facts remain in dispute. <em>See Dillard v. Doe </em>(1992), 251 Mont. 379, 382, 824 P.2d 1016, 1018 (citations omitted). However, if a party seeking summary judgment establishes the absence of a genuine issue of material fact as to any one of the elements constituting the cause of action, and the opposing party fails to come forward with proof establishing the existence of a- genuine issue as to that element, summary judgment is proper. <em>See White v. Murdock </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 386, 389-90, 877 P.2d 474, 476. Any inferences to be drawn from the factual record, however, must be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>See Boylan v. Van Dyke </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 259, 266, 806 P.2d 1024, 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">\u00b622 Further, we may affirm a district court decision which is correct regardless of the district court\u2019s reasoning in reaching its decision. <em>See, e.g., Clark v. Eagle Systems, Inc. </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 279, 287-88, 927 P.2d 995, 1000 (affirming summary judgment on tortious interference and emotional distress).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">\u00b623 Debcon does not challenge any of the District Court\u2019s decisions pertaining to the City. Rather, both issues raised focus squarely on the alleged negligent or bad faith conduct of Delta. With this in mind, we proceed to the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>\n<em>Issue 1.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">\n<em>In granting summary judgment in favor of Delta, did the District Court correctly conclude that Delta owed no duty of care to Debcon in fulfilling its contractual obligation to the City to make recommendations concerning the lowest responsible bid?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\u00b624 The primary focus of our inquiry here is the first question of negligence: duty. <em>See Dobrocke v. City of Columbia Falls, </em>2000 MT 179, \u00b6 28, 300 Mont. 348, \u00b6 28, 8 P.3d 71, \u00b6 28 (citations omitted). Debcon claims that under \u201csettled\u201d Montana law, an engineering firm owes a duty of ordinary care to competitive public bidders to present their bids correctly to the owner of the project in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\u00b625 Debcon\u2019s negligence claim, as stated in its complaint, alleges that Delta negligently failed to follow and apply the provisions found in the City\u2019s bid specifications, and \u201cnegligently used the mathematical error by Debcon, Inc., to disqualify them from receiving the contract for this project.\u201d Debcon alleges that the bid specifications promulgated by Delta on behalf of the City required Delta to correct Debcon\u2019s admitted mathematical errors, and submit a corrected bid to the City. In turn, Debcon expansively argues on appeal that Delta not only negligently handled Debcon\u2019s mathematical errors, but also negligently provided a recommendation to the City that Debcon\u2019s bid should be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"AJf\">\u00b626 Thus, according to Debcon, Delta breached a duty of care owed to Debcon as a bidder for a public works construction project. As a result, Debcon argues that Delta may be found liable to Debcon for its lost profits of $200,000 and other damages caused by Delta\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"A731\">\u00b627 Delta contends that it owed a duty only to the City in its performance of the contract to evaluate the submitted bids and make a recommendation as to which contractor was the \u201clowest responsible bidder.\u201d Delta argues that it owed no duty to Debcon, as a stranger to that contract, and therefore Debcon cannot assert a claim for negligence as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">\u00b628 We agree with Debcon that the law concerning the imposition of a duty under these circumstances is, indeed, well-settled in Montana. We agree with Delta, however, that Debcon has failed to present the well-settled controlling law for our adjudication of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">\u00b629  As acknowledged by the District Court and the parties here, the existence of a legal duty in any given case is a question of law for the court to decide. <em>See Dobrocke, </em>\u00b6 28; <em>Hatch v. State Dept. of Highways </em>(1994), 269 Mont. 188, 195, 887 P.2d 729, 733 (citation omitted). Absent a duty, no breach of duty can be established and no negligence action can be maintained. <em>See Hatch, </em>269 Mont. at 195, 887 P.2d at 734 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">\u00b630 The District Court concluded that in Montana, \u201can unsuccessful bidder lacks standing to bring a negligence claim for failure to obtain the award of a public works contract.\u201d As authority, the court relied on <em>Baker v. State </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 235, 707 P.2d 20. As to any duty owed by Delta in particular, the court determined that Debcon\u2019s negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>claim against Delta \u201calso must fail as a matter of law\u201d and Delta \u201chas no duty to Debcon.\u201d The court reasoned that because Debcon cannot assert that such a duty exists as to the City, under <em>Baker, </em>then \u201cDebcon cannot assert then that such duty exists with Delta when there is no underlying right to assert this duty against City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">\u00b631 Generally, we agree with the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"Aut\">\u00b632 In contracting with the City to fulfill, essentially, the same function as provided by state law that would otherwise be performed by the City itself, it is fundamental that the same legal standards apply to Delta\u2019s contractual performance. The contract between the City and Delta provided that \u201call applicable federal and state statutes and regulations are incorporated into this Contract by this reference and are binding upon the ENGINEER.\u201d Further, the specifications presented to bidders expressly provided that the contract would be awarded \u201cin conformance with the laws of the State of Montana.\u201d <em>See generally </em>\u00a7 7-5-4301(1), MCA (providing that a city or town council has the power to \u201cmake any and all contracts necessary to carry into effect the powers granted by this code and to provide for the manner of executing the same\u201d); \u00a7 1-3-204, MCA (stating general maxim that a law established for a public reason cannot be contravened by a private agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">\u00b633 Accordingly, we conclude that should the City owe hopeful public works contract bidders a duty of care in the competitive bidding process provided by state law, or otherwise at common law, then Delta would owe bidders this same duty in fulfilling its contractual obligations to assist the City in assessing and awarding a public works contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u00b634 Thus, we initially observe that Debcon chose to go far afield in combing our case law in hopes of crafting an applicable common law duty of care when it could have-or, rather, should have-looked no farther than the clear line of authority that has addressed public works contracts for more than a century in Montana, and to which the District Court alluded. In this light, we further observe that Debcon\u2019s argument is largely premised on the fallacy that the lowest monetary bidder necessarily must be awarded such a contract as the \u201clowest responsible bidder.\u201d This fallacy is clearly contradicted by controlling statutes, case law, as well as the bid documents themselves, as revealed by the following analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\u00b635 This particular area of the law was addressed by this Court not long after the governing legislation, which is noticeably absent from Appellant\u2019s brief, was codified in 1907. Under what is now \u00a7 7-5-4302, MCA (originally codified in 1907 under \u00a7 3278, Rev.C; and then under \u00a7 5070, RCM, and \u00a7 11-1202, RCM), all contracts awarded by local governments (cities and towns) for construction, repair, or maintenance in excess of $25,000 \u201cmust be let to the lowest responsible bidder after advertisement for bids.\u201d Further, a city council \u201cmay reject any bids and readvertise as provided in this section.\u201d Although often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>amended, particularly as to the dollar amount, the foregoing statutory rules have not changed. Accordingly, the line of authority commencing with our decision in <em>O\u2019Brien v. Drinkenberg </em>(1910), 41 Mont. 538, 111 P. 137, has produced a set of legal principles that will guide our decision here today-although they do not appear in Debcon\u2019s brief to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">\u00b636 Notably, the aggrieved party in <em>O\u2019Brien </em>was a taxpayer who sought an injunction to restrain the town of Hamilton from constructing paved sidewalks in place of board sidewalks. This Court declared that the \u201cmanifest purpose in requiring the contract be let to the lowest responsible bidder is to protect the state against imposition and extortion.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>41 Mont. at 549, 111 P. at 141. In reversing the judgment of the district court, and ordering dismissal of the plaintiffs complaint, this Court concluded that \u201cto successfully attack such proceeding, plaintiff would have to show that the contract was not let to the lowest responsible bidder, that there was not any opportunity afforded for competitive bidding, or that there was collusion or bad faith on the part of the council, or such gross mistake as to preclude the exercise of sound judgment, and in this he failed.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>41 Mont. at 550, 111 P. at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u00b637 In 1912, in an action for mandamus to compel a county board to rescind and set aside a contract and award it to the actual lowest monetary bidder, this Court declared that the provision of law for \u201cletting contracts of this character to the lowest bidder is for the benefit of the public, and does not confer any right upon the lowest bidder as such.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Stuewe v. Hindson </em>(1912), 44 Mont. 429, 437-38, 120 P. 485, 487 (stating that the only standing which Stuewe had in the courts in this proceeding was as a taxpayer, and not as an unsuccessful bidder, in action where contract \u201cfor the care of the poor, sick, and infirm of the county\u201d went to the highest monetary bidder). <em>See also Ford v. City of Great Falls </em>(1912), 46 Mont. 292, 309, 127 P. 1004, 1009 (stating that in an action for an injunction brought by a taxpayer the statutory provision requiring competitive bidding is \u201cdesigned to prevent favoritism and to secure to the public the best possible return for the expenditure of the funds\u201d); <em>Cooper v. City of Bozeman </em>(1917), 54 Mont. 277, 169 P. 801 (action brought by taxpayer for injunction to restrain the city of Bozeman from drawing warrants or levying taxes to pay for certain improvements); <em>Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. City of Havre </em>(1939), 109 Mont. 164, 94 P.2d 660 (action for injunction brought by taxpayer).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u00b638 In 1941, in a fairly lengthy discussion, this Court again emphasized that the public works statute requiring that contracts be \u201clet to the lowest responsible bidder\u201d was enacted \u201cfor the protection of public interests and must be complied with by the municipal authorities for the benefit of the public.\u201d <em>Koich v. Cvar </em>(1941), 111 Mont. 463, 465, 110 P.2d 964, 965. In <em>Koich, </em>a taxpayer sought to enjoin the East Helena city council from proceeding with the execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>of a contract, claiming that the purchase of fire fighting equipment did not go to the actual lowest bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\u00b639 This Court declared that it was settled law that the phrase \u201clowest responsible bidder\u201ddoes not merely mean the lowest bidder whose pecuniary ability to perform the contract is deemed the best, but the bidder who is \u201cmost likely in regard to skill, ability and integrity to do faithful, conscientious work, and promptly fulfill the contract according to its letter and spirit.\u201d <em>Koich, 111 </em>Mont. at 466, 110 P.2d at 965 (citations omitted). <em>See also State ex rel. Eaves v. Rickards </em>(1895), 16 Mont. 145, 151-52, 40 P. 210, 212 (in addressing state publishing contract that statute required must go to \u201clowest responsible bidder,\u201d the Court determined that the term \u201cresponsible\u201d did not refer to pecuniary ability only and included \u201cjudgment, skill, ability, capacity, and integrity;\u201d and, therefore, contract need not go to the lowest bidder who tendered a sufficient bond).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b640 This Court further declared in <em>Koich </em>that in exercising its discretion to select the lowest responsible bidder, \u201cthe officers in whom the power is vested must determine the fact, and such determination cannot be set aside unless the action of the tribunal is arbitrary, oppressive or fraudulent.\u201d <em>Koich, 111 </em>Mont, at 466, 110 P.2d at 965 (citations omitted). Ultimately, we concluded that in \u201cthe absence of any showing of bad faith, fraud, or corruption, we cannot say, as a matter of law, that the city council abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Koich, </em>111 Mont, at 470-71, 110 P.2d at 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u00b641 In 1973, this Court again recognized the rule that \u201can unsuccessful bidder has no standing in mandamus <em>or otherwise </em>to control the discretion of the city council in awarding a contract to the lowest responsible bidder.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Sletten Const. Co. v. City of Great Falls </em>(1973), 163 Mont. 307, 516 P.2d 1149 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"AZR\">\u00b642 The statutes at issue in <em>Baker v. State </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 235, 707 P.2d 20, which is the decision relied on by the District Court here, were those under Title 18, which, similar to \u00a7 7-5-4302, MCA, govern the bid process of State agencies. Under \u00a7 18-2-103(l)(c), MCA, for example, construction contracts with the State must be awarded to the \u201clowest qualified bidder considering conformity with specifications and terms and reasonableness of the bid amount.\u201d More generally, under \u00a7 18-1-102(1), MCA, a State agency must award construction contracts to the \u201clowest responsible bidder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\u00b643 Unlike the foregoing cases, however, the \u201cdisappointed bidder,\u201d Baker Construction, sought to have not only the contract awarded to its competitor declared illegal, and in turn have the contract awarded to it as the actual \u201clowest responsible bidder,\u201d it also sought recovery of lost profits, bidding costs, litigation costs and attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Baker, </em>218 Mont. at 237, 707 P.2d at 22. After reciting the rule that standing is afforded only to taxpayers, not unsuccessful bidders, this Court determined that \u201cBaker failed to allege ... standing as a taxpayer.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>218 Mont. at 240, 707 P.2d 23. We also relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number><em>Koich </em>for the proposition that even had standing been established, \u201cin the absence of any showing of bad faith, fraud, or corruption of the Department, the exercise of discretion will not be disturbed.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>218 Mont. at 240, 707 P.2d 24. This Court also observed that the construction company was barred from relief as a taxpayer with standing due to its own laches-meaning Baker had waited until the contract had been awarded to another party, which had commenced performance. <em>See also Heritage Comm. Contractors, Inc. v. City of Helena </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 90, 899 P.2d 1076 (concluding that Appellant, in seeking damages, had no standing to object to City\u2019s discretionary ruling and had presented no evidence that City\u2019s decision was made in bad faith).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">\u00b644  In synthesizing and gleaning the rules from the foregoing, we observe that under the facts here, a claim for relief accrues under the following conditions: (1) the plaintiff must timely assert its claim as an aggrieved taxpayer; (2) the claim must seek a remedy-such as an injunction, a writ of mandamus, or a declaratory judgment-that will protect the rights of the aggrieved taxpayer from the potential harm that will occur; and (3) the plaintiff must then show that the process by which the public works contract was awarded resulted from an abuse of discretion-i.e., the municipality\u2019s discretionary decision was tainted by an act of bad faith, fraud, corruption, or was otherwise arbitrary in some manner. This latter showing naturally flows to parties in contractual privity with the municipality, such as Delta in the matter at bar, that perform services associated with the bidding process. Delta is correct, of course, that it owed a duty to the City to exercise ordinary professional skill and competence in fulfilling its contractual obligations. We conclude, however, that Delta also owed a duty of care to the taxpayers pursuant to the foregoing-a duty which its argument failed to recognize.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b645 As our analysis of this legal issue indicates, we are by no means breaking new common law ground in this matter. Our decision here, in fact, accords with a majority of jurisdictions that have ruled on the issue and have not allowed an aggrieved low bidder to recover lost profits or other expectancy damages under a negligence theory. <em>See, e.g., City of Scottsdale v. Deem </em>(Ariz.Ct.App. 1976), 556 P.2d 328, 330; <em>Rubino v. Lolli </em>(Cal.Ct.App. 1970), 89 Cal.Rptr. 320, 321-22; <em>L &amp; M Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Golden </em>(Colo.Ct.App. 1993), 852 P.2d 1337, 1339; <em>Sutter Bros. Constr. Co., Inc. v. City of Leavenworth </em>(Kan. 1985), 708 P.2d 190, 195-96; <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Clark County </em>(Nev. 1978), 575 P.2d 1332, 1333-34; <em>Becker Elec., Inc. v. City of Bismarck </em>(N.D. 1991), 469N.W.2d <em>159, 160; Ralph L. Wadsworth Const. Co., Inc. v. Salt Lake County </em>(Utah 1991), 818 P.2d 600, 602; <em>Mottner v. Town of Mercer Island </em>(Wash. 1969), 452 P.2d 750, 752-53. <em>See also </em>65 A.L.R.4th 93, <em>Public Contracts: Low Bidder\u2019s Monetary Relief Against State or Local Agency for Nonaward of Contract </em>(1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>\u00b646 Therefore, in light of the foregoing, we conclude that Debcon\u2019s contention that a new duty of care should be constructed from whole cloth pursuant to the general principles set forth in <em>Estate of Strever v. Cline </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 165, 924 P.2d 666, cannot withstand the overwhelming weight of authority contrary to its position. <em>See Estate of Strever, </em>278 Mont. at 173, 924 P.2d at 670 (providing that the existence of a duty of care depends upon the foreseeability of the risk and upon a weighing of policy considerations for and against the imposition of liability, and setting forth a four-part standard) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u00b647 Accordingly, we conclude that the rights and remedies of parties involved in bids for public works contracts have been thoroughly resolved, as a matter of law, by this Court-and, notably, have not been substantively addressed let alone distinguished by Debcon here. In-particular, Debcon\u2019s argument that the tax paying public would somehow benefit by permitting individual claims for lost profit damages every time a bidder on a public works contract has cause to believe a negligent or nefarious mistake was made in selecting the \u201clowest responsible bidder\u201d cannot be sustained under the policies established in <em>O\u2019Brien </em>and its progeny. Because such damages benefit only the interest of an individual bidder, an award of damages for lost profits in such instances is contrary to the very public interest that the competitive bidding laws were designed to protect. <em>See State ex rel. Stuewe, </em>44 Mont. at 437-38, 120 P. at <em>487; Baker, </em>218 Mont. at 240, 707 P.2d 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b648  What this cause amounts to, therefore, is a claim for relief upon which relief cannot, as a matter of law, be granted. We hold therefore that the District Court correctly determined that, under the specific facts here, Delta, serving as a project engineer for the City, did not owe Debcon, as a failed bidder, a duty of care in its handling of the public works contract bidding process under the theory of negligence pursued throughout the litigation of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u00b649 Debcon also claims that the District Court erred, as a matter of law, in relying on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating Serv., Inc. v. HEM Assoc. </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 494, 878 P.2d 248. Debcon claims, in fact, that our decision in <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating </em>favors its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">\u00b650 The District Court determined that the only duty of care that. could be applied to such circumstances is a version of negligent misrepresentation addressed by this Court in <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating. </em>The court concluded, however, that the facts presented did not meet the <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating </em>criteria for establishing that Delta owed a duty of. care to Debcon in its handling of the bid process.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">\u00b651 On the whole, we agree with Delta that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating Serv., Inc. v. HEM </em>Assoc. is inapposite to the issue presented here. The duty discussed in that case, as derived from the Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 552 (information negligently supplied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>for the guidance of others), may apply where a bidding party is awarded a contract. In turn, the successful bidding party fails to sufficiently perform under the contract specifications established by a project engineer or architect, which leads, generally, to the party suffering demonstrable pecuniary damages. The aggrieved contractor may look to false information \u201cnegligently\u201d supplied in the contract specifications, although the party was not in privity with the alleged negligent party. Thus, the contractor alleges that but for the project engineer\u2019s or architect\u2019s negligence in providing incorrect information in the bid specifications, it would not have failed in its performance under its contract, and in turn would not have been damaged. <em>See generally Jim\u2019s Excavating, </em>265 Mont. at 504-505, 878 P.2d at 254-55. \u00b652 Clearly, the foregoing is distinguishable from the claim here. Debcon was not awarded the contract, it therefore suffered no damages as a result of its failed performance that could be attributed to any reliance on any information negligently supplied by Delta. The District Court was therefore correct in its determination that our decision in <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating </em>did not serve to impose a duty of care on Delta that was owed to Debcon as a failed bidder for a public works construction contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b653 Finally, in light of the foregoing conclusions reached under this issue, we need not address Delta\u2019s claim that its recommendations to the City were privileged, and therefore Delta should be exempt from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\n<em>Issue 2.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\n<em>Did the District Court correctly conclude that as a matter of law Debcon could not assert a bad faith claim against Delta, and therefore the denial ofDebcon\u2019s motion to amend its complaint was proper?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">\u00b654 The District Court addressed and rejected the bad faith claim that Debcon attempted to include in its May 7, 1999 amended complaint. Although the District Court observed that the proposed amended complaint was filed \u201cwell beyond the [March 16, 1999] scheduling deadline for amending,\u201d the court nevertheless addressed the issue of bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">\u00b655 We agree with Delta that the motion to amend was untimely, but nevertheless will address the legal conclusion reached by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">\u00b656 In correctly determining that Debcon had not established a necessary \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Delta, the court misconstrued the rule set forth by this Court in <em>Story v. City of Bozeman </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 436, 791 P.2d 767. In that decision we declared that \u201cthe Uniform Commercial Code model should be extended to cover all <em>contracts </em>and that the bad faith tort should be used only when the parties have a special relationship.\u201d <em>Story, </em>242 Mont. at 450, 791 P.2d at 775 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>\u00b657 Generally, the tort of bad faith arises only between contracting parties, and is nothing more than an implied term in all contracts-that is, to act in good faith and deal fairly in the performance of the contract. For example, one of the essential elements of the necessary \u201cspecial relationship\u201d is that \u201cthe <em>contract </em>must be such that the parties are in inherently unequal bargaining positions.\u201d <em>Simmons Oil Corp. v. Holly Corp. </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 79, 89-90, 852 P.2d 523, 529 (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>\u00a7 28-1-211, MCA (the conduct required by the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is \u201chonesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\u00b658 The only exception to the foregoing rule is where there is an express statutory provision providing for a bad faith claim. <em>See Grenz v. Medical Management Northwest, Inc. </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 58, 63, 817 P.2d 1151, 1155 (stating that absent a specific statutory provision providing for a bad faith claim, or a contract between the parties involving a special relationship as described in <em>Story, </em>\u201cno cause of action will lie\u201d). <em>See also Brewington v. Employers Fire Ins. Co., </em>1999 MT 312, \u00b6 19, 297 Mont. 243, \u00b6 19, 992 P.2d 237, \u00b6 19 (holding that a third-party claimant was not prohibited from pleading the common law tort of bad faith against a workers compensation insurer, pursuant to \u201cgood faith\u201d requirement set forth under \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA, in conjunction with \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u00b659  The District Court misstated, therefore, that in order to sustain a claim of bad faith, Debcon must first establish that it enjoyed a special relationship with Delta. Rather, the District Court should have simply declared that in the absence of contract or an express statutory provision, the claim of bad faith does not lie. It is undisputed that Debcon did not enjoy contractual privity with Delta. Further, Debcon has failed to set forth an express statutory provision that would sustain a bad faith claim \u2014 for a good reason. A statutory provision applicable to the parties and the factual circumstances here simply does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\u00b660 Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s order denying Debcon\u2019s motion to amend is affirmed and the order granting summary judgment in favor of Delta and denying Debcon\u2019s motion for summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b429-7\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, LEAPHART and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
