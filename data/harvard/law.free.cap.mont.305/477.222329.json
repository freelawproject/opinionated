Miller appealed the Justice Court judgment against her to the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Carbon County, which dismissed the appeal. Miller appeals and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-23\">\u00b62 The issue is whether the District Court erred in dismissing Miller\u2019s appeal from the Justice Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-24\">\u00b63 On June 4, 1997, Miller entered into a one-year, $600 per month residential lease for a home in Red Lodge, Montana, with Red Lodging, operated by Steve Burke, which acted as agent for the landlord. In November of 1997, however, Miller contacted Red Lodging and advised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>that she wished to relocate to a larger home. On December 3, 1997, Red Lodging and Miller entered into a written lease agreement for another house in Red Lodge. They verbally agreed that Red Lodging would use its best efforts to secure an alternative tenant for the house Miller vacated and that Miller would help by advertising the house for rent in the local newspaper and showing the house to prospective tenants. She was then to refer any prospective tenants to Red Lodging.</p>\n<p id=\"AS1\">\u00b64 Although Miller referred prospective tenants to Red Lodging, none qualified through Red Lodgings application process to lease the vacated house. On March 4,1998, Miller notified Red Lodging that she would no longer pay the rent on the vacated house, and she did not make the March payment. Red Lodging filed a complaint against Miller in Justice Court seeking four months\u2019 rent for the balance of the lease and costs. Miller answered the complaint and filed a counterclaim seeking reimbursement for rent she had paid since vacating the house and other damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b65 Within a month after Red Lodging filed its complaint, it entered into a lease agreement with tenants who took possession of the house Miller had vacated. Red Lodging kept Miller\u2019s $600 damage deposit as rent for the month of March and dismissed its Justice Court complaint. The Justice Court then held a nonjury trial on Miller\u2019s counterclaim, found in favor of Red Lodging, and awarded attorney fees and costs totaling $6,281.90.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b66 Miller filed a notice of appeal to District Court. She also filed an undertaking on appeal in which she and Jerett Miller pledged money and property in the sum of $12,563.80 and promised to pay, on her behalf, the amount appealed and all costs if the appeal were withdrawn or dismissed, or the amount of any judgment and all costs that might be recovered against her in the action in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AUg\">\u00b67 Red Lodging moved to dismiss the appeal on grounds Miller had neither filed an undertaking on appeal which met the requirements of \u00a7 25-33-201, MCA, nor deposited money in lieu of an undertaking pursuant to \u00a7 25-33-205, MCA. Miller responded by asking the court to order Red Lodging to return the money it had by then obtained from executing on its Justice Court judgment and deposit that money with the Clerk of the District Court. Miller proposed to then tender to the District Court an additional $300 to meet the requirements of \u00a7 25-33-205, MCA. Under this latter \u201cjudgment monies plus $300\" approach, she argued that her appeal would be perfected notwithstanding having acted as her own surety. The District Court granted Red Lodging\u2019s motion and dismissed Miller\u2019s app\u00e9al.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err in dismissing Miller\u2019s appeal from the Justice Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\u00b69 The District Court\u2019s order dismissing Miller\u2019s appeal from the Justice Court did not set forth the court\u2019s rationale. It stated only that, \u201c[u]pon motion of [Red Lodging] and for good cause shown,\u201d the appeal from the Justice Court was dismissed. Miller\u2019s first contentions on appeal are that dismissal of her appeal was improper because she filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>a valid undertaking on appeal and Red Lodging\u2019s objections to it were untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b610 The procedure for appeals from justice court to district court is set out at \u00a7\u00a7 25-33-101 through -306, MCA. Section 25-33-201, MCA, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">(1) Except as provided in subsection (4) [an exception for indigent appellants], an appeal from a justice\u2019s or city court is not effectual for any purpose unless an undertaking be filed, with two or more sureties, in a sum equal to twice the amount of the judgment, including costs, when the judgment is for the payment of money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXK\">\u00b611 Red Lodging contends that Miller\u2019s undertaking on appeal was deficient and the District Court was without jurisdiction to consider the appeal because Miller\u2019s undertaking did not meet the \u201ctwo or more sureties\u201d requirement of \u00a7 25-33-201(1), MCA. Red Lodging is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"AKg\">\u00b612  A surety is \u201cone who, at the request of another and for the purpose of securing to him a benefit, becomes responsible for the performance by the latter of some act in favor of a third person or hypothecates property as security therefor.\u201d Section 28-11-401, MCA. The document filed by Miller, entitled \u201cUndertaking on Appeal,\u201d does not meet the statutory requirements of an undertaking because one of the two \u201csureties\u201d is Miller herself. Under the \u00a7 25-11-401, MCA, definition of a surety, one cannot act as a surety for oneself. Thus, Jerett Miller is the only valid surety named in Miller\u2019s document. A \u201csingular signature violates 25-33-201, MCA, which clearly requires two or more sureties.\u201d <em>Adams v. Crismore </em>(1984), 211 Mont. 245, 248, 683 P.2d 497, 499. Consequently, we conclude Miller\u2019s undertaking was deficient under \u00a7 25-33-201(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b613 Miller counters that Red Lodging failed to timely object to her undertaking on appeal under \u00a7 25-33-203, MCA, which provides that \u201c[t]he adverse party may except to the sufficiency of the sureties within 5 days after the filing of the undertaking[.]\u201d However, the statute on which Miller relies does not apply to the situation before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u00b614 By its own terms and as interpreted by this Court, \u00a7 25-33-203, MCA, relates to the financial sufficiency of sureties. An exception to the \u201csufficiency of the sureties\u201d refers to their \u201csolvency or pecuniary sufficiency\u201d rather than to their qualifications to act as sureties. <em>Whitcomb v. Beyerlein </em>(1929), 84 Mont. 470, 473, 276 P. 430, 431 (citation omitted). Here, Red Lodging\u2019s objection to Miller\u2019s undertaking challenged her qualifications to act as a surety for herself, not the monetary sufficiency of the undertaking. As a result, we conclude Red Lodging\u2019s objection was not required within five days of Miller\u2019s filing of her undertaking and, therefore, the objection was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">\u00b615 Miller points out, however, that \u00a7 25-33-205, MCA, provides an alternative to filing an undertaking on appeal whereby the appellant deposits with the justice court an amount of money equal to the amount of .the judgment plus $300. Pursuant to \u00a7 25-33-205, MCA, the justice court then transmits the money to the clerk of district court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Miller argues that because Red Lodging successfully executed on its judgment, she in effect \u201cdeposited\u201d that amount. She contends that her request for return of that amount to the District Court, together with her offer to pay another $300, constituted substantial compliance with \u00a7 25-33-205, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b616 Section 25-33-205, MCA, explicitly requires that the amount of the judgment plus $300 be deposited with the justice court. Miller\u2019s proposal that monies Red Lodging obtained via execution be returned in the future and that she add $300 to that amount in the future does not constitute a deposit. Moreover, an undertaking on appeal-for which the deposit is a substitute-must be filed within ten days after the notice of appeal. Section 25-33-208, MCA. Miller\u2019s proposed \u201csubstantial compliance,\u201d made at the December 10,1999 hearing, was. well beyond the ten days allowed after her August 2, 1999 notice of appeal from the Justice Court. Miller clearly did not fulfill the requirements of \u00a7 25-33-205, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b617 Finally, Miller asserts the undertaking requirement violates her right to equal protection. She relies on <em>Merchants Association v. Conger </em>(1979), 185 Mont. 552,606 P.2d 125, in support of this position, but her reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b618 In <em>Merchants, </em>Conger appealed to this Court from a district court\u2019s denial of her request for permission to appeal a justice court judgment without prepaying costs. She raised several constitutional issues, including whether the statutory undertaking requirement violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by barring an indigent defendant access to the district court. <em>Merchants, </em>185 Mont. at 553-54, 606 P.2d atl26. We addressed only the equal protection issue, determining that the existing statutory undertaking requirement, as applied to Conger, violated her equal protection rights. <em>Merchants, </em>185 Mont. at 554-55, 606 P.2d at 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\u00b619 After our decision in <em>Merchants, </em>the Legislature added subsection (4) to \u00a7 25-33-201, MCA, which requires a district court to waive the undertaking requirement upon a determination the appealing party is indigent. <em>See </em>1991 Mont. Laws 63. Thus the basis for Merchants\u2019s equal protection decision has been superseded by the legislative action. Moreover, Miller has not alleged in the present case that she is indigent or taken any other steps to avail herself of \u00a7 25-33-201(4), MCA. For these reasons, <em>Merchants </em>has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b506-9\">JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER, LEAPHART and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
