Did the District Court err in determining that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Electric Utility Industry Restructuring and Customer Choice Act violates MPC\u2019s constitutional right to just compensation under either the federal or the Montana Constitution takings clause?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">2. Did the District Court err in concluding that the Commission incorrectly interpreted the plain language of the Electric Utility Industry Restructuring and Customer Choice Act when it denied MPC\u2019s proposed \u201ctrackers\u201d accounting method for recovering transition costs?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u00b64 This case concerns the deregulation of electricity generating utilities in Montana under recent legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\u00b65 Enacted in 1997, the legislation, under Title 69, Chapter 8, also known as the \u201cElectric Utility Industry Restructuring and Customer Choice Act\u201d (hereinafter the Act), requires utilities such as MPC to separate the generation, distribution, and transmission functions of their operations. In turn, the generation function must be deregulated, or exposed to competitive markets, whereas the functions of distribution and transmission will remain regulated by the Montana Public Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">\u00b66 The Commission, under the Act, is charged with administering this process of restructuring and deregulation. Thus, the Act requires utilities to file a deregulation \u201ctransition\u201d plan with the Commission that comports with various deregulation requirements under the Act. In turn, the Commission must review and approve of the plan pursuant to the mandates under the Act, including issuing a final order \u201capproving, modifying, or denying the transition plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">\u00b67 One such requirement is that in order for a utility to recover \u201ctransition costs\u201d it must include a proposal in its transition plan as provided under the Act. These transition costs, which may ultimately be recouped from consumers, represent \u201cstranded\u201d costs associated with complying with legislated deregulation that could not otherwise be recovered in the soon-to-be competitive electrical power generation market. Categories of transition costs under the Act include the \u201cimmitigable\u201d costs associated with qualifying facility contracts, energy supply-related regulatory assets and deferred charges that exist because of current regulatory practices, and costs related to public utility-owned generation and other power purchase contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">\u00b68 The Act does not guarantee utilities that all transition costs may be recovered. Rather, in order to garner approval from the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>of these transition costs, utilities such as MPC must supply the Commission with an \u201caffirmative showing\u201d of these costs, and also show \u201creasonable mitigation.\u201d A proposal for transition cost recovery would invariably involve estimating some costs that have yet to accrue, and therefore remain uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\">\u00b69 In turn, in determining whether to approve, modify, or deny these proposed costs contained in a utility\u2019s transition plan, the Commission must look at whether they are \u201creasonably demonstrable,\u201d and must consider them as a whole on a \u201cnet basis\u201d unless waived by the public utility, the Commission must conduct a hearing and then issue a final order, determining if and to what extent a utility\u2019s transition costs can be recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b610 In the matter at bar, such a final order has yet to materialize due to the dispute that arose over MPC\u2019s proposed transition costs. At issue here is the method MPC proposed to the Commission for demonstrating its transition costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b611 Foreseeing imminent uncertainty in the costs of electricity, MPC proposed that a current estimation of some, but not all, transition costs be deferred, and \u201ctracked\u201d \u2014 in some instances for as long as the next 25 to 30 years-so that a more accurate figure could be determined in the future. Therefore, with regard to certain assets, in particular a number of \u201cqualifying facility contracts,\u201d MPC in essence proposed to offer no estimation of any transition costs; instead, such costs would be determined and thereby recovered at a later time, most likely on an annual basis, subsequent to the Commission issuing its \u201cfinal\u201d order as required under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b612 The Montana Consumer Counsel and the Large Customer Group received permission to intervene in this matter. Both disagreed with MPC\u2019s proposed use of \"trackers,\" claiming that the method would require as many as 30 years of cost tracking, which did not comport with the imperative of finality for fixing transition costs under the Act. At the Commission\u2019s request the parties briefed the issue, along with the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, Big Sky Power, and Montana Energy Brokers.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u00b613 On November 24, 1999, the Commission issued an Order, which determined that MPC\u2019s proposed \u201ctracking\u201d or \u201ctrackers\u201d cost accounting system, which would adjust transition costs in the future as such costs accrued, rather than reaching a current estimated fixed sum, was not consistent with the requirements of the Act. The Commission therefore concluded that under its interpretation of the Act, MPC\u2019s transition costs must be reduced to a fixed, net amount in order to gain approval. The Commission ordered MPC to amend its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>transition plan to specifically identify and demonstrate all transition costs it sought to recover, and not to rely on a future tracking mechanism.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b614 MPC filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied by the Commission on January 26, 2000. MPC sought judicial review by the District Court on February 17,2000. MPC argued that the Commission improperly interpreted the Act to preclude the use of trackers in its transition cost plan. MPC further contended that use of the proposed tracking method, although not expressly provided for under the Act, was well within the discretion afforded the Commission by the Legislature. MPC requested that the District Court reverse the Commission\u2019s decision that disallowed MPC\u2019s proposed tracking method for determining transition costs and permanently enjoin the Commission from enforcing its interpretation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b615 The District Court, in its May 12, 2000 Order, concluded that MPC\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights have been prejudiced because of the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Act to disallow trackers, in violation of constitutional and statutory provisions.\u201d The court ordered that the Commission \u201cmust allow MPC to incorporate tracking mechanisms in its transition plan proposal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b616 The court reasoned that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Act \u201chas great potential for depriving MPC or Montana consumers of property, and as such, is in violation of our Constitution.\u201d The court also determined that there was \u201cno clear provision in the Act disallowing trackers,\u201d and therefore \u201cthe use of trackers is allowed,\u201d under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u00b617 The Commission and intervenor LCG appealed. Oral argument was heard by this Court on May 3, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">\u00b618 When reviewing an agency decision, we apply the same standard as did the district court. <em>See Synek v. State Compensation Mut. Ins. Fund </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 246, 250, 900 P.2d 884, 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">\u00b619 In this case, as expressed under \u00a7 69-8-202(4), MCA, the Commission must process a request for approval of a transition plan pursuant to the contested case procedures of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, Title 2, Chapter 4, Part 6. The District Court was then required to follow the standard of review as set forth in the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, under \u00a7 2-4-704, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AWE\">\u00b620 In turn, judicial review of an agency decision under the contested case statutes permits a court to reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are \u201cin violation of constitutional or statutory provisions.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2-4-704(2)(a)(i), MCA. Here, the District Court applied (a)(i), in determining that \u201cMPC\u2019s substantial rights have been prejudiced because of the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Act to disallow trackers, in violation of constitutional and statutory provisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\">\u00b621 Accordingly, we must review the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Act, as well as the District Court\u2019s conclusions of law, to determine if they are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b622 As a preliminary matter, it is necessary to discuss certain underlying rules critical to the following analysis of the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"AqC0\">\u00b623 The District Court set forth a general rule, which is not disputed by the parties here, that \u201cbecause of the expertise the Commission has in the area it administers, the interpretation of statutes administrated by the Commission is given great deference by the Court.\u201d The court then cited to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>D\u2019Ewart v. Neibauer </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 335, 742 P.2d 1015. In <em>D\u2019Ewart, </em>this Court stated that \u201cthe construction of a statute by the person or agency responsible for its execution should be followed unless there are compelling indications that the construction is wrong.\u201d <em>D\u2019Ewart, </em>228 Mont. at 340, 742 P.2d at 1018 (citation omitted). <em>See also, accord, Montana Consumer Counsel v. Public Serv. Comm'n </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 180, 187, 541 P.2d 770, 774, <em>and compare with Johansen v. State, </em>1999 MT 187, \u00b6 9, 295 Mont. 339, \u00b6 9, 983 P.2d 962, \u00b6 9 (stating that court should defer to an agency's <em>decision </em>where substantial agency expertise is involved).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u00b624 Once this rule is properly traced to its source, however, it is necessary to temper the District Court\u2019s as well as the Appellants\u2019 slight but significant overstatement of its breadth. In <em>Bartels v. Miles City </em>(1965), 145 Mont. 116, 122, 399 P.2d 768, 771, this Court, in espousing the foregoing rule, provided several caveats that have since been shed through the ordinary course of repetitive citation that has brought us to the present. We stated that it is a well-accepted rule of statutory construction that the long and continued contemporaneous and practical interpretation of a statute by the executive officers charged with its administration and enforcement constitutes an \u201cinvaluable aid in determining the meaning of a doubtful statute.\u201d <em>Bartels, </em>145 Mont, at 122, 399 P.2d at 771. We also stated that where such an interpretation \u201chas stood unchallenged for a considerable length of time it will be regarded as a great importance in arriving at the proper construction of a statute.\u201d <em>Bartels, </em>145 Mont, at 122, 399 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>P.2d at 771. We analogized this \u201cdeference\u201d to an agency or officer\u2019s interpretation of a statute to estoppel, due to the reliance by the \u201cpublic and those having an interest in the interpretation of the law.\u201d <em>Bartels, </em>145 Mont, at 122, 399 P.2d at 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b625 Thus, the foregoing rule of deference applies, generally speaking, where the particular meaning of a statute has been placed in doubt, and where a particular meaning has been ascribed to a statute by an agency through a long and continued course of consistent interpretation, resulting in an identifiable reliance. Even then, such administrative interpretations are not binding on the courts; rather, they are entitled to \u201crespectful consideration.\u201d <em>Doe v. Colburg </em>(1976), 171 Mont. 97, 100, 555 P.2d 753, 754. Accordingly, the test of time and reliance may nevertheless yield to a judicial determination that construction is nevertheless wrong, based on \u201ccompelling indications.\u201d <em>D\u2019Ewart, </em>228 Mont. at 340, 742 P.2d at 1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b626 Here, the District Court determined, and the parties do not contest, that the Act, when read as a whole, is not ambiguous. Accordingly, if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, the statute speaks for itself and there is nothing left for this Court to construe. <em>See In re Raymond W. George Trust, </em>1999 MT 223, \u00b6 19,296 Mont. 56, \u00b6 19, 986 P.2d 427, \u00b6 19. Further, we must follow the ubiquitous rule, under \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA, that it is the obligation of the reviewing court, in interpreting a statute or an Act of legislation, to simply ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted. <em>See Farmers Alliance Mut. Ins. Co. v. Holeman </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 274, 277, 924 P.2d 1315, 1317.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b627 In sum, the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Act, which is at issue here, requires no \u201cdeference\u201d per se. However practical the Commission\u2019s construction of the Act may appear, the Act as a whole, or in particular, certainly has not been subjected to any meaningful \u201clong and continued contemporaneous\u201d interpretation. Thus, the Commission\u2019s interpretation that MPC\u2019s proposed transition cost tracking method does not comport with the Act~a decision intended to remove all doubt-has simply not \u201cstood unchallenged for a considerable length of time\u201d and, obviously, has not been relied on by MPC or any other party \u201chaving an interest in the interpretation of the law.\u201d Thus, consistent with our aforementioned standard of review, we shall focus our discussion and analysis on whether the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Act was correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u00b628 With the foregoing in mind, we turn to the issues presented by Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-2\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\n<em>Issue 1.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\">\n<em>Did the District Court err in determining that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Electric Utility Industry Restructuring and Customer Choice Act violates MPC\u2019s constitutional right to just compensation under either the federal or the Montana Constitution takings clause?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b629 The District Court, in its May 12, 2000 Order, concluded that it would \u201cnot interpret a statute in such a manner that it allows for an unlawful, or unconstitutional taking.\u201d Therefore, the court concluded that the \u201cgreat <em>potential </em>for depriving MPC ... of property ... is in violation of our Constitution.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b630 The Commission and LCG contend that the constitutional \u201ctakings\u201d issue is not ripe for adjudication because MPC has yet to be deprived of any property, and any future loss at this point is speculative. The Appellants argue, therefore, that the District Court erred as a matter of law in determining that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Act violated either the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, or Article II, Sections 17 and 29, of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b631 We agree, and therefore will not entertain at this time the underlying merits of whether alleged State infringement upon a utility\u2019s transition cost recovery permitted under the Act may give rise to a constitutional takings claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b632 The ripeness doctrine raised by the Appellants is a principle of law, grounded in the federal constitution as well as in judicial prudence, that requires an actual, present controversy, and therefore a court will not act when the legal issue raised is only hypothetical or the existence of a controversy merely speculative. <em>See Pearson v. Virginia City Ranches Ass\u2019n, </em>2000 MT 12, \u00b6 30, 298 Mont. 52, \u00b6 30, 993 P.2d 688, \u00b6 30; <em>Portman v. County of Santa Clara </em>(9th Cir. 1993), 995 F.2d 898, 902-903 (stating that the basic rationale of the ripeness requirement is to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements) (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\u00b633 In response to the foregoing, MPC sets forth the rule of statutory interpretation that \u201cit is paramount that we give such construction to the statute as will preserve the constitutional rights of the parties.\u201d <em>See In re A.RA. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 66, 70, 919 P.2d 388, 391 (citing <em>LaFountaine v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 402, 406-407, 698 P.2d 410, 413). MPC contends that because the Commission, as a State agency, established fixed rates for qualified facility contracts, MPC must in the future buy power from these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>facilities and then, perhaps, be forced to sell the power for far below the Commission\u2019s approved transition cost estimates. Without the accuracy of its proposed tracking system-which MPC argues the Commission rejected as a result of incorrectly interpreting the Act-its constitutional rights will be violated. Accordingly, MPC contends that the District Court did not err in staving off the \u201cvery likely\u201d deprivation of its property at the hands of State action, in construing the Act contrary to the Commission\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b634 Our decision <em>in In re A.R.A. </em>involved the harm to the fundamental rights suffered by a parent in a custody dispute where the natural father was denied custody in favor of a stepfather, following the death of the natural mother. <em>See In re A.R.A., </em>277 Mont, at 68-70, 919 P.2d at 389-91. The constitutional rights at issue in <em>LaFountaine </em>were \u201ctrial by jury, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the presumption of innocence, and all other rights guaranteed a criminal defendant\u201d where an attorney stood accused of committing \u201cdeceit or collusion\u201d which we concluded was, potentially, a criminal as well as a civil matter. <em>See LaFountaine, </em>215 Mont, at 406-407, 698 P.2d at 413. In <em>LaFountaine, </em>we relied on <em>Mackin v. State </em>(1980), 190 Mont. 363, 369-70, 621 P.2d 477, 481. The constitutional rights at issue there involved State immunity from suit, under Article II, Section 18, of the Montana Constitution, where a mother of an injured youth brought a tort claim against the State, and was denied full recovery pursuant to a statute that limited the State\u2019s liability. <em>See Mackin, </em>190 Mont, at 370, 621 P.2d at 481 (stating that neither \u201cstatutory nor constitutional construction by us should lead to absurd results if reasonable construction will avoid it\u201d). The <em>Mackin </em>Court, in turn, extracted the foregoing rule from <em>Yurkovich v. Industrial Accident Board </em>(1957), 132 Mont. 77, 314 P.2d 866. In <em>Yurkovich, </em>this Court addressed the Worker\u2019s Compensation statutes, where a plaintiff coal miner had been injured on the job after a four-hundred-pound slab of rock fell onto the plaintiff and injured his spine. The Industrial Accident Board denied his claim of disability because he missed a 12-month deadline. We affirmed the District Court\u2019s decision which overturned the Board\u2019s denial, concluding that \u201cthe Board\u2019s first duty is to administer the act so as to give the employee the greatest possible protection within the purposes of the act.\u201d <em>Yurkovich, </em>132 Mont. at 83, 314 P.2d at 870.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u00b635 In all four decisions, this Court declared that it was, indeed, paramount that we give such construction to the statute placed at issue that would preserve the constitutional rights of the parties. <em>See, e.g., In re A.R.A., </em>277 Mont. at 71, 919 P.2d at 391 (stating that \u201cthe state\u2019s ability to intrude upon the parent/child relationship must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>guarded\u201d); <em>Yurkovich, </em>132 Mont. at 83-85, 314 P.2d at 870-71 (stating that the act was fundamental legislation enacted first for the protection and benefit of the injured workman, his wife and children, and other dependants, and therefore must be liberally construed).</p>\n<p id=\"A0t\">\u00b636 Applied to the matter at bar, it is clear that MPC\u2019s claim to an unconstitutional takings at the hands of the Commission\u2019s ruling on the proposed tracking mechanism is as hypothetical and speculative as the future of electricity costs in Montana themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">\u00b637 The District Court\u2019s Order, which seems bent on nipping this \u201cpotential\u201d takings in the bud, expresses this inherent uncertainty by restating the Commission\u2019s contention that <em>if </em>the transition cost estimates prove to be too low, MPC <em>may </em>recover their inexact future market values by bringing a takings without just compensation claim. MPC\u2019s argument is similar: \u201cunless trackers are deemed permissible, MPC <em>very likely will </em>be deprived of constitutionally protected property rights through a taking without adequate compensation.\u201d (Emphasis added). MPC further acknowledges that under seven of the qualifying facility contracts at issue, \u201cno one will know how much customers or MPC [will be] actually harmed until this 25-year period has expired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AiI\">\u00b638  This is precisely the point. The State action-that is, the Commission\u2019s disallowance of MPC\u2019s proposed transition cost recovery method in its transition plan-has yet to deprive MPC of any property. Whether such \u201cproperty\u201d~assuming it is in fact property\u2014 <em>very likely will </em>or <em>very likely will not </em>come into existence in one year or 25 years is anyone\u2019s guess at this point. The <em>very likely potential </em>of an unconstitutional takings claimed by MPC is thus distinguishable from those imminent and very real violations of constitutional rights and remedies at risk under <em>Yurkovich </em>and its progeny. In sum, we cannot interpret an act of legislation and thereby enjoin state action to preserve a property interest which does not, and may not, exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b639  Therefore, we hold that the District Court erred when it declared, pursuant to its standard of review under \u00a7 2-4-704(2)(a)(i), MCA, that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Act produced an unconstitutional taking which has prejudiced MPC\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\n<em>Issue 2.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\n<em>Did the District Court err in concluding that the Commission incorrectly interpreted the plain language of the Electric Utility Industry Restructuring and Customer Choice Act when it denied MPC\u2019s proposed \u201ctrackers\u201d accounting method for recovering transition costs?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>\u00b640 With no constitutional takings at issue, we turn to the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Act, which the District Court concluded violated the plain language of the statutes at issue and thereby prejudiced the substantial rights of MPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u00b641 In order to affirm the decision of the District Court, this Court must likewise conclude that the Commission violated statutory provisions in its interpretation of the Act, pursuant to \u00a7 2-4-704, MCA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2-4-711, MCA; \u00a7 69-3-405, MCA; <em>Synek, </em>272 Mont, at 250, 900 P.2d at 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u00b642 The District Court determined that the plain language of the Act \u201callows tracking, in conjunction with, and not to the exclusion of (i), (ii) or (iii) sub parts of \u00a7 69-8-211(2)(b), MCA.\u201d Further, the court determined that \u201c[tjrackers can be used and still achieve a net cost\u201d as required under the Act, and there is \u201cno clear provision in the Act disallowing trackers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u00b643 MPC, in turn, directs this Court to the Act\u2019s statement of policy, which declares that \u201cthe interests of Montana consumers should be protected and the financial integrity of electrical utilities should be fostered.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 69-8-102(3), MCA. MPC argues that to construe the Act, as the Commission has, and disallow its proposed \u201ctrackers\u201d accounting system for recovering future transition costs, could potentially harm both interests identified under the foregoing policy if transition cost estimates are either too low or too high. MPC contends, therefore, that the Legislature surely wished to encourage the full recovery of transition costs, because in the end, either the consumers or the electrical utilities will benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u00b644 The Commission and the LCG argue that it is the need for certainty and finality now \u2014 not 20 or 30 years from now \u2014 that is the gravamen of the Act\u2019s treatment of transition cost recovery. Accordingly, the Appellants contend that leaving some but not all transition costs undetermined under a \u201cfinal\u201d order would frustrate the plain intent of the Act that seeks a \u201csettlement\u201d of all transition costs claimed by a utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\u00b645 Furthermore, according to authority relied on by the Appellants, the concept of burdening the consumers in a deregulated market with \u201ctransition costs\u201d is, of course, at odds with the underlying principle of deregulation-that the infusion of competition will naturally select and reward the strongest and fittest utilities for the ultimate benefit of the consumer. In other words, the recovery of transition costs amounts, in part, to legislatively sanctioned public relief for anticipated losses among utilities and their shareholders. According to the Appellants, the Legislature recognized this by requiring utilities to mitigate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>then estimate transition costs, so that a net sum could then be approved by the Commission in a final order that in turn lends an element of predictability to consumer choices in a deregulated market.</p>\n<p id=\"AUI\">\u00b646 With the foregoing policy dispute in mind, we observe that the Commission is statutorily charged with applying and enforcing the Act, including the approval and ultimate determination of transition costs. <em>See </em>\u00a7 69-3-102, MCA (Commission is invested with full power of supervision, regulation, and control of public utilities); \u00a7 69-8-202(5), MCA (on approval of a transition plan, the Commission \u201cshall enforce the public utility obligations as incorporated in the plan and in the Commission\u2019s final order\u201d); \u00a7 69-8-403(11), MCA (commission may promulgate \u201cany other rules\u201d necessary to carry out the provision of this chapter).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\">\u00b647 Accordingly, there are numerous provisions provided by the Legislature where the Commission may exercise its authority. Under \u00a7 69-8-211(2), MCA, for example, the Legislature has provided that the costs must be \u201cdetermined\u201d by the Commission upon an \u201caffirmative showing\u201d by a public utility. Under \u00a7 69-8-211(3), MCA, the Legislature has provided that the \u201camount\u201d of a public utility\u2019s transition costs may be recovered, but only upon \u201capproval\u201d by the Commission. Finally, the Legislature requires that the Commission\u2019s approval of transition costs and the subsequent collection of those transition costs through transition charges must constitute a \u201csettlement of all transition costs claims by a public utility\u201d under \u00a7 69-8-211(5), MCA. Thus, the Legislature has also provided that a public utility \u201cseeking to recover transition costs through any means not authorized by this chapter may not collect transition charges with respect to these transition costs,\u201d under \u00a7 69-8-211(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">\u00b648 In exercising its power to determine and approve a utility\u2019s transition costs, the Commission must follow certain criteria set forth by the Legislature in the Act. First, by definition, a \u201ctransition cost\u201d means only the \u201cnet verifiable generation-related and electricity supply costs, including costs of capital, that become unrecoverable as a result of the implementation of the Act or of federal law requiring retail open access or customer choice.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 69-8-103(30), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b649 Next, under \u00a7 69-8-202(1), MCA, all public utilities must submit a transition plan to the Commission, which demonstrates that the public utility \u201cmeets all the requirements of this chapter.\u201d The Commission must then, in accordance with \u00a7 69-8-202(4), MCA, \u201cprocess a request for approval of a transition plan pursuant to the contested case procedures of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act,\u201d codified under Title 2, Chapter 4, Part 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>\u00b650 Furthermore, in order to meet with the Commission\u2019s approval, transition costs submitted by a public utility must meet the requirements under \u00a7 69-8-211(2), MCA. Proposed transition costs must reflect \u201call reasonable mitigation\u201d by the public utility, the value of all generation-related assets and liabilities and electricity supply costs must be \u201creasonably demonstrable,\u201d and, finally, these values and costs must be considered on a \u201cnet basis.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 69-8-211(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"ApC\">\u00b651 Upon this \u201cshowing\u201d by a utility, the Commission must then determine the value of a utility\u2019s proposed costs by using at least one of the following methods: (i) estimating future market values of electricity and ancillary services provided by the assets; (ii) appraisal by independent third-party professionals; or (iii) a competitive bid sale. The Legislature has also provided that the Commission, in addition to using at least one of the foregoing methods, may use other methods as well. <em>See </em>\u00a7 69-8-211(2)(b), MCA. Here, it is undisputed that subpart (i)-the <em>estimation </em>of future market values~is at issue, in that appraisal and a competitive bid sale were not ultimately utilized by MPC in its proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u00b652 Returning to the question of policy underlying the foregoing statutory mandates, it is obvious that the Act requires that the Commission balance two conflicting objectives-protectingthe interests of the consumers and fostering the financial integrity of electrical utilities-in determining the extent to which MPC may recover transition costs. Thus, the issue boils down to whether the Commission has the statutory \u201cflexibility\u201d to oblige MPC\u2019s proposed use of a cost tracking method-which entails proposed costs that are \u201cunknown\u201d \u2014 in light of the policy to protect consumers coupled with the mandate that all estimated transition costs must be verified, unrecoverable, affirmatively shown, subjected to mitigation, demonstrable, viewed on a net basis, and reduced to an \u201camount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ANp\">\u00b653 Obviously, the tracking method of recovering transition costs was not expressly provided for by the Legislature when it enacted the Act in 1997, nor when it revised portions of the Act, including \u00a7 69-8-211, MCA, in 1999, nor when it again amended portions of the Act during the recent 2001 session. Further, contrary to MPC\u2019s contentions, there is no express indication that utilities must be entitled to a full recovery of all \u201cactual\u201d transition costs identified under \u00a7 69-8-211, MCA. Rather, \u201cthe commission shall allow recovery\u201d of transition costs \u201csubject to the provisions of this section,\u201d which the Legislature recognized would be determined by the Commission based, in part, on estimates of future market values.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u00b654  We conclude, therefore, that MPC\u2019s cost-tracking method-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>whereby some, but not all, transition costs proposed by a utility would be unknown and therefore subject to the caprice of future events-is entirely inconsistent with the statutory mandates placed on the Commission that <em>all </em>costs subject to its determination must be: (1) \u201cverifiable;\u201d (2) established as \u201cunrecoverable;\u201d (3) affirmatively shown; (4) reasonably mitigated; (5) \u201creasonably demonstrable;\u201d (6) reduced to a \u201cnet\u201d sum; and (7) reduced to an \u201camount\u201d in a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\">\u00b655 The principle of finality that the foregoing mandates express is further emphasized by \u00a7 69-8-211(5), MCA, which declares that the Commission\u2019s approval of transition costs, as well as the subsequent collection of those transition costs through transition charges, \u201cis a settlement of <em>all </em>transition costs claimed by a public utility.\u201d (Emphasis added). As indicated by Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, a \u201csettlement,\u201d in legal parlance, means to fix or resolve conclusively. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s, at 1372 (6th ed. 1990). In a different context, but nevertheless in broad terms, this Court recently concluded that the term \u201csettlement\u201d was synonymous with an enforceable bilateral contract that discharges a future or existing obligation. <em>See Watters v. Guaranty Nat. Ins. Co., </em>2000 MT 150, \u00b6 40, 300 Mont. 91, \u00b6 40, 3 P.3d 634, \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"A28\">\u00b656  We conclude that such finality, as indicated by the inclusion of the term \u201csettlement\u201d under \u00a7 69-8-211(5), MCA, is the overarching intent of the Act, where the need of consumers to effectively plan today takes precedence over precise cost analysis extending years if not decades into the future. Like any \u201csettlement,\u201d the parties here must play the role of clairvoyant, to some extent, in an endeavor that requires attaining certainty now based on an unknown future. And, in the end, pursuant to statutory mandate, it is the Commission that assumes the role of arbiter in determining and fixing MPC\u2019s transition costs, if any, that in turn will be discharged at the consumers\u2019 expense.</p>\n<p id=\"As5\">\u00b657  Thus, we hold that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Act was correct, and that it therefore did not violate any statutory provisions under the Act. We conclude, therefore, that a judicial mandate directed at the Commission to allow the use of the proposed \u201ctrackers,\u201d would require the Commission to bend if not violate the law, and therefore cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u00b658 Accordingly, the order of the District Court is reversed and vacated, and the order of the Commission is reinstated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b299-5\">JUSTICES REGNIER, LEAPHART, COTTER, TRIEWEILER, RICE and DISTRICT JUDGE PHILLIPS sitting for CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
