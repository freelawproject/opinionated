Gilder, </em>1999 MT 207, 295 Mont. 483, 985 P.2d 147 <em>(Gilder I). </em>We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-25\">\u00b62 The parties generally state the issues on appeal as:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-26\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by granting the State\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing following our decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Gilder\u2019s first appeal; and</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in denying Gilder\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u00b65 However, the appeal is resolved by our determination that the doctrine of law of the case precluded the District Court from further considering the evidence suppression issue addressed by this Court in the previous decision rendered herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\u00b66 In 1998, Gilder was charged by information with a fourth offense of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, driving while his license was suspended or revoked, and obstructing a police officer. His arrest on the charges followed an investigative stop of his vehicle by a Missoula County deputy sheriff. Gilder filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the stop of his vehicle, arguing the officer did not have a particularized suspicion to justify the stop. The District Court denied Gilder\u2019s motion, and following the entry of a conditional guilty plea, he appealed to this Court. In <em>Gilder I, </em>we concluded that the District Court erred when it denied Gilder\u2019s motion to suppress and reversed the District Court\u2019s ruling. The case was not remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">\u00b67 Following issuance of remittitur in <em>Gilder I, </em>the State requested an evidentiary hearing in the District Court \u201cto present additional evidence with which to meet its burden\u201d of establishing the particularized suspicion necessary to justify the stop of Gilder\u2019s vehicle. The State argued to the District Court that this Court\u2019s Opinion in <em>Gilder I </em>had referenced the District Court\u2019s failure to conduct an evidentiary hearing prior to its original denial of the motion to suppress, and further, that the opinion stated \u201cthe State was not provided with an opportunity to present additional evidence with which to meet its burden of showing how the facts support an experienced officer\u2019s inference of criminal activity.\u201d Gilder opposed the hearing, arguing that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gilder I </em>did not contemplate any further proceedings on the suppression issue. The District Court granted the State\u2019s request and conducted an evidentiary hearing, over Gilder\u2019s objection, in which the arresting officer was allowed to testify and supplement the evidence offered by the State in <em>Gilder I. </em>The District Court then issued an order again denying Gilder\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the stop of his vehicle. Gilder appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">\u00b68 The dispositive issue is whether this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Gilder I </em>constituted law of the case on the suppression issue, prohibiting further consideration of the issue by the District Court. We review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>District Court\u2019s actions under an abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u00b69 Under the doctrine of law of the case, a prior decision of this Court resolving a particular issue between the same parties in the same case is binding and cannot be relitigated. <em>State v. Wooster, </em>2001 MT 4, \u00b6 12, 304 Mont. 56, \u00b612, 16 P.3d 409, \u00b6 12. This Court has applied the doctrines of law of the case and <em>res judicata </em>to preclude an appellant from raising issues that were decided by this Court on a previous appeal. <em>State v. Black </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 39, 44, 798 P.2d 530, 533. To afford one party additional review of the same issue between the same parties would negate the intent of these doctrines.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u00b610 The doctrines of law of the case and <em>res judicata </em>often work hand in glove but are not identical. Two important policies underlie and are common to both principles: judicial economy and finality of judgments. <em>State v. Perry </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 455, 463, 758 P.2d 268, 273. While the law of the case is normally decisive, it does not have the same binding force as the doctrine of <em>res judicata. United States v. Miller </em>(9th Cir. 1987), 822 F.2d 828, 832. The United States Supreme Court has stated, concerning the difference between law of the case and <em>res judicata, </em>that \u201cone directs discretion, the other supersedes it and compels judgment.\u201d <em>Southern Ry. Co. v. Clift </em>(1922), 260 U.S. 316, 319, 43 S.Ct. 126, 67 L.Ed. 283. While Gilder argues that the District Court's consideration of the suppression issue after <em>Gilder I </em>was. prohibited under both doctrines, it is our determination that the doctrine of law of the case is applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u00b611 In discussing law of the case, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">In the absence of statute the phrase, law of the case, as applied to the effect of previous orders on the later action rendering them in the same case, merely expresses the practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided, not a limit to their power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-8\"><em>Messenger v. Anderson </em>(1912), 225 U.S. 436, 444, 32 S.Ct. 739, 56 L.Ed. 1152. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has said, \u201cWe are dealing then with what is properly a matter of discretion-discretion so vague that the law of the case has been described by the Supreme Court as \u2018an amorphous concept. <em>Arizona v. California </em>(1983), 460 U.S. 605, 618, 103 S. Ct. 1382, 75 L. Ed. 2d 318.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller, </em>822 F.2d at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">\u00b612 This Court\u2019s jurisprudence regarding the doctrine of law of the case often stems from the offc-cited case <em>Carlson v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co. </em>(1929), 86 Mont. 78, 281 P. 913. There, the Court pronounced, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">The rule is well established and long adhered to in this state that where, upon an appeal, the supreme court in deciding a case presented states in its opinion a principle or rule of law necessary to the decision, such pronouncement .becomes the law of the case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>and must be adhered to throughout its subsequent progress, both in the trial court and upon subsequent appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><em>Carlson, </em>86 Mont. at 81, 281 P. at 914. <em>(And see, e.g., Federated Mut. Ins. Co. v. Anderson, </em>1999 MT 288, \u00b6 60, 297 Mont. 33, \u00b6 60, 991 P.2d 915, \u00b6 60).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u00b613 While the Court in <em>Carlson </em>recognized that there are exceptions to the application of the doctrine, and other jurisdictions have developed specific tests for adjudicating such exceptions, those issues are not before the Court here. On the basis of this Court\u2019s longstanding jurisprudence, we find that the doctrine of law of the case is dispositive and that the District Court abused its discretion in failing to apply the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\u00b614 The State has cited <em>Zavarelli v. Might </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 120, 779 P.2d 489, in support of the District Court\u2019s decision to conduct additional proceedings on the suppression issue following <em>Gilder I. </em>The State argues that because this Court did not include a specific mandate remanding the case with instructions to enter an order of dismissal, the District Court was implicitly authorized to conduct further proceedings consistent with the Court\u2019s opinion. The State references language in <em>Zavarelli </em>which quoted from an Am.Jur.2d annotation discussing law of the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">On <em>remand, </em>the trial court may consider or decide any matters <em>left open by the appellate court </em>and is free to make any order in further progress of the case, not inconsistent with the decision of the appellate court, <em>as to any question not presented or settled by that decision .... </em>5 Am. Jur. 2d 420, 421, Appeal and Error, \u00a7\u00a7992 (1962). [Emphases added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-8\"><em>Zavarelli, </em>239 Mont. at 125, 779 P.2d at 492-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">\u00b615 The State is correct only in regard to those issues not finally resolved by the Court\u2019s opinion. The only issue addressed and decided by the Court in <em>Gilder I </em>was Gilder\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained by way of the investigative stop. Thus, under <em>Zavarelli, </em>the suppression issue was not \u201cleft open\u201d by the Court in <em>Gilder I, </em>but was a question \u201csettled by that decision,\u201d and consideration of the issue by the District Court was presumptively foreclosed under the principle of law of the case. The decision to prosecute the charges based upon other evidence, or to dismiss the charges, was left to the discretion of the State, and the District Court was not precluded from conducting further proceedings on these other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">\u00b616 The State also argues that <em>Zavarelli </em>held that law of the case applies to questions of law, not to questions of fact, and therefore, it was appropriate for the District Court to conduct further evidentiary proceedings. This proposition is generally true. In <em>Zavarelli, </em>we held \u201cthat the doctrine is rarely, and in a very limited classification, applied to matters of evidence as opposed to rulings of law, and that a decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>on appeal of a question of fact does not generally become the law of the case ....\u201d <em>Zavarelli, </em>239 Mont, at 125, 779 P.2d at 493. However, this general principle is still governed by the effect of the Court\u2019s prior holding. While the District Court could have properly revisited factual determinations in regard to other issues, the suppression issue addressed in <em>Gilder I </em>was foreclosed from further consideration. As we stated in <em>Zavarelli:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\">If the mandate speaks only in the light of the special facts found, the lower court is at liberty to proceed <em>in all other respects </em>in the matter that, according to its judgment, justice may require. The trial court should examine the mandate and the opinion of the reviewing court and proceed <em>in conformity with the views expressed therein. </em>The mandate is to be interpreted <em>according to the subject matter </em>and, if possible, in a manner to promote justice. [Emphases added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><em>Zavarelli, </em>239 Mont. at 126, 779 P.2d at 493. As stated, the law of the case promotes the policy of judicial economy. It thus precludes subsequent evidentiary hearings on issues finally adjudicated before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u00b617 The State interprets the Court\u2019s statement in <em>Gilder I </em>that \u201cthe State was not given an opportunity to present additional evidence with which to meet its burden\u201d as an invitation for further proceedings on the issue in the District Court. The State\u2019s interpretation of and reliance on that language are incorrect. While the Court in <em>Gilder I </em>referenced the lack of an evidentiary hearing in determining that the evidence presented in the officer\u2019s incident report was insufficient to justify the investigative stop, the Court did not hold that the District Court erred in failing to conduct such a hearing, and did not remand the case for hearing. Moreover, the State did not argue in <em>Gilder I </em>that the District Court had so erred, nor did it request that the case be remanded for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">\u00b618  Our decision in <em>Gilder I </em>constituted the law of the case regarding the lack of particularized suspicion for the investigative stop, and the suppression of evidence obtained therefrom. Failure to properly apply the law of the case constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>Thomas v. Bible </em>(9th Cir. 1993), 983 F.2d 152, 155. Here, the District Court did not properly treat our decision in <em>Gilder I </em>as law of the case and, therefore, abused its discretion in conducting further evidentiary hearings on a matter which was conclusively decided by this Court in previous proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\u00b619 The District Court\u2019s order is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b392-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
