The defendants moved for summary judgment and that motion was granted. Fang appeals the District Court\u2019s order dismissing his complaint by summary judgment. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b62 Fang has raised several issues on appeal. However, all of his claims depend on his assertion that he was damaged by Bock\u2019s conduct. Since we conclude that he was not, the following issue is dispositive:</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err when it held that the plaintiffs claim for damages based on the defendant\u2019s alleged professional negligence should be dismissed as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\u00b64 Appellant, Hua Fang, M.D., is a citizen of China and was a lawful permanent resident of the United States. He was granted resident status on June 18, 1996, and was employed by Montana State University as an HIV researcher. His wife, Chiun Liu, attended classes at the University.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">\u00b65 On November 21, 1997, Fang and his wife were involved in a domestic dispute and Chiun Liu called the police. Chiun Liu stated in her affidavit that she did not realize when she called the police that her husband would be arrested. However, Fang was arrested and charged with \u201cknowingly and purposefully causing bodily injury by striking his wife with closed fist to the face\u201d in violation of \u00a745-5-206, MCA (1999). He was taken to the Gallatin County Detention Center where he was shown a video by which he was advised that a guilty plea could lead to deportation. On December 11, 1997, he and Chiun Liu went to the Associated Students Legal Services on campus for advice. There they met with Phyllis Bock and asked her about the possibility of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">\u00b66 Phyllis Bock contacted Julia Rice, an attorney employed by the University of Illinois at Chicago who made a presentation regarding immigration law at a continuing legal education seminar that Bock had attended. Bock told Rice that she was representing a client charged with domestic abuse, a misdemeanor. Bock asked Rice if this was grounds for deportation. Rice informed Bock that the INS would not initiate deportation proceedings until the commission of two misdemeanors. Bock relayed that information to Fang. Based at least in part on Bock\u2019s erroneous advice, Fang pled guilty to Family Member Assault in violation of \u00a745-5-206, MCA, on February 9, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u00b67 However, in 1996, Congress amended the Immigration and Nationality Act at 8 U.S.C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(E)(i). The new law provides that domestic violence convictions are deportable offenses. Deportation can occur if the violence was directed at \u201ca current or former spouse of the person....\u201d These provisions became effective with enactment of the Illegal Immigrant Reform Act on September 30, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b68 Several weeks after he pled guilty, Fang received a \u201cNotice to Appear\u201d from the INS informing him that he was subject to deportation from this country. He hired new counsel and moved the district court to set aside his guilty plea. On June 26,1998, the district court granted Fang\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea, stating that the failure of Bock to inform Fang of the possibility of removal to China constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The INS then agreed to suspend further proceedings until the resolution of the charges against Fang.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b69 On October 5, 1998, based on the advice of his new immigration attorney, Deborah Smith, Fang reached another plea agreement with the Gallatin County Attorney\u2019s office and pled guilty to an amended charge of assault in violation of \u00a745-5-201, MCA (1999). Approximately two weeks later, Smith informed the INS of the disposition of Fang\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u00b610 Based on the new conviction, INS counsel moved the immigration court of the United States Department of Justice to deport Fang. On March 31, 1999, an INS judge granted their motion and ordered that Fang be removed to China. The judge held that the assault that Fang pled guilty to on October 5, 1998, also constituted a crime of violence against a protected person for purposes of the federal immigration statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\u00b611 Fang filed his complaint against Phyllis Bock and the Associated Students Legal Services of Montana State University, seeking damages for professional negligence and negligent supervision. He also sought treble damages pursuant to \u00a737-61-406, MCA. All three claims were dismissed by summary judgment. On appeal, Fang seeks reinstatement of these three claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">\u00b612 Did the District Court err when it held that the plaintiffs claim for damages based on the defendant\u2019s alleged professional negligence should be dismissed as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">\u00b613 This court reviews a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment de novo based on the same criteria found at Mont.R.Civ.P 56(c) that must be considered by the district court. <em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903. The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issue of material fact exists. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>The burden then shifts to the party opposing the motion to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that there is a genuine issue of fact. If no genuine issue of fact exists, the court must determine whether the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Bruner, </em>272 Mont. at 264-265, 900 P.2d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b614 The facts in this case are not in dispute. Bock admits giving erroneous advice to Fang. Fang pled guilty to family member assault based on that advice. Fang learned that Bock\u2019s advice was incorrect and because of his reliance on that advice was allowed to withdraw his plea. As a result, deportation proceedings were suspended. However, after getting independent advice, he then pled guilty to assaulting the same member of his family. Deportation proceedings were resumed and he was ordered removed from the country because of his second conviction. The real issue as recognized by the District Court is whether Fang\u2019s legal expenses and current predicament are a result of Bock\u2019s error or the inevitable consequences of conduct that he has now admitted on two separate occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u00b615 The District Court concluded that Fang failed to prove all the elements of a prima facie case of professional negligence. It relied on <em>Lorash v. Epstein </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 21, 767 P.2d 1335, in which this Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">In pursuing a negligence or breach of contract action against an attorney, the plaintiff must initially establish the existence of an attorney-client relationship. The plaintiff must then establish that the acts constituting the negligence or breach of contract occurred, proximately causing damages to the plaintiff. The final requirement for the plaintiff is the need to establish that \u2018but for\u2019 such negligence or breach of contract, the client would have been successful in the prosecution or defense of the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-7\"><em>Lorash, </em>236 Mont. at 24, 767 P.2d at 1337 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">\u00b616 The District Court concluded that Fang could not satisfy the last element. He could not show.that but for Bock\u2019s negligence, he would have successfully defended the charge against him. Furthermore, the District Court also held that once the first guilty plea was vacated, any adverse effect from Bock\u2019s advice was erased.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">\u00b617 Fang contends, however, that because of Bock\u2019s advice, he was exposed to the possibility of removal from this country and had to expend substantial sums of money to avoid that exposure. The <em>Lorash </em>test, in the context of the undisputed facts before us, require that we determine whether Fang would have been exposed to removal from the country based on his conduct with or without Bock\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">\u00b618 To answer that question we must necessarily review the offenses to which he pled guilty, the statutory basis for his deportation and the Immigration Judge\u2019s explanation for her order.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\u00b619 Section 45-5-206, MCA (1999), which penalizes assault on a family member and is the crime to which Fang originally pled guilty, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">(1) A person commits the offense of partner or family member assault if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">(a) purposely or knowingly causes bodily injury to a partner or family member;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">(b) negligently causes bodily injury to a partner or family member with a weapon; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">(c) purposely or knowingly causes reasonable apprehension of bodily injury in a partner or family member.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">\u00b620 Section 45-5-201, MCA, which describes misdemeanor assault, the crime to which Fang pled guilty based on the advice of a second attorney after being informed of the 1996 amendment to the Immigration Act, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">(1) A person commits the offense of assault if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">(a) purposely or knowingly commits bodily injury to another,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-11\">(c) purposely or knowingly makes physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature with any individual; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-12\">(d) purposely or knowingly causes reasonable apprehension of bodily injury in another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">\u00b621 8 USC \u00a71227(a)(2)(E)(i), pursuant to which Fang\u2019s removal from this country was sought by Immigration officials, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeg\">Any alien who at any time after admission is convicted of a crime of domestic violence, a crime of stalking, or a crime of child abuse, child neglect or child abandonment is deportable. For purposes of this clause, the term \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d means any crime of violence ... against a person committed by a current or former spouse of the person, by an individual with whom the person shares a child in common, by an individual who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the person as a spouse</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-14\">\u00b622 18 USC \u00a716 defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-15\">(a) an offense that has as an element the use, the'attempted use or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-16\">(b) any other offense that is a felony and by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-17\">\u00b623 Anne Ho, the Immigration Judge who ordered Fang\u2019s removal to China on March 31, 1999, concluded that the second offense to which Fang pled guilty was just as much a crime of violence against his spouse as the first. She noted that in support of his second plea, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>stated that he \u201cwas having a heated argument with Chun Liu [his wife]. At one point [he] became very angry, threw a shirt at Chun, and otherwise made threatening gestures directed at her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b624 Pointing out that the title of the offense is irrelevant for purposes of Immigration law, she stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">[T]he respondent need not be convicted of a specifically classified state \u201cdomestic violence\u201d law in order to be convicted of a \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d as defined by the Act. As the Service correctly stated in their request for an order of removal, INA \u00a7237(a)(2)(E)(i) has two elements that transform a conviction for a particular offense into a \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d: first, the offense must be a crime of violence as defined; second, the offense must be committed against a \u201cProtected Person.\u201d See INA \u00a7237(a)(2)(E)(i). When the Board determines whether an offense, as defined by a state statute, constitutes a ground of deportability, they do not rely on the state\u2019s definition of the type of crime covered as a matter of state law, but rely on the elements of the offense. <em>Matter of Punu, </em>Int. Dec. 3364 (BIA 1998); <em>Matter of Teixiera, </em>Int. Dec. 3275 (BIA 1996). Moreover, there is nothing in INA \u00a7237(a)(2)(E)(i) that requires than an alien be convicted of a specifically designated \u201cdomestic violence law\u201d in order to be rendered removable. Rather, one need only be convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d committed against a \u201cprotected person.\u201d A spouse is one such person. Therefore, the respondent\u2019s second argument is completely meritless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">\u00b625 Ho also addressed Fang\u2019s argument on appeal that a different result is compelled by the fact that Fang\u2019s assault conviction has since been expunged based on a deferred prosecution. Footnote 1 of her decision points out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">In <em>Matter of Roldan, </em>Int. Dec. 3377 (BIA 1999), the Board held, in pertinent part, that under the statutory definition of \u201cconviction\u201d provided at INA \u00a7101(a)(48)(A), \u201cno effect is to be given in immigration proceedings to a state action which purports to expunge, dismiss, cancel, vacate, discharge or otherwise remove a guilty plea or other record of guilt or conviction by operation of a state rehabilitative statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">\u00b626  Although Bock misinformed Fang, her advice did not lead to his current predicament nor has the money he spent to have his first conviction set aside changed the result. The conduct which he admitted was in violation of both statutes to which he pled guilty. Violation of either statute was grounds for deportation so long as the victim was his wife. Fang\u2019s situation regarding deportation is a result of the conduct he has admitted, and is the same following correct legal advice as it was following Bock\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>\u00b627 Therefore, Fang cannot prove that \u201cbut for\u201d negligent legal advice he could have avoided deportation and based on our decision in <em>Lorash, </em>Bock was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Because we conclude as a matter of law that Fang was not damaged by Bock\u2019s conduct, his other claims which are directly or indirectly predicated on that conduct must also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u00b628 For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b354-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
