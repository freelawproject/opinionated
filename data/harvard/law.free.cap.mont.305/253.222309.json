Setters had also been charged with theft by accountability for benefits received under various public assistance programs, but that charge was dismissed pursuant to a plea agreement. Setters appeals the District Court's order requiring him to pay restitution to the Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) in connection with the dismissed charge. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u00b62 The issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred in requiring Setters to pay restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court properly considered Setters\u2019 ability to pay when it established the amount of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court erred in assessing a penalty in addition to restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">\u00b66 Because we hold in issue 1 that the District Court exceeded its statutory authority by ordering Setters to pay restitution for a dismissed count, it is unnecessary for us to address the question in issue 2 of Setters' ability to pay said restitution or the question in issue 3 regarding the civil penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">\u00b67 Setters is a Vietnam veteran who was determined by the Veterans Administration (VA) to be suffering from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and, as a result, is 100% disabled and unable to obtain gainful employment. As a result of the PTSD disability determination, Setters received over $100,000 in back pay in 1995 and continues to receive $2,368 per month in veteran\u2019s disability benefits, subject to cost of living adjustments. Setters now lives at the family home in Arlee with his wife and four of his five children. Setters claims that during the period his wife received the public assistance at issue here, he did not reside with his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">\u00b68 From July of 1989 through November of 1995, Setters\u2019 wife applied for and received various forms of public assistance including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Food Stamps, Aid for Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), and Medicaid, totaling approximately $93,000. Several individuals in the community of Arlee expressed their concerns to local authorities regarding the public assistance received by the Setters, precipitating an investigation by the Lake County Attorney\u2019s office. These individuals alleged that Setters was in fact living with his wife in Arlee and that the amount of public assistance being paid to Setters\u2019 family was improper. Of the $93,000 in public assistance received by Setters\u2019 wife, Deborah, $73,689.16 was later determined by the Montana Department of Justice Criminal Investigations Bureau (DOJ) to be overpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b69 Pursuant to the DOJ investigation, Setters was charged by information in August 1997, with the offense of accountability for theft, a common scheme, under \u00a7\u00a7 45-2-302(3) and 45-6-301(4)(a), MCA. The State alleged that Deborah \u201cpurposely or knowingly obtained or exerted unauthorized control\u201d over public assistance benefits when she claimed that Setters did not reside in her home resulting in higher payments to her than she was entitled. Setters pleaded not guilty to the charge. The State also filed charges against Deborah, but dismissed those charges with prejudice in a subsequent plea agreement with Robert.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b610 The case proceeded to trial in January 1998. After a two-day trial, the jury indicated that they were hopelessly deadlocked. The District Court declared a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u00b611 In an amended information filed in September 1998, the State again charged Setters with the offense of accountability for theft, a common scheme, and added the charge of tampering with public records or information, a felony, under \u00a7 45-7-208(1), MCA. This unrelated charge stemmed from Setters\u2019 1996 application for a Montana liquor license, wherein he stated that he had indeed lived with his wife in Arlee for the past 11 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\u00b612 Setters admitted his guilt on the tampering charge, while continuing to maintain his innocence on the charge of accountability. Consequently, as part of a plea agreement, Setters agreed to plead guilty to the tampering charge in exchange for the State moving to dismiss the charge of theft by accountability. The State also agreed that after judgment was entered against Setters, the State would dismiss with prejudice the charges pending against Setters' wife. In addition, the State agreed to recommend that the court impose a five-year sentence to Montana State Prison with all of that time suspended upon certain conditions, including that Setters make restitution to DPHHS. To that end, the plea agreement specified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The Defendant shall be responsible for restitution to the victim of the offense, the Department of Public Health and Human Services, in an amount to be determined at the sentencing hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b613 In the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report, the probation officer recommended imposition of a five-year suspended sentence and that Setters pay $20,025 in restitution at the rate of $334 per month. The probation officer noted that he had contacted the chief auditor and program compliance manager for DPHHS who had reported that while DPHHS would prefer to receive full restitution, they would be willing to compromise on an amount between $20,000 and $40,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b614 At sentencing, the State recommended that Setters be ordered to pay full restitution in the amount of $73,698.16, plus a statutorily-prescribed 25% penalty in the amount of $15,040.54, for a total of $88,729.70, to be repaid within 58 months. The resultant monthly payment, including court costs, was approximately $1,539 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"A9q\">\u00b615 The District Court concurred with the State and imposed a five-year suspended sentence and ordered Setters to pay restitution in the amount of $88,729.70. In both its oral pronouncement of sentence and its written judgment, the District Court explained that the reasons for the sentence are that it will provide restitution to the victim of the offense and it will afford Setters an opportunity for rehabilitation. Setters appeals and asks this Court to vacate the restitution requirement contained in the District Court's judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">\u00b616 This Court reviews a district court's imposition of a sentence for legality only. <em>State v. Hilgers, </em>1999 MT 284, \u00b6 6, 297 Mont. 23, \u00b6 6, 989 P.2d 866, \u00b6 6 (citing <em>State v. Richards </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 322, 324, 948 P.2d 240, 241). <em>See also State v. Rennick, </em>1999 MT 155, \u00b6 7, 295 Mont. 97, \u00b6 7, 983 P.2d 907, \u00b6 7; <em>State v. Graves </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 451, 463, 901 P.2d 549, 557. The standard of review of the legality of a sentence is whether the sentencing court abused its discretion. <em>Rennick, </em>\u00b6 7. In reviewing the court's findings of fact as to the amount of restitution, our standard of review is whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Hilgers, </em>\u00b6 6 (citing <em>State v. Perry </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 34, 36, 938 P.2d 1325, 1327).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">\u00b617 <em>Whether the District Court erred in requiring Setters to pay restitution.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">\u00b618 Setters argues that the District Court exceeded its statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>authority by requiring him to pay full restitution for a crime which he did not admit committing and for which he was not convicted. He also argues that, contrary to the District Court's reasoning, the restitution condition does not have a rehabilitative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u00b619 Relying on <em>State v. Blanchard </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 11, 16, 889 P.2d 1180, 1183, the State argues that an order of restitution for uncharged conduct is appropriate when it is bargained for in a plea agreement. The State contends that Setters has reaped the benefit of the dismissed charges against him and his wife and that he should not now be allowed to escape the obligations of his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u00b620 A plea agreement is a contract which is subject to contract law standards. <em>State v. Keys, </em>1999 MT 10, \u00b6 18, 293 Mont. 81, \u00b6 18, 973 P.2d 812, \u00b6 18 (citing <em>State v. Butler </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 286, 291, 900 P.2d 908, 911). Under contract law, one party relinquishes some rights in reliance upon the promise of the other party. For that reason, this Court has consistently held that it will not assist a defendant in escaping the obligations of a plea agreement once the defendant has received its benefit. <em>Keys, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>State v. Nance </em>(1947), 120 Mont. 152, 166, 184 P.2d 554, 561).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u00b621 Nevertheless, it is also well established that a district court's authority to impose sentences in criminal cases is defined and constrained by statute. <em>State v. Nelson, </em>1998 MT 227, \u00b6 24, 291 Mont. 15, \u00b6 24, 966 P.2d 133, \u00b6 24 (citing <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 34, 37, 926 P.2d 712, 714). Moreover, \"a district court has no power to impose a sentence in the absence of specific statutory authority.\" <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 24 (quoting <em>State v. Hatfield </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 340, 346, 846 P.2d 1025, 1029).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\u00b622 The statutory authority for the payment of restitution in this case is found at \u00a7 46-18-201(2), MCA (1997), which provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">In addition to any penalties imposed pursuant to subsection (1), if the court finds that <em>the victim of the offense </em>has sustained a pecuniary loss, the court shall require payment of full restitution <em>to the victim </em>as provided in 46-18-241 through 46-18-249. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajp\">Hence, restitution is statutorily limited to the \"victim\" of the crime for which a defendant is convicted. <em>State v. Horton, </em>2001 MT 100, \u00b6 25, 305 Mont. 242, \u00b6 25, 25 P.3d 886, \u00b6 25 (citing <em>State v. Brown </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 223, 227, 867 P.2d 1098, 1101).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">\u00b623 In <em>Horton, </em>a case similar to the case before us on appeal, the defendant was charged with felony driving under the influence (DUI), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>driving while his license was suspended or revoked, and felony nonsupport. The defendant owed over $47,000 in back child support. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Horton pleaded guilty to the traffic offenses in exchange for the State dismissing the felony nonsupport charge and, as part of the terms and conditions of his probationary sentence, Horton agreed to pay his child support arrearage. <em>Horton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8-11. At sentencing, the District Court ordered Horton to pay his monthly child support obligation along with an additional amount toward the arrearages as restitution. <em>Horton, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u00b624 On appeal, Horton argued that since he pleaded guilty to certain traffic offenses and he did not plead guilty to, nor was he convicted of, the charge of felony nonsupport, there was no \"victim\" of the crimes for which he was convicted and to whom he could be ordered to pay restitution. <em>Horton, </em>\u00b6 27. We agreed with Horton and held that the District Court's order in that case did not meet the statutory requirements for the imposition of restitution on a suspended sentence. <em>Horton, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b625 Similarly, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>Setters was convicted of tampering with public records or information for giving false information to obtain a liquor license. He did not plead guilty to, nor was he convicted of, the charge of theft by accountability. Consequently, the \"victim\" of the crime for which Setters was convicted-tampering with public records or information-was not DPHHS and Setters cannot be ordered to pay restitution to DPHHS for the offense of theft by accountability-a crime for which he was not convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b626 Setters also argues that, contrary to the District Court's statement at the sentencing hearing and in its written judgment, the restitution condition does not have a rehabilitative purpose. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">\u00b627  Section 46-18-202(l)(e), MCA (1997), provides that a sentencing court may impose any condition or restriction \"reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society.\" However, in interpreting that provision in <em>State v. Ommundson, </em>1999 MT 16, \u00b6 11, 293 Mont. 133, \u00b6 11, 974 P.2d 620, \u00b6 11, we held that a sentencing limitation or condition must have some correlation or connection to the underlying offense for which the defendant is being sentenced. There is no such correlation or connection in this case between Setters' conviction on the tampering charge and ordering him to pay restitution to DPHHS for. his alleged theft of public assistance benefits. Consequently, the District Court's order did not meet the statutory requirements for the imposition of restitution on a suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>\u00b628  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court exceeded its statutory authority by ordering Setters to pay restitution for a dismissed count as a condition of his sentence. Hence, we reverse the determination of the District Court as to restitution and we order that portion of Setters' sentence vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b629 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b285-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b285-6\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"Ax_\">specially concurs and dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u00b630 I concur with the Court\u2019s conclusion that a district court\u2019s authority to impose sentences in criminal cases is defined and constrained by statute, and I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that there was no \u201cvictim\u201d of the crime of which Setters was convicted and to whom Setters could be ordered to pay restitution over objection. However, for the reasons set forth in my concurring and dissenting opinion in <em>State v. Horton, </em>2001 MT 100, 305 Mont. 242, 25 P.3d 886, I respectfully dissent from this Court\u2019s order striking the restitution provisions from the District Court\u2019s Judgment and Order of Sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"A2b8\">\u00b631 As I proposed in <em>Horton, </em>I would remand to the District Court, with directions that the State be given the option of either accepting the sentence as amended by this Court, or, in the alternative, rescinding the plea agreement for failure of consideration. Should the State elect to rescind, the parties would be returned to their pre-plea agreement status, with Setters withdrawing his plea of guilty and all charges previously dismissed being reinstated.
