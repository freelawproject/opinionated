The Slacks cross-appeal. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">\u00b62 The parties raise the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court\u2019s award of litigation expenses incurred through the settlement of the condemnation case was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred by awarding the Slacks their attorney fees incurred in proving the amount of reasonable and necessary attorney fees in the condemnation action.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">\u00b65 3. Whether the Slacks are entitled to fees for post-trial work and for responding to DOT\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b515-15\">\u00b66 As part of a project to expand U.S. Highway 2 near Kalispell, Montana, into a four-lane highway, DOT sought to acquire a portion of a tract of land owned by the Slacks. DOT initially offered the Slacks $45,150. The Slacks refused and, on July 19, 1993, DOT filed a complaint seeking to condemn their property. The Slacks hired attorney Dale L. McGarvey to represent them. The Slacks entered into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>a contingency fee agreement with McGarvey providing that McGarvey would receive 40% of the entire recovery obtained by settlement or trial in excess of DOT\u2019s initial offer or 50% of the excess obtained on appeal or retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\u00b67 The case proceeded toward a condemnation commission hearing scheduled for June 8, 1994. On May 19, 1994, DOT offered the Slacks $168,069 plus interest and necessary litigation expenses as defined by \u00a7 70-30-306, MCA. The Slacks accepted DOT\u2019s offer and judgment was entered. McGarvey submitted an Amended Memorandum of Litigation Expenses seeking a total of $41,657.03 in necessary litigation expenses incurred in the condemnation action. DOT filed a motion to retax fees and costs contending that the Slacks\u2019 litigation expenses were excessive, unnecessary, and unreasonable. On January 29,1997, DOT offered the Slacks $26,000 to settle the Slacks\u2019 claim for necessary litigation expenses. On January 30, 1997, the Slacks filed a supplemental memorandum of litigation expenses requesting an additional $50,407.84 for expenses incurred in its action for fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\u00b68 The District Court held a total of five days of hearings devoted solely to the issue of the Slacks\u2019 necessary litigation expenses. The court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Judgment on February 21,2000, awarding the Slacks atotal of $115,493 in litigation expenses and interest. With regard to the litigation expenses incurred through the settlement of the condemnation case, the court awarded the Slacks $46,577. Included in this amount was $29,483 for attorney and paralegal fees calculated at 1996 rates. The court also awarded the Slacks the litigation expenses they incurred after the settlement of the condemnation case in proving their necessary litigation expenses. With regard to their expenses incurred in the fee litigation, the court awarded the Slacks $62,547. DOT appeals the District Court\u2019s award of litigation expenses. The Slacks cross-appeal seeking fees for post-trial work and for responding to DOT\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous and a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>In re Estate of Silver, </em>2000 MT 127, \u00b6 16, 299 Mont. 506, \u00b6 16, 1 P.3d 358, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">\u00b610 Was the District Court\u2019s award of litigation expenses incurred through the settlement of the condemnation case excessive?</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">\u00b611 As part of the settlement, DOT agreed to pay the Slacks\u2019 \u201cnecessary expenses of litigation as defined by Section 70-30-306, MCA.\u201d Section 70-30-306, MCA, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-11\">(1) Necessary expenses of litigation ... mean reasonable and necessary attorney fees, expert witness fees, exhibit costs, and court costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-12\">(2) Reasonable and necessary attorney fees are the customary hourly rates for an attorney\u2019s services in the county in which trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>is held. Reasonable and necessary attorney fees shall be computed on an hourly basis and may not be computed on the basis of any contingent fee contract entered into after July 1,1977.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">\u00b612 DOT contends that the District Court\u2019s award of necessary expenses of litigation incurred in the settlement of the condemnation case was excessive because the court awarded attorney fees that were not reasonable and necessary. With regard to the settlement of the condemnation case, the District Court awarded the Slacks $29,483 in attorney and paralegal fees. DOT essentially makes two claims: (1) McGarvey\u2019s attorney and paralegal hours were excessive; and (2) the District Court should have used McGarvey\u2019s hourly rates in effect at the time he rendered services</p>\n<p id=\"Ak9\">A. HOURS</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u00b613 The District Court found that 151.05 attorney hours expended by Dale L. McGarvey, 3.25 attorney hours expended by John L. Heberling, and 204 paralegal hours expended by Mary K. Johnson were reasonable and necessary. DOT argues that the District Court awarded an excessive number of hours given the fact that the case was settled quickly. DOT observes that the case was settled within nine months of the filing of the complaint and before the exchange of appraisals or the holding of a condemnation commission hearing. DOT contends that the parties merely exchanged a small number of \u201cstock\u201d discovery requests and that there were no court hearings. DOT also maintains that the Slacks\u2019 claim included attorney and paralegal hours which were duplicative of tasks performed by expert witnesses and also included paralegal time that duplicated attorney tasks. DOT refers us to the testimony of its two expert witnesses, attorneys Dan Sullivan and Gary Christiansen, to demonstrate that McGarvey\u2019s fee claim was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">\u00b614 Mr. Sullivan worked as a lawyer for the Montana Highway Department from 1960 to 1982 and worked in private practice thereafter. Mr. Sullivan testified that he tried 120 condemnation cases to jury. In seven of those cases he represented private landowners. He represented two private landowners against DOT. One of the two cases in which Mr. Sullivan represented a private client against a DOT condemnation action went to a condemnation commission hearing. He was under the impression that eighty attorney hours were billed in that case to the end of the condemnation commission hearing. The other case settled before a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\u00b615 While working for the Highway Department, Mr. Sullivan undertook a survey of six or seven lawyers whom he believed were competent, experienced, and had represented private landowners in condemnation actions. Mr. Sullivan testified that according to his survey, a competent practitioner should be able to complete a settlement prior to a condemnation commission hearing in about forty to fifty attorney hours. Based on his experience and the study he performed, Mr. Sullivan believed that a reasonable amount of attorney time in the Slack case would have been about 48 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">\u00b616 Mr. Sullivan\u2019s testimony is not sufficient to establish that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>District Court\u2019s determination of reasonable and necessary attorney hours is clearly erroneous. Mr. Sullivan\u2019s conclusion that McGarvey\u2019s fee claim was excessive was based on his personal experience and an informal survey he conducted. With regard to his experience, Mr. Sullivan did not have a large amount of experience representing private landowners in condemnation cases against DOT. Rather, he acquired the vast majority of his condemnation experience as an attorney for the State. He had only represented two private landowners in condemnation actions against DOT. With regard to his study, Mr. Sullivan simply conducted an informal survey in the mid-1970's which consisted of calling some attorneys he knew and asking them for ballpark estimates of attorney hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u00b617 DOT also directs our attention to the testimony of Gary Christiansen, an attorney who has practiced in the Kalispell area for over thirty years. Mr. Christiansen testified that he had handled four condemnation cases during his practice. Mr. Christiansen reviewed McGarvey\u2019s Amended Memorandum of Litigation Expenses and some of the briefing in this case as well as memoranda of litigation expenses in a number of other condemnation cases handled by McGarvey. In Mr. Christiansen\u2019s opinion, McGarvey charged an excessive number of hours, charged some hours that were duplicative, and the format of McGarvey\u2019s memorandum made it difficult to review because the memorandum contained insufficient detail to allow a comparison of the time spent with the corresponding task accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b618 In support of Mr. Christiansen\u2019s conclusions, DOT observes that Mr. Christiansen handled a condemnation case for another private property owner on the same highway project which lasted about the same length of time as the Slacks\u2019 case and involved some similar issues - referred to as the \u201cJump case.\u201d In the Jump case, Mr. Christiansen charged approximately $2,800 in attorney fees. DOT appears to be implying that the Jump case is somehow analogous to the instant case and therefore is evidence that McGarvey\u2019s fee claim was excessive. However, we note that Mr. Christiansen also testified that the Jump case was handled through a \u201cstipulated appraiser approach\u201d in which he and the State agreed on an appraiser and agreed that the condemnation award would be set by the appraisal. Undoubtedly, the stipulated appraiser approach is a simple way to quickly dispose of a condemnation controversy and thus requires less attorney time. The instant case is not analogous; it was not settled through the stipulated appraiser approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u00b619 DOT notes that Mr. Christiansen testified that there were inconsistencies between the times claimed by McGarvey and his paralegal and the time claimed by expert participants to the same meetings. For instance, DOT observes that McGarvey and his paralegal both charged 6.3 hours for a helicopter flight when the helicopter bill was for 1.1 hours. However, the court\u2019s determination that these hours were reasonable and necessary is not clearly erroneous. McGarvey testified that the helicopter flight was necessary to create a video for trial which showed that the Slacks had access to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>a shop building prior to the highway construction project and would not have access after the project. McGarvey contended that he and his paralegal spent more time than the helicopter service because they had to mark the Slacks\u2019 property and access lines before and after DOT\u2019s condemnation for purposes of the video.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\">\u00b620 DOT notes that Mr. Christiansen testified that McGarvey and his paralegal \u201cdouble-billed\u201d when the paralegal accompanied McGarvey to meetings or when both charged for the same task. Once again, we do not believe that the District Court\u2019s determination that these hours were reasonable and necessary is clearly erroneous. McGarvey testified that it was imperative to resolve this case before the highway construction season started in order for the Slacks to be able to continue operating their logging and trucking business out of their shop building. McGarvey testified that in order to resolve this case quickly, he needed to have a series of joint meetings with various combinations of experts to show that the Slacks could lawfully access their shop before the condemnation and to establish how they would gain access to their shop after the condemnation. McGarvey testified that his paralegal attended these meetings in order to coordinate the experts\u2019 activities by establishing task lists and time lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b621  We have previously stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">In the final analysis, the duty of fixing attorney fees in condemnation cases for the prevailing party falls upon the District Court. The purpose of the evidentiary hearing on attorney fees, required since <em>Crncevich v. Georgetown Recreation Corporation </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 113, [120], 541 P.2d 56, 59, is to aid the court in its determination in exercising its discretion to fix reasonable attorney fees. The court, as a jury, is not bound absolutely to the testimony of expert witnesses. It can reduce or increase the figures submitted to it by experts as reasonable attorney fees and as long as its findings are not clearly erroneous, the determination made in its discretion will not be disturbed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\"><em>State v. Helehan </em>(1980), 189 Mont. 339, 346-47, 615 P.2d 925, 930. We conclude that the District Court\u2019s finding that the number of attorney and paralegal hours claimed by the Slacks were reasonable and necessary is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">B. RATE</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">\u00b622 The District Court awarded attorney and paralegal fees at 1996 rates: McGarvey and Heberling\u2019s hourly rates were set at $125 per hour and McGarvey\u2019s paralegal rate was set at $50 per hour. DOT contends that the District Court was without authority to award fees using 1996 rates. DOT argues that fees must be awarded at the hourly rate in effect at the time the services were provided. The Slacks argue that the District Court had the authority to award fees at current rates rather than incurred rates to compensate for delay and inflation. The Slacks also contend that enhancement for delay has been authorized by the majority of federal circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">\u00b623 Whether an award of necessary litigation expenses pursuant to \u00a7 70-30-306, MCA, can be enhanced for delay by using current rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>than historic hourly attorney rates is a matter of first impression. The statute defining the necessary expenses of litigation is silent with regard to whether a court may adjust the necessary expenses of litigation by awarding attorney fees at current rates to account for delay in payment. Section 70-30-306(2), MCA, simply provides that \u201c[rjeasonable and necessary attorney fees are the customary hourly rates for an attorney\u2019s services in the county in which trial is held.\u201d There are no judicial decisions allowing or precluding enhancement for delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u00b624 We see no reason why an enhancement for delay may not be part of a \u201c[rjeasonable and necessary\u201d attorney fee award pursuant to \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA. We note that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, the federal provision which allows a court to grant a \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d to prevailing parties in federal civil rights actions, is also silent with regard to enhancement of fees for delay. However, the United States Supreme Court has held that an appropriate enhancement for delay, \u201cwhether by the application of current rather than historic rates or otherwise,\u201d is within the contemplation of \u00a7 1988. <em>Missouri v. Jenkins </em>(1989), 491 U.S. 274, 283-84, 109 S.Ct. 2463, 2469, 105 L.Ed.2d 229. As the Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">Our cases have repeatedly stressed that attorney\u2019s fees awarded under this statute are to be based on the market rates for the services rendered.... Clearly, compensation received several years after the services were rendered ... is not equivalent to the same dollar amount received reasonably promptly as the legal services are performed, as would normally be the case with private billings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAs\"><em>Jenkins, </em>491 U.S. at 283, 109 S.Ct. at 2469 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\u00b625  Fees awarded pursuant to \u00a7 70-30-306, MCA, are also based on market rates. <em>See </em>\u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA (providing that fees are to be based on \u201ccustomary hourly rates\u201d). Compensation awarded at historic hourly rates years after the services are provided is not equivalent to the same amount received reasonably promptly as the services are performed. Accordingly, we conclude that a district court may award an appropriate enhancement for delay as part of an award of reasonable and necessary attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">C. CONTINGENCY FEE</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">\u00b626 DOT argues that contingent fee agreements violate \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA. The Slacks respond that the statute only precludes the computing of an attorney fee award on the basis of a contingent fee agreement and does not preclude private landowners from entering into contingent fee agreements in condemnation cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">\u00b627 With regard to contingent fee agreements, \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA, provides that \u201c[rjeasonable and necessary attorney fees shall be computed on an hourly basis and may not be computed on the basis of any contingent fee contract entered into after July 1, 1977.\u201d The statute plainly and unambiguously precludes the <em>computation </em>of an award of reasonable and necessary attorney fees on the basis of a contingent fee contract. The statute does not preclude condemnees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>from entering into contingent fee agreements with their attorneys. The District Court did not compute the Slacks\u2019 attorney fees on the basis of a contingent fee contract. Rather, the court computed the Slacks\u2019 reasonable and necessary attorney fees on an hourly basis. We conclude that the District Court applied the statute correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u00b628 Did the District Court err by awarding the Slacks the attorney fees they incurred during the fee litigation?</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\u00b629 The District Court determined that DOT did not \u201cthoroughly investigate, nor did it objectively evaluate, [the Slacks\u2019] claim for litigation expenses ... [and], instead, without such investigation or objective evaluation, made an arbitrary offer of $20,200.\u201d The court held that DOT had pursued litigation over the appropriate amount of necessary litigation expenses in bad faith and, pursuantto \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, the Slacks were entitled to attorney fees and costs incurred in the litigation over fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u00b630 DOT argues that an award of fees is precluded as a matter of law. DOT contends that there cannot be a finding of bad faith when it had a legal duty to defend the action. In this regard, DOT notes that an award of attorney fees must be based on an evidentiary hearing allowing for oral testimony and the opportunity to cross-examine. The Slacks respond that any defense to a fee claim which the DOT has a duty to provide must be consistent with the requirements of Montana\u2019s statutes and constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">\u00b631 We have previously stated that in some circumstances the State may be required to bear a condemnee\u2019s necessary litigation expenses incurred in proving the amount of costs and fees of the underlying condemnation action. In <em>State v. McGuckin </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 81, 788 P.2d 926, we concluded that a district court could award the \u201ccosts and attorney fees incurred in proving necessary and reasonable litigation expenses <em>other than attorney fees\u201d McGuckin, </em>242 Mont. at 87, 788 P.2d at 930 (emphasis in original). With regard to awarding attorney fees incurred in proving attorney fees, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">[A]n award of attorney fees incurred in proving the amount of attorney fees incurred in the litigation is generally not a necessary and reasonable expense of the landowner.... However, in order to achieve an equitable result in extraordinary circumstances, the District Court in its sound discretion may require the opposing party to bear this expense. This would be the rare exception and not the rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-9\"><em>McGuckin, </em>242 Mont. at 86-87, 788 P.2d at 930. DOT has not provided us with any reason to depart from <em>McGuckin. </em>Thus, we hold that the District Court had the authority to award the Slacks their attorney fees incurred in proving fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">\u00b632 The question thus becomes whether the instant case presented the \u201crare exception\u201d in which \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d justified an award of attorney fees incurred in proving the amount of attorney fees incurred in the underlying litigation. <em>See McGuckin, </em>242 Mont. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>87, 788 P.2d at 930. In this regard, DOT maintains that it conducted a reasonable investigation of McGarvey\u2019s claim for fees and expenses and did not simply object to each and every expense item claimed. DOT notes that two of its witnesses reviewed McGarvey\u2019s claim for fees incurred in the underlying litigation and testified that his claim was excessive, inaccurate, and duplicative. The Slacks argue that we should only preclude an award of attorney fees for proving the amount of attorney fees incurred in the underlying litigation in those cases where a district court finds that the amount of fees claimed in the underlying litigation is inflated and unreasonable. The Slacks note that the District Court awarded them all of the necessary litigation expenses they had claimed in the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">\u00b633  The Slacks are not entitled to attorney fees incurred in proving attorney fees simply because the District Court awarded them their entire claim for fees in the underlying litigation. This is certainly not one of the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d we were referring to in <em>McGuckin. </em>Rather, we were referring to those circumstances in which the State\u2019s objection to the condemnee\u2019s fee claim is unreasonable. <em>See McGuckin, </em>242 Mont. at 85, 788 P.2d at 929 (observing that allowing fees for proving attorney fees in extraordinary circumstances prevents the State from simply objecting to every expense claimed even if all expenses claimed were reasonable). We believe that the District Court abused its discretion in awarding the Slacks their attorney fees incurred in proving attorney fees. DOT\u2019s objection to the Slacks\u2019 claim for fees was not unreasonable. As DOT notes, an award of attorney fees must be based on a hearing allowing for oral testimony, the introduction of exhibits, and the opportunity for a responsible party to cross-examine the reasonableness of the attorney fees claimed. <em>See Helehan, </em>189 Mont. at 346, 615 P.2d at 929. At that hearing, DOT presented two qualified expert witnesses who both testified that McGarvey\u2019s fee statement was excessive and duplicative. Although the District Court did not find that DOT\u2019s evidence compelled a reduction in fees, we would be hard-pressed to characterize DOT\u2019s objections as unreasonable. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s award of attorney fees incurred in proving the amount of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u00b634. Are the Slacks entitled to fees for post-trial work and on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"A5i\">\u00b635  The Slacks request that we remand this case to the District Court for the purpose of awarding them their fees incurred in post-trial work and in responding to DOT\u2019s appeal. We decline to do so. Although the District Court\u2019s findings justifying its award of necessary litigation expenses were not clearly erroneous, the court\u2019s fee award was clearly generous. The District Court granted McGarvey everything he requested despite the fact that DOT presented two witnesses who testified that McGarvey\u2019s claims were excessive and duplicative. The Slacks\u2019 claim for attorney fees incurred in post-trial work and on appeal is hereby denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>\u00b636 Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"ACJD\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY and JUSTICE COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b523-4\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"ABg\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"Aumu\">\u00b637 I concur in the resolution of issues two and three. I dissent as to the resolution of issue one: Were the hours expended by the Slacks\u2019 attorney and paralegal reasonable?</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\u00b638 The DOT presented expert testimony from two witnesses, Mr. Dan Sullivan and Mr. Gary Christiansen. Both Sullivan and Christiansen are very experienced attorneys. Very few attorneys in the state have more experience in condemnation law than Mr. Sullivan. Mr. Sullivan has represented both the State and private landowners and has tried 120 condemnation cases to juries. After reviewing the history of this case, which was settled within nine months of the filing of the complaint and before exchange of appraisals or the holding of a condemnation commission hearing, he concluded that a reasonable amount of attorney time would have been approximately 48 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"AjW\">\u00b639 Mr. Christiansen, an attorney of some 30 years experience, testified that he had tried four condemnation cases and had handled a condemnation case for another private property owner (the \u201cJump\u201d case) on the same highway project. The \u201cJump\u201d case involved some of the same issues as the Slack case and was resolved in roughly the same amount of time. The attorney fees were approximately $2,800. The majority points out that the Jump case, contrary to the Slack case, was resolved on the basis of the stipulated appraisal approach. It should be noted, however, that although the Slacks were not proceeding on the basis of stipulated appraisals, their claim was resolved before the exchange of any appraisals.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\u00b640 Christiansen testified that the Slacks\u2019 counsel charged for excessive hours, charged duplicative hours and that he and the paralegal both charged 6.3 hours for a helicopter flight when the helicopter bill was for 1.1 hours. Christiansen also testified that the Slacks\u2019 counsel and his paralegal both charged for the same task when the paralegal accompanied Mr. McGarvey to meetings. Mr. McGarvey testified that he had his paralegal accompany him to these meetings to coordinate the experts\u2019 activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u00b641 The DOT also points out that the paralegal billed for 38 hours of \u201creviewing the file,\u201d spent 11.5 hours preparing for a meeting with an appraiser and charged over 20 hours for preparing drawings which duplicated work done by the Slacks\u2019 engineers.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">\u00b642 The Slacks were entitled to \u201cnecessary expenses of litigation\u201d as defined by \u00a7 70-30-306, MCA. Section 70-30-306, MCA, provides that necessary expenses of litigation mean \u201creasonable and necessary attorney fees, expert witness fees, exhibit costs, and court costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">\u00b643 Although the District Court, in fixing attorney fees in condemnation cases \u201cis not bound absolutely to the testimony of expert witnesses,\u201d <em>State v. Helehan </em>(1980), 189 Mont. 339, 347, 615 P.2d 925, 930, the District Court here was presented with two exceptionally well-qualified expert witnesses, one of whom, Mr. Christiansen, resolved a condemnation claim on the same highway project for 1/10 the fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>awarded to the Slacks\u2019 counsel. Both experts concluded that the hours were excessive and their opinions were not rebutted by any independent expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">\u00b644 The District Court\u2019s conclusion that the hours were reasonable and necessary was not supported by substantial evidence. I am left with a definite and firm conviction that the trial court made a mistake. <em>Yellowstone II Dev. Group v. First Amer. Title Co., </em>2001 MT 41, \u00b6 34, 304 Mont. 223, \u00b6 34, 20 P.3d 755, \u00b6 34. In my view, the award of $29,483 in attorney fees in a case which was resolved without a hearing and within nine months of filing the complaint and which involved a paralegal billing a significant number of hours for work which was duplicative of work performed by attorneys, engineers and appraisers was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">\u00b645 For the above reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b524-6\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the concurring and dissenting opinion of JUSTICE LEAPHART.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b524-7\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AqG\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">\u00b646 I concur with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the District Court did not err when it found the number of hours claimed by Slacks\u2019 attorneys reasonable and enhanced fees for delay by awarding them at the attorney\u2019s 1996 rates. While Justice Leaphart\u2019s opinion to the contrary capably sets forth the evidence relied on by the appellants, it ignores the evidence submitted by Slacks which is the evidence on which the District Court justifiably based its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">\u00b647 Furthermore, I concur with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA, does not prohibit condemnees from entering into contingent fee agreements with their attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa6\">\u00b648 However, I dissent from that part of the majority opinion which, in reliance on <em>State v. McGuckin </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 81, 788 P.2d 926, reverses the District Court\u2019s award of fees incurred to prove Slacks\u2019 \u201cnecessary expenses of litigation.\u201d I conclude first that <em>McGuckin </em>does not require reversal of the District Court\u2019s award and second that, to the extent arguably applicable, <em>McGuckin </em>was incorrectly decided because it is logically inconsistent and based on the false premise that an attorney\u2019s efforts to prove the reasonable value of \u201cnecessary expenses of litigation\u201d are for his or her own benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">\u00b649 What is important to note from <em>McGuckin </em>is its recognition that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avm_\">The State\u2019s power of eminent domain is controlled by Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution which provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-13\">\u201cSection 29. Eminent Domain. Private property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation to the full extent of the loss having been first made to or paid into court for the owner. In the event of litigation, just compensation shall include necessary expenses of litigation to be awarded by the court when the private property owner prevails.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-14\"><em>The policy underlying the constitutional provision is to make the land owner whole after the State takes his property. </em>This constitutional mandate is further embodied in the condemnation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>statutes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\">\u201c(1) <em>The condemnor shall, </em>within 30 days after an appeal is perfected from the commissioner\u2019s award or report or not more than 60 days after waiver of appointment of condemnation commissioners, <em>submit to condemnee a written final offer of judgment for the property to be condemned, together with the necessary expenses of condemnee then accrued </em>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">\u201c(2) In the event of litigation and when the private property owner prevails by receiving an award in excess of the final offer of the condemnor, the court shall award the necessary expenses of litigation to the condemnee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">Section 70-30-305, MCA. (Emphasis added.) Necessary expenses of litigation are defined as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">\u201c ... reasonable and necessary attorney fees, expert witness fees, exhibit costs, and court costs ....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">242 Mont. at 84 and 85, 788 P.2d 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">\u00b650 In <em>McGuckin, </em>the State Department of Highways contended that pursuant to \u00a7 70-30-305(1), MCA, the statutory authority for an award of attorney fees to a prevailing condemnee, a landowner is entitled to only those expenses of litigation accrued before a settlement is reached. However, the Court correctly disagreed and gave the following explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">For us to strictly construe the terms of the settlement agreement as unequivocally precluding an award of any expenses incurred after the date of settlement could result in denying a landowner just compensation in direct contravention of Article I, Section 29 of the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">If they are precluded from recovering any additional expenses after the date the initial settlement was reached, there is nothing to deter the State from making such an unreasonable objection in all cases and hope the Court might agree with them. The end result could deny the landowner a net recovery. On the other hand, the landowner and counsel should not be allowed to benefit from making unreasonable and inflated expense claims that force the State to object and lead to further litigation upon which a landowner\u2019s counsel can claim further fees ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">242 Mont. at 85, 788 P.2d 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">\u00b651 With that much of the <em>McGuckin </em>opinion, I agree. The Constitution requires that condemnees be made whole when their property is taken. They cannot be made whole unless they are awarded reasonable costs of litigation when litigation is necessary in order to recover reasonable compensation for their land. Furthermore, they cannot be made whole, unless they are awarded additional fees and costs, when additional litigation is necessary in order to recover the initial costs of litigation. That fact is no more true because the State acts unreasonably than when the State refuses to pay reasonable expenses of litigation on some arguably reasonable basis. In either event the attorney\u2019s efforts are necessary to recover the expenses of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>litigation and unless the claimant is compensated for those efforts, his or her net recovery is reduced. Therefore, I strongly disagree with this Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>McGuckin </em>\u201c... that an award of attorney fees incurred in proving the amount of attorney fees incurred in the litigation is generally not a necessary and reasonable expense of the landowner.\u201d 242 Mont, at 86, 788 P.2d 926. That conclusion is totally inconsistent with the majority\u2019s conclusion in the same case that \u201c... in order to achieve an equitable result in extraordinary circumstances, the District Court in its sound discretion may require the opposing party to bear this expense ....\u201d 242 Mont. at 87, 788 P.2d 926. There was no equitable authority cited in <em>McGuckin </em>for an award of attorney fees. The only authority for attorney fees discussed in <em>McGuckin </em>was Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution and \u00a7 70-30-305, MCA. Both require an award of attorney fees to make the condemnee whole. Neither conditions the award of attorney fees on the nature of the condemnor\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">\u00b652 Another example of the majority\u2019s logical inconsistency in <em>McGuckin </em>is its conclusion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">However, we conclude that costs and attorney fees incurred in proving necessary and reasonable litigation expenses <em>other than attorney fees </em>are chargeable to the client and to the other party, taking into consideration the other party\u2019s litigation expenses in defending other costs and attorney fees disallowed or unnecessary and unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">242 Mont, at 87, 788 P.2d 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\u00b653 Section 70-30-306, MCA, which defines \u201cnecessary expenses of litigation\u201d includes both attorney fees and costs. It makes no distinction between them for purposes of the condemnee\u2019s right to recovery. Nor was there any reason for this court to distinguish between the circumstances under which.costs could be recovered as opposed to attorney fees. An award of both is necessary to ensure that the condemnee is made whole and when both are necessarily incurred to prove a property owner\u2019s \u201cnecessary expenses of litigation\u201d both should be awarded. The constitution requires no less.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">\u00b654 The only explanation I can find in the <em>McGuckin </em>opinion for this logically inconsistent result is the mistaken premise that the efforts of an attorney to prove the value of attorney fees incurred by his client are solely for the attorney\u2019s benefit. That opinion states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXE\">With respect to attorney fees incurred in proving attorney fees, it is apparent that a landowner\u2019s counsel is acting primarily in his own interest rather than for the benefit of his client. The landowner\u2019s condemnation award already secured, the outcome of the litigation expense hearing becomes important to the attorney as well as the client, and with respect to attorney fees awarded, any result secured by the services of the attorney would be for his benefit rather than the client. <em>See, e.g., Glenview Park District v. Redemptorist Fathers of Glenview </em>(1980), 89 Ill.App.3d 623. 45. Ill.Dec. 29. 412 N.E.2d. 162.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>242 Mont. at 86, 788 P.2d 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\">\u00b655 Nothing could be more incorrect than the preceding statement and the facts in this case are a perfect example. Slacks were obligated to pay their attorney a contingent fee equal to 40% of the amount recovered above DOT\u2019s original offer. The majority agrees that contingent fees are a matter between the attorney and client and are not precluded by \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">\u00b656 In this case the DOT originally offered $45,150. However, due to the efforts of Slacks\u2019 attorney, ultimately agreed to pay $168,069. The fee that Slacks owed their attorney for recovery of that amount was at least $49,167.60. That fee was owed regardless of how much Slacks\u2019 attorney was able to recover from the State for his \u201cnecessary expenses of litigation.\u201d In other words, when Slacks claimed $41,657 as reasonable expenses and the State offered $26,000, Slacks\u2019 attorney had little personal incentive to litigate the additional amount recovered. The primary benefit was Slacks\u2019 because most of the additional amount by which they were compensated for expenses, including attorney fees, increased their net recovery and brought them closer to being made \u201cwhole.\u201d This Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>McGuckin </em>that an attorney\u2019s efforts to see that his client receives the full amount of his necessary expenses of litigation are for the attorney\u2019s benefit rather than the client\u2019s benefit is completely wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u00b657 For all these reasons, I would reverse <em>McGuckin </em>and hold that because of the constitutional obligation that property owners whose land has been condemned be made whole, property owners are also entitled to an award of those attorney fees incurred to prove \u201cnecessary expenses of litigation\u201d unless those expenses have been claimed unreasonably. For the same reasons, I dissent from the majority\u2019s denial of those fees and costs incurred in post-trial proceedings and on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\u00b658 Howev\u00e9r, having so concluded, I also disagree that the claim in this case is barred by <em>McGuckin. </em>The court in <em>McGuckin </em>seemed to be concerned with two extreme situations. The first, where the State unreasonably objects to every expense item claimed and the second, where the landowner and counsel make inflated expense claims that force the State to object. The opinion infers that in the <em>McGuckin </em>case, the landowner\u2019s claims were unreasonable and the State\u2019s objections were reasonable. Here, the landowners\u2019 claimed expenses were not unreasonable. The full amount was awarded by the District Court and that award has been affirmed by this Court. Therefore, the second extreme with which this Court was concerned in <em>McGuckin </em>is not present in this case and there is no justification for applying <em>McGuckin </em>to bar the landowners\u2019 claim for those costs and fees incurred to prove his necessary expenses of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">\u00b659 For these reasons, I concur in part and dissent in part from the majority opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
