The mother appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in terminating the mother\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b63 In December of 1997, the Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) took M.F.B., D.A.B., M.S.B., and S.L.B. under protective custody based on the then-most recent in a long history of referrals regarding abuse in the family. Ranging in age from 8 to 12 years old, M.F.B., D.A.B., M.S.B., and S.L.B. were the four youngest of six children. At that time, M.S.B. told a DPHHS case worker that her mother spanked the children on their heads, arms, stomachs, legs, and faces with a plastic ladle and their dad spanked them with a belt. She also told the case worker that her brother, D.A.B., had threatened her with a knife. DPHHS had received a referral on the family a month earlier, when 12-year-old M.F.B. dragged 8-year-old S.L.B. out of the school lunch room by the hair. S.L.B. told a DPHHS case worker that his dad and older brother fought with knives, his dad dragged him and his siblings by the hair, and his brother D.A.B. held a knife to M.S.B.\u2019s throat. The children\u2019s oldest brother had admitted in 1995 to having had sexual intercourse with M.S.B. beginning when she was about a year old. That brother had not yet undergone sex offender treatment and remained with the parents when the four youngest children were removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\u00b64 Under a 1998 treatment plan promulgated by DPHHS, the mother was to obtain individual therapy with an approved therapist. Goals of the therapy were to gain a clear understanding of how to prevent her children from further emotional, physical, and sexual abuse and neglect, and to address parenting issues, her own self-esteem, her prior family history, and her dependency on her husband at the expense of her children\u2019s safety. The mother also was required to attend parenting classes as recommended by DPHHS and to participate in weekly supervised visitation with her four youngest children and in her oldest son\u2019s weekly sex offender counseling. A counselor advised her that she might have to choose between her children and her husband, whose organic brain dysfunction was blamed for his frequent violent outbursts. The mother initially chose to stay with her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"ACj\">\u00b65 During the early part of 1999, as part of reunification efforts associated with family therapy, the children were returned to their parents\u2019 home for several overnight visits. Afterwards, M.S.B. reported to school officials two instances in which her father had harshly verbally abused her and her mother had not intervened. The mother did not report these incidents to the family\u2019s therapist until the therapist questioned her about M.S.B.\u2019s reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">\u00b66 In late July or early August of 1999, the mother left her husband and the family home in Thompson Falls, Montana, and moved to a shelter in Kalispell, Montana. The father\u2019s parental rights were terminated by default in October of 1999. The District Court held a hearing on DPHHS\u2019s request for termination of the mother\u2019s parental rights in January and February of 2000. At that time, the mother was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>living in a one-room apartment and searching for a job. M.F.B. was living in a youth group home and D.A.B., M.S.B., and S.L.B. were living in foster care homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">\u00b67 After the hearing, the District Court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order terminating the mother\u2019s parental rights. The court found that, from the time the mother moved to Kalispell in the summer of 1999 until the hearings in January and February of 2000, she had \u201cat best, sporadic contact with the children who remain in Sanders County.\u201d The court found the mother had not complied with the treatment plan, that her 15-month failure to do so was conduct unlikely to change within a reasonable time, and that continuation of the parent-child relationship would likely result in continued abuse or neglect of the children. The court further found the mother \u201cis not willing or able to carry out the tasks associated with parenting due to her mental or emotional illness.\u201d Finally, the court found DPHHS had made reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the children and to make it possible for the children to return home. The mother appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err in terminating the mother\u2019s parental rights to M.F.B., D.A.B., M.S.B., and S.L.B.?</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u00b69 This Court\u2019s standards in reviewing a district court\u2019s termination of parental rights are whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>In re R.B.O., </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 272, 277, 921 P.2d 268, 271 (citations omitted). A finding is clearly erroneous only if it is not supported by substantial evidence or, if so supported, the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence or this Court is left with a definite or firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>In re C.F. </em>, 2001 MT 19, \u00b6 11, 304 Mont. 134, \u00b6 11, 18 P.3d 1014, \u00b6 11 (citations omitted). The mother, however, points to our language <em>in In re B.F., </em>2000 MT 231, \u00b6 7, 301 Mont. 281, \u00b6 7, 8 P.3d 790, \u00b6 7, regarding clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\u00b610 We recently reaffirmed our \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review of trial court findings of fact in cases like that presently before us. <em>See In Re the Matter of A. </em>C., 2001 MT 126, \u00b6 36, 305 Mont. 404, \u00b6 36, 27 P.3d 960, \u00b6 36. We again clarify here that \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d relates to a party\u2019s burden of proof in the trial court in certain cases. <em>See, e.g., In re T.B., </em>1999 MT 174, \u00b6 13, 295 Mont. 234, \u00b6 13, 983 P.2d 929, \u00b6 13; <em>see also Wareing v. Schreckendgust </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 196, 206, 930 P.2d 37, 43. Our standard of review of a trial court\u2019s findings of fact remains the clearly erroneous test. <em>See T. B., </em>\u00b6 12. We proceed, then, to apply our standards of review to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">\u00b611 The following provisions of \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, were applied in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">(1) The court may order a termination of the parent-child legal relationship upon a finding that any of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>(f) the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care and both of the following exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-4\">(1) an appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the court has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">(ii) the conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">(2) In determining whether the conduct or condition of the parents is unlikely to change within a reasonable time, the court shall enter a finding that continuation of the parent-child legal relationship will likely result in continued abuse or neglect or that the conduct or the condition of the parents renders the parents unfit, unable, or unwilling to give the child adequate parental care. In making the determinations, the court shall consider but is not limited to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">(a) emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency of the parent of a duration or nature as to render the parent unlikely to care for the ongoing physical, mental, and emotional needs of the child within a reasonable time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">(b) a history of violent behavior by the parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">(c) excessive use of intoxicating liquor or of a narcotic or dangerous drug that affects the parent\u2019s ability to care and provide for the child; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-10\">(d) present judicially ordered long-term confinement of the parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-11\">(3) In considering any of the factors in subsection (2) in terminating the parent-child legal relationship, the court shall give primary consideration to the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">\u00b612 The mother does not dispute that M.F.B., D.A.B., M.S.B., and S.L.B. were adjudicated youths in need of care pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA. She asserts, however, that the District Court erred in its \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f)(i) and (ii), MCA, findings that she had not complied with the requirements of her treatment plan and that her condition is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">\u00b613 The District Court\u2019s findings do not specifically address which tasks in the treatment plan the mother had failed to complete. The court did find that, after moving to Kalispell, the mother \u201chad, at best, sporadic contact with the children who remain in Sanders County.\u201d The court\u2019s \u201csporadic contact\u201d finding implicates both of the treatment plan tasks on which DPHHS introduced evidence at trial: the mother\u2019s therapy task and her weekly visitation with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-14\">\u00b614 The specific provision of the treatment plan regarding therapy states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-15\">[The mother] will obtain individual therapy with a [DPHHS] approved therapist. She will continue in therapy until she can demonstrate that she has a clear understanding of how to protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>her children from further emotional, physical, sexual abuse, and neglect. She will put this into practice for a minimum of six months, at which time all professionals involved will assess [her] ability to protect her children within a reasonable amount of time. She will also address parenting issues, her self-esteem, prior family history, signs of sexual abuse, and her dependency on [the children\u2019s father] at the cost of her children\u2019s safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">The mother points out that licensed clinical professional counselor Juanita Triplett recommended temporary legal custody be extended to allow her one additional year of continued counseling. The mother also points out that psychotherapist Cindie Jobe opined at the hearing that the mother was ready to parent the children because she had sufficiently addressed her dependent personality disorder and was no longer dependent on the children\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\u00b615 The testimony on which the mother relies, however, does not address the portion of the therapy objective in her treatment plan which required that she put into practice what she learned in therapy for a minimum of six months. Nor does it fully represent the evidence of record on whether she had complied with that objective of the treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\u00b616 In addition to the testimony upon which the mother relies, Jobe stated she did not know how the mother could have put into practice what she had learned in therapy for six months, because she had not had custody of her children since the plan had been put into place. The mother had discontinued therapy with Triplett when she left Thompson Falls, at which time she was making slow progress. Similarly, while Jobe subsequently had counseled the mother individually in Kalispell, the mother had not seen M.F.B., D.A.B., M.S.B., or S.L.B. since she had moved there. As a result, Jobe had never observed interaction between the mother and her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\u00b617 Diane Morrin, another licensed professional counselor who testified at the hearing, had counseled the mother both before and after she left the father and had observed interactions between the mother and her children. According to Morrin, the mother focused on her own needs rather than on those of her children and had extreme difficulty extending herself to her children. Morrin explained that the process of learning to change behavior must take place at three levels to be successful: first, at the intellectual or cognitive level; second, at the contemplative level where the person tries to integrate concepts of change into her life; and, finally, at the level of actually putting new behaviors into practice. In Morrin\u2019s observations, the mother had not progressed beyond the first level. At the time of the termination hearing, Morrin did not believe it was in the children\u2019s best interests to be returned to their mother\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">\u00b618 The DPHHS case worker presented the only professional testimony specifically addressing whether the mother completed the treatment plan. The case worker testified that although the children had been in foster care for over two years, the mother had not yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>complied with the therapy task of the treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">\u00b619  Regarding the differences in opinion among the counselors on whether the mother had made the requisite progress in therapy to be ready to parent her children, thus effectively meeting the therapy treatment plan objective, the existence of conflicting evidence does not preclude a trial court\u2019s determination that clear and convincing evidence exists to support a finding of fact. <em>In re </em>C.B., 2001 MT 42, \u00b6 15, 304 Mont. 252, \u00b6 15, 20 P.3d 117, \u00b6 15, citing In <em>re J.L. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 284, 290, 922 P.2d 459, 462. Moreover, the credibility of witnesses is exclusively within the province of the finder of fact. C.B., \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\u00b620 The provision of the treatment plan regarding visitation was \u201c[the mother and father] will have weekly supervised visits with their children.\u201d The mother does not contest that she failed to meet this requirement. She relates that she moved to Kalispell for purposes of securing job training and employment; that she had no vehicle or other means of transportation from the time she left her husband through the time of the hearings; and that she was financially unable to have a telephone until November of 1999, but that she maintained contact with the children through letters and e-mail. Her argument seems to be that her failure to meet this goal was not her fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\u00b621 The mother\u2019s caseworker, however, pointed out that, although the family had two vehicles, the mother did not attempt to take one when she left the father. The case worker also testified that she had contact with the mother only once, by telephone, from the time the mother moved to Kalispell in the summer of 1999 until the hearing in February of 2000. During that time, the case worker contacted the mother at M.S.B.\u2019s request to ask why she had not been in contact with her children. The mother responded she had e-mailed two of the children. Nothing in the record indicates the mother requested any assistance from DPHHS in meeting the weekly visitation goal or in otherwise staying in touch with her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">\u00b622  We conclude the District Court\u2019s finding that the mother did not complete her treatment plan is supported by substantial evidence that she did not complete the therapy task or the visitation task of that plan. We further conclude that this finding is not otherwise clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">\u00b623 The District Court also found the mother \u201cis not willing or able to carry out the tasks associated with parenting due to her mental or emotional illness\u201d and that she \u201chad fifteen months to comply with the treatment plan and has not done so and the Court finds that this conduct of [the mother] rendering her unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d With regard to the District Court\u2019s finding that her condition was unlikely to change within a reasonable time, the mother points out DPHHS failed to introduce any expert testimony regarding the needs of her children. On that basis, she contends the requirements of \u00a7 41-3-609(2)(a), MCA, were not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">\u00b624  DPHHS did, however, introduce testimony of foster parents of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>two of the children that those children\u2019s behavior and school performance had improved since they were placed in foster care. Moreover, counselor Morrin\u2019s testimony indicated that the mother\u2019s longstanding dependent personality disorder-or, in the words of \u00a7 41-3-609(2)(a), MCA, her \u201cemotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency\u2019-rendered her unfit to care for <em>any </em>child\u2019s physical, mental, and emotional needs within a reasonable time. We conclude the District Court\u2019s finding that the mother\u2019s condition was unlikely to change within a reasonable time is supported by substantial evidence and is not otherwise clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">\u00b625 We hold the District Court did not err in terminating the mother\u2019s parental rights to M.F.B., D.A.B., M.S.B., and S.L.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\u00b626 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b513-6\">JUSTICES REGNIER, COTTER, LEAPHART and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
