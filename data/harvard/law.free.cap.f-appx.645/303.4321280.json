Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999) (citation omitted). \u201cDismissal is appropriate if it is clear from the face of the complaint that the claims asserted are barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-20\">As Congress has not provided \u00e1 statute of limitations in \u00a7 1983 cases, the federal courts borrow from the forum state\u2019s general personal-injury limitations period. <em>See Owens v. Okure, </em>488 U.S. 235, 249-50, 109 S.Ct. 573, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989). In Texas, the pertinent limitations period is two years from the day the cause of action accrues. <em>See </em>Tex. Crv. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7 16.003(a) (West 2005); <em>see also Pete v. Metcalfe, </em>8 F.3d 214, 217 (5th Cir.1993) (borrowing two-year statute of limitations period from Texas law for \u00a7 1983 case).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-21\">Although state law controls the limitations period for \u00a7 1983 claims, federal law determines when a cause of action accrues. <em>Pete, </em>8 F.3d at 217. \u201cThe federal standard provides that a cause of action under section 1983 accrues when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of the action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotations marks omitted). Cau-ley does not dispute the district court\u2019s finding that his cause of action against the individuals accrued no later than January 12, 2011. Cauley also does not dispute the district court\u2019s finding that he first raised his claims against the individual defendants when he filed the amended complaint on May 8, 2013 \u2014 or more than two years after his cause of action accrued. Therefore, unless Cauley is excused from compliance with the applicable two-year limitations period, his claims against the individual defendants must be dismissed as time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-22\">Citing <em>Gillig v. Nike, Inc., </em>602 F.3d 1354 (Fed.Cir.2010), Cauley argues that the statute of limitations for his claims should have been tolled while an earlier lawsuit was pending. However, Cauley has failed to show how the earlier dismissed lawsuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>was a \u201cpredicate action,\u201d or how the extant lawsuit \u201cis contingent on the [earlier] action\u2019s determination of rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1358. Cauley also argues that the statute of limitations should have been equitably tolled because he was placed in segregation and was denied access to legal materials for 150 days. While Texas courts recognize that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies under certain circumstances, <em>see Bailey v. Gardner, </em>154 S.W.3d 917, 920 (Tex.App.2005), Cauley has failed to establish that he is entitled to equitable tolling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b329-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
