Parson <em>pro se </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of both his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines and his subsequent motion for reconsideration. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">A district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements. <em>Id. </em>A reduction is inconsistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements and is not authorized if the retroactive amendment does not actually lower the defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range due to a statutory provision, such as a mandatory minimum. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) &amp; cmt. n. 1(A); <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1077-78 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Here, the district court properly denied Parson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. At his original sentencing, Parson\u2019s guidelines range of life and his life sentence were based on the mandatory life sentence in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) because Parson had three prior felony drug convictions. Thus Amendment 782, which lowered the base offense levels for most drug offenses, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 782, had no effect on Parson\u2019s guidelines range or his sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) (stating that a mandatory minimum sentence is the guidelines sentence when it is greater than the high end of the guidelines range).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the district court was not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce Parson\u2019s sentence. <em>See Mills, </em>613 F.3d at 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">For the same reasons, the district court also did not abuse its discretion by denying Parson\u2019s motion for reconsideration, which argued incorrectly that Parson was not sentenced under the mandatory life sentence in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">Parson also argues that: (1) the magistrate judge who presided over Parson\u2019s initial appearance failed to inform him of the nature of the charges; (2) Parson\u2019s indictment was insufficient because it did not charge him with violating \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A); (3) prior to Parson\u2019s trial, the government failed to comply with the procedural requirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851; (4) at his original sentencing, the government failed to produce sufficient evidence of the drug quantity; and (5) at his original sentencing, the district court erred by treating the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory. These issues are outside the limited scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 831, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2694, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). To the extent Parson contends the prosecutors representing the government in this appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>committed any misconduct, we find this claim meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Finally, Parson has not shown that the district court judge was required to recuse <em>sua sponte </em>in Parson\u2019s case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Parson\u2019s allegations of bias concern only the district court\u2019s actions in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and a subsequent motion for a certified copy of his sentencing transcript. Parson does not allege bias from an extrajudicial source or point to any judicial remarks indicating bias against Parson. <em>See Thomas v. Tenneco Packaging Co., </em>293 F.3d 1306, 1329 (11th Cir.2002) (explaining that the kind of bias requiring recusal generally must stem from an extrajudicial source unless the judge\u2019s remarks in the judicial proceedings demonstrate such pervasive bias that it constitutes bias against a party). Moreover, Parson provides no evidence supporting his allegations of bias or of a conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">For these reasons, the district court properly denied Parson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and motion for reconsideration and was under no obligation to recuse <em>sua </em>sponte.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b947-7\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b947-8\">. Notably, even if Parson were not subject to \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)'s mandatory life sentence, Amendment 782 still would not have lowered his guidelines range. Parson\u2019s base offense level remains level 38 after Amendment 782 because at the original sentencing the district court found that Parson\u2019s drug conspiracy offense involved 150 kilograms of cocaine base. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (2015) (assigning an offense level of 38 if the offense involved 25.2 kilograms or more of cocaine base). Parson\u2019s claims that the sentencing court did not make a drug quantity finding and did not apply the mandatory minimum sentence are flatly refuted by the sentencing transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b948-19\">. Where, as here, a party fails to seek recusal of a judge before the district court, we review the judge\u2019s decision to not recuse <em>sua sponte </em>for plain error. <em>Hamm v. Members of the Bd. of Regents of the State of Fla., </em>708 F.2d 647, 651 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b948-20\">. Parson\u2019s \"Supplemental Affidavit of Stacy LaDrake Parson in Support of Appellant's Response and Reply Brief,\u201d construed as a motion for reconsideration of the Court\u2019s order dated December 29, 2015 denying his motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-21\">In addition to the grounds discussed in the Court\u2019s December 29, 2015 order, we note the following. When Parson filed his <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the \u25a0 district court appointed the federal public defender to represent him. After the district court denied the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and Parson\u2019s notice of appeal was filed, Parson filed a <em>pro se </em>motion seeking to have his appointed counsel discharged on appeal because his counsel had informed Parson that he would file an <em>Anders </em>brief. The district court' granted Parson\u2019s request, and Parson has represented himself on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
