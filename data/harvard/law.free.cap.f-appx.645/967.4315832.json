First, Yusim argues that the Department of Labor improperly refused his request for it to petition a district court to withdraw the reference of his STAA retaliation claim from a bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction once his former employer, Midnight Sun Tours (\u201cMidnight Sun\u201d), declared bankruptcy. Second, Yusim argues that the ARB improperly dismissed his STAA complaint because it should have considered the merits of his STAA claim. After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we dismiss the petition for review in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">When considering a petition for review from a STAA proceeding, we apply the standards of review from the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). <em>Koch Foods, Inc. v. Sec\u2019y, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>712 F.3d 476, 480 (11th Cir.2013). The ARB\u2019s legal conclusions must be affirmed unless they are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance with the law. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). The ARB\u2019s factual findings must be accepted unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 706(2)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">We are obliged to review our own jurisdiction whenever we may be lacking jurisdiction and determine our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Alexis v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>431 F.3d 1291, 1293 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-12\">A valid claim under the APA must challenge an agency action, which includes an agency order or relief, the denial thereof, or the failure to act. <em>Fanin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>572 F.3d 868, 877 (11th Cir.2009); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(13). The APA also grants a court the authority to compel an agency to conduct an action that has been \u201cunlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(1). An APA claim premised on an agency\u2019s failure to act can only proceed if the plaintiff asserts that the agency failed to take a discrete action that it was required to take. <em>Fanin, </em>572 F.3d at 877-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-13\">An employee who alleges that he was discharged in violation of the anti-retaliation provision in the STAA can file a complaint with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d). 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105(b)(1); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1978.103(c). After an investigation, OSHA issues written findings about whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the employer violated the STAA. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1978.105(a). A party may object to the written findings and request a hearing before an ALJ. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1978.106(a). If the employer objects, then the Department of Labor ordinarily acts as the prosecuting party before the ALJ. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>\u00a7 1978.108(a)(1). Otherwise, the Department of Labor \u201cmay participate as a party or participate as amicus curiae at any stage of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id,</em></p>\n<p id=\"AXb\">We lack jurisdiction under the APA to review the Department of Labor\u2019s decision not to intervene in Yusim\u2019s attempts to withdraw the reference of his STAA claim from a'bankruptcy court because it was not a discrete action that the agency was required to perform by law. Yusim has not shown that the agency was required to intervene on his behalf. <em>See Fanin, </em>572 F.3d at 877-78. Indeed, the Department of Labor has discretion to decide whether to participate as a party in a STAA proceeding when the complainant objects to OSHA\u2019s written findings. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1978.108(a)(1). Therefore, we dismiss Yusim\u2019s petition for review to the extent that he challenges the Department of Labor\u2019s refusal to intervene on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"A6zk\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"AfL\">The STAA prohibits an employer from discharging the driver of a commercial motor vehicle for accurately reporting his hours on duty. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105(a)(1)(C); <em>see also </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31101(2) (defining an employee for purposes of the STAA). If the Department of Labor concludes that an employer violated 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105(a), then it can take affirmative action to abate the violation, reinstate the employee to his prior position, and order the employer to pay compensatory damages, punitive damages, and reasonable costs. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 31105(b)(3)(A)-(C). The STAA defines an employer as a person engaged in a business affecting commerce that owns or leases a commercial motor vehicle. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 31101(3).</p>\n<p id=\"AYkf\">The ARB\u2019s legal conclusion that Yusim\u2019s complaint should be dismissed was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law. The ARB could not provide any of the relief authorized under \u00a7 31105(b)(3) once Midnight Sun was no longer operating as a business and had no assets from which damages could be paid. Indeed, Midnight Sun was not an employer under the STAA at the time of the ARB\u2019s decision because it did not operate a business that owned or leased a commercial motor vehicle. Yusim argues that the ARB could have granted him relief by declaring that he accurately reported his hours, but the STAA does not state that the Department of Labor can provide such declaratory relief. Because the ARB\u2019s decision to dismiss the STAA complaint was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law, we deny Yusim\u2019s petition for review to the extent that he challenges the ARB\u2019s decision to dismiss his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"AGNz\">Accordingly, we dismiss Yusim\u2019s petition for review in part and deny his petition for review in part.</p>\n<p id=\"AqX\">DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
