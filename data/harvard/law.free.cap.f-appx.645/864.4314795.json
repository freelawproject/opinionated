Nero, Sr., has filed a <em>pro se </em>appeal of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint alleging violations of the federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), as well as various state law claims. The district court held that some of Nero\u2019s federal claims were precluded because Nero had brought the same claims in state court. The court dismissed his remaining federal claims for failure to state a claim. Nero argues that both these holdings are wrong. He also says the district' court should not have dismissed his state law claims and his mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>tions for sanctions after it dismissed the federal claims. After careful review of the record and briefs, we affirm all of the district court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Nero first argues that the judgment from his earlier Florida case did not preclude his federal claims against Mayan Mainstreet Investors I, LLC (\u201cMayan\u201d), Ezra Katz, and Bradley Weiss. We. review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s holding that a claim is precluded by a prior judgment. <em>Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach, </em>713 F.3d 1066, 1069 (11th Cir.2013). When we are asked to give preclusive effect to a state court judgment, we apply the preclusion rules of the state whose decision would bar further litigation. <em>See Kizzire v. Baptist Health Sys., Inc., </em>441 F.3d 1306, 1308 (11th Cir.2006). Under Florida law, a judgment on the merits bars \u201cnot only relitigation of claims raised but also the litigation of claims <em>that could have been raised </em>in the prior action.\u201d <em>State v. MpBride, </em>848 So.2d 287, 290 (Fla.2003). For this bar to apply, there must be \u201c(1) identity of the thing sued for, (2) identity of the cause of action, (3) identity of persons and parties to the actions, and (4) identity of the quality or capacity of the person for or against whom the claim is made.\u201d <em>Amey, Inc. v. Gulf Abstract &amp; Title, Inc., </em>758 F.2d 1486, 1509 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">The first of those four elements is satisfied if the earlier lawsuit sought the same remedy. <em>See id. </em>The second element \u201crequires that the- claims or causes of action be substantially the same. Identity of causes of action is' defined by similarity of the facts essential to the maintenance of both actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1510 (quotation and alterations omitted). \u201cAs for the third element, identity of the parties, it is not necessary that the parties to both actions be identical. A judgment is conclusive as .to those in privity with the parties.\u201d <em>McDonald v. Hillsborough Cty. Sch. Bd., </em>821 F.2d 1563, 1565-66 (11th Cir.1987). Finally, the fourth element requires that \u201cthe parties in the state action had the incentive to adequately litigate the claims in the same character or capacity as would the parties to the federal action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1566.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">The district court did not err in holding that Nero\u2019s TILA and RICO claims against Mayan, Katz, and Weiss were precluded. Nero\u2019s state and federal claims all sought damages from the same foreclosure. This means there was \u201cidentity of the thing sued for.\u201d <em>Amey, </em>758 F.2d at 1509.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Also, both his state RICO counterclaim and his federal RICO claim alleged' that the foreclosure was based on forged documents. And both his state TILA counterclaim and his federal TILA claim asserted that Mayan wrongfully foreclosed on his property because he had rescinded the mortgage. This means there was \u201cidentity of the cause of action\u201d too. <em>Id. </em>Next, though Katz and Weiss weren\u2019t parties in the state litigation, both men were in privity with Mayan. According to Nero\u2019s complaint, Katz was Mayan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>\u201cOwner\u201d and Weiss was a \u201cManaging Member\u201d of the company. This establishes \u201cidentity of persons and parties to the actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, both Nero and Mayan had every incentive to adequately litigate the state action in order to resolve the foreclosure. This means there was also \u201cidentity of the quality or capacity of the person for or against whom the claim is made.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Nero next argues that the district court should not have dismissed his federal claims against the remaining defendants for failure to state a claim. \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s order dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.\u201d <em>Grossman v. Nationsbank, N.A., </em>225 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">RICO provides for civil liability against people engaged in \u201ca pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c). A plaintiff must show \u201c(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.\u201d <em>Lehman v. Lucom, </em>727 F.3d 1326, 1330 (11th Cir.2013) (quotation omitted). \u201cRacketeering activity\u201d is defined with a list of offenses that includes mail fraud and wire fraud. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1). If a RICO claim is based on an allegation of fraud, the complaint must specify \u201c(1) the precise statements, documents, or misrepresentations made; (2) the time and place of and person responsible for the statement; (3) the content and manner in which the statements misled the Plaintiffs; and (4) what the Defendants gained by the alleged fraud.\u201d <em>Ambrosia Coal &amp; Constr. Co. v. Pages Morales, </em>482 F.3d 1309, 1316-17 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">The district court did not err in dismissing Nero\u2019s RICO claims against the remaining defendants for failure to state a claim. Nero did not specify in either his complaint, his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations, or his briefs in this Court that any of the defendants committed one of the predicate offenses listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961. As the magistrate judge noted, the closest Nero came to identifying a predicate offense was his assertion that the defendants made fraudulent online court filings. But federal fraud charges cannot be based on the filing of court documents. <em>See United States v. Pendergraft, </em>297 F.3d 1198, 1209 (11th Cir.2002) (establishing this rule for mail fraud); <em>United States v. Bradley, </em>644 F.3d 1213, 1238 (11th Cir.2011) (\u201cMail and wire fraud are analytically identical save for the method of execution.\u201d). To the extent Nero alleges that the defendants made other kinds of fraudulent communications, he has never stated with particularity what these communications said, when they occurred, or the people involved. <em>See Ambrosia, </em>482 F.3d at 1316-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">As for Nero\u2019s TILA claims, TILA authorizes suit against creditors and assignees only. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1640-1641. As the holder of Nero\u2019s mortgage, Mayan was the only creditor or assignee of the mortgage. This means Nero has no TILA claim against anyone other than Mayan or its agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">Nero also argues that the district court abused its discretion by not allowing him to amend his complaint to correct his RICO and TILA claims. While we review a district court\u2019s refusal to grant leave to amend for abuse of discretion, we review <em>de novo </em>the legal determination that amendment would be futile. <em>SFM Holdings, Ltd. v. Banc of Am. Sec., LLC, </em>600 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>F.3d 1334, 1336 (11th Cir.2010). A district court is not required to permit amendment if \u201cthere has been ... repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed\u201d or if \u201camendment would be futile.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Dupree, </em>252 F.3d 1161, 1163 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam). The district court here did not abuse its discretion in denying Nero leave to amend his complaint. Nero had filed RICO and TILA charges in state court based on the same conduct alleged in his federal complaint. Despite several opportunities, Nero has failed to state a cognizable and non-precluded RICO or TILA claim in any of his filings in the state court, the district court, or this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Nero next argues that the district court should not have refused to assert jurisdiction over his state law claims after it dismissed his federal claims. \u2018We review the district court\u2019s decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Parker v. Scrap Metal Processors, Inc., </em>468 F.3d 733, 738 (11th Cir.2006). A federal court \u201cmay decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim\u201d if it \u201chas dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3). Once the district court dismissed Nero\u2019s federal TILA and RICO claims, all that was left were his Florida law claims of conspiracy, theft, and fraud. Diversity jurisdiction does not supply federal jurisdiction for these claims. Nero was domiciled in Florida and his complaint states that all the defendants either lived in or operated from Florida. Once the district court dismissed the claims over which it had jurisdiction, it acted within its discretion in declining to assert supplemental jurisdiction over Nero\u2019s state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">Finally, Nero argues that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing as moot his motions for sanctions, which were based on allegations that the defendants committed fraud upon the district court. We review \u201call aspects\u201d of a district court\u2019s sanctions rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>Didie v. Howes, </em>988 F.2d 1097, 1103 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">As an initial matter, the district court was wrong to say Nero\u2019s sanctions motions were moot. A \u201cdistrict court has the authority to.... rule upon the collateral issue of sanctions, although the case from which allegedly sanctionable conduct arose is no longer pending.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1103. Still, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant Nero\u2019s sanctions motions because the motions lacked merit. Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure empowers a court to impose sanctions \u201c(1) when a party files a pleading that has no reasonable factual basis; (2) when the party files a pleading that is based on a legal theoby that has no reasonable chance of success and that cannot be advanced as a reasonable argument to change existing law; or (3) when the party files a pleading in bad faith for an improper purpose.\u201d <em>Worldwide Primates, Inc. v. McGreal, </em>87 F.3d 1252, 1254 (11th Cir.1996) (quotation omitted). Federal courts also have the inherent power to impose sanctions based on a court\u2019s need \u201cto manage its own affairs and to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.\u201d <em>Flury v. Daimler Chrysler Corp., </em>427 F.3d 939, 944 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe key to unlocking a court\u2019s inherent power is a finding of bad faith.\u201d <em>Barnes v. Dalton, </em>158 F.3d 1212, 1214 (11th Cir.1998). A party acts in bad faith by \u201cknowingly or recklessly raising] a frivolous argument or arguing a meritorious claim for the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>pose of harassing an opponent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Nero failed to demonstrate that any of the defendants\u2019 actions were in bad faith, for the purpose of harassment, or for any other improper purpose. To the contrary, the defendants\u2019 statements and assertions were supported by the state court\u2019s findings and do not appear false or fraudulent. The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant Nero\u2019s sanctions motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b893-8\">. Nero offers an additional argument on this point. He says the remedies sought in the state and federal claims aren\u2019t the same because none of the parties in state court had requested conditional rescission. But foreclosure is an equitable remedy in Florida, and Florida courts sitting in equity have \"broad discretion in forming [their] decrees, in order to adapt the relief to the circumstances of particular cases.\u201d <em>Nichols v. Bodenwein, </em>107 Fla. 25, 146 So. 86, 93 (1932); <em>see also id. </em>(\"[T]he power of a court of equity to grant relief is not circumscribed by any fact or technical rule.... The primary object of a decree is to reach the ends of justice, and equity procedure is usually elastic enough to accomplish this result.\u201d). Nero gives no legal support for his argument that his lack of a prayer for this specific relief should dictate whether his claim is precluded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
