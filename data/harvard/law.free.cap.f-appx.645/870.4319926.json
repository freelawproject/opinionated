Doc. 397.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Pronmans appeal the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Regarding their copyright, the Pron-mans argue that Brian Styles improperly obtained copies of the photographs they copyrighted and illegally published them on the internet, which necessitated the need for an injunction. With respect to the protection of their personal names and internet websites, they assert that personal names are protected under the ACPA regardless of proof of secondary meaning and that the Styleses violated their rights by infringing on the use of their names. Finally, they argue that the district court clearly erred in finding that one of their marks, Movie Star Musclecars, was merely descriptive, and that Brian Styles did not seek to profit from an allegedly infringing website, garypronman.com.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Galvez v. Bruce, </em>552 F.3d 1238, 1241 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, presents no genuine issue of fact and compels judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Swisher Intern., Inc. v. Schafer, </em>550 F.3d 1046, 1050 (11th Cir.2008); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>An \u201cauthor has a valid copyright in an original work at the moment it is created \u2014 or, more specifically, fixed in any tangible medium of expression.\u201d <em>See Original Appalachian Artworks, Inc. v. Toy Loft, </em>684 F.2d 821, 823 n. 1 (11th Cir.1982) (citing 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a)). To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for copyright infringement, a plaintiff must show (1) that he owns a valid copyright and (2) that the defendant copied constituent elements of the copyrighted work that are original. <em>Calhoun v. Lillenas Publ\u2019g, </em>298 F.3d 1228, 1232 (11th Cir.2002) (citation omitted). Assuming copyright infringement is proven, the plaintiff may recover his \u201cactual damages and any additional profits of the infringer ... that are attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(a)(1) &amp; (b). To prove actual damages, the plaintiff must \u201cdemonstrate a \u2018causal connection\u2019 between the defendant\u2019s infringement and an injury to the market value of the plaintiffs copyrighted work at the time of infringement.\u201d <em>Montgomery v. Noga, </em>168 F.3d 1282, 1294 (11th Cir.1999). This injury is usually \u201cmeasured by the revenue that the plaintiff lost as a result of the infringement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1295 n. 19. With respect to profits, the plaintiff must show a causal relationship between the infringement and profits, and must also present proof of the infringer\u2019s gross revenue. <em>See </em>17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(b); <em>Montgomery, </em>168 F.3d at 1296.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">The district court properly granted the Styleses partial summary judgment on the Pronmans\u2019 allegation that Brian Styles violated their copyright. There was no evidence that photographs on the Styleses\u2019 websites impaired the value of the Pron-mans\u2019 compilation, or that the Pronmans suffered any actual damages attributable to the infringement. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(a)(1), (b). They failed to \u201cdemonstrate a \u2018causal connection\u2019 between the defendants\u2019 infringement and an injury to the market value of the plaintiffs\u2019 copyrighted work at the time of infringement.\u201d <em>Montgomery, </em>168 F.3d at 1294. Specifically, in his 2014 deposition, Gary Pronman testified about the value of the photographs, but he did not know if there was a market for them. Dan Pronman testified that people used his photographs and expressed his opinion as to the photographs\u2019 value, but he said that no one had offered him any money for the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">The ACPA provides a cause of action for a trademark owner against a person who has a bad faith intent to profit from the owner\u2019s mark and who \u201cregisters, traffics in, or uses\u201d a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to the owner\u2019s distinctive mark. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(d); <em>S. Grouts &amp; Mortars, Inc. v. 3M Co., </em>575 F.3d 1235, 1243 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">Trademark protection is only available to \u201cdistinctive\u201d marks, that is, marks that serve the purpose of identifying the source of the goods or services. <em>Welding Servs., Inc. v. Forman, </em>509 F.3d 1351, 1357 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). Personal names are not inherently distinctive; they are merely descriptive. <em>Investacorp, Inc. v. Arabian Inv. Banking Corp. (Investcorp) E.C., </em>931 F.2d 1519, 1520 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">A descriptive mark, though not inherently distinctive, can acquire distinctiveness, or \u201csecondary meaning,\u201d by becoming associated with the proprietor\u2019s product. <em>Welding Servs., Inc., </em>509 F.3d at 1358. A name has acquired secondary meaning when the primary significance of the term in the minds of the consuming public is not the product but the producer. <em>Id. We </em>have decided that personal names are not inherently distinctive; instead, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>they are merely descriptive. <em>Investacorp, Inc., </em>931 F.2d at 1520. Therefore, district court did not err in determining that the Pronmans\u2019 personal names used as marks required proof \u2014 which was not forthcoming \u2014 of a secondary meaning under the ACPAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">In prosecuting this appeal, the Pronmans opted not to include a transcript of the bench trial. They memorialized this decision by checking the box on the Eleventh Circuit Transcript Information Form indicating that \u201cNo transcript is required for appeal purposes.\u201d Doc. 400. Although they contend that the record evidence available is sufficient to allow us to decide the issues presented to the district court at trial, without a complete transcript it is impossible for them to demonstrate that the court clearly erred in making its factual findings regarding whether Movie Star Musclecars, Inc.\u2019s mark was merely descriptive and whether Brian Styles sought to profit from any domain. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(b)(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Put another way, without trial transcripts, we cannot adequately review the arguments the Pron-mans address to any of the findings of fact and conclusions of law the district courts made pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) following the bench trial. Those arguments consequently fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-5\">.This case stems from a dispute in 2009 when Brian Styles entered into a contract with Movie Star Musclecars, Inc. to purchase an automobile. Styles paid for the automobile, but contended that it was never delivered. He sued the Pronmans in state court for breach of contract and then went online and created a \"gripe\u201d website about them. The Pronmans responded by bringing this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">The Pronmans\u2019 claims are asserted in a Third Amended Complaint (\"complaint\u201d). The complaint contains 10 counts. Doc. 296. They are styled as follows: Count I, Violations of the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, Lanham Act \u00a7 43(d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(d); Count II, Federal Trademark Infringement and Unfair Competition, Lanham Act \u00a7 43(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a); Count III, Federal Trademark Infringement and False Designation of Origin, Lanham Act \u00a7 32(l)(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141(l)(a); Count IV, Federal Trademark Dilution, Lanham Act 43(c), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(c); Count V, Common Law Trademark Infringement; Count VI, Federal Copyright Infringement, Art. 5, Sec. 1 of the Berne Convention and 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a); Count VII, Trademark Dilution, Fla Stat. \u00a7 495.151 <em>et seq.; </em>Count 'VIII, Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 501.201 <em>et seq.; </em>Count IX, Fraudulent Transfers and Conveyances, Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, Fla. Stat. 726.101, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(c); Count X, Preliminary and Permanent Injunction. Count X did not state a cause of action. Rather, it simply sought a remedy for Counts I-IX.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b898-11\">. The district court\u2019s initial summary judgment order, Doc. 374, which dismissed Counts II, III, and IV in part, was reconsidered on the Styles's motion and modified in an order that set for trial the \u201cmarks and/or domain names ... Gpmusclecars.com and MovidstarsMusclecars.com.\u201d Doc. 382 at 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b898-12\">. Prior to entering judgment, the district court struck MoviestarsMusclecars.com Inc. from the complaint as a plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b898-13\">. We have considered, and rejected, a request by the appellees to dismiss the appeal due to the plaintiffs' failure to comply with applicable rules of procedure, particularly concerning record citations. We also reject as merit-less the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the magistrate judge\u2019s order denying in part their motion to compel discovery, because they failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s order and the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b900-8\">. Rule 10(b)(2), <em>Unsupported Finding or Conclusion, </em>states: \u201cIf the appellant intends to urge on appeal that a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence, the appellant must include in the record a transcript of all evidence relevant to that finding or conclusion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
