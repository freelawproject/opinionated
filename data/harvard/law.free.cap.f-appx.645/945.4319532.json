Pestana\u2019s charges arose from him misappropriating personal credit card information from unwitting third parties, creating fraudulent credit cards using such information, and subsequently purchasing numerous Walmart gift cards totaling $211,358.82 with those credit cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">On appeal, Pesta\u00f1a argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement based on his role as a leader or organizer under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3131.1(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After reviewing the record and considering the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not commit reversible error in sentencing Pesta\u00f1a. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">The district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense is a factual finding that we review for clear error. <em>See United States v. Moran, </em>778 F.3d 942, 979 (11th Cir.2015). \u201cFor a factual finding to be clearly erroneous, we must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">To apply a role enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), \u201cthe defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 2. A \u201cparticipant\u201d \u25a0need not be convicted of the offense, but is criminally responsible for its commission. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 1. The court should consider the following factors in evaluating Pestana\u2019s role in the offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aue\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-10\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 4. However, not all factors need suggest a lead role in order to find the enhancement applicable. <em>See United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1356 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">The district court did not clearly err in applying a two-level enhancement for Pes-tana\u2019s role in the offense under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). In executing his fraudulent scheme, Pesta-\u00f1a co-opted Walmart cashiers by offering them gift cards in exchange for allowing' him to swipe numerous fraudulent credit cards. Pesta\u00f1a also exercised control over the frequency and magnitude of the fraudulent transactions, and arranged the transactions to coordinate with the cashiers\u2019 shifts. He proactively recruited the first cashier to participate in the scheme, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>kept a dominant share of the criminal proceeds. These facts support a finding that Pesta\u00f1a \u201chad decision-making authority and exercised control\u201d over the scheme and its participants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d at 1355. Therefore, the district court did not clearly err in finding Pesta\u00f1a to be a leader or organizer under \u00a7 3B1.1(c). <em>See United States v. Jennings, </em>599 F.3d 1241, 1254 (11th Cir.2010) (holding that the district court did not err in finding the defendant was a leader in light of his \u201cextensive involvement in the development and operation of the scheme.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Because we find no reversible error by the district court in determining Pestana\u2019s sentence, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b972-8\">, Pesta\u00f1a also contends that the district court erred because it improperly relied on a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. Specifically, he asserts that by not ruling on the enhancement, the court took it into account. This argument is without merit. At sentencing, the district court adopted the Pre-sentence Investigation Report\u2019s (PSI) calculated offense level, which did not include the obstruction of justice enhancement. Because the calculated offense level did not apply that enhancement, and the Government explicitly stated at sentencing that it found the enhancement unnecessary, the district court\u2019s silence on the issue did not amount to reversible error affecting the ultimately-imposed sentence. Thus, we find no reversible error based on the court\u2019s failure to explicitly rule on the obstruction enhancement;</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b973-15\">. Pesta\u00f1a does not dispute that the cashiers are criminally responsible under the scheme and therefore can be considered \"participants\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 3Bl.l(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
