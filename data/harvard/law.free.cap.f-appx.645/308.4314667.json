In affirming the immigration judge\u2019s (IJ) denial of relief, the BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s findings that (i) Lin\u2019s motion was time barred, because he failed to file his motion within the 180-day limitations period prescribed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) he failed to establish \u201cchanged country conditions,\u201d as required by \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-16\">Lin contends that the 180-day limitations period set forth in \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) should be tolled because he was diligent in pursuing his claims from the expiration of the limitations period \u2014 occurring in or around January 2000 \u2014 until he filed his motion on January 13, 2013. He also contends that his conversion to Christianity in the U.S. in 2011, the fact that he could be imprisoned if he returned to China, and an increase in the Chinese government\u2019s persecution of Christians, showed the requisite \u201cchanged country conditions\u201d entitling him to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-17\">Motions to reopen removal proceedings are disfavored, and the moving party bears a heavy burden. <em>Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 549 (5th Cir.2006) (per curiam). In reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, this court generally applies a \u201chighly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard\u201d and will affirm the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cso long as it is not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303-04 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotations marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-18\">Because Lin\u2019s motion to reopen was filed many years after the IJ\u2019s entry of the in abstentia order of removal in 1999, \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) is inapplicable, unless Lin can establish that the 180-day limitations can be equitably tolled. This court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>has recognized that equitable tolling should apply in \u201crare and exceptional circumstances,\u201d <em>United States v. </em>English, 400 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.2005), and that a party seeking to toll a filing deadline must demonstrate diligence, <em>Pacheco v. Rice, </em>966 F.2d 904, 906-07 (5th Cir.1992). The BIA held that Lin did not make the necessary showing to toll \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i)\u2019s limitations period. Upon a review of the record, we conclude that the BIA\u2019s holding in this regard was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Nevertheless, \u201c[t]here is no time limit on the filing of a motion to reopen\u201d if the motion \u201cis based on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). Lin\u2019s brief focuses on the change in his own personal circumstances \u2014 his conversion to Christianity in 2011 \u2014 and only makes a single conclusory statement in support of his argument that \u201cchanged country conditions\u201d exist in China. Because Lin has failed to elaborate on his conclusory statement, and failed to explain how his supporting documentation supports his statement, he has effectively abandoned any argument that there exist \u201cchanged country conditions\u201d in China. <em>See Williams v. Martin, </em>570 Fed.Appx. 361, 363 (5th Cir.2014) (per curiam). Furthermore, his argument that a change in his own personal circumstances \u2014 his conversion to Christianity \u2014 is sufficient to establish \u201cchanged country conditions\u201d is unavailing. <em>See Lin v. Holder, </em>558 Fed.Appx. 422, 422 (5th Cir.2014) (per curiam); <em>Chen v. Holder, </em>531 Fed.Appx. 453, 454 (5th Cir.2013) (per curiam). For these reasons, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Lin\u2019s application on the grounds that he failed to establish \u201cchanged country conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
