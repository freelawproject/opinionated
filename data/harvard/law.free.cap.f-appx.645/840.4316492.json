For the reasons which follow, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b867-15\">In his <em>pro se </em>complaint filed with the district court, Mr. Jones alleged that in 2012 Judge Lovett, a Georgia state trial judge, sentenced him to a term of probation. In June 2013, he was arrested on a new charge. A different judge, Judge Russell, imposed a new term of probation and terminated Judge Lovett\u2019s probationary term. Judge Russell\u2019s probationary term for the 2013 offense included six months at a sober living program in East Point Georgia, but the order included a \u201ccome back\u201d notice. This \u201ccome back\u201d notice required that Mr. Jones report to probation on January 22, 2014, if he was not in the sober living program, or that he report to probation within 48 hours of being placed in the sober living program. Mr. Jones contends that the \u201ccome back\u201d notice inferred release if the sober living program was closed. Mr. Jones\u2019 original transport order to the sober living program expired before he was transferred, and Mr. Jones\u2019 attorney had to obtain a new transport order for January 20, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-16\">On January 20, 2014, Mr. Jones was processed out of jail and turned over to Sergeant King of the F.C.J. transport division. At this time Mr. Jones was provided with proof of incarceration and release. According to Mr. Jones\u2019 complaint, during transport to the sober living program prison officials learned that the program had closed. Major K. Beasley told those offi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>ci\u00e1is to return Mr. Jones to the jail, despite Mr. Jones\u2019 protests and the \u201ccome back\u201d notice. The officials returned Mr. Jones to the jail, but did not book him.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">On January 21, 2014, Mr. Jones informed the probation intake unit about the situation. At the time the inmate database listed Mr. Jones as \u201creleased.\u201d On January 28, 2014, Mr. Jones was transferred to Coastal State Prison on a 13-month invocation sentence that was part of the originally imposed sentence by Judge Lovett in 2012. This occurred without either a hearing or a waiver of a hearing. Within the next 10-14 days, Mr. Jones explained the situation to the orientation counselor, the deputy warden of care and treatment, and his initial parole interviewer. However, none of these officials helped.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Mr. Jones filed a habeas petition in the state court and, on March 2, 2014, Judge Russell ordered Mr. Jones\u2019 immediate release. Mr. Jones was not released for nine more days, 'however, and Judge Russell had to follow up and threaten to retrieve Mr. Jones personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Mr. Jones then filed a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming a violation of his Fourteenth Amendment due process liberty rights for the extended time he was held incarcerated beyond his sentence and Judge Russell\u2019s court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">On appeal, Mr. Jones argues that the district court erred when it dismissed his complaint for failure to state.a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. The district court gave one reason, and one reason only, for dismissal, and that was the complaint was barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because Mr. Jones failed to show that his conviction or sentence had been reversed or invalidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915A. <em>See Leal v. Georgia Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2001). To avoid dismissal, the complaint must state a claim for relief that is facially plausible. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). The complaint here is viewed in the light most favorable to Mr. Jones, and his well-pleaded facts are accepted as true. <em>See Am. United Life Ins. Co. v. Martinez, </em>480 F.3d 1043, 1057 (11th Cir.2007). We will, moreover, liberally construe Mr. Jones\u2019 <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">To state a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must allege that an act or omission committed by a person acting under color of law deprived him of a right, privilege, or immunity secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States. <em>See Hale v. Tallapoosa County, </em>50 F.3d 1579, 1582 (11th Cir.1995). False imprisonment is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and a viable claim under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Ortega v. Christian, </em>85 F.3d 1521, 1526 (11th Cir.1996). A \u00a7 1983 claim for false imprisonment requires a showing of (1) the common law elements of false imprisonment, and (2) a Fourteenth Amendment due process violation. <em>See Campbell v. Johnson, </em>586 F.3d 835, 840 (11th Cir.2009). Under common law, false imprisonment requires an intent to confine, an act resulting in confinement, and the victim\u2019s awareness of the confinement. <em>Id. </em>A due process violation ensues from the continued detention of a person after it was or should have been known that the detainee was entitled to release. <em>Id. </em>A plaintiff must also show that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>which requires proving that the defendants subjectively knew of a risk of serious harm, and disregarded that risk by actions that constitute more than mere negligence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">A \u00a7 1983 claim is barred by <em>Heck </em>and cannot \u201cbe brought by a prisoner for damages if the adjudication of the civil action in the plaintiffs favor would necessarily imply that his conviction or sentence was invalid unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\u201d <em>Morrow v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, </em>610 F.3d 1271, 1272 (11th Cir.2010). To demonstrate invalidation, a plaintiff must show that the \u201cconviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. But <em>Heck </em>applies only if a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim would necessarily affect the fact or duration of his confinement and the prisoner seeks either immediate release or a shortening of his confinement. <em>See Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 81-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005); <em>Muhammad v. Close, </em>540 U.S. 749, 754, 124 S.Ct. 1303, 158 L.Ed.2d 32 (2004). \u201c[A]s long as it is possible that a \u00a7 1983 suit would not negate the underlying conviction, then the suit is not <em>Heck-bared.\u201d Dyer v. Lee, </em>488 F.3d 876, 879-80 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">In Georgia, a prisoner may inquire about the legality of his imprisonment through a writ of habeas corpus. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-14-1. If the examining judge determines that imprisonment or restraint is illegal, he or she will grant the writ, requiring the prisoner to be released. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-14-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">Because we accept the well-pleaded facts as true, and view them in the light most favorable to Mr. Jones, we find that the complaint sufficiently alleges that his term of imprisonment was invalidated with the successful granting of a habeas corpus petition by Judge Russell. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Therefore, even if Mr. Jones\u2019 claim is decided in his favor, his allegations do not improperly call into question the validity of his conviction or sentence. <em>See Wilkinson, </em>544 U.S. at 81-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242. <em>See also Morrow, </em>610 F.3d at 1272 (holding that a prisoner\u2019s claim under the FTCA based on being imprisoned for an extra ten days did not call into question the conviction or sentence and was not barred by <em>Heck). </em>At the very least, Mr. Jones sufficiently alleged that he was intentionally held, without legal authority, between March 2, 2014 \u2014 when habeas corpus was granted\u2014 and March 11, 2014. Because he was fully aware of his confinement, Mr. Jones sufficiently pled a constitutional claim for false imprisonment. <em>See Campbell, </em>586 F.3d at 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">Based on what is set forth in the complaint, Mr. Jones has sufficiently alleged a due process violation under \u00a7 1983 that is not barred by <em>Heck. </em>The district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim was erroneous, and we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
