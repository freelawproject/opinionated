While seeking permanent resident status in the United States, Besada traveled to Germany for two neck surgeries. She al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>leged that defendants the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services and the United States Department of Homeland Security sent her a letter in which they denied her application to adjust her immigration status because of unauthorized travel. She then cancelled her second surgery in Germany and returned to the United States, and, as a result, her health deteriorated.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). In evaluating dismissals under 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), we view the allegations in the complaint as true and use the same standard that governs dismissals under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Id. </em>To avoid dismissal, the complaint must state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face. <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). A claim is \u25a0facially plausible \u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. Pro se </em>pleadings, however, are held to less stringent standards than those drafted by lawyers. <em>Alba, </em>517 F.3d at 1252. Accordingly, this Court liberally construes <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">The FTCA waives sovereign immunity and is the exclusive remedy against the United States for tort claims for money damages that allege personal injury caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of the government. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). The FTCA authorizes suit against the United States, not its agencies. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(a); <em>F.D.I.C. v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 476, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994) (\u201c[I]f a suit is cognizable under \u00a7 1346(b) of the FTCA, the FTCA remedy is exclusive and the federal agency cannot be sued in its own name\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). To state a claim under the FTCA, a plaintiff must allege a violation of state law by an employee of. the federal government acting within, the scope of his employment. <em>See Zelaya v. United States, </em>781 F.3d 1315, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">A tort claim under the FTCA is \u201cforever barred\u201d unless it is \u201cpresented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within two years after such claim accrues.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b). Presentation of a claim requires the agency to receive written notification about an incident, accompanied by a claim for money damages in a sum certain. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.2. A claim under the FTCA accrues at the time of injury, or when the plaintiff is aware of both the injury and its cause. <em>Diaz v. United States, </em>165 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">The district court properly dismissed Besada\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim under the FTCA. First, the FTCA authorizes suits against the United States, not its agencies, and Besada failed to name the United States as a party. Second, Besada\u2019s key allegation \u2014 that her health deteriorated because she elected to cancel a scheduled surgery based on a letter sent by the defendants \u2014 fails to establish a violation of state law. <em>See Zelaya, </em>781 F.3d at 1323-24. Finally, Besada alleged no facts indicating that she filed an administrative claim With either agency within two years of the accrual of her cause of action, as is required under the FTCA. Accordingly, Besada\u2019s complaint fails to raise a claim that is plausible on its face, and the district court did not err in dismissing it for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
