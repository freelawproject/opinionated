Runde (the \u201cSuperintendent\u201d) and the district court\u2019s dismissal of her amended complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies \\mder the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d). Castillo also contends that the' district court judge was required to recuse himself under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(b)(5)(ii), and she raises several procedural issues related to alleged incorrect docket entries and delayed service of documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-21\">The district court did not abuse its discretion' in denying Castillo\u2019s motions for default judgment. Default judgment was not warranted: the School Board and Superintendent timely filed a motion to dismiss Castillo\u2019s amended complaint, which stayed the deadline for them to file a responsive pleading. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(a)(4)(A). The district court did not err in dismissing Castillo\u2019s amended complaint that asserted the educational rights of a disabled child: she \u2014 never asserting futility or inadequacy \u2014 failed to exhaust her administrative remedies under the IDEA before bringing her suit. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a71415(1); <em>M.T.V. v. DeKalb Cty. Sch. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number><em>Dist., </em>446 F.3d 1153, 1157-59 (11th Cir.2006). We decline to consider Castillo\u2019s assertion (without specifics) that the district court judge acted improperly and the allegations on docket entry errors and delayed service: she raised these arguments for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See Access Now, Inc. v.
