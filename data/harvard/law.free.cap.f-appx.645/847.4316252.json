No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-22\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under section 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012). We construe liberally <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-23\">A district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment unless (1) the defendant\u2019s sentence was based upon a guideline range that the Sentencing Commission later lowered and (2) a reduction is consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s applicable policy statements. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction is inconsistent with the guidelines\u2019 policy statements if the guidelines amendment does not lower the defendant\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). A defendant\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d is the guideline range determined based on a defendant\u2019s offense level and criminal history category before the application of departures or variances. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)),</p>\n<p id=\"b873-25\">The district court lacked the authority to reduce Potts\u2019s sentence, pursuant to section 3582(c)(2). First, Potts was sentenced to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment: the statutory mandatory minimum sentence for Potts\u2019s offense of conviction. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). \u201cIt is well-settled that a district court is not authorized to sentence a defendant below the statutory mandatory minimum unless the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>ment filed a substantial assistance motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 or the defendant falls within the safety-valve of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f).\u201d <em>United States v. Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d 1358, 1360 (11th Cir.2008). Here, the government filed no section 3553(e) motion; and Potts was ineligible for relief under section 3553(f). Thus, the district court lacked authority to sentence Potts below the 240-month statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See id. </em>Potts is also ineligible for relief under Amendment 780. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) (Amendment 780 applies only \u201c[i]f the case involves a statutorily required minimum sentence and the court had the authority to impose a sentence below the statutorily required minimum sentence pursuant to a government motion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Moreover, Potts\u2019s applicable guideline range was not lowered by Amendments 750 and 782. Based on Potts\u2019s total offense level of 41 and criminal history category of VI, Potts\u2019s initial guidelines range was calculated as 360 months\u2019 to life. Although retroactive application of Amendments 750 and 782 would reduce Potts\u2019s bas\u00e9 offense level, Potts\u2019s adjusted offense level would still be 37 based on the operation of the career-offender guideline in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Thus, Potts\u2019s applicable guideline range remains unchanged. That Potts was sentenced below his guideline range based on the government\u2019s section 5K1.1 motion does not alter his \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d for purposes of determining eligibility under section 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, n. 1(A). The district court committed no error in concluding that Potts was ineligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d 328, 337 (11th Cir.2013) (\u201cWhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
