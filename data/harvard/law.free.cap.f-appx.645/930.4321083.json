On appeal, Dixon argues that the district court erred in dismissing the complaint because it misinterpreted her allegations. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s order to dismiss a case for failing to state a claim. <em>Coventry First, LLC v. McCarty, </em>605 F.3d 865, 868-69 (11th Cir.2010). We accept as true the facts as alleged in the complaint. <em>United States ex rel. Clausen v. Lab. Corp. of Am., Inc., </em>290 F.3d 1301, 1303 n. 2 (11th Cir.2002). Because Rule 9(b) applies, Dixon \u201cis not expected to actually <em>prove </em>[her] allegations, and we defer to the properly pleaded allegations of the complaint. But we cannot be left wondering whether a plaintiff has offered mere conjecture or a specifically pleaded allegation on an essential element of the lawsuit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">The relevant facts, as alleged in the complaint, are these. On October 7, 2011, Dixon read a marketing brochure bearing Allergan\u2019s name and logo entitled, \u201cYour Weight-Loss Journey Begins with My Lap-Band Journey.\u201d A Lap-Band is a medical device manufactured by Allergan that wraps around the upper portion of a patient\u2019s stomach to reduce stomach size. Among other statements, the brochure advertised the Lap-Band as \u201cadjustable and reversible,\u201d and \u201c10 times safer than gastric bypass.\u201d That same day, a physician surgically implanted a Lap-Band device into Dixon. Dixon had the Lap-Band adjusted two or three times after it was implanted. On December 3, 2012, Dixon experienced severe pain and was admitted to the emergency room. She lapsed into a coma until December 11, 2012, and was hospitalized for approximately twenty days. Doctors determined that Dixon\u2019s stomach had turned black from lack of blood supply, rotted, and ruptured, which disbursed her stomach contents throughout her body. Dixon alleges this was caused by the erosion of her Lap-Band.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-14\">Dixon\u2019s fourth amended complaint, filed June 11, 2015, alleges negligent misrepresentation, fraud in the inducement, fraud in the performance, and fraudulent misrepresentation stemming from the brochure\u2019s promises of safety, adjustability, and reversibility. For each count, the complaint alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-15\">The [brochure\u2019s] statements misled Plaintiff because the LAP-BAND is not 10 times safer than gastric bypass. In fact, from the prospective of outcomes, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>has been shown that gastric bypass is more effective in reducing morbidity and mortality of obesity when compared to the LAP-BAND. Moreover, the LAP-BAND system is not \u201cadjustable and reversible\u201d at any time. In fact, the LAP-BAND is designed to stay within the patient for [the] rest of his/her life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsmX\">On July 16, 2015, the district court determined that Dixon failed to allege how the brochure\u2019s statements were untrue or misleading, and granted Allergan\u2019s motion to dismiss. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Because each of Dixon\u2019s claims sounds in fraud, she \u201cmust state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). As we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-6\">Rule 9(b) is satisfied if the complaint sets forth (1) precisely what statements were made in what documents or oral representations or what omissions were made, and (2) the time and place of each such statement and the person responsible for making (or, in the case of omissions, not making) same, and (3) the content of such statements and the manner in which they misled the plaintiff, and (4) what the defendants obtained as a consequence of the fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-7\"><em>Tello v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>494 F.3d 956, 972 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">In this case, the district court held that although \u201cDixon alleges two misrepresentations by Allergan, neither is supported by facts showing the misrepresentations\u2019 falsity or how they are misleading.\u201d We agree. Dixon simply failed to plead \u201cthe manner in which [Allergan\u2019s statements] misled\u201d her. <em>Tello, </em>494 F.3d at 972. Even assuming gastric bypass has been shown to be more \u201ceffective\u201d in reducing morbidity and mortality of obesity, as Dixon alleges, this does not undermine Allergan\u2019s claim that the Lap-Band is \u201csafer than gastric bypass.\u201d Effectiveness and safety are separate metrics, and Dixon has not pled that Aller-gan has made misleading statements that concern Lap-Band\u2019s effectiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">As for Dixon\u2019s claim that \u201csafety\u201d and \u201cmortality are tightly linked, \u201cmortality\u201d must be read in context. Dixon\u2019s complaint says that \u201cfrom the prospective of outcomes, it has been shown that gastric bypass is more effective in reducing morbidity and mortality of obesity when compared to the LAP-BAND.\u201d \u201cMortality of obesity,\u201d in the context of this sentence, can only be read as referring to death caused by excessive body weight. The \u201csafety\u201d Dixon claims was overpromised in Allergan\u2019s brochure, meanwhile, plainly refers to health effects resulting from the procedure itself. Thus, Dixon may be right that gastric bypass may decrease the risk of death from obesity, relative to Lap-Band. But that does not mean that Aller-gan\u2019s safety statement is misleading if gastric bypass also increases the relative risk of infection, internal bleeding, or other surgery-specific ailments. In short, safety need not be correlated with effectiveness, and Dixon has pled nothing to demonstrate any inconsistency.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">Similarly, even if the Lap-Band is designed to stay within the patient\u2019s body for the rest of her life, as Dixon alleges, this does not render misleading Allergan\u2019s statement that the Lap-Band is adjustable and reversible. It is entirely consistent that a medical device may be designed for permanence, but capable of removal when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>necessary. Dixon\u2019s objection to the claim of adjustability is also undermined by the acknowledgement in her complaint that her own Lap-Band was adjusted \u201c2 or 3 times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Because Dixon failed to plead her claims with the specificity required by Rule 9(b), the district court did not err in dismissing her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-9\">. The fact of Dixon\u2019s injury is also insufficient to contradict Allergan's statement of relative safety. That a Lap-Band may be more safe than gastric bypass does not guarantee every Lap-Band recipient a safe (or effective) result.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
