(\u201cSilverton\u201d), under which Silverton had sold to Federated a roughly one-third interest in a $3 million \u2014 plus loan for the purchase price of $1 million. When the loan matured and the entire principal amount became due, the underlying borrower J. Michael Womble (\u201cWomble\u201d) defaulted. Five months later, Silverton failed and the FDIC was appointed as its receiver. After unsuccessful efforts to col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>lect on or otherwise address the Womble default, the FDIC sued Womble and others to recover the amount due under Womble\u2019s note and another Silverton loan. The court entered judgment in that action in favor of the FDIC in the total principal amount of $4,941,297 plus accrued interest and attorney\u2019s fees; the FDIC thereafter settled with Womble and others for $1.9 million. At that point, Federated submitted an administrative claim to the FDIC pursuant to the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (\u201cFIRREA\u201d), demanding a cash payment of $1 million, and asserting a \u201cclaim for money damages against [the] FDIC for post-receivership breach of contract.\u201d The FDIC denied Federated\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Federated then filed this action in federal district court under FIRREA, alleging that the FDIC failed to attempt to recover on the underlying $8 million defaulted loan, and failed to provide information to Federated about the loan. The complaint contained four counts: Count I (judicial review of Federated\u2019s administrative claim); Count II (breach of contract); Count III (equitable subordination); and Count IV (attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation expenses). The district court dismissed Counts I, III, and IV and part of Count II, and ultimately granted summary judgment in favor of the FDIC on the rest of Count II. On appeal, Federated argues that the district court erred: (1) to the extent it dismissed Federated\u2019s claims because the claims qualify as administrative expenses of the FDIC, they qualify as post-receivership claims that must be paid in cash, and the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the claims; and (2) to the extent it granted summary judgment because Federated put forth evidence that its damages resulted from its cost of performance, from charge-offs and from the FDIC\u2019s failure to liquidate collateral and sue on the note. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the legal conclusions underlying a district court\u2019s dismissal of claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and its findings of jurisdictional facts for clear error. <em>Houston v. Marod Supermarkets, Inc., </em>738 F.3d 1323, 1328 (11th Cir.2013). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of claims for failure to state a claim. <em>SFM Holdings, Ltd. v. Banc of Am. Sec., LLC, </em>600 F.3d 1334, 1336 (11th Cir.2010). We also review a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court, and drawing all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the non-movant. <em>Nat'l Parks Conservation Ass\u2019n v. Norton, </em>324 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2003). Summary judgment is proper where \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 66(a). \u201cWhen the nonmoving party has the burden of proof at trial, to prevail at summary judgment the moving party has the burden of either negating an essential element of the nonmoving party\u2019s case or showing that there is no evidence to prove a fact necessary to the nonmoving party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>McGee v. Sentinel Offender Servs., LLC, </em>719 F.3d 1236, 1242 (11th Cir.2013). Finally, we review a district court\u2019s grant of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Region 8 Forest Serv. Timber Purchasers Council v. Alcock, </em>993 F.2d 800, 806 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">First, we are unpersuaded by Federated\u2019s claim that the district court erred in dismissing three of its claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Except as otherwise provided in FIRREA, \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction over \u2014 (i) any claim or action for payment from, or any action seeking a determination of rights with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>spect to, the assets of any depository institution for which the [FDIC] has been appointed receiver ... or (ii) any claim relating to any act or omission of such institution or the [FDIC] as receiver.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(d)(13)(D). FIRREA permits suit to be filed on such claims only if the FDIC denies the claim or fails to resolve it within a specified time period. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(d)(6)(A). In <em>Interface Kanner, LLC v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., </em>we recognized that, \u201cfor post-receivership claims \u2014 such as [Federated\u2019s] potential claim[s] against the FDIC \u2014 the court has no subject matter jurisdiction unless the claimant has exhausted the administrative remedies.\u201d 704 F.3d 927, 934 (11th Cir.2013) (quotation omitted). We also cited with approval the Third Circuit\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe plain meaning of \u00a7 1821(d)(13)(D)(i) includes declaratory judgment actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v. City Sav., F.S.B., </em>28 F.3d 376, 385 (3d Cir.1994)). Thus, the D.C. Circuit has held that a plaintiff must exhaust the exact same claim in the administrative process as the one it brings in federal court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAx\">Although [the plaintiffs] filed a timely proof of claim with' the FDIC, then-claim requested only damages for construction delays. Their claim made no mention of the declaratory relief the [plaintiffs] now seek nor could anything in the claim fairly be construed to put the FDIC on notice that the [plaintiffs] challenged its conclusion that repudiation of the loan agreement did not erase the [plaintiffs\u2019] duty to repay the previously disbursed amount. Because the [plaintiffs] failed to route their claim for declaratory relief through the administrative review process, section 1821(d)(13)(D)(ii) withholds judicial review of that claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-6\"><em>Westberg v. FDIC, </em>741 F.3d 1301, 1308 (D.C.Cir.2014) (persuasive authority).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Here, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over three of the claims Federated raised in its complaint. Although it had submitted to the FDIC a single claim for money damages, Federated included in its complaint claims for declaratory relief (part of Count II), equitable subordination of the FDIC\u2019s interest in settlement funds received from Womble and others due to the alleged failure of the FDIC to segregate those settlement funds (Count III), and attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation expenses (Count IV). Indeed, Federated has admitted that it never submitted to the FDIC its claims for equitable subordination and attorneys\u2019 fees and legal expenses found in Counts III and IV.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor are we persuaded by Federated\u2019s argument that these Counts are not distinct claims but only \u201cremedies.\u201d As the D.C. Circuit said in <em>Westberg, </em>Federated\u2019s administrative claim to the FDIC \u201cmade no mention of the [equitable] relief [it] now seek[s] nor could anything in the claim fairly be construed to put the FDIC on notice that [Federated] challenged [the manner in which the FDIC handled the settlement funds].\u201d 741 F.3d at 1308. Federated even admits that it would have been impossible for the FDIC to do anything with the Womble settlement funds until after Federated had already submitted its administrative claim. Because Fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>erated did not submit these claims to the FDIC befo're bringing suit, it failed to exhaust its administrative remedies for these claims, and the district court could not consider them. <em>See Interface, </em>704 F.3d at 934 (\u201cfor post-receivership claims \u2014 such as [Federated\u2019s] potential claim[s] against the FDIC \u2014 the court has \u2018no subject matter jurisdiction unless the claimant has exhausted the administrative remedies\u2019\u201d). The district court properly-dismissed all of Federated\u2019s claims other than its breach-of-contract claim demanding money damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">We also reject Federated\u2019s argument that the district court erred in dismissing for failure to state a claim Count I, which seeks a declaration that Federated would be entitled to receive \u2014 as a first-priority creditor \u2014 payment in cash for a judgment in its favor on its breach-of-contract claim. The National Depositor Preference Amendment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (\u201cFDIA\u201d), mandates that, when paying claims from receivership assets, the FDIC must follow a specified payment-priority scheme: (i) administrative expenses; (ii) deposit liabilities; (iii) other general or senior liabilities; (iv) obligations subordinated to depositors or general creditors; and (v) obligations to shareholders. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(d)(ll). \u201c[Administrative expenses\u201d are defined as \u201cthose necessary expenses incurred by the receiver in liquidating or otherwise resolving the affairs of a failed insured depository institution. Such expenses shall include pre-failure and post-failure obligations that the receiver determines are necessary and appropriate to facilitate the smooth and orderly liquidation or other resolution of the institution.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 360.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Here, Federated does not argue that its breach-of-contract claim under the participation agreement constitutes an administrative expense within the meaning of 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 360.4. Rather, it says that because its claim is one for breach of a contract executed or approved by the FDIC after it was appointed as receiver for Silverton, the claim qualifies as an administrative expense under \u00a7 1821(d)(20). Section 1821(d)(20) regulates the treatment of claims arising from a post-receivership breach of contract by FDIC as receiver, and provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB24\">any final and unappealable judgment for monetary damages entered against a receiver or conservator for an insured depository institution for the breach of an agreement <em>executed </em>or <em>approved </em>by such receiver or conservator after the date of its appointment shall be paid as an administrative expense of the receiver or conservator....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(d)(20) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">However, Federated does not argue that the FDIC <em>executed </em>the Agreement for purposes of \u00a7 1821(d)(20). Federated argues only that - the FDIC <em>approved </em>the Agreement because it \u201cassumed the role as lead lender on the loan, made business decisions relating to its servicing ..., approved legal action against the borrower by filing a lawsuit in Federal Court and has collected and retained proceeds under the loan.\u201d But none of the FDIC\u2019s activities alleged by Federated constitutes approval of the Agreement. Rather, they are all collection activities related to the underlying loan. Indeed, the FDIC\u2019s activities could not constitute approval for purposes of \u00a7 1821(d)(20), As the D.C. Circuit held in <em>MBIA Ins. Co. v. FDIC, </em>\u201cSection 1821(d)(20) ... requires] formal, written approval by the FDIC to qualify contract damages for priority as \u2018administrative expenses\u2019 under \u00a7 1821(d)(ll)(A).\u201d 708 F.3d 234, 245 (D.C.Cir.2013). \u201cThe context, where the FDIC steps into the shoes of a failed bank in emergency cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>cumstances, shows in light of other provisions of \u00a7 1821 that Congress intended \u2018approved\u2019 to have a formality consistent with \u2018executed\u2019 and beyond \u2018acceptance],\u2019 and that a narrow meaning is required under the depositor preference scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244. Accordingly, \u201c[a] formal written sanction thus serves an important statutory purpose by limiting the contracts that are given priority.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Federated attempts to distinguish <em>MBIA, </em>arguing that it involved an agreement that had been repudiated and this \u25a0case does not. But that is not a basis for distinguishing this case. In <em>MBIA, </em>the court explained the need for a formal writing even when a non-repudiated contract continues in force post-receivership:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-5\">[A] writing protects all interested parties, distinguishing \u2018approved\u2019 contracts from on-going agreements assumed and non-repudiated. Under MBIA\u2019s broad interpretation of \u2018approved,\u2019 mere assumption, oral agreement, or partial performance would accord priority status to any damages stemming from a non-repudiated contract_\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-7\"><em>MBIA, </em>708 F.3d at 245. We agree with the <em>MBIA </em>Court and reject the argument Federated makes here.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">Federated also argues \u2014 for the first time on appeal \u2014 that written approval of the Agreement \u201cmay very well exist,\u201d but that \u201cthe trial court erred in ruling on the Motion to Dismiss without allowing Federated to seek complete discovery on these issues.\u201d However, this argument was waived because Federated did not raise it before the district court. <em>Millennium Partners, L.P. v. Colmar Storage, LLC, </em>494 F.3d 1293, 1304 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cArguments raised for the first time on appeal are not properly before this Court.\u201d) (quotation omitted). Further, nowhere in its complaint does Federated allege that the FDIC approved the Agreement in writing, and notably, Federated has not put forth any evidence suggesting that the FDIC approved the Agreement in writing, even though discovery is now completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">Federated next points to an internal FDIC claims manual for the proposition that it has the right to be paid in cash on its claim for post-receivership \u2022 breach of the Agreement by the FDIC as receiver. However, it is undisputed that the claims manual it relies upon had been rescinded and replaced by the FDIC nearly a year <em>before </em>Federated filed its administrative claim and that the claims manual that superseded it includes no provision like the one Federated relies upon from the rescinded claims manual. In any event, internal agency manuals like the FDIC\u2019s claims manual do not provide an independent basis for liability. Rather, as the Supreme Court and this Court have held, such manuals are solely for the use of agency employees, do not have the force of law, and do not provide any substantive rights to persons or entities who interact with federal agencies. <em>See Schweiker v. Hansen, </em>450 U.S. 785, 789, 101 S.Ct. 1468, 67 L.Ed.2d 685 (1981) (Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) Claims Manual is a \u201chandbook for internal use by thousands of SSA employees\u201d that \u201chas no legal force, and ... does not bind the SSA.\u201d); <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>659 F.2d 62, 63, 66 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981) (observing that a Veterans Administration loan servicing manual was \u201cinternal agency publication issued to employees engaged in loan servicing operations to provide procedural information and policy guidelines\u201d and holding \u201cthe manual does not create substantive rights in the mortgagor enforceable in federal court\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>We also find no merit to Federated\u2019s argument that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to dispose of its breach-of-contract claim. \u201cThe elements for a breach of contract claim in Georgia are the (1) breach and the (2) resultant damages (3) to the party who has the right to complain about the contract being broken.\u201d <em>Norton v. Budget Rent A Car Sys., Inc., </em>307 Ga.App. 501, 705 S.E.2d 305, 306 (2010) (quotation omitted). When suing for damages in Georgia, a plaintiff \u201chas the burden of proof of showing the amount of loss in a manner in which the jury ... can calculate the amount of the loss with a reasonable degree of certainty. An allowance for damages cannot be based on guess work.\u201d <em>Big Builder, Inc. v. Evans, </em>126 Ga.App. 457, 191 S.E.2d 290, 291 (1972). Thus, a party\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] to perform ... standing alone does not furnish a basis upon which the amount of the loss can be calculated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, \u201cdamages awarded for breach of contract cannot be vague, speculative, or uncertain ... and must be traced solely to the breach of contract.\u201d <em>Turner Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v. McDavid, </em>303 Ga.App. 593, 693 S.E.2d 873, 886 (2010). While proximate cause is usually a jury question in Georgia, it may be determined by the courts \u201cin plain and undisputed cases.\u201d <em>Sanders v. Lull Int'l, Inc., </em>411 F.3d 1266, 1271 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Here, Federated claims that the FDIC breached the Agreement in two ways: (1) it failed to provide Federated with sufficient information about the Womble note, the potential for default, and the FDIC\u2019s collection efforts; and (2) it failed to liquidate the collateral securing the note \u2014 approximately 44,000 shares of stock in FMCB Holdings, Inc. \u2014 or to act quickly enough to initiate a collection action against the borrower. Federated also describes the damages it suffered: (1) the price it paid for its participation interest in the Womble note; and (2) the amounts of the Womble loan it was forced to \u201ccharge off\u201d (i.e., report as a lost asset of the bank). Federated has failed, however, to put forth evidence of how the FDIC\u2019s alleged breaches caused the harm Federated suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">As for the first breach, the district court concluded that \u201cFederated has offered no evidence at all on how the FDIC\u2019s alleged failure to provide required information caused any damage suffered by Federated.\u201d For example, Federated offered no evidence that it would have taken different action had it been aware of the information the FDIC allegedly failed to provide it. <em>See Sun American Bank v. Fairfield Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>690 F.Supp.2d 1342, 1368 (M.D.Ga.2010) (\u201cPrecise legal damages [from a breach of contract similar to the one alleged here] would be impossible to calculate because such calculation would require speculation into what Sun American would have done with the information Fairfield was obligated to disclose.... It might have made good decisions, or it might have made bad decisions.... It is impossible to say.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">As for the second breach, the only evidence suggesting that there was a market for the FMCB shares was a December 4, 2009 letter from FMCB Holdings. But as the district court concluded, that letter is \u201can insufficient basis upon which the jury could determine what damages might have been suffered by Federated due to the FDIC\u2019s allegedly commercially unreasonable delay in initiating collection activities.\u201d In fact, the letter itself provides that there is no \u201cpublic market\u201d for FMCB Holdings, Inc.\u2019s shares. Furthermore, the only share sale referenced in the letter was for 3,200 shares. Without an available public market, Federated cannot point to <em>one </em>sale as the basis for determining that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>$35 per share was a realistically possible price point. The collateral here was over 44,000 shares, a significantly higher number, particularly when discussing a stock for which there is already no public market. Federated provided no evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that a sale of such magnitude was even possible at any price.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Because it is plain that there is no evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude without speculation that the alleged actions or inactions of the FDIC caused Federated to suffer any damages under the Agreement, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the FDIC on Federated\u2019s breach-of-contract claim. Nor, moreover, did the district court abuse its discretion by granting the FDIC\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the initial denial of the FDIC\u2019s summary judgment motion. \u201c[Bjecause the order [denying summary judgment] was interlocutory, \u2018the court at any time before final decree [could] modify or rescind it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bon Air Hotel, Inc. v. Time, Inc., </em>426 F.2d 858, 862 (5th Cir.1970) (quoting <em>John Simmons Co. v. Grier Bros. Co., </em>258 U.S. 82, 88, 42 S.Ct. 196, 66 L.Ed. 475 (1922)),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>abrogated on other grounds by Little v.
