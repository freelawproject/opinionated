On appeal, he argues that the district court erred by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on its determination that he was ineligible for a sentence reduction. He also challenges his status as a career offender, and argues that his sentence should be lowered based on the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-18\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012). The defendant, as the movant, bears the burden of establishing that a retroactive amendment actually lowers his guideline range. <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d 328, 337 (11th Cir.2013). We liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262,1263 (11th Cir.1998). However, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not grant the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentenc-ing issues, including collateral attacks on a sentence. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-19\">Ordinarily, a district court may not modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment once it has been imposed. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). However, a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if the term of imprisonment was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). For a defendant to be eligible for such a reduction based on a subsequent amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines, the relevant amendment must be listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). Because Amendment 782 is one of the listed amendments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>that applies retroactively, it may serve as the basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l), (d). Amendment 782 revises the drug quantity tables in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, resulting in a two-level reduction to the base offense level applicable to most drug offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 782 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">However, the grounds upon which a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are narrow. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir.2012). A district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment unless a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction is inconsistent with the Guidelines\u2019 policy statement if the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Thus, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d at 337. Moreover, we have explained that, when a defendant is sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, that defendant\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 plays no role in the calculation of the guideline range for purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">The district court did not err by denying Baxter\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction based on its conclusion that he was ineligible for relief because Amendment 782 did not lower his guideline range. Here, the district court adopted the guideline calculations contained in the PSI, noting that, based on a total offense level of 37 and a criminal history category of VI, Baxter\u2019s guideline range was 360 months to life. Retroactively applying Amendment 782 would decrease Baxter\u2019s base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) from 32 to 30. However, because Baxter was designated as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, his otherwise applicable offense level would still be adjusted upward to 37. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 (providing that, \u201c[i]f the offense level for a career criminal ... is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the offense level from the [career offender table] shall apply\u201d). Assuming a total offense level of 37 and a criminal history category of VI, the resulting guideline range remains 360 months to life. Accordingly, Amendment 782 does not alter the guideline range underlying Baxter\u2019s sentence, and \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence. <em>See Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">Moreover, to the extent that Baxter challenges his status as a career offender, his arguments are not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 782. Likewise, Baxter\u2019s reliance on the Fair Sentencing Act is misplaced, as the FSA does not fall within the scope of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because it is \u201cnot a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress.\u201d <em>Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377. Thus, the district court was not authorized to reduce Baxter\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
