Aletto challenges his convictions on two main grounds. First, Aletto contends that the evidence was insufficient to show that he made extensions of credits or that he used extortionate means. Second, he argues that the district court violated his right to conflict-free counsel by allowing him to waive the conflict of interest without informing him that he could obtain the advice of independent counsel. After careful review, we find that sufficient evidence supports Alet-to\u2019s convictions and that he knowingly and intelligently waived his right to conflict-free counsel. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"A2j\">In a superseding indictment, a federal grand jury charged Aletto with one count of knowingly and intentionally making an extortionate extension of credit on or about August 7, 2010, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 892(a) (\u201cCount 1\u201d), and one count of knowingly and intentionally participating, along with several codefendants, in the use of extortionate means to collect and attempt to collect extensions of credit, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 894(a)(1) (\u201cCount 3\u201d). Aletto pled not guilty and proceeded to trial. Most of his codefendants pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-16\">At trial, the government\u2019s evidence consisted primarily of testimony from the victim, Eduardo Virguetti, and his daughter. This evidence, in the light most favorable to the government, showed that Virguetti, a Bolivian national living in the United States without authorization, and his daughter, a legal resident, owned a gas station in Boca Raton, Florida.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Virguetti needed money to buy inventory for his store. Unable to obtain a loan from a bank, Virguetti went to a pawn shop owned by Aletto to try to pawn a necklace.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-17\">At the pawn shop, Virguetti met Aletto, who, after hearing Virguetti\u2019s story, offered to give him $10,000 in cash with no collateral at an interest rate of 15% per month. Virguetti accepted and agreed to make weekly interest payments of $375 each Saturday at the pawn shop. Shortly thereafter, Aletto proposed entering into a partnership with Virguetti. Virguetti declined the partnership offer, prompting Al-etto to demand collateral for the $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>Over time, Aletto introduced Virguetti to three associates, named as codefendants in the superseding indictment, from whom Virguetti borrowed a total of $30,000 on the same terms as his original agreement with Aletto (weekly interest payments of $375 per $10,000). It was often confusing to Virguetti, and even the creditors, to whom he owed money, as Aletto generally collected the weekly payments, and the creditors would transfer Virguetti\u2019s debts to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">When Virguetti needed money on a short-term basis, he borrowed smaller amounts from Aletto, typically between $1,000 and $3,000, for a fee. Virguetti would borrow the money in the morning, and Aletto expected to be paid back by the end of the business day. One day in July 2010, Virguetti was unable to repay Aletto the same day and told him so. Aletto angrily demanded his money from Virguet-ti. When Virguetti asked what would happen if he did not repay the money, Aletto responded that he would kill Virguetti.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">On or about August 7, 2010, Aletto personally loaned Virguetti another $10,000 in cash at a weekly interest rate of 2% (the offense conduct charged in Count l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This transaction was memorialized in a promissory note, signed by Virguetti, which stated that the money was to be repaid in 60 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">Eventually, Virguetti began to have trouble making interest payments on time. This, in turn, caused Aletto and his code-fendants to make veiled or explicit threats to Virguetti and his daughter. For example, Virguetti\u2019s daughter testified that, on one occasion, Aletto came to the gas station looking for Virguetti, who was not there, and he demanded that Virguetti pay back the principal he owed. Virguetti\u2019s daughter argued that they had paid Aletto enough. Aletto then mimicked a gun with his hand and pointed it at his head while stating that he would shoot Virguetti in the head if they did not repay Aletto. Another time, one of the codefendants showed Virguetti a gun when attempting to collect a debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">At some point late in 2010, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) began an investigation into whether Virguetti was being extorted. When questioned by FBI agents, Aletto described the original $10,000 he gave to Virguetti as a \u201cbad loan.\u201d In the context of the interview, the FBI agent understood Aletto to mean it was a loan-shark loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">The jury returned a verdict finding Alet-to guilty of both Counts 1 and 3. The district court sentenced Aletto to a total term of 24 months in prison. Aletto now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction. <em>United States v. Howard, </em>742 F.3d 1334, 1341 (11th Cir.2014). We view the evidence presented at trial, and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to the verdict. <em>United States v. Sterling, </em>738 F.3d 228, 234 (11th Cir.2013). We will not disturb a guilty verdict unless no reasonable trier of fact could have found that the evidence establishes the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Howard, </em>742 F.3d at 1341. \u201cWe do not second guess the jury\u2019s determination of credibility issues. Nor will we reverse a conviction simply because the defendant put forth a reasonable hypothesis of innocence at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1342 (cita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>tions and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Section 892(a) of Title 18 of the United States Code' prohibits making \u201cany extortionate extension of credit.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 892(a). An \u201cextension of credit\u201d is broadly defined as a loan or \u201cany agreement, tacit or express, to defer the repayment or satisfaction of any debt or claim.\u201d <em>United States v. Cassano, </em>132 F.3d 646, 649-50 (11th Cir.1998); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 891(1) (\u201c[T]o extend credit means to make or renew any loan, or to enter into any agreement, tacit or express, whereby the repayment or satisfaction of any debt or claim, whether acknowledged or disputed, valid or invalid, and however arising, may or will be deferred.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">An extension of credit is \u201cextortionate\u201d where \u201cboth the creditor and the debtor understand that default or delinquency in making payments \u2018could result in the use of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to the person, reputation or property of any person.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Nakaladski, </em>481 F.2d 289, 297 (5th Cir.1973) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 891(6)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe states of mind of the defendant and the debtor are, therefore, both essential elements of the crime of making extortionate extensions of credit under \u00a7 892.\u201d <em>United States v. Lombardozzi </em>491 F.3d 61, 68 (2d Cir.2007). With respect to the debtor\u2019s state of mind, the government must prove that the debtor \u201cactually had such an awareness of the possible harm that could arise from default or delinquency in repaying the loans.\u201d <em>Nakaladski, </em>481 F.2d at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">Sufficient evidence supports Alet-to\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 892(a). First, a reasonable jury could find that Aletto made an \u201cextension of credit\u201d to Virguetti on or about August 7, 2010, as charged in Count 1 of the superseding indictment. The evidence shows that, on or around that date, Aletto loaned Virguetti $10,000 in cash at 2% weekly interest rate. In a promissory note, Virguetti agreed to repay Aletto in 60 days. Clearly, this evidence was sufficient to show that this transaction was either a \u201cloan\u201d or an agreement to defer repayment of Virguetti\u2019s debt to Al-etto. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 891(1); <em>Cassano, </em>132 F.3d at 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">The evidence does not support Aletto\u2019s position that the $10,000 was an \u201cinvestment\u201d' by a business partner, nor would that characterization be dispositive in any case. <em>See Cassano, </em>132 F.3d at 649-50 (recognizing that an \u201cextension of credit\u201d may arise from deferment of payments on legitimate investments and joint ventures, in addition to various other debts). Virguetti declined Aletto\u2019s partnership offer early on. The evidence of their interactions from that point, including the weekly interest payments, Aletto\u2019s requiring of collateral to secure repayment of the principal amounts, and Aletto\u2019s own statements that he made a \u201cbad loan\u201d to Virguetti, fully supports the inference that Aletto and Virguetti\u2019s relationship was that of a creditor and debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">Second, a reasonable jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the August 2010 extension of credit was \u201cextortionate\u201d based on the circumstances surrounding its making.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While the government need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>not necessarily present evidence of an explicit threat to the debtor, the government did so in this case. <em>See Lombardozzi, </em>491 F.3d at 69 (stating that \u201cthe victim borrower\u2019s state of mind can be inferred\u201d and \u201cdoes not necessarily depend on evidence of explicit threats made by the creditor\u201d); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 891(7) (\u201cextortionate means\u201d include the \u201cexpress or implicit threat\u201d of the use of violence or other criminal means).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Less than a month before Aletto made the August 2010 extension of credit, he explicitly threatened Virguetti with violence when Virguetti was late repaying a short-term loan. On that date in July 2010, Virguetti met with Aletto to tell him he could not repay by the end of the day the $2,000 he borrowed that morning. Al-etto became very angry, placed himself inches from Virguetti\u2019s face, and told him, \u201cYou need to pay me my money, now.\u201d Virguetti responded, \u201cIf I don\u2019t pay ... you kill me?\u201d Aletto replied, \u2018Yes, I do.\u201d Virguetti testified that he took this threat seriously and that he was scared of Aletto.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Crediting this testimony, a reasonable jury could conclude that, when Aletto made the August 2010 extension of credit, which was five times the amount of the loan that prompted Aletto to threaten Vir-guetti, the defendant and the debtor both understood that harmful consequences could result from delinquency or delay in repaying the loan. <em>See Nakaladski, </em>481 F.2d at 297-98. The extortionate nature of the loan is also supported by evidence that Aletto made high-interest, predatory loans to someone he knew was desperate for money and unlikely to inform authorities due to his immigration status, that he demanded excessive collateral for those loans, and that he recruited others to make money from Virguetti and his family. Alet-to essentially contends that Virguetti\u2019s testimony regarding Aletto\u2019s threat and whether Virguetti took it seriously is not worthy of credence, but we will not second-guess the jury\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>See Howard, 142 </em>F.3d at 1342. Nor will we reverse Aletto\u2019s conviction simply because he put forth a reasonable hypothesis of innocence at trial. <em>See id. </em>In short, sufficient evidence supports Alet-to\u2019s \u00a7 892(a) conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">Section 894(a)(1) prohibits using \u201cany extortionate means\u201d \u201cto collect or attempt to collect any extension of credit.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 894(a)(1). Section 891 defines \u201cextortionate means\u201d as \u201cany means which involves the use, or an expr\u00e9ss or implicit threat of use, of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to the person, reputation, or property of any person.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 891(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">Here, the evidence presented was sufficient for a jury to find that Aletto participated in using threats of violence to collect or attempt to collect an extension of credit. \u25a0 Aletto contends that the only threats came from his codefendants and that he is not culpable for their conduct. But even if we limited our inquiry solely to Aletto, the evidence was more than sufficient to show that Aletto personally threatened Virguetti and his family with violence in attempting to collect extensions of cred<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>it. First, as mentioned above with respect to Count 1, Aletto threatened Virguetti when he was late repaying a short-term loan. Second, Virguetti\u2019s daughter testified that Aletto came to the gas station to collect on Virguetti\u2019s debt and threatened to shoot Virguetti in the head if the debt was not repaid. The jury was free to fully credit this testimony and conclude that Aletto knowingly used means involving the threat of violence to attempt to collect extensions of credit. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 891(7), 894(a); <em>see Howard, </em>742 F.3d at 1341-42. Accordingly, we affirm Aletto\u2019s \u00a7 894(a) conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Aletto next argues that the district court erred in not declaring a mistrial based upon a conflict of interest between Aletto and his trial counsel, Michael J. Silver.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Aletto is represented by different counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">During trial, and outside the presence of the jury, Virguetti\u2019s daughter recognized Silver. The district court questioned Vir-guetti\u2019s daughter, who stated that Silver came to the gas station, represented that he was Aletto\u2019s lawyer, and threatened to \u201ccall immigration\u201d on the Virguetti family if the debt to Aletto was not paid. The government moved for a mistrial because Virguetti\u2019s daughter\u2019s testimony could make Silver a witness in the case. The district court questioned Aletto under oath about his rights and the potential conflict, and Aletto stated that he understood the conflict and wished to proceed with Silver. Ultimately, the district court denied the government\u2019s motion for a mistrial and prohibited the government from eliciting any testimony from Virguetti\u2019s daughter about her belief that Aletto\u2019s attorney threatened her.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">The question of whether a defendant waived his counsel\u2019s conflict of interest is a mixed question of fact and law that we review <em>de novo. See Hamilton v. Ford, </em>969 F.2d 1006, 1010 (11th Cir.1992) (analyzing conflict-of-interest claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2264).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">An actual conflict of interest that adversely affects a defendant deprives him of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>982 F.2d 474, 477 (11th Cir.1993). In general, however, a defendant may waive his right to conflict-free counsel and choose to proceed with conflicted counsel. <em>Id.; see United States v. Garcia, </em>517 F.2d 272, 276 (5th Cir.1972). An effective waiver of a constitutional right must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent, and it must be \u201cestablished by clear, unequivocal, and unambiguous language.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>517 F.2d at 276-78 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe record should show, in some way, that the defendant was aware of the conflict of interest; realized the conflict could affect the defense; and knew of the right to obtain other counsel.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>982 F.2d at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">Here, Aletto waived his right to conflict-free counsel. The district court inquired of Aletto under oath in \u00e1 manner similar to that used in a plea colloquy. <em>See Garcia, </em>517 F.2d at 278 (describing the procedure to obtain a valid waiver). Alet-to\u2019s responses show that he understood the potential conflict and the consequences of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>proceeding with Silver \u2014 that Silver could not deny that he had acted improperly. \u25a0Further, the court informed Aletto that he had the right to conflict-free counsel and the right to consult with another lawyer before deciding whether to proceed with Silver. Following the court\u2019s inquiry, Al-etto unambiguously stated that he voluntarily waived his right to conflict-free counsel and wished to proceed with Silver. On this record, it is clear that Aletto knowingly and intelligently waived his right to conflict-free counsel. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>982 F.2d at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Nor has Aletto shown that the potential conflict of interest affected him adversely in any way because the district court prohibited the government from eliciting testimony about Silver\u2019s actions in allegedly threatening Virguetti\u2019s daughter. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">\n<em>IV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">For the reasons stated, we affirm Alet-te\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b921-11\">. In reviewing a sufficiency challenge, we construe the facts in the light most favorable to the conviction. <em>See United States v. Howard, </em>742 F.3d 1334, 1338 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b922-7\">. It appears that the money was actually given on July 31, 2010, and the promissory note was signed later, Regardless, both parties generally refer to this transaction as occurring on August 7, 2010, so for the sake of consistency we do as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b923-11\">. This Court adopted as binding precedent all Fifth Circuit decisions prior to October 1, 1981. <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AVF\">, Aletto incorrectly states that a conviction under \u00a7 892(a) requires evidence that \u201cthe debtor believed, at the time the credit was extended, that the defendant previously used extortionate means to collect a debt or had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>reputation for doing so.\u201d Aletto\u2019s Initial Br. at 43-44. That element is part of \u00a7 892(b), which provides a specific way for the government to show that an extension of credit was extortionate, but subsection (b) \"is nonexclusive and in no way limits the effect or applicability of subsection (a).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 892(b). Likewise, the fact that the promissory note may have been legally enforceable, as Aletto asserts, is not dispositive of whether the extension of credit was extortionate. Enforceability is an element of the nonexclusive showing under \u00a7 892(b). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 892(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b925-8\">. We note that Aletto opposed the government\u2019s motion for a mistrial and therefore arguably invited any error, as the government contends. But given the allegations against Aletto\u2019s counsel, the possibility counsel may have had conflicting motivations in arguing against a mistrial, and the fact that we nevertheless conclude that the district court properly found that Aletto waived the conflict, we do not consider whether Aletto invited error in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
