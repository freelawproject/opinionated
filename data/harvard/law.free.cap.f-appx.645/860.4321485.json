On appeal, St. Fleurose challenges the district court\u2019s calculation of his criminal history score. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">A. Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b887-15\">St. Fleurose\u2019s federal convictions arise out of tax refund fraud St. Fleurose engaged in while working as a tax preparer. Specifically, between January 2010 and July 2011, St. Fleurose deposited into his personal business bank accounts at Chase Bank and Woodforest National Bank fraudulently obtained U.S. Treasury Department tax refund checks and wire transfers, as well as stolen and forged Refund Application Loan checks. In total, St. Fleurose converted $418,679.66 and affected 70 taxpayer victims. The main victim was the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), which sought $112,665.95 for the five tax refunds either processed by the IRS or stolen by St. Fleurose that were deposited in his personal bank account. These five fraudulent obtained refunds were charged in the five counts of St. Fleurose\u2019s indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-17\">B. Presentence Investigation Report</p>\n<p id=\"b887-18\">St. Fleurose\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) a 14-level increase in St. Fleurose\u2019s offense level because he was responsible for a loss amount of more than $400,000 but less than $lmillion, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H); and (2) a total offense level of 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-19\">The PSI assigned St. Fleurose 2 criminal history points, 1 point for a 2011 Florida conviction for driving under the influence and 1 point for 2011 Florida convictions for fraud, grand theft in the third degree, and cashing defrauded and worthless checks. These latter fraud and theft convictions sprang from a state investigation of suspicious deposits of tax return refunds into St. Fleurose\u2019s personal account at CitiBank. The PSI did not include the total number of victims or the number or dollar value of deposits, but stated that, between April 15 and April 22, 2011, \u201cfive other\u201d tax return refunds totaling approximately $50,000 were deposited into St. Fleurose\u2019s CitiBank account. The 1 criminal history point for St. Fleurose\u2019s 2011 Florida fraud and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>theft convictions bumped St. Fleurose\u2019s criminal history category from I to II. <em>See id. </em>U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">With a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of II, the PSI recommended an advisory guidelines range of 41 to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment. Without the second criminal history point, St. Fleurose\u2019s advisory guidelines range would have most likely been 37 to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">C. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">At sentencing, St. Fleurose objected to his receiving 1 criminal history point for the 2011 Florida fraud and theft convictions, arguing that these convictions were not a \u201cprior sentence,\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.1 and 4A1.2(a), but rather part of the relevant, though uncharged, conduct in his federal case, under U.S.S.G, \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2). The district court overruled St. Fleurose\u2019s objection, adopted the PSI\u2019s guidelines calculations, and calculated an advisory guidelines range of 41 to 51 months. The district court explained, however, that \u201cfor the sake of judicial economy,\u201d it would calculate \u201cthe correct guideline sentence,\u201d but also would \u201cimpose a sentence independent of the guidelines\u201d based on what the court thought was reasonable \u201cunder all the facts, guideline or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">In mitigation, St. Fleurose\u2019s counsel argued for a sentence of house arrest and probation, pointing out that he had no further criminal history after his arrest in 2011, successfully completed his state probation, was working, and had a strong support network of family and friends. The district court heard personally from St. Fleurose, who expressed remorse for his actions. St. Fleurose explained that he was foolishly tempted by a friend\u2019s offer of a way to make a quick buck during hard times after his wife had a new baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">The district court confirmed with the government that, although there were 70 individual taxpayer victims, the IRS was the only victim seeking restitution because the IRS had paid the refunds owed to the 70 taxpayer victims. The district court acknowledged that it had heard some good things about St. Fleurose, including his remorse and his rehabilitation efforts, but stressed that there were \u201csocietal interests\u201d to be considered as well. The district court stressed that the 70 taxpayer victims \u201chad their refunds hijacked and were probably substantially disrupted in their financial affairs,\u201d and that it would have taken considerable effort to identify who the proper taxpayers were and how much they were owed and additional time to get their refunds paid. The district court found that St. Fleurose\u2019s offenses involved \u201ccertainly serious criminal conduct that impacted a number of innocent individuals that has to be taken into account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">The district court stated that it had considered the parties\u2019 statements, the PSI with the advisory guidelines, and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and sentenced St. Fleurose to concurrent 41-month sentences on all five counts. After the district court imposed a total 41-month sentence, St. Fleurose renewed his objection \u201cto the guideline calculation\u201d and objected to the sentence imposed as substantively and procedurally unreasonable. The district court responded that \u201cthe sentence that I\u2019ve imposed is a sentence independent of the guideline calculation in the event that you prevail on that point on appeal,\u201d and that the court \u201cbelieve[d] the 41-month sentence [was] a reasonable sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">On appeal, St. Fleurose argues that the district court erred in assigning one criminal history point to his 2011 Florida fraud and theft convictions and should have instead considered them as relevant conduct for guidelines calculations purposes. After review, we conclude that any error in treating St. Fleurose\u2019s Florida fraud and theft convictions as prior criminal history rather than relevant conduct was harmless and that a remand for resentencing is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">\u201cAfter the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Booker </em>and <em>Gall, </em>the district courts are still required to correctly calculate the advisory Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1089 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, \u201c[t]he Supreme Court and this Court have long recognized that it is not necessary to decide guidelines issues or remand cases for new sentence proceedings where the guidelines error, if any, did not affect the sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1349 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 1120-21, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992) (\u201c[O]nce the court of appeals has decided that the district court misapplied the Guidelines, a remand is appropriate unless the reviewing court concludes, on the record as a whole, that the error was harmless, <em>i.e., </em>that the error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Accordingly, this Court need not reach disputed guidelines issues if, as here, the district court has stated that \u201cthe guidelines advice that results from the decision of those issues does not matter to the sentence imposed after the \u00a7 3553(a) factors are considered,\u201d and this Court concludes that \u201cthe sentence imposed through the alternative or fallback reasoning of \u00a7 3553(a) [is] reasonable.\u201d <em>Keene, </em>470 F.3d at 1349. \u201cIn determining whether [the sentence imposed] is reasonable we must assume that there was a guidelines error \u2014 that the guidelines issue should have been decided in the way the defendant argued and the advisory range reduced accordingly \u2014 and then ask whether the final sentence resulting from consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors would still be reasonable.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Dean, </em>517 F.3d 1224, 1232 (11th Cir.2008) (applying <em>Keene </em>and concluding that, assuming the district court erroneously calculated the defendant\u2019s guidelines range, the sentence nevertheless \u201cwas reasonable and stands despite the disputed guidelines issue\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">Here, even assuming the district court erred in finding that St. Fleurose\u2019s Florida fraud and theft convictions were sufficiently dissimilar from his federal offenses to constitute a prior sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a) rather than relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2), the error was harmless. As the district court explained clearly and plainly, it would have imposed the same 41-month sentence even if it had sustained St. Fleurose\u2019s objection and removed the additional criminal history point.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under this scenario, the adviso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>ry guidelines range would have been 37 to 46 months, and St. Fleurose\u2019s 41-month sentence still would have fallen within that range. Furthermore, in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the record, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s chosen sentence, in the middle of the assumed advisory guidelines range of 37 to 46 months, is unreasonable. The sentence was well below the statutory maximum sentence of ten years, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641, and the offense resulted in substantial loss, affecting 70 taxpayers in addition to the IRS. Perhaps tellingly, St. Fleurose does not even attempt to make a reasonableness argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Instead, St. Fleurose\u2019s argues that we are not bound by <em>Keene </em>because it contravenes <em>Booker\u2019s </em>requirement that the district court correctly calculate the advisory guidelines range. We are not persuaded by this argument. Nothing in <em>Booker </em>or its progeny suggests that appellate courts must always vacate sentences and remand for resentencing if there is a guidelines calculation error, even if that error is harmless and the chosen sentence is reasonable. In any event, <em>Keene, </em>which postdates and explicitly applies <em>Booker, </em>is binding precedent that has not been overruled or abrogated. <em>See United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that under our prior panel precedent rule, subsequent panels are bound by the holding of a prior panel \u201cunless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or by this court sitting <em>en banc </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"ALV\">Citing <em>United States v. Zabielski, </em>711 F.3d 381, 389-90 (3d Cir.2013), St. Fleurose contends that one of our sister Circuits has \u201crejected <em>Keene\u2019s </em>blanket approach.\u201d To the contrary, in <em>Zabielski, </em>the Third Circuit refused to remand for resentencing because it was convinced any error in applying a disputed threat-of-death guidelines enhancement was harmless based on the sentencing court\u2019s statements during the sentencing hearing that indicated \u201ca high probability\u201d it would have imposed the same sentence irrespective of that guidelines enhancement. 711 F.3d at 388-89. In so doing, the Third Circuit cited and discussed <em>Keene </em>with approval, suggesting \u201c[f]or the benefit of future cases,\u201d that \u201c[a]n explicit statement\u201d from the district court \u201cthat it would have imposed the same sentence under either guidelines range would\u201d \u201cobviate questionable appeals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389. That is exactly what happened at St. Fleurose\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-8\">. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>Gall </em>v. <em>United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b889-9\">. St. Fleurose acknowledges that it is unclear from the record whether his total offense level would have remained 21 if the conduct underlying his Florida fraud and theft convictions had been included as relevant conduct, as the total number of victims and the loss amount from the state convictions was not clearly stated. Thus, it is at least possible that St. Fleurose\u2019s offense level, and hence his guidelines range, could have been higher rather than lower had he been held accountable for the state conduct. However, for purposes of this appeal, we give St, Fleurose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>benefit of the doubt that his total offense level would have remained the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
