Dancing $, LLC, </em>578 Fed.Appx. 938, 947-48 (11th Cir.2014), we vacated the District Court\u2019s decision with instructions to \u201capply the equitable factors\u201d set out in <em>Blasland, Bouck &amp; Lee, Inc. v. City of Miami, </em>283 F.3d 1286 (11th Cir.2002), \u201cin order to determine whether equitable considerations justify a denial or reduction of prejudgment interest to the Receiver in light of Florida\u2019s general rule that prejudgment interest is an element of pecuniary damages.\u201d On remand, the District Court, overruling the Receiver\u2019s objection to the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation and adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, awarded the Receiver prejudgment interest but calculated the award from the date the Receiver filed suit rather than- the dates of the fraudulent transfers to Dancing $, LLC. The Receiver appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">The Receiver correctly notes that the District Court considered factors other than those set out in <em>Blasland. </em>It evaluated the purported equitable underpinnings of the \u201cclawback\u201d cases arising from the Ponzi scheme that yielded the fraudulent transfers and then concluded that the Receiver should receive prejudgment interest only from the date he commenced this action. In doing so, the court strayed from our instructions which were to determine whether Blasland\u2019s equitable factors justified the denial or reduction of the prejudgment interest awarded the Receiver. As we noted in <em>Wiand v. Dancing $, LLC, </em>Florida applies the \u201closs theory\u201d of prejudgment interest. Under that theory, \u201cprejudgment interest is merely another element of pecuniary damages.\u201d 578 Fed.Appx. at 938 (internal quotation marks omitted). And \u201cFlorida courts award prejudgment interest as a matter of course.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). As the Florida Supreme Court stated in <em>Alvarado v. Rice, </em>614 So.2d 498, 499 (Fla.1993), \u201c[i]t is well settled that a plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest when it is determined that the plaintiff has suffered an actual, out-of-pocket loss at some date pri- or to the entry of judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">Rather than vacate the District Court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings (in which the transaction costs will further consume the prejudgment interest the Receiver is due), we vacate the court\u2019s judgment with the instruction to calculate the prejudgment interest from the dates of the pertinent fraudulent transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
