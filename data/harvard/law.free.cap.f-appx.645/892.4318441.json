He contends that Amendment 782 to the sentencing guidelines lowered his total offense level and that under the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>662 F.3d 166 (2d Cir.2011), the district court had the authority to correct other errors that occurred at his original sentence hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">In 1997 Rizo was convicted of one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and four counts of attempting to obstruct commerce by robbery. The presentenee investigation report set a base offense level of 38 for his drug conviction based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 (1997), because the offense involved over 150 kilograms of cocaine. It also applied enhancements for using a dangerous weapon, physically restraining a victim in the course of the offense, and being an organizer or leader of the offense, for a total offense level of 46. With his criminal history category of I, Rizo\u2019s advisory guideline range was life imprisonment. At the sentence hearing, the district court found that Rizo was responsible- for 156 kilograms of cocaine and sentenced him to life imprisonment for the drug offense, with concurrent 240 month sentences for the robbery offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about its authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>576 F.3d 1216, 1218 n. 1 (11th Cir.2009). A district court may modify a defendant\u2019s sentence if the sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). But the district court lacks authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if the relevant amendment to the guidelines does not lower the defendant\u2019s advisory guideline range. <em>Id.; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">Amendment 782 lowers Rizo\u2019s total offense level from 46 to 44. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5), (c)(2) (2014); <em>id., </em>Supp. to App. C., Amends. 782 <em>&amp; </em>788 (2014). But, like his original offense level of 46, Rizo\u2019s amended offense level of 44 yields an advisory guideline range of life imprisonment. The district court therefore properly found that it was not authorized to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 782. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-13\">Nor was the district court authorized to reduce Rizo\u2019s sentence on any of the other bases that he argued. This Court \u201chas been very clear in holding that a sentencing adjustment undertaken pursuant to Section 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a de novo <em>resentencing_[A]ll </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781-82 (11th Cir.2000). Rizo\u2019s argument that the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Rivera </em>authorized the district court to correct other alleged errors from -his original sentence hearing is unavailing. Even if <em>Rivera </em>were binding precedent in this Circuit, which it is not, that case related to how to determine what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>a defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and \u00a7 1B1.10, <em>See Rivera, </em>662 F.3d at 177. It did not hold that a court could use a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding to correct other errors that the defendant alleged occurred at the original sentence hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">AFFIRMEp.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
