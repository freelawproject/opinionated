California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Calderon-Canas has filed a response. The record is not sufficiently developed to allow us to make a fair evaluation of Calderon-Canas\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>of ineffective assistance of counsel; we therefore decline to consider the claim without prejudice to such right to collateral review as Calderon-Canas may have. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant parts of the record reflected therein, as well as Calderon-Canas\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
