We review the reasonableness of a final sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging the reasonableness of a sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>A sentence substantively is unreasonable if it \u201cfails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>We will not vacate a sentence unless \u201cwe are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Bostic has failed to demonstrate that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. Based on Bostic\u2019s adjusted offense level of 21 and criminal history category of VI, his advisory guidelines range was first calculated as between 77 and 96 months\u2019 imprisonment. Bostic\u2019s guideline range was then reduced to 48 months\u2019 imprisonment: the statutory maximum sentence for his offense of conviction. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(d)(1);' U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a). We ordinarily expect a sentence imposed within the guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. That Bostic was sentenced to the statutory maximum sentence for his offense does not render his sentence per se unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">In determining Bostic\u2019s sentence, the district court considered expressly the section 3553(a) factors. In particular, the district court expressed concern about Bostic\u2019s extensive criminal history (including his two prior drug convictions), about Bostic\u2019s continued drug use, and about Bostic\u2019s commission of a new criminal offense while on supervised release. In the light of the nature of Bostic\u2019s offense and Bostic\u2019s history and characteristics, we accept that a 48-month sentence could be reasonably thought to be necessary to deter Bostic from further criminal activity, to protect the public from future crimes, and to promote respect for the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">We reject Bostic\u2019s argument that the district court failed to accord sufficient weight to the comparatively minor role he played in the charged conspiracy. The district court has considerable discretion in weighing the section 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). Given the totality of the circumstances, we are not \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factor\u2019s.\u201d See <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191. We see no abuse of discretion; we affirm Bostic\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-16\">. In a 54-count indictment against Bostic and 22 codefendants, a federal grand jury charged Bostic with one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and eight counts of unlawful use of a communication facility. Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Bostic pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful use of a communication facility in exchange for the government\u2019s agreement to dismiss the other counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b973-25\">. Under section 3553(a), a district court should consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>of the defendant, the need for the sentence to provide adequate deterrence, respect for the law, and protection of the public, policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, provision for the medical and educational needs of the defendant, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
