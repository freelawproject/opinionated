J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On December 21, 2016, plaintiff and appellant Associated Chino Teachers (ACT) filed a verified petition for writ of mandate, seeking to prevent defendant and respondent Chino Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) from releasing two documents relating to the results of an investigation into a public high school teacher's (Doe) actions as a girls' volleyball coach. Doe's actions did not result in any type of discipline or adverse action from the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC). The trial court denied the petition. ACT appeals contending the disclosure of these documents is not authorized under the California Public Records Act. (CPRA; Gov. Code, \u00a7 6250, et seq. )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It argues that disclosure would significantly harm Doe's privacy rights. (\u00a7 6254, subd. (c).) Alternatively, ACT asserts the public interest in not disclosing the documents outweighs the public interest in disclosing them. (\u00a7 6255.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We conclude the CPRA does not require the production of the documents because Doe's privacy interests outweigh the public interest in their disclosure. We therefore do not address ACT's alternative argument. We reverse the judgment and remand the matter to the trial court to enter a new order granting the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND AND FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   ACT is the employee organization that serves as the exclusive representative for CVUSD's teachers. Doe is a high school teacher in CVUSD and a\n   member of ACT. During their\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   two-decade career with CVUSD, they have never received any warnings or discipline relating to their assignment as a classroom teacher. During the fall of 2016, while Doe was coaching the girls' volleyball team, CVUSD received two separate complaints from parents/guardians (hereinafter \"complainants\") of student-athletes, regarding Doe's conduct, namely, yelling and belittling the student-athletes in public and holding practice at their home. Complainants did not allege any sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, physical violence, threats of violence, drug-related wrongdoing, criminal\n   activity, or any other egregious misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   CVUSD investigated the allegations against Doe and provided complainants with a written disposition of their complaints (dated Oct. 21 &amp; Nov. 21, 2016, collectively disposition letters). Doe received a letter of warning (dated Nov. 4, 2016) and a letter of concern (dated Dec. 1, 2016), which were placed in their official personnel file. The disposition letters were not placed in Doe's official personnel file. Doe resigned from the coaching position in November 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On or about November 14, 2016, Beau Yarbrough, a staff writer for the Southern California News Group and a contributor to the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, requested (1) Doe's \"current job assignment and current salary,\" (2) \"information regarding additional compensation or benefits for coaches at [CVUSD] and the length of coaching assignments,\" (3) \"a copy of all complaints made against [Doe] in [their] career with [CVUSD]\" and (4) \"any documents relating to the status or resolution of those complaints.\" Yarbrough later narrowed his request to records that demonstrated the results of CVUSD's investigation. After determining that the complaints against Doe were substantial in nature and well founded, CVUSD informed Doe of its intent to disclose the disposition letters, while providing them an opportunity to contest such disclosure pursuant to the holding in\n   <em>\n    Marken v. Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School Dist.\n   </em>\n   (2012)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4245101\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/202/1250/\">\n    202 Cal.App.4th 1250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20395\">\n    136 Cal.Rptr.3d 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Marken\n   </em>\n   ). Doe objected to the release of the disposition letters. Nonetheless, on December 13, 2016, CVUSD notified Doe that it would be releasing them after December 23, 2016, unless prevented from doing so by a court order. On December 19, 2016, CVUSD provided Doe with copies of the letters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 21, 2016, ACT filed a verified petition for writ of mandate seeking to prevent disclosure of the disposition letters. On December 22, 2016, ACT successfully moved ex parte for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and order to show cause for a preliminary injunction, enjoining CVUSD from disclosing Doe's personnel records during the pendency of the action, and the trial court sealed the relevant documents. Subsequently, the parties stipulated that the preliminary injunction would be in effect pending further order of the court following the hearing on the petition for writ of mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 21, 2017, the trial court denied the petition for writ of mandate without providing substantive reasoning or analysis in support of its ruling. Judgment was entered on April 5, 2017, and CVUSD filed a notice of entry of judgment on April 12, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard of Review.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Generally, \"[a]n appellate court's role in the CPRA process is to 'conduct an independent review of the trial court's ruling; factual findings made by the trial court will be upheld if based on substantial evidence. [Citation.]' \" (\n   <em>\n    Wilder v.

Here, however, the pertinent facts are not disputed and the question is simply whether the CPRA mandates disclosure of the disposition letters. Since the issue involves the application of the CPRA to a given set of facts, it is a question of law subject to de novo appellate review. (\n   <em>\n    Lorig v.

The CPRA.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"The California Constitution guarantees both the individual's right of privacy\n   [citations] and the public's 'right of access to information concerning the public's business' [citation], including 'the writings of public officials and agencies.' [Citations.] With respect to the latter right, the Supreme Court has observed, 'Openness in government is essential to the functioning of a democracy. \"Implicit in the democratic process is the notion that government should be accountable for its actions. In order to verify accountability, individuals must have access to government files. Such access permits checks against the arbitrary exercise of official power and secrecy in the political process.\" ' [Citation.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"In the CPRA the Legislature has sought to reconcile these two fundamental, but sometimes conflicting, conditional rights. While 'mindful of\n   the right of individuals to privacy' [citation], the Legislature has declared 'access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.' [Citation.] Thus, the CPRA generally provides 'every person has a right to inspect any public record ...' [citation], '[e]xcept with respect to public records exempt from disclosure by express provisions of law ....' [Citation.] Section 6254, in turn, lists 29 categories of documents exempt from the requirement of public disclosure, many of which are designed to protect individual privacy, including, 'Personnel, medical, or similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.' [Citations.] Section 6255, subdivision (a), also permits a public agency to withhold other records if it can demonstrate 'on the facts of the particular case the public interest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"These statutory exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the CPRA must be narrowly construed. [Citations.] Moreover, the exemptions from disclosure provided by section 6254 are permissive, not mandatory: They allow nondisclosure but do not prohibit disclosure. [Citations.] Indeed, the penultimate sentence of section 6254 provides, 'Nothing in this section prevents any agency from opening its records concerning the administration of the agency to public inspection, unless disclosure is otherwise prohibited by law.'

The Appeal Is Not Moot Because the Right to Assert Exemption Under the CPRA Has Not Been Forfeited.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Because the disposition letters were disclosed to complainants, CVUSD contends that they are public records, and the appeal therefore is moot.

We disagree. CVUSD's unilateral disclosure of the disposition letters to complainants did not forfeit the right to assert the personnel and similar files exemption under the CPRA, nor did it mandate the release of these documents to the general public.

Pursuant to CPRA, BRV requested copies of the PI's report and any documentation pertaining to the district's retention of the PI and the superintendent's resignation. When the district refused to provide the PI's report on the ground it was exempt under the CPRA, BRV filed a petition for writ of mandate.

The trial court determined that the PI's report, including the interview summaries, were not subject to disclosure, and the district did not waive its right to prevent disclosure by transmitting the interview summaries to complainants for review and comment. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . ) The Court of Appeal held that the documents should be disclosed. In reaching this decision, the court did not conclude that the interview summaries became public records upon their disclosure to complainants. Rather, it weighed the superintendent's privacy interest against the public's right to know and found that the public's right to know outweighed any privacy interests due to the superintendent's \"position of authority as a public official and the public nature of the allegations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 759,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20519\">\n    49 Cal.Rptr.3d 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This case shares some factual similarities with\n   <em>\n    BRV\n   </em>\n   . Here, the relevant documents were provided to the complainants; however, they were not provided to a newspaper. Given the similarity of this case to\n   <em>\n    BRV\n   </em>\n   , we agree with the\n   <em>\n    BRV\n   </em>\n   court's approach of weighing the competing interests before ordering disclosure of the documents.
