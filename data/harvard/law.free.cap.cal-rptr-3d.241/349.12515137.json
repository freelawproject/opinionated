Because the matter must be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings, we conclude the issue is not ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The facts of the underlying crimes are minimally relevant to the issues raised on appeal. Briefly, on January 8 or 9, 1995, appellant, who was 17 years old, approached Jill N., threw her to the ground and choked her. Appellant forced Jill N. at knifepoint to orally copulate him. He also raped her. Appellant choked her into unconsciousness and when she awoke, appellant was gone, along with her belongings. (\n   <em>\n    Garcia I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , B104833.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 28, 1995, appellant raped Jane Doe in her hotel room. Appellant also hit her in the face and kicked her in the stomach and chest area. She suffered a fractured eye socket, ruptured eardrum, massive bruising and loosened teeth. After appellant left, she discovered that her wallet and other property were missing. (\n   <em>\n    Garcia I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , B104833.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 6, 1995, appellant attacked Hulda I. as she was walking on the beach. He grabbed her by the neck, put a gun to her side and said he would kill her if she called out. Appellant then choked her and hit her repeatedly in the face. After a passerby responded to her screams, appellant ran away. (\n   <em>\n    Garcia I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , B104833.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A jury convicted appellant of crimes against the three victims, including forcible oral copulation (count 1; \u00a7 288a, subd. (c) ), forcible rape (counts 2 &amp; 7; \u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2) ), assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury (counts 3 &amp; 10; \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1) ), robbery (counts 4 &amp; 8, \u00a7 211), kidnapping for sexual purposes (counts 5 &amp; 12; \u00a7\u00a7 207, subd. (a), former 208, subd. (d) ), forcible penetration by a foreign object (count 6; \u00a7 289, subd. (a) ), first degree burglary (count 9; \u00a7 459), and assault with intent to commit rape (count 11; \u00a7 220). The jury also found true allegations that appellant personally used a deadly weapon and inflicted great bodily injury on Jill N. (\u00a7\u00a7 12022, subd. (b), 12022.3, 12022.7, 12022.8), and that he inflicted great bodily injury on Jane Doe (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.7, 12022.8). Further, the jury found true the allegation that the crime of forcible penetration by a foreign objection (\u00a7 289, subd. (a) ) against Jane Doe occurred during the commission of a burglary pursuant to section 667.61, subdivisions (a) and (d). The jury also found true the allegation that appellant personally used a firearm during the commission of the offenses against Hulda I. (\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a).) Appellant was sentenced to an aggregate term of 94 years to life in prison. (\n   <em>\n    Garcia I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , B104833.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Caballero\n   </em>\n   were decided years after appellant was sentenced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Based on these authorities, appellant filed a habeas petition challenging the legality of his sentence. The trial court issued an order to show cause, observing that since appellant \"can only earn credit at the rate of 15%, he will be approximately 97 years old when he is first eligible for parole. [Appellant] turned 30 in 2007. At that time, a 30 year old African-American male was expected to live to the age of 72.7 years. [Citation.] Therefore, [appellant's] parole eligibility date ... falls outside his natural life expectancy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the show cause hearing, the prosecution requested a sentence that would render appellant eligible for a parole hearing date when he is approximately 77 years old. Defense counsel asked for a determinate sentence of 45 years, emphasizing certain mitigating factors, including appellant's childhood history of foster care and impoverishment and the improvements in his attitude and behavior in prison. Appellant testified on his own behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Noting that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Caballero\n   </em>\n   require that juvenile offenders be given \"a meaningful opportunity to rehabilitate and to demonstrate that [they] should be paroled within their natural life expectancy,\" the court imposed a sentence of 50 years to life. The sentence was comprised of two terms of 25 years to life, for counts 2 and 7, pursuant to section 667.61, known as the One Strike law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court found that this sentence would give appellant \"an opportunity to prove that [he's] capable of living on the outside at the age of 59. That's my calculation. Maybe it's 60, maybe it's 58, but somewhere in that ballpark. So, that's not young, but it's not 77 either.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Appellant is Entitled to a Juvenile Court Transfer Hearing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In supplemental briefing, appellant contends that, due to the passage of Proposition 57, he is entitled to a hearing in juvenile court regarding whether his case should be transferred to adult criminal court. Appellant requests that the judgment be conditionally reversed, so that the hearing may take place. The Attorney General concedes appellant is entitled to a transfer hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Appellant was charged with the offenses in 1995. Under the law at the time, appellant's case had to be brought in juvenile court. (See former\n   Welf. and Inst. Code section 707 ;\n   <em>\n    Juan G. v.

In order to try appellant as an adult, the district attorney had to file a motion pursuant to former Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (c) for a judicial determination that appellant was not fit to be dealt with under juvenile court law. For purposes of the motion, appellant was \"presumed to be not a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law unless the juvenile court concludes, based upon evidence, ... that the minor would be amenable to the care, treatment, and training program available through the facilities of the juvenile court,\" based on five criteria: \"(1) The degree of criminal sophistication exhibited by the minor. [\u00b6] (2) Whether the minor can be rehabilitated prior to the expiration of the juvenile court's jurisdiction. [\u00b6] (3) The minor's previous delinquent history. [\u00b6] (4) Success of previous attempts by the juvenile court to rehabilitate\n   the minor. [\u00b6] (5) The circumstances and gravity of the offenses alleged in the petition to have been committed by the minor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .) In order to make a finding of fitness, the juvenile court had to find \"the minor [was] fit and proper under each and every one of the above criteria.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) It is apparent that appellant was found to be unfit under these criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"Amendments to former [Welfare and Institutions Code] sections 602 and 707 in 1999 and 2000, some by initiative [Proposition 21], changed this historical rule.

[Citations.] ... [\u00b6] Proposition 57 changed the procedure again, and largely returned California to the historical rule. 'Among other provisions, Proposition 57 amended the Welfare and Institutions Code so as to eliminate direct filing by prosecutors.

Relevant here is section 3051, subdivision (b)(3), which provides for a parole eligibility hearing in the 25th year of incarceration if the sentence is a term of 25 years to life. This provision, however, does not apply to Three Strikes sentences and One Strike sentences for certain felony\n   sex offenses (\u00a7 667.61). ( \u00a7 3051, subd. (h).) The Legislature determined that juveniles convicted of certain serious sex crimes under aggravated circumstances may be kept in prison more than 25 years before being given an opportunity for parole. Appellant's sentence includes two terms of 25 years to life because, among other things, he committed a burglary in order to carry out a rape, thus falling within the One Strike sentencing scheme.

An early version of section 3051 did not exclude juvenile one strike offenders from a youth offender parole hearing (Legis. Counsel's Dig., Sen. Bill No. 260 (2013-2014 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 27, 2013, p. 5), but the legislation was amended several months later to specifically exclude this class of offenders (Legis. Counsel's Dig., Sen. Bill No. 260 (2013-2014 Reg.

Instead, the Legislature has provided for a parole hearing for one strike juvenile offenders at age 60 under section 3055. Establishing a longer period of incarceration before parole suitability hearings for juvenile one strike offenders is consistent with the state's long-standing policy recognizing the unique danger of recidivism posed by violent sexual offenders.
