(\n   Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21000 et seq. )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our task is to review specific challenges to the final EIR\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   that defendant County of Fresno (County) and its Board of Supervisors adopted, and the trial court approved. As we explain, we affirm in part and reverse in part the Court of Appeal's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Friant Ranch project (Project) consists of real party in interest Friant Ranch, L.P.'s (real party) planned development of the Central Valley's first master-planned \"pedestrian friendly\" community on a 942-acre site (formerly zoned agricultural) that sits adjacent to the unincorporated community of Friant in north central Fresno County, just south of the San\n   Joaquin River. The County is the local governmental entity that acted as the lead agency for the CEQA review and for preparation of the Project's EIR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Project includes the Friant Ranch Specific Plan (Specific Plan), which contemplates the construction of approximately 2,500 single and multi-family residential units that are age restricted to \"active adults\" age 55 and older, other residential units that are not age restricted, a commercial village center, a recreation center, trails, open space, a neighborhood electric vehicle network, and parks and parkways. The Project also includes 250,000 square feet of commercial space on 482 acres and the dedication of 460 acres to open space. An additional Friant Community Plan Update expands the Specific Plan area and adds policies that are consistent with the Specific Plan and the County's General Plan. The Project's construction is divided into five phases with an estimated 10-year build-out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Through its Board of Supervisors, the County received written comments to the draft EIR, held a public hearing, and prepared responses to the comments. After making the findings required under section 21081, subdivision (a), for each significant effect noted in the draft, the County issued a Statement of Overriding Considerations (Statement) that is required in CEQA approved projects to show that the Project's significant environmental effects have been identified, and avoided or mitigated, or that unmitigated effects will be outweighed by the Project's benefits. (\u00a7\u00a7 21002, 21002.1, 21081; Guidelines, \u00a7\u00a7 15091-15093.) The Statement noted: \"The Project implements and furthers important plans and public policies adopted and endorsed by the County related to urban growth.\" The Statement also observed that the County \"made a reasonable and good faith effort to eliminate or substantially mitigate the environmental impacts resulting from the Project by requiring implementation of the environmentally superior alternative-Project Alternative No. 3: Northeast Development Configuration and the Beck Property alternative wastewater treatment plant location-and various mitigation measures, goals and policies identified in the EIR, General Plan, the proposed Friant Community Plan Update, and the proposed Friant Ranch Specific Plan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On February 1, 2011, the County's Board of Supervisors approved Project Alternative 3, certified the EIR, and approved a version of the Specific Plan that prohibited the discharge of treated effluent\n   into the river from the wastewater treatment plant. The County also adopted a Mitigation Monitoring Program (MMP), which noted in part that compliance with the mitigation measures would be \"enforced through subsequent conditions\n   of approval for future discretionary actions,\" including use permits and tentative subdivision maps for the Specific Plan area. By petition for writ of mandamus filed in the trial court, plaintiffs Sierra Club, Revive the San Joaquin, and League of\n   Women Voters of Fresno (collectively, plaintiffs) challenged the County's certification of the EIR, alleging that it violated CEQA in several respects. ( Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5 [challenge to public agency's determination based on alleged CEQA noncompliance requires administrative mandamus proceeding].) The trial court rejected plaintiffs' challenges and approved the Project, noting in its judgment that in reviewing CEQA decisions, \"it may not exercise its independent judgment on the evidence, but must determine only whether the act or decision is supported by substantial evidence.\" In reviewing the EIR, the court agreed with County's findings on traffic impact, biological resources, wastewater treatment, and air quality impact, among other considerations. It stated that the court \"does not pass on the correctness of any EIR's environmental conclusions, but instead determines whether the EIR is sufficient as an informational document. All conflicts in the evidence and reasonable inferences must be resolved and drawn in favor of the agency's decisions and findings. The reviewing Court does not reweigh the evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The court's judgment also observed that regarding air quality impacts, the County explained why the EIR's mitigation measures would reduce the Project's greenhouse gas emissions. The court agreed with the County that plaintiffs did not cite to the record in sufficient detail to show any error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the end of its judgment, the court noted that it retained jurisdiction to allow the County a reasonable amount of time to circulate a Park Impact analysis on the Project's effect on adjoining parks, including Lost Lake Park and Millerton Lake. This analysis is not at issue here. Otherwise, the court denied all of plaintiffs' claims and entered judgment in favor of real party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs appealed the judgment before the County could implement the mitigation measures. They claimed in relevant part that the Project's EIR failed to comply with CEQA because its discussion of air quality impacts was inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court of Appeal agreed with plaintiffs' contentions involving the EIR's consideration of the Project's air quality impacts on the following grounds: \"(1) the EIR was inadequate because it failed to include an analysis that correlated the [P]roject's emission of air pollutants to its impact on human health; (2) the mitigation measures for the [P]roject's long-term air quality impacts violate CEQA because they are vague, unenforceable and lack specific performance criteria; and (3) the statement that the air quality\n   mitigation provisions will\n   <em>\n    substantially\n   </em>\n   reduce air quality impacts is unexplained and unsupported. These defects must be cured by the preparation of a revised EIR.\" The Court of Appeal reversed the trial court's judgment on those grounds only.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We granted real party's petition for review on the issues concerning the Court of Appeal's reversal of the trial court judgment upholding the air quality impact findings and conclusions in the EIR's chapter 3 (discussing air quality impacts). The scope of our review concerns how courts should determine the adequacy of an EIR's discussion, including: What standard of review a court must apply when adjudicating a challenge to the adequacy of an EIR's discussion of adverse environmental impacts and mitigation measures, and whether CEQA requires an EIR to connect a project's air quality impacts to specific health consequences. We must also\n   decide whether a lead agency impermissibly defers mitigation measures when it retains the discretion to substitute later adopted measures in place of those proposed in the EIR, and whether a lead agency may adopt mitigation measures that do not reduce a project's significant and unavoidable impacts to a less-than-significant level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We conclude as follows: When reviewing whether a discussion is sufficient to satisfy CEQA, a court must be satisfied that the EIR (1) includes sufficient detail to enable those who did not participate in its preparation to understand and to consider meaningfully the issues the proposed project raises (\n   <em>\n    Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California\n   </em>\n   (1988)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1971402\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/47/376/#p405\">\n    47 Cal.3d 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 405,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=253%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20426\">\n    253 Cal.Rptr. 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=764%20P.2d%20278\">\n    764 P.2d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Laurel Heights I\n   </em>\n   ) ), and (2) makes a reasonable effort to substantively connect a project's air quality impacts to likely health consequences. As explained below, the EIR in this case failed to do so. The EIR should be revised to relate the expected adverse air quality impacts to likely health consequences or explain in meaningful detail why it is not feasible at the time of drafting to provide such an analysis, so that the public may make informed decisions regarding the costs and benefits of the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We further conclude that a lead agency may leave open the possibility of employing better mitigation efforts consistent with improvements in technology without being deemed to have impermissibly deferred mitigation measures. A lead agency may adopt mitigation measures that do not reduce the project's adverse impacts to less than significant levels, so long as the agency can demonstrate in good faith that the measures will at least be partially effective at mitigating the Project's impacts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We therefore affirm the Court of Appeal's judgment finding the EIR's analyses of the Project's air quality impacts inadequate. However, we reverse the Court of Appeal's judgment that the EIR improperly deferred mitigation measures by proposing to substitute more effective measures if available in the future, and that the mitigation measures proposed were impermissibly vague and unlikely to reduce adverse health impacts to less than significant levels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Adequacy of the EIR's discussion of health impacts of the Project's long-term effects on air quality\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that the EIR was insufficient as an informational document because\n   it failed to adequately explain how the air pollutants the Project generated would impact public health.

Section 21168.5 states in part: \"In any action or proceeding ... to attack, review, set aside, void or annul a determination, finding, or decision of a public agency on the grounds of noncompliance with this division, the inquiry shall extend only to whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.\" (See \u00a7 21005, subd. (a) [noncompliance with information disclosure requirements may \"constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion\"].) Our decisions have thus articulated a procedural issues/factual issues dichotomy. \"[A]n agency may abuse its discretion under CEQA either by failing to proceed in the manner CEQA provides or by reaching factual conclusions unsupported by substantial evidence. (\u00a7 21168.5.) Judicial review of these two types of error differs significantly: While we determine de novo whether the agency has employed the correct procedures, 'scrupulously enforc[ing] all legislatively mandated CEQA requirements' (\n   <em>\n    Citizens of Goleta Valley v.

In most cases, the question whether an agency has followed proper procedures will have a clear answer. Did the agency provide sufficient notice and opportunity to comment on a draft EIR? (\u00a7 21092; Guidelines, \u00a7 15087.) Did the agency omit the required discussion of alternatives? (Guidelines, \u00a7 15126.6.) As to these legal requirements, the agency has no discretion, and courts will invalidate an EIR that fails to meet them. In that sense, judicial review is de novo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   But the question whether an agency has followed proper procedures is not always so clear.

The case involved a challenge to an EIR's discussion of alternatives to the proposed construction of the University of California, San Francisco's (UCSF) Laurel Heights campus. This court concluded that the discussion was inadequate: \"UCSF's treatment of alternatives was cursory at best. The draft EIR identified three types of alternatives: no project anywhere, alternative sites on the UCSF Parnassus campus, and alternative sites off-campus. The three categories received a scant one and one-half pages of text in an EIR of more than 250 pages. The EIR stated the obvious conclusion that the 'no project' alternative, i.e., no relocation to Laurel Heights, would not have the environmental effects identified in the EIR. It then stated in a mere two-sentence paragraph that '... no alternative sites on [the Parnassus] campus were evaluated as possible candidates for the location of the basic science units of the School of Pharmacy.'

The Court of Appeal found, however, that the EIR was inadequate under CEQA because its analysis failed to correlate the increase in emissions that the Project would generate to the adverse impacts on human health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Real party had argued below that \"the reader can infer from the provided information that the Project will make air quality and human health worse.\" But the Court of Appeal concluded that \"although the better/worse dichotomy is a useful starting point for analyzing adverse environmental impacts, including those to human health, more information is needed to understand that adverse impact.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The EIR does include some discussion of the health impacts of various pollutants and attempts to provide an explanation for its lack of specificity. It offers a general discussion of adverse health effects associated with certain Project-related pollutants. Notably, it also recognized that Fresno County suffers from the \"most severe\" ozone problems in the state and acknowledged the relationship between adverse ambient air quality and certain health risks to the respiratory system that could affect asthmatics, children, and healthy adults. These adverse effects, the draft EIR observed, could include \"breathing and respiratory symptoms, aggravation of existing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, alterations to the immune system, carcinogenesis, and premature death.\" The EIR explained, however, that a more detailed analysis of health impacts is not possible at this early planning phase. According to the EIR, \"Health Risk Assessments are typically prepared for inclusion in development specific\n   project EIRs when certain types of development commonly known to have the potential to result in a human health risk are being proposed (automobile fueling stations [for example] ). Due to the broad nature of the planning approvals analyzed in this EIR, it is impossible to conduct a human health risk assessment based on specific proposed uses at specific locations within the boundaries of the Project Area because such specific information has not been determined.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We agree with the Court of Appeal that the EIR's discussion of health impacts found in Impact No. 3.3.2 is inadequate as an informational document, similar to what the court found in\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 124 Cal.App.4th at p. 1220,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20203\">\n    22 Cal.Rptr.3d 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The EIR's discussion of health impacts of the named pollutants provides only a general description of symptoms that are associated with exposure to the ozone, particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NOx), and the discussion of health impacts regarding each type of pollutant is at most a few sentences of general information. The disclosures of the health effects related to PM, CO, and sulfur dioxide fail to indicate the concentrations at which such pollutants would trigger the identified symptoms. As in\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   , \"[a]fter reading the EIRs, the public would have no idea of the health consequences that result when more pollutants are added to a nonattainment basin.\" (\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 124 Cal.App.4th at p. 1220,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20203\">\n    22 Cal.Rptr.3d 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) And as mentioned above, a sufficient discussion of significant impacts requires not merely a determination of whether an impact is significant, but some effort to explain the nature and magnitude of the impact. (See\n   <em>\n    Cleveland National Forest\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 3 Cal.5th at pp. 514-515,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513605\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/220/294/#p514\">\n    220 Cal.Rptr.3d 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513605\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/220/294/#p514\">\n    397 P.3d 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The EIR in this case fails to meet the standards articulated in\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cleveland National Forest\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Even in the one area in which the EIR goes into some detail about health effects-ozone-the analysis is inadequate. The EIR states: \"Exposure to ambient levels of ozone ranging from 0.10 to 0.40 [parts per million of ozone] has been found to significantly alter lung functions by increasing\n   respiratory rates and pulmonary resistance, decreasing tidal volumes, and impairing respiratory mechanics. Ambient levels of ozone above 0.12 [parts per million] are linked to symptomatic responses that include such symptoms as throat dryness, chest tightness, headache, and nausea.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   At first glance, this information appears to potentially illuminate the health impacts of ozone produced by the Project. But the EIR presents no evidence of the anticipated parts per million (ppm) of ozone as a result of the Project. Rather, the EIR provides the estimated tons per year of reactive organic material (ROG) and NOx, the two components that react with sunlight to form ozone (i.e., ROG + NOx + sunlight ? ozone). The raw numbers estimating the tons per year of ROG and NOx from the Project do not give any information to the reader about how much ozone is estimated to be produced as a result. Therefore, the disclosure of the health impacts associated with exposure to 0.10 to 0.40 ppm of ozone is not meaningful within the context of the Project because the reader has no idea how much ozone will be produced (i.e., whether the amount of ozone resulting from the ROG and NOx pollution will bring the ozone ppm within the 0.10 to 0.40 range).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Guidelines section 15126.2, subdivision (a) is instructive. It mandates that an EIR \"identify and focus on the significant environmental effects of the proposed project ... examin[ing] [ ] changes in the existing physical conditions in the affected area,\" that it identify and describe \"[d]irect and indirect significant effects of the project on the environment,\" and that the discussion should include, among other things, \"relevant specifics of ... health and safety problems caused by the physical changes.\" It also suggests that a connection be drawn between the two segments of information presented in the EIR-potential project emissions and human health impacts. Such a connection would meet CEQA's requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Relying on various amici curiae briefs submitted to the court, the County and real party attempt to explain why the connection between emissions and human health that plaintiffs seek cannot be provided given the state of environmental science modeling in use at this time. The parties may be\n   correct; we express no view on the question, except to note that scientific certainty is not the standard. But if it is not scientifically possible to do more than has already been done to connect air quality effects with potential human health impacts, the EIR itself must explain why, in a manner reasonably calculated to inform the public of the scope of what is and is not yet known about the Project's impacts. Contained in a brief, such explanation is directed at the wrong audience. The relevant informational document here is the EIR, and the EIR must communicate not to the reviewing court, but \"the public and the government officials deciding on the\n   project.\" (\n   <em>\n    Vineyard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 40 Cal.4th at p. 443,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20821\">\n    53 Cal.Rptr.3d 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=150%20P.3d%20709\">\n    150 P.3d 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) For purposes of supplementing the EIR and bringing it in conformance with CEQA, the information contained in the briefs \"is irrelevant [ ] because the public and decision makers did not have the briefs available at the time the project was reviewed and approved.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . [\"That a party's briefs to the court may explain or supplement matters that are obscure or incomplete in the EIR [ ] is irrelevant.... The question is [ ] not whether the project's significant environmental\n   effects\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   be clearly explained, but whether they\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   .\"].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We further reject real party's argument that the EIR sufficiently accounted for its lack of specificity by explaining that a \"Health Risk Assessment\" is typically prepared later in the CEQA process, in connection with development-specific EIRs. A \"Health Risk Assessment\" is defined in the Health and Safety Code as a type of analysis undertaken in connection with the siting of hazardous substances, \"a detailed comprehensive analysis ... to evaluate and predict the dispersion of hazardous substances in the environment and the potential for exposure of human populations and to assess and quantify both the individual and population wide health risks associated with those levels of exposure.\" ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 44306.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   CEQA does not mandate such an in-depth risk assessment. CEQA requires that the EIR have made a reasonable effort to discuss relevant specifics regarding the connection between two segments of information already contained in the EIR, the general health effects associated with a particular pollutant and the estimated amount of that pollutant the project will likely produce. This discussion will allow the public to make an informed decision, as CEQA requires. Because the EIR as written makes it impossible for the public to translate the bare numbers provided into adverse health impacts or to understand why such translation is not possible at this time (and what limited translation is, in fact, possible), we agree with the Court of Appeal that the EIR's discussion of air quality impacts in this case was inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court of Appeal identified several ways in which the EIR could have framed the analysis so as to adequately inform the public and decision makers of possible adverse health effects. The County could have, for example, identified the Project's impact on the days of nonattainment per year. But the Court of Appeal was clear that, ultimately-though the EIR must provide an analysis that is adequate to inform (Guidelines, \u00a7 15151)-the \"County has discretion in choosing what type of analysis to provide....\" We agree. The task for real party and the County is clear: The EIR must provide an adequate analysis to inform the public how its bare numbers translate to create potential adverse impacts or it must adequately explain what the agency\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   know and why, given existing scientific constraints, it cannot translate potential health impacts further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   To be sure, \" 'courts have looked not for perfection but for adequacy, completeness, and a good faith effort at full disclosure.' \" (\n   <em>\n    In re Bay-Delta etc.\n   </em>\n   (2008)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3884051\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/43/1143/#p1175\">\n    43 Cal.4th 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1175,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20578\">\n    77 Cal.Rptr.3d 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=184%20P.3d%20709\">\n    184 P.3d 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) But basic CEQA principles dictate there must be a reasonable effort to put into a meaningful context the conclusion that the air quality impacts will be significant. Although the EIR generally outlines some of the unhealthy symptoms associated with exposure to various pollutants, it does not give any sense of the nature and magnitude of the \"health and safety problems caused by the physical changes\" resulting from the Project as required by the CEQA guidelines. (Guidelines, \u00a7 15126.2, subd. (a).) Perhaps it was not possible\n   to do more. But even in that case, we would have found the EIR insufficient because it failed to explain why it was not feasible to provide an analysis that connected the air quality effects to human health consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Mitigation measures\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    \"Substantially reduce air quality impacts\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   At the outset of the discussion of proposed Mitigation Measure 3.3.2 (discussed more fully in part D below), the\n   EIR stated that \"Implementation of the following mitigation measures will substantially reduce air quality impacts related to human activity within the entire Project area but not to a level that is less than significant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Court of Appeal concluded that the EIR's use of the term \"substantial\" to describe the impact the proposed mitigation measures would have on reducing the Project's significant health effects, without further explanation or factual support, amounted to a \"bare conclusion\" that did not satisfy CEQA's disclosure requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We agree with the Court of Appeal on this point.

Plaintiffs contend that the Project's EIR is insufficient, because \"the mitigation analysis is devoid of criteria for measuring the effectiveness of mitigation measures.\" (Guidelines, \u00a7 15126.4, subd.

Allowing future substitutions for equal or more efficient technology to mitigate a project's acknowledged significant effects promotes CEQA's goal of environmental protection and is not an impermissible deferral of mitigation or an abuse of discretion.

(\u00a7 21081.6, subd. (b).) We note that the measures referred to in this section are proposed as \"guidelines\" that \"shall be used by the County during review of future project-specific submittals for non-residential development ... with [the] intent that specified measures be required where feasible and appropriate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Court of Appeal found the EIR mitigation \"provision about equipping HVAC units with a catalyst system does not identify who will determine if the system is 'reasonably available and economically feasible' \" and is unenforceable. In its analysis, the court omitted the next sentence, \"[c]atalyst systems are considered feasible if the additional cost is less than 10% of the base HVAC cost.\" This definition of what constitutes \"economically feasible\" catalyst systems eliminates the need to have individuals make such determinations. The Court of Appeal also found the phrase \" 'PremAir or similar catalyst system' \" vague for not defining what performance criteria must be met to be a \" 'similar catalyst system.' \" The term is not vague. PremAir is a brand name for an HVAC catalyst system. The individuals proposing new projects, or those tasked with evaluating the proposals for approval, would necessarily have knowledge of HVAC systems and catalyst systems, including PremAir. It is also impossible to require specific performance criteria, given that the type, size, model, and efficiency levels of the HVAC systems being installed in these future projects are unknown. Given the uncertainty of these future proposed projects, the language \" 'PremAir or similar catalyst system' \" is sufficient under CEQA to provide an enforceable mitigation measure for any HVAC systems associated with those projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Court of Appeal similarly found that the mitigation measure requiring trees be selected to provide shade did not specify the person(s) responsible for selecting which trees to plant. The measure instructs that \" '[t]rees selected to shade paved areas should be varieties that will shade 25% of the paved area within 20 years.' \" The instruction provides sufficient guidance for selecting appropriate shade trees. Any plan that the County approves must be complete, and must contain information about the trees selected for this mitigation measure. It seems clear that the person(s) selecting the trees would be the individuals or entity submitting the plans to the County for approval. The measure is not vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In finding the mitigation measures cannot be enforced through permit conditions, agreements, or other measures, the Court of Appeal also misinterpreted section 21081.6, subdivision (b) and its significant\n   effects provision, which provides that a public agency may set forth conditions of project approval required to avoid significant effects in \"referenced documents which address [or incorporate the] required mitigation measures ... into the plan.\" (\u00a7 21081.6, subd. (b).) The Project's MMP places the burden of enforcement on the County to \"ensure that all construction plans and project operations conform to the conditions of the mitigated project.\" The Specific Plan additionally states that \"The County shall monitor compliance with the Specific Plan and mitigation measures,\" and it provides the stages of planning at which certain mitigation measures must be completed. These measures are not vague as to how they will be enforced; the County will enforce them during the approval process of future nonresidential development.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, if the County were to\n   approve a project that did not include a feasible mitigation measure, such approval would amount to an abuse of discretion, which could be corrected in a court mandamus proceeding.

At this point, we cannot know whether the required additional analysis will disclose that the Project's effects on air quality are less than significant or unavoidable, or whether that analysis will require reassessment of proposed mitigation measures. Absent an analysis that reasonably informs the public how anticipated air quality effects will adversely affect human health, an EIR may still be sufficient if it adequately explains why it is not scientifically feasible at the time of drafting to provide such an analysis. Otherwise, the EIR is generally clear about the potential environmental harm under the Specific Plan, and it outlined mitigation measures to address those effects with factual support and scientific consensus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Based on the foregoing analysis, we affirm in part and reverse in part the Court of Appeal's judgment and remand the matter for additional proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   We Concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   CANTIL-SAKAUYE, C.

The Court of Appeal concluded that the amount and location of wastewater use and disposal, and the hydrogeology of the site chosen for the wastewater treatment plant, were addressed in sufficient detail during the environmental review process. The Court of Appeal also concluded that the development plan was consistent with the land use element (as changed from agricultural to residential by amendment), and that the traffic policy issues had not been properly exhausted during the administrative process. The parties do not dispute the Court of Appeal's judgment on these issues, and we do not address that aspect of the court's opinion here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    A \"significant effect\" is defined as \"a substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment.\" (\u00a7 21068.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Guidelines section 15370 provides that legally adequate mitigation measures must be capable of \"(a) Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action.

Of course, they each are part of the greater \"residential development\" in the project, but for EIR purposes are considered \"non-residential\" since they involve cleaning the air, planting trees, and creating bicycle trails.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
