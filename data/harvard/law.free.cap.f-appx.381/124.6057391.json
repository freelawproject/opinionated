We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-24\">Albert filed a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 challenging his 2006 conviction for violating federal child pornography laws. Among other things, Albert claimed a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights based on an allegedly illegal search of his home and his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. Albert does not state in his habe-as petition in which court he was convicted, but correspondence attached to his petition appears to indicate that he was convicted in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-25\">The Magistrate Judge recommended that Albert\u2019s petition be dismissed because a motion to vacate sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 filed in the sentencing court is the exclusive means to challenge his conviction. The Magistrate Judge noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>that Albert did not satisfy the narrow exception allowing a petition to be filed under \u00a7 2241 where a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of detention. In his objections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report, Albert stated that he may not seek relief under \u00a7 2255 because the statute of limitations has passed. He also argued the merits of his Fourth Amendment claim. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and recommendation and dismissed the petition, noting that Albert\u2019s objections made clear that his remedy, if any, is by way of a \u00a7 2255 motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">As recognized by the District Court, \u201c[mjotions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 are the presumptive means by which federal prisoners can challenge their convictions or sentences that are allegedly in violation of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.Sd 117, 120 (3d Cir. 2002). Although a petitioner may challenge a conviction pursuant to \u00a7 2241 where a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d a \u00a7 2255 motion is not inadequate or ineffective because the sentencing court denies relief, the one-year statute of limitations has expired, or the petitioner is unable to meet \u00a7 2255\u2019s gatekeeping requirements. <em>Cradle v. United States, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538-39 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam). Rather, a \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective \u201conly where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a \u00a7 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his wrongful detention claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538. <em>See also In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 248-52 (3d Cir.1997) (construing \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d provision of \u00a7 2255).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Albert has not made such a showing. The fact that Albert may be time-barred from filing a \u00a7 2255 motion does not render a \u00a7 2255 motion \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d Because this appeal does not raise a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-20\">. Because Albert\u2019s claim lacks arguable merit, his request for appointment of counsel is denied. Ta<em>bron v. Grace, </em>6 F.3d 147, 155 (3d Cir. 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
