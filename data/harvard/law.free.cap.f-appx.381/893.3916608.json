Slay argues that the district court failed to provide a written statement to explain why it varied upward from the guideline range. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-21\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a district court complied with section 3553(c). <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1181 (11th Cir.2006). An error in sentencing is reviewed for harmless error. Under that standard, after \u201cviewing the proceedings in their entirety, ... [if] the error did not affect the sentence or had but very slight effect,\u201d we will affirm the sentence. <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-22\">We need not decide whether the district court erred because any error in failing to provide Slay a written statement is harmless. The district court explained at Slay\u2019s sentencing hearing that it varied upward to punish Slay for having manipulated and deceived the prosecutor and the district court. Slay obtained permission to associate with known felons ostensibly to assist law enforcement and then used those contacts to distribute cocaine. Slay does not argue that the explanation provided at his sentencing hearing was deficient or otherwise affected his ability to appeal his sentence. Slay was not harmed by the lack of a written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-23\">Slay\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
