Rushing pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine and use of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). The guidelines sentencing range was 92 to 115 months for the methamphetamine offense and 60 months for the firearm offense. The district court determined that an upward variance from the guidelines range was appropriate and imposed consecutive sentences of 135 and 72 months, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Rushing challenges the district court\u2019s reasons for the sentences as insufficient. Because he did not object on this basis in the district court, we review the issue for plain error. <em>See United, States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 258, 261-62 (5th Cir.2009). Rushing confuses the upward variance imposed by the district court with an upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. He asserts that the district court\u2019s explanation was insufficient, because it did not show that the court applied the procedure required by \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(4)(B) and because the court relied on his arrest record in violation of \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(3). We distinguish between an upward departure allowed under the guidelines and a non-guidelines sentence, or variance, that is outside of the guidelines range. <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008). The district court stated that it was imposing an upward variance. As such, it was permitted to rely on Rushing\u2019s arrest record, supported by additional evidence of criminal conduct (including Rushing\u2019s \u201csix or seven\u201d convictions as well as the violent and drug-related nature of the charges underlying his prior arrests), in imposing the above-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 625, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). The provisions of \u00a7 4A1.3 did not apply, and the district court did not err by failing to show that it complied with those provisions. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706-08 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-16\">Next Rushing contends that the district court erred by relying on elements of the offense to impose the above-guidelines sentence. The appellant\u2019s brief must contain his \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which [he] relies.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A). Rushing abandons this argument by failing to offer any legal support for it. <em>See id.; United States v. Stalnaker, </em>571 F.3d 428, 439-40 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-17\">Rushing also asserts that the district court\u2019s reasons were not factually specific or detailed enough to allow review by this court. The district court provided a lengthy explanation for the upward variance that included fact-specific reasons such as Rushing\u2019s \u201csix or seven\u201d prior convictions, 25 arrests, history of narcotics distribution and physical violence, and the violence involved in the instant offense. It cited aggravating circumstances not ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>counted for by the guidelines, including a separate robbery committed by Rushing on the night of the instant offenses, his possession of firearms as a convicted felon, his fleeing to Wyoming after the instant offenses, and his failure to provide officials with the source of methamphetamine he purchased. The district court referenced the sentencing factors under \u00a7 3553(a) and explained that the variance was necessary to protect society and deter future crimes. The court acknowledged Rushing\u2019s argument that his troubled background was a mitigating factor but rejected it because Rushing had \u201cample opportunities\u201d as an adult to change but failed to do so. Accordingly, we find no error, plain or otherwise, with the reasons provided by the district court. <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 708; <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">We do not consider Rushing\u2019s remaining argument that the consecutive sentences imposed by the district court were disproportionate to his offenses and unsupported by the record. Although Rushing states that this court should use the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) as a guide in reviewing the reasonableness of his sentences, he does not explain why the sentences were excessive under those factors, dispute the factors relied on by the district court, or cite to the record. By failing to brief the issue sufficiently, he waives it. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>Stalnaker, </em>571 F.3d at 439-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
