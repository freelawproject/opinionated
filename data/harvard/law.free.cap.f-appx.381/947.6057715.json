This is Auger\u2019s second appeal challenging the district court\u2019s finding as to the number of marijuana plants seized on Auger\u2019s property. After review, we affirm Auger\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A_9\">A. Auger\u2019s First Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">Auger allowed others use land he leased to grow marijuana. When the marijuana growing operation was discovered, law enforcement agents executed a search warrant at Auger\u2019s property and seized the marijuana plants growing there.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-14\">At Auger\u2019s original sentencing, the government presented testimony of Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) Special Agent Stephen Tinsley, who inspected the seized plants three days after they were collected and counted. Tinsley testified that many of the plants he saw were \u201cseedlings\u201d in plastic trays, but that the reported 8,664-plant count appeared accurate within 1,000 plants. Based on Tins-ley\u2019s testimony, the district court found that 8,664 plants were seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-15\">This Court vacated Auger\u2019s sentence and remanded for further fact finding as to the number of seedlings seized on Auger\u2019s property and whether those seedlings were \u201cplants,\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c). <em>United States v. Auger, </em>338 Fed.Appx. 823 (11th Cir.2009). The commentary to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) defines a \u201cplant\u201d as \u201can organism having leaves and a readily observable root formation (e.g., a marihuana cutting having roots, a rootball, or root hairs is a marihuana plant).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) cmt. n. 17. We explained that, because Auger objected to the statement in the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) that 8,664 plants were seized on Auger\u2019s property, the government was required to produce evidence that the 8,664 plants seized had observable root formation. Agent Tinsley had not testified as to whether the \u201cseedlings\u201d he saw had observable root formation. <em>Auger, </em>338 Fed.Appx. at 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-16\">B. Resentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b972-17\">At the resentencing hearing, the government presented testimony from Coffee County Sheriffs Department Detective James Hersey, who supervised the counting of the plants seized on Auger\u2019s proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>ty. Hersey stated that a Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent instructed his officers that each organism had to have root-balls, root hairs or a rooting system to qualify as a plant. Accordingly, only plants with existing root systems were counted. After his officers finished the count, Hersey recounted the plants and placed them in black plastic bags. Hersey counted 8,664 marijuana plants. Hersey did not count between 200 and 600 plants because they were too small. Hersey identified several photographs of the plants seized from Auger\u2019s property. One photograph shows several small plants growing in trays, and two photographs show larger marijuana plants growing in the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\">The government also called Agent Tins-ley, who testified that after this Court vacated Auger\u2019s original sentence, he photographed what remained of the seized marijuana plants, including the root systems. Tinsley explained that when he first inspected the seized marijuana plants, they were stored in a blue Tupperware tub, garbage bags and brown sacks. At the time, Tinsley believed that the amount collected looked like it could have been 8,000 marijuana plants. Later, when Tinsley returned to photograph the plants, although much of the material had since rotted, Tinsley could still identify the plants\u2019 root systems. Tinsley clarified that at no time during his investigation did he observe any plants without a root system. The government introduced Tinsley\u2019s photographs, which showed, <em>inter alia, </em>a large blue container, four garbage bags of rotting plants, and close-ups of plants that have visible root material and soil.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">Defendant Auger called Scott Harper, an evidence custodian with the Coffee County Sheriffs Department. Harper testified that several months after the seizure, he provided Agent Tinsley with samples of the marijuana plants in a paper bag for testing. Harper opined that, in his experience, marijuana plants one to two inches tall typically do not have a root structure. When Auger asked Harper whether be believed the blue Tupperware container depicted in the government\u2019s photographs was large enough to store 8,664 marijuana plants, the district court sustained the government\u2019s objection and stated that the evidence was that the plants were stored in multiple containers, including boxes, bags and plastic bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">Based on the evidence presented, the district court again found that Auger was accountable for 8,664 marijuana plants. The district court found that \u201cthe number of seized organisms that were seedlings were at least 8,664; and that the number of seized organisms that had readily observable root formations and met the definition of a plant were at least 8,664 plants.\u201d The district court calculated Auger\u2019s base offense level accordingly, which resulted in an advisory guidelines range of 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court reimposed a 46-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">On appeal, Auger argues that the district court\u2019s finding of 8,664 marijuana plants is clearly erroneous and, as a result, his 46-month sentence is procedurally unreasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">Although the Sentencing Guidelines are now advisory after <em>United States v. Book</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number><em>er, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court must still calculate the advisory guidelines range correctly. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence based on a miscalculated advisory guidelines range or on clearly erroneous facts is procedurally unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">When a defendant objects to a PSPs factual allegation \u201cused in calculating his guideline sentence, such as drug amount, the government bears the burden of establishing the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1296. Although \u201c[t]he preponderance of the evidence is a relaxed evidentia-ry standard,\u201d if the defendant has properly objected, the district court may not \u201csentence the defendant in the absence of sufficient evidence....\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court\u2019s findings of fact at sentencing \u201cmay be based on evidence heard during trial, facts admitted by a defendant\u2019s plea of guilty, undisputed statements in the presentence report, or evidence presented at the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>United States v. Saunders, </em>318 F.3d 1257, 1271 n. 22 (11th Cir. 2003) (quotation marks omitted). A sentencing court may consider any evidence, including hearsay, regardless of its admissibility so long as it has sufficient indicia of reliability, the district court makes explicit credibility findings and the defendant has an opportunity to rebut the evidence. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1253 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Here, the district court\u2019s finding that Auger\u2019s offense involved 8,664 marijuana plants is supported by Detective Hersey\u2019s testimony. Hersey testified that his officers counted 8,664 marijuana \u201cplants\u201d with observable root formations and that he then verified that count by recounting them himself. The district court credited Hersey\u2019s testimony, which was corroborated by Agent Tinsley\u2019s testimony that he saw root systems on the plants and the government\u2019s photographs of seized marijuana plants with visible roots.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">Auger has given us no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s credibility finding. Auger points to Agent Tinsley\u2019s testimony that when he visited Auger\u2019s property three days after the seizure, he saw stalks and roots sticking out of the ground. We reject Auger\u2019s contention that this evidence shows that law enforcement cut down <em>all </em>the plants and left the roots. Furthermore, while some plants may have been cut down, Auger presented no evidence that these \u201ccuttings\u201d were counted by Detective Hersey and his officers. Thus, Agent Tinsley\u2019s testimony does not contradict Hersey\u2019s testimony that he counted only plants with roots.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">Auger also contends that it was \u201cpatently impossible\u201d for 8,664 marijuana plants with observable roots to be stored in the blue Tupperware container. However, the district court did not find that the officers stored all the plants in the blue container. To the contrary, as the district court noted during the sentencing hearing, Agent Tins-ley testified that the seized plants were stored in multiple containers, including garbage bags and brown paper bags. Notably, Agent Tinsley\u2019s photographs show at least four garbage bags in addition to the blue container.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">Finally, Auger contends that the government\u2019s photographs show \u201cfar less than 8,664 roots.\u201d However, none of the witnesses testified that the marijuana plants depicted in the government\u2019s photographs were all of the marijuana plants seized at Auger\u2019s property. And, the government was not required to photograph the root system of every marijuana plant in order to carry its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-10\">We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Auger\u2019s offense involved 8,664 marijuana plants and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>properly calculated Auger\u2019s base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). Because the district court did not rely on clearly erroneous facts and did not miscalculate Auger\u2019s advisory guidelines range, Auger has not shown that his 46-month sentence is procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-5\">. We review a district court's fact finding as to drug quantity for clear error. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir. 2005). When that fact finding is based on the credibility of witnesses, \u201cthe resolution will almosl never be clear error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review the reasonableness of a sentence under the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
