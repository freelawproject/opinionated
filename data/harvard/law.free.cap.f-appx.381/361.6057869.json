Viramontes maintains that his 30-month sentence, which was below the properly calculated guidelines range, is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-21\">Viramontes\u2019s assertion that his sentence is unreasonable is conclusory and unsupported by legal analysis. An appellate court is not required to search the record to find the legal basis for an issue. <em>United States, v. Brace, </em>145 F.3d 247, 255 (5th Cir.1998) (en banc). Because Viramontes is represented by counsel on appeal, his brief is not entitled to liberal construction. <em>See Beasley v. McCotter, </em>798 F.2d 116, 118 (5th Cir.1986). Issues must be briefed to be preserved. Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). Consequently, given that Viramontes\u2019s only issue for appeal has not been preserved, we do not consider it. Moreover, nothing in the briefs or the record gives us any reason to believe that the below guideline sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
