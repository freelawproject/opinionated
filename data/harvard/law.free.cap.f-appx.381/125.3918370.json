Nelson appeals from the order of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissing his civil rights action. Nelson is an inmate of the Dauphin County Prison. He filed his complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against Kenneth A. Rapp, the Public Defender of Dauphin County. The District Court\u2019s memorandum sets forth the allegations of the complaint, so we revisit them in summary only. Nelson alleged that his constitutional rights were violated in relation to proceedings in two criminal matters in the Dauphin County Court of Common Pleas. More specifically, according to Nelson, he was arraigned via videoconference, his request for attorney representation was denied, and he was coerced into pleading guilty to the charges. Nelson alleged that he suffered mental anguish, for which he has undergone psychological treatment, as a result of the defendant\u2019s malpractice and incompetence. Further, he asserted that the defendant acted outside the scope of his duties by failing to appear in court, and that the defendant\u2019s unethical behavior violated his constitutional rights. As relief, Nelson sought $1 million in compensatory damages and the same amount in punitive damages, and he also sought the injunctive relief of halting the violation of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">Nelson was granted <em>in forma pauperis </em>status in District Court. The District Court dismissed the complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-15\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Upon consideration of the record, we will affirm. As noted by the District Court, a public defender does not act \u201cunder color of state law\u201d and is not liable under section 1983 when performing a lawyer\u2019s traditional functions as defense counsel. <em>Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981). Despite Nelson\u2019s assertion that the defendant was acting outside of the scope of his professional duties, the conduct alleged here falls within defense counsel\u2019s traditional functions. Thus, Nelson\u2019s allegations fail to state a claim under section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-16\">Accordingly, for essentially the same reasons as those set forth by the District Court in its memorandum, we will affirm. Nelson\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
