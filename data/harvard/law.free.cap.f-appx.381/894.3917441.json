On appeal, Harrison asserts that the defendants intentionally mailed him materials at an incorrect address.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-16\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of a case under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gratton v. Great Am. Commc\u2019ns, </em>178 F.3d 1373, 1374 (11th Cir.1999) (per curiam). We give \u201cgreat deference to a district court\u2019s interpretation of its local rules.\u201d <em>Clark v. Housing Auth. of City of Alma, </em>971 F.2d 723, 727 (11th Cir.1992) (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-17\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) authorizes a district court to dismiss a complaint for failure to comply with a court order. Under the Northern District of Georgia\u2019s local rules, the failure of a <em>pro se </em>party to keep the clerk\u2019s office informed of any address change which causes a delay or otherwise adversely affects the management of a civil case constitutes grounds for dismissal of the action without prejudice. N.D. Ga. R. 41.2(C); N.D. Ga. R. 83.1(D)(3); <em>see </em>Doc. 42-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-18\">A review of the record indicates that the district court\u2019s order expressly instructed Harrison to keep the court advised of his current address. Doc. 4. However, Harrison did not update his address despite the notices and discovery sent to his undeliverable address in November 2008. <em>See </em>Docs. 19 and 23, Exh. B. In February 2009, Harrison responded to a motion to dismiss, but he continued to fail to comply with the local rules and the district court\u2019s order. Moreover, Harrison offers no persuasive argument challenging the district court\u2019s determination that his noncompliance resulted in a substantial delay in the proceedings. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Harrison\u2019s amended complaint without prejudice, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
