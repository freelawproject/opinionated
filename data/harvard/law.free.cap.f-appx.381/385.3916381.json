By moving to proceed IFP, Polk is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-27\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a Section 3582(c)(2) motion <em>de novo. United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). Because Polk\u2019s guidelines imprisonment range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense but rather from his career offender status, the district court was correct in concluding that a sentencing reduction was not permitted. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 (5th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-30\">Polk has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>1983). His motion for IFP is denied and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cm.
