He now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of a two-level minor role adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 and a safety-valve adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. He further argues that the district court committed procedural error by failing to give adequate reasons for the sentence imposed and that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"ARU\">We review the district court\u2019s finding that Davila was not a minor participant for clear error. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203-04 <em>&amp; </em>n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). The record reflects that Davila transported a large amount of cocaine and agreed to drive the load through a government checkpoint. Given these facts, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s conclusion that Davila was not a minor participant was implausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See id. </em>at 203; <em>see United States v. Jenkins, </em>487 F.3d 279, 282 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"Amo\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s finding that Davila was not entitled to a \u00a7 5C1.2 safety valve adjustment because he did not truthfully debrief. <em>See Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203 n. 9; <em>United States v. Miller, </em>179 F.3d 961, 963-64 (5th Cir.1999). Contrary to Davila\u2019s argument, the district comb\u2019s conclusion was not based on unsubstantiated assertions. Rather, the district court heard directly from Davila and concluded that his story was not plausible. The district court\u2019s credibility determination, which is entitled to great deference, was not clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Powers, </em>168 F.3d 741, 753 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"ATp\">We review for plain error Davila\u2019s claim that the district court provided inadequate reasons for the sentence imposed. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). The district court gave specific reasons for the within-guidelines sentence imposed, referencing the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court\u2019s reasons reflect consideration of appropriate factors, such as the nature and circumstances of the instant offense, Davi-la\u2019s history, the need for adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, and the need to protect the public. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(B)-(C). Davila has failed to show any error, much less clear or obvious error, regarding the adequacy of the district court\u2019s reasons. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 361-64.</p>\n<p id=\"A-D\">We review for plain error Davi-la\u2019s claim that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court accepted the unsubstantiated assertions of the Government in determining the applicability of the safety valve provision. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). First, Davila had the burden of proving the facts necessary to support the safety valve adjustment; however, he failed to carry his burden. <em>See United States v. Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d 143, 146-47 (5th Cir.1996). Second, on appellate review, \u201c[a] discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). Davila has failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>rebut this presumption. He has thus shown no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
