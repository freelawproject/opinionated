Baker, federal prisoner # 16137-064, is serving a 235-month sentence for possession of ammunition by a felon. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>508 F.3d 1321, 1330 (10th Cir. 2007). Baker filed a petition for habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, arguing that the presentence report incorrectly recommended an enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act since his civil liberties as to his 1997 burglary conviction had been restored under Kansas law. The district court determined that Baker could not proceed under \u00a7 2241 because his claim did not satisfy the requirements of the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) and dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-18\">Section 2255 provides the main vehicle to raise a collateral challenge to a federal sentence. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). Section 2255 relief is the remedy for \u201cerrors that occurred at or prior to sentencing.\u201d <em>Cox v. Warden, Fed. Detention Ctr., </em>911 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir.1990) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In contrast, \u00a7 2241 is used to raise a challenge to \u201cthe manner in which a sentence is executed.\u201d <em>Tolliver, </em>211 F.3d at 877. A petition filed under \u00a7 2241 that raises errors \u201cthat occurr[ed] at trial or sentencing is properly construed [as arising] under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 877-78. Baker is challenging the factual correctness of his sentence enhancement. As such, Baker\u2019s claim arose at the latest during his sentencing and must be presented under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Cox, </em>911 F.2d at 1113; <em>see also Warren v. Miles, </em>230 F.3d 688, 694 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-19\">If a prisoner can demonstrate that the \u00a7 2255 remedy would be \u201c \u2018inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [the prisoner\u2019s] detention,\u2019 \u201d he may be permitted to bring a habeas corpus claim pursuant to \u00a7 2241 under the \u201csavings clause.\u201d <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting \u00a7 2255). \u201c[T]he savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies to a claim (i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 904. Baker has not shown that he is entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241 based on the savings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>clause of \u00a7 2255(e). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b342-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
