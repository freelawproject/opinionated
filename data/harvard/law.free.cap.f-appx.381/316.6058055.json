On appeal, he argues that the district court committed procedural error by failing to address his arguments for a lesser sentence and that the sentence imposed was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">\u201c[W]hen a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The requirement that the district court explain its sentence may be satisfied if the district court listens to arguments and then indicates that a sentence within the guidelines range is appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 357-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456. Here, the district court heard counsel\u2019s argument for a lesser sentence, specifically rejected those arguments, and stated that a sentence within the applicable guidelines range satisfied the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525-26 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 616 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">Zavala-Rosales suggests that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because, in calculating his sentencing range, a single prior robbery conviction resulted in both a 16-level enhancement and all five of his criminal history points. However, the Guidelines provide for consideration of a prior conviction for both criminal history and the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n.6). We have rejected the argument that such \u201cdouble-counting\u201d renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-17\">\u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). The fact that this court \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. We conclude there is \u201cno reason to disturb\u201d the presumption of reasonableness in this case. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b341-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
