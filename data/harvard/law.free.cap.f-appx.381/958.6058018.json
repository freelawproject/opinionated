In his initial application, Lin only mentioned his wife\u2019s forced abortion and sterilization and the fine they received. Lin seems to contend that the agency erred because its adverse credibility finding was based only on his initial asylum application which differed significantly from his amended asylum application. Lin argues that the agency failed to cite to any specific discrepancies or implausibilities as to why his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>amended claim should be disbelieved, other than that his original application and documents in support failed to mention his detention, his beating, his required attendance at a \u201cbirth control study session,\u201d and his potential arrest. Lin argues that he left out events from his original application because the person who helped him prepare the application told him not to include his own persecutory experiences because his wife\u2019s forced abortion was more serious. Next, Lin argues that his amended submissions were timely because: (1) his additional submissions were not made on the eve of his removal hearing; and (2) he was without help of counsel during most of the proceedings. Finally, Lin argues that a reasonable factfinder would find that he had a reasonable fear of future persecution, and it was more likely than not that he would be persecuted or tortured if he returned to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA]\u2019s decision, except to the extent that [the BIA] expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion\u201d or reasoning. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, because the BIA issued its own opinion and did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s opinion or reasoning, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. \u201cWe lack jurisdiction to consider a claim raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies\u201d with respect to that claim. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1)). In addition, when an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, or includes only a passing reference to an issue, such an issue will be deemed abandoned. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">We review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006). Under the substantial evidence test, we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (internal quotation marks omitted). The BIA\u2019s credibility determinations \u201ccan be reversed only if the evidence \u2018compels\u2019 a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1230-31 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">\u201cTo be eligible for asylum, the applicant bears the burden of proving statutory refugee status.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1231; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). \u201cThat is, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; or (2) a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a statutorily-protected ground.\u201d <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. When a petitioner is unable to meet the standard of proof for asylum, he is generally precluded from qualifying for withholding of removal or for relief under the CAT. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93,1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">The BIA must make a \u201cclean\u201d determination of credibility. <em>See Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir. 2005) (discussing IJ\u2019s credibility determination). \u201cThe [BIA] must also offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the [BIA\u2019s] credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">If credible, an alien\u2019s testimony may be sufficient, without corroboration, to sustain his burden of proof in establishing his eligibility for relief from removal. <em>Id. </em>\u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>port the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Regardless, \u201can adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the ... duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant.\u201d <em>For-gue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. \u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Based on our review of the record, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Because the remaining evidence in the record does not compel a reversal of the BIA\u2019s decision, the BIA properly affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Furthermore, Lin has abandoned his challenge to the BIA\u2019s finding that the IJ did not ignore any of the evidence submitted with the amended application. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2. Finally, because Lin has not exhausted his claim that the IJ legally erred in allegedly finding that any alien who amends his application after a change in the law must necessarily be lying, we lack jurisdiction to consider the claim. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250. Accordingly, we deny the petition in part and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">PETITION DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-10\">. In <em>Matter of J-S, </em>the Attorney General overruled the BIA\u2019s prior holding that the spouse of a person who has been physically subjected to a forced abortion or sterilization procedure is per se entitled to refugee status.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
