Velasquez-Santos argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-22\">The presentence investigation report increased Velasquez-Santos\u2019s base offense level by 16 points because he previously had been deported after his conviction for a violent felony. United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (Nov.2008). The report provided a guideline range of 37 to 46 months of imprisonment. The report stated that Velasquez-Santos had been convicted in a Florida court in 1999 of attempted second-degree murder and sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment, but that sentence had been suspended for Velasquez-Santos to serve 90 days in jail and eight years of probation. Over the next six years, Velasquez-Santos was convicted of trespass, disorderly conduct, and driving under the influence, and he was deported in 2004 after a Florida court revoked his probation for driving with a suspended license.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-23\">The presentence report also described Velasquez-Santos\u2019s earlier convictions and arrests. Between 1989 and 1996, Velas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>quez-Santos had been convicted of four counts of battery, three counts of resisting an officer, two counts of disorderly intoxication, assault, and improper exhibition of a dangerous weapon, and he received suspended sentences, probation, and counseling. Between 1981 and 1985, Velasquez-Santos had been arrested for ten offenses: three instances of aggravated assault, maiming \u201cwith intent,\u201d aggravated battery with a firearm, battery, domestic assault, possession of marijuana, driving under the influence, and drunkenness.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\">Velasquez-Santos objected to a 16-point enhancement of his base offense level. Velasquez-Santos argued that application of the enhancement would yield a sentence greater than necessary. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Velasquez-Santos argued that his 1999 conviction was stale and the enhancement was disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court commented that Velasquez-Santos had received a \u201cvery light sentence\u201d for the \u201cserious crime\u201d of attempted murder. The district court stated that Velasquez-Santos had a \u201csubstantial criminal history,\u201d and the court recited his prior convictions. The district court remarked that, because Velasquez-Santos\u2019s \u201ccriminal history\u201d was \u201cawful,\u201d it was \u201chard ... to say that he doesn\u2019t deserve a sentence within the guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Velasquez-Santos\u2019s daughter testified, and the district court stated that it was \u201caffected\u201d by her testimony and acknowledged that the sentence would be \u201chardest on the family.\u201d The district court concluded that Velasquez-Santos \u201cknew he could not come back into the United States\u201d and he had \u201cto be [held] responsible for his own actions.\u201d The district court, \u201chaving considered the advisory guidelines\u201d and the sentencing factors, sentenced Velasquez-Santos to 42 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">Velasquez-Santos argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable, but we disagree. The district court considered the sentencing factors, Velasquez-Santos\u2019s arguments, and imposed a sentence within the guideline range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), (c); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The district court reasonably determined that a sentence of 42 months of imprisonment would address Velasquez-Santos\u2019s \u201csubstantial criminal history,\u201d punish him for his willful reentry into the United States, and deter similar future conduct. The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
