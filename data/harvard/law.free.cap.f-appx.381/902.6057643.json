Gjoka contends that the Board erred in finding that he failed to establish past persecution and that, even if he had, evidence in the record rebutted a well-founded fear of future persecution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-24\">\u201cWhen the BIA issues a decision, we review the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that the BIA has expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Niftaliev v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1211, 1215 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo the extent that the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Mehmeti v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1199 (11th Cir.2009). Because the Board adopted the Immigration Judge\u2019s reasoning, we will review both decisions. \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>sions of law by the Board and Immigration Judge, but we review findings of fact for substantial evidence to support them.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350-51 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">\u201cOur review for substantial evidence is highly deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1351. We view the evidence in the record \u201cin the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We may not \u201creweigh the evidence from scratch\u201d and must affirm the agency\u2019s decision if \u201cit is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). \u201cUnder this highly deferential standard of review, the [agency\u2019s] decision can be reversed only if the evidence compels a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1289-90 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">The Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum to any alien determined to be a \u201crefugee,\u201d as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A refugee is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyT\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). \u201cThe burden of proof is on the applicant to establish that [he] is a refugee.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1351 (internal quotation marks omitted). An applicant establishes asylum based on past persecution by proving \u201c(1) that [he] was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006). An applicant who establishes past persecution is presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1351. \u201cThat presumption may be rebutted if an asylum officer or immigration judge makes either of two findings: (1) that \u2018[t]here has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution\u2019; or (2) \u2018[t]he applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality ... and under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1351-52 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(A) &amp; (B)). The government has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, either changed circumstances or the ability to avoid persecution by relocating. <em>See id. </em>at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">An alien is entitled to withholding of removal if he can demonstrate that it is more likely than not that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in [the proposed country of removal] because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b). \u201cWhere an applicant is unable to meet the \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 standard of asylum, he is generally precluded from qualifying for either asylum or withholding of [removal].\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1352 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">Gjoka contends that the Board erred in concluding that he failed to demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>past persecution based on his membership in the Democratic Party. We do not need to decide that issue because the record supports the Board\u2019s determination that changed country conditions negate any presumption that Gjoka had a well-founded fear of future persecution. The 2006 Country Report indicated that the Democratic Party took control of Parliament in 2005 and that Albania\u2019s Prime Minister is a member of that party. The report also stated that \u201cthere were no reports of politically motivated disappearances\u201d and \u201cno reports that the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings.\u201d The 2006 Country Profile indicated that \u201cthere have been no outbreaks of political violence [in Albania] since 1998, and the available evidence suggests that neither the Government nor the major political parties engage in policies of abuse or coercion against them political opponents.\u201d Although Grjoka contends otherwise, the Immigration Judge\u2019s reliance on those reports was proper. <em>See Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1175 (11th Cir. 2008) (noting that the BIA may rely heavily on country reports because the State Department is the most appropriate resource on foreign nations\u2019 political conditions); <em>see also Mehmeti, </em>572 F.3d at 1200 (concluding that substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s determination that changed country conditions in Albania negated the presumption that the applicant had a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his membership in the Democratic Party). Because Gjoka cannot meet the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum, he also cannot satisfy the standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1352. Accordingly, we deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-16\">. Gjoka did not challenge the denial of his request for CAT relief before the BIA and does not challenge it before us. That claim is abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that an appellant\u2019s failure to offer argument on an issue constitutes abandonment of that issue).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
