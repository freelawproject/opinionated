Smith claims that a sidetrack CSX placed and operates near his home constitutes a nuisance under Georgia law. CSX moved for summary judgment. The district court granted CSX\u2019s motion, holding that Smith\u2019s state-law nuisance claim is preempted by the plain language of the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101 <em>et seq. </em>(R.3-50 at 5.) Smith appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-23\">Smith contends that the Act should be interpreted to only preempt state law claims demanding remedies affecting the core operations of railroads that are identified in the Act. He concedes that a plaintiffs claim is preempted when the plaintiff seeks a remedy that changes a railroad\u2019s core operation. But, Smith contends that when a plaintiff seeks a remedy demanding an insubstantial change to incidental operations, the claim is not preempted. CSX responds that under the plain language of the Act, state law remedies directed at sidetracks are preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-24\">The Act created the Surface Transportation Board. The Act provides that the Board\u2019s jurisdiction over</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afq\">the construction, acquisition, operation, abandonment, or discontinuance of spur, industrial, team, switching, or side <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>tracks ... is exclusive. Except as otherwise provided under this part, the remedies provided under this part with respect to regulation of rail transportation are exclusive and preempt the remedies provided under Federal or State law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">\u00a7 10501(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Congressional intent \u201cprimarily is discerned from the language of the preemption statute and the \u2018statutory framework\u2019 surrounding it.\u201d <em>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, </em>518 U.S. 470, 486, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 2250-51, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996) (citation omitted). Although courts begin the preemption analysis \u201cwith the assumption that the historic police powers of the States are not to be superseded,\u201d the presumption against preemption dissipates when the intention of Congress is \u201cclear and manifest.\u201d <em>Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>552 U.S. 312, 334, 128 S.Ct. 999, 1013, 169 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008) (quotations and citation omitted). Here, Congress\u2019s intent is clear that any state law involving where to construct or how to operate a sidetrack is preempted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons stated by the district court (R.3-50 at 3-5), we hold that the text of the Act expressly preempts Smith\u2019s state-law nuisance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b910-8\">. This court has considered the Act\u2019s preemption before in <em>Fla. E. Coast Ry. Co. v. City of West Palm Beach, </em>266 F.3d 1324 (11th Cir. 2001). Smith's reliance on that case is misplaced, as it involved a municipal ordinance not directed to railroad operations. Instead, the ordinance was directed at a private distribution business operating on leased railroad property.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
