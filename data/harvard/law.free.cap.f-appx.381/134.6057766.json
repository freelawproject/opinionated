We will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-17\">After a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, Hatches was found guilty of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), among other charges. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the judgment of conviction, and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. Hatches subsequently filed a motion in the trial court attacking his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which was denied. Hatches did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-18\">In February 2009, Hatches filed a petition for relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, the judicial district where he is confined.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His petition asserted that he was actually innocent of the \u00a7 924(c) charge, because his conviction rests on an improper definition of \u201cuse\u201d under <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137,150-51, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), and that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 was \u201cinadequate and ineffective.\u201d <em>See e.g., In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997) (allowing prisoner who had previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to bring claim via \u00a7 2241 where there had been an intervening change in substantive law that the petitioner had no prior opportunity to challenge). The District Court found that Hatches\u2019 circumstances did not warrant application of the <em>Dorsainvil </em>exception, and recharacterized the petition as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>\u00a7 2255 motion. The District Court further determined that it lacked jurisdiction because the motion was \u201csecond or successive\u201d and Hatches had not obtained authorization from the appropriate Court of Appeals to file it, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). Concluding that it would not be \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d to transfer the action to the Fourth Circuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, the District Court dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Hatches filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to Local Civil Rule 7.1(1), in which he argued that the District Court erred in recharacterizing his petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion without providing him with a prophylactic warning as required by <em>United States v. Miller, </em>197 F.3d 644, 646 (3d Cir.1999). He also argued that the District Court inappropriately addressed the substantive issues contained in his petition over which it lacked jurisdiction. The District Court denied the motion. Hatches timely filed this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a). We exercise plenary review over a district court\u2019s legal conclusions, and we apply a clearly erroneous standard to its factual findings. <em>Cristin v. Brennan, </em>281 F.3d 404, 409 (3d Cir.2002). We may take summary action if the appeal presents no substantial question. <em>See </em>Third Circuit L.A.R. 24.7; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Following the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), we have held that upon receipt of a pro se pleading challenging a conviction, \u201cwhether styled as a \u00a7 2255 motion or not,\u201d the district court should not recharacterize that motion as a habeas petition unless it first warns the petitioner of the consequences under AEDPA, including the bar on successive petitions, and gives the petitioner a chance to oppose the recharacterization or to withdraw or amend the motion. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>197 F.3d 644, 652 (3d Cir.1999). However, these so-called <em>Miller </em>warnings are required only \u201cwhen a court recharacterizes a pro se litigant\u2019s motion as <em>a first </em>\u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003) (emphasis added). A district court is not required to provide <em>Miller </em>warnings in cases where doing so would be an \u201cexercise in futility.\u201d <em>United States v. Chew, </em>284 F.3d 468, 471 (3d Cir.2002) (holding that no <em>Miller </em>warning was required where the statute of limitations already barred petitioner from filing a \u00a7 2255 motion at the time of the recharacterization). Hatches argues that the District Court erred in failing to issue a <em>Miller </em>warning before recharacterizing his \u00a7 2241 petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion. However, this petition was not Hatches\u2019 first. Because Hatches had previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion in the Western District of Virginia, the issuance of <em>Miller </em>notice in this case would have served no meaningful purpose. Thus, we find no error in the District Court\u2019s failure to invoke Miller,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">Hatches also contends that the District Court impermissibly reached the merits of his claims. When a second or successive habeas petition is filed in a district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>court without the permission of the Court of Appeals, the District Court\u2019s only option is to dismiss the petition or transfer it to the appropriate Court of Appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. <em>See Robinson v. Johnson, </em>313 F.3d 128, 139 (3d Cir.2002). In deciding that it would not be in the interest of justice to transfer the petition to the Fourth Circuit, the District Court properly considered whether Hatches had alleged facts sufficient to bring his petition \u2022within the gatekeeping requirement of \u00a7 2255 permitting \u201csecond or successive\u201d petitions based upon newly discovered evidence or a new rule of constitutional law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). However, this inquiry as to the factual premise of Hatches\u2019 claims did not require \u2014 and the District Court did not express \u2014 any opinion on the merits of the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Because this appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm. <em>See </em>Third Circuit L.A.R. 24.7; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-14\">. Hatches is currently serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fair-ton, New Jersey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-9\">. Hatches filed his original notice of appeal on November 19, 2009, prior to the District Court\u2019s ruling on his motion for reconsideration. Following the District Court\u2019s ruling, Hatches filed an amended notice of appeal from the denial of the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-12\">. Furthermore, for the reasons given by the District Court, we agree that Hatches\u2019 claim does not meet the standard set forth in <em>In re Dorsainvil </em>allowing a prisoner to proceed under \u00a7 2241 rather than \u00a7 2255.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
