However, in his written plea agreement, Flores waived his right to appeal his sentence on any ground, except for ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-25\">Flores does not assert that his appeal waiver is invalid or unenforceable. The record of the rearraignment hearing indicates that Flores read and understood his plea agreement and that he raised no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>question regarding the appeal waiver. Therefore, his waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.2005). Flores\u2019s challenges to his sentence do not fall within the exceptions to the appeal waiver. <em>See id. </em>at 746-47. Therefore, the appeal waiver bars the instant appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Flores\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED. However, this case is REMANDED pursuant to Fed.R. Crim.P. 36 for the limited purpose of correcting a clerical error in the judgment to reflect that Flores was convicted and sentenced under \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(1) rather than \u00a7 1326(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-15\">. Robert R. Sykes, counsel for Flores, did not address the appeal waiver or respond to the Government\u2019s argument regarding the appeal waiver. We caution counsel that pursuing a basis for appeal that is waived by a valid appeal waiver and failing to address the waiver in a reply brief after it is raised by the Government may result in sanctions. <em>See United States v. Gaitan, </em>171 F.3d 222, 223-24 (5th Cir. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
