California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Villareal\u2019s response to counsel\u2019s motion was untimely; thus, we need not consider it. In any event, Villa-real raises only claims concerning counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance in connection with the plea and sentence, but the record is insufficiently developed for this court to consider that claim. <em>See United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir. 2006). Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
