He argues that the factual basis for his plea did not establish that he knowingly imported a particular quantity of a particular drug into the United States, so his plea should be vacated. He correctly concedes, however, that that argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>586 F.3d 303 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1920, 176 L.Ed.2d 390 (2010) (No. 09-9048); he raises the argument solely to preserve its further review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-25\">Ramirez-Leonardo additionally contends that the district court clearly erred in denying him a minor-role adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Ramirez-Leonardo\u2019s reliance on his alleged courier status, alone, is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Larraga, </em>517 F.3d 258, 272 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>487 F.3d 279, 282 (5th Cir.2007). The unrebutted facts established that Ramirez-Leonardo imported a large amount of heroin into the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>States from the Dominican Republic; traveled a long distance with the heroin in hidden compartments in the soles of multiple pairs of his shoes; was to be paid a large sum of money for his role in the criminal activity; and was solely responsible for transporting the heroin to its final destination of New York. Based on the foregoing, it cannot be said that Ramirez-Leonardo was \u201cperipheral to the advancement of the criminal activity\u201d and thus a minor participant. <em>See Martinez-Larraga, </em>517 F.Sd at 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
