The district court initially sentenced Council to a 420-month term of imprisonment, but this court remanded for resentencing in the light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). At resentencing, the district court imposed a 137-month term of imprisonment, representing a significant downward variance from the sentencing guidelines range of 360 months to life imprisonment set forth in the presentence report, which the district court adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-16\">Council filed a motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on Amendment 706 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). In denying the motion, the district court noted that Council was \u201cfound to be a career offender, which resulted in a guideline range of 360 months to life,\u201d and that although Council\u2019s \u201cbase offense level was reduced, his total offense level and guideline range remain the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-17\">The court has the discretion to reduce a sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2). That is, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the defendant\u2019s sentencing range is actually lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). The crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to defendants sentenced as a career offenders because they were not sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Council argues that he was not sentenced as a career offender at resentenc-ing and was, therefore, eligible for a reduced sentence under \u00a7 3582(c). Although the district court imposed a downward variance, the record reflects that Council\u2019s guidelines sentencing range was derived from his career offender status and not from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense. Accordingly, he was not sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He is ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>See Anderson, </em>591 F.3d at 791. The district court did not err or otherwise abuse its discretion in denying Council\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction. <em>See Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">To the extent Council argues that the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 is not mandatory, this argument is foreclosed. <em>See id. </em>at 238. Because the district court simply denied the motion and did not consider any sentence reduction, we do not address Council\u2019s arguments that the district court erred in not considering the full panoply of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining his new, reduced sentence in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
