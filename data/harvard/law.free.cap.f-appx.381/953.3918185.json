After review, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AWcm\">A. Removal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b978-12\">In 2003, Xu entered the United States on a nonimmigrant student visa to attend the University of North Carolina in Charlotte (\u201cUNCC\u201d). In January 2005, UNCC suspended Xu for failing to comply with academic requirements. As a result, Xu\u2019s student visa was terminated. In November 2006, based on the visa termination, the Department of Homeland Security charged Xu with removability for failing \u201cto maintain or comply with the conditions of the nonimmigrant status under which [he was] admitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b978-14\">In April 2007, Xu <em>pro se </em>filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) in which he claimed he feared persecution in China because, in part, he is a baptized Christian and practices qigong, a breathing exercise that Chinese authorities would perceive as Falun Gong. Xu\u2019s hearing was originally scheduled for July 30, 2007. After both Xu and the government sought a continuance, the hearing was postponed until November 30, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-15\">Prior to his hearing, on November 27, 2007, Xu filed two \u201cemergency\u201d motions for a continuance. The first motion asserted that (1) UNCC\u2019s academic suspension was due to discrimination, (2) Xu had an appeal of the suspension pending with the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights (\u201cOCR\u201d) and (3) Xu wished to continue his removal hearing until he received a final opinion from the OCR. The second continuance motion explained that Xu was arrested on November 23, 2007 for second degree trespass and resisting a public officer. Xu asked to postpone the removal hearing so he would not \u201crisk the loss of [his] constitutional right to a trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b978-16\">At Xu\u2019s November 30, 2007 removal hearing, the IJ denied Xu\u2019s continuance motions. After Xu testified, the IJ denied relief. The IJ denied Xu\u2019s asylum claim as time-barred and, alternatively, on the merits. The IJ found that Xu was not credible as to his religious activities in the United States and failed to show a clear probability that he would be persecuted in China. The IJ granted Xu voluntary departure before December 31, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>B. \u201cMotion for Reconsideration\u201d Construed as a Motion to Reopen</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">On December 27, 2007, Xu filed a motion styled \u201cMotion for Reconsideration,\u201d in which Xu: (1) withdrew his asylum application, but requested withholding of removal based on his religion and Falun Gong practice; (2) stated that he was baptized at Northside Baptist Church on February 8, 2004 and regularly attended \u201chouse churches\u201d; (8) argued that because his criminal case had been continued until January 3, 2008, the IJ\u2019s voluntary departure date of December 31, 2007 violated his constitutional right to a trial; and (4) asked for voluntary departure should his application be denied. Xu attached exhibits, including (1) what appear to be pictures of Xu\u2019s baptism; (2) a letter from World Bible School dated August 8, 2007, stating Xu studied the Bible by mail; (8) excerpts of the 2007 China Religious Freedom Report and the 2007 China Country of Origin Information Report with portions relevant to \u201chouse churches\u201d underlined; (4) the 2007 China Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions Report with information pertaining to Falun Gong underlined; and (5) a document showing that Xu\u2019s criminal case was continued until January 3, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">The IJ construed Xu\u2019s \u201cmotion for reconsideration\u201d as a motion to reopen. The IJ denied the motion because Xu failed to show that the evidence was previously unavailable or could not have been presented at the hearing. The IJ also concluded that Xu had not shown a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits to warrant reopening removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">C. BIA Appeal and Motions to Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Xu <em>pro se </em>appealed to the BIA, challenging the IJ\u2019s denial of his motions for a continuance. Xu argued that the denial of his continuance requests violated his rights to a trial and due process. In addition, Xu advised the BIA that his criminal case was continued until February 14, 2008 and attached a copy of the notice of his new court date.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">While his BIA appeal was pending, Xu filed three motions to remand with the BIA. The first remand motion, filed February 25, 2008, advised the BIA that Xu\u2019s OCR appeal was still pending and attached an email exchange with an OCR representative. The second remand motion, filed June 12, 2008, advised the BIA that (1) Xu\u2019s OCR appeal was still pending and that he would not receive a final opinion for at least 150 days; and (2) on January 27, 2008, Xu filed an action against UNCC in North Carolina state court asserting state law claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Xu attached copies of pleadings in the state court action. The third remand motion advised the BIA that on August 29, 2008 Xu had filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action against UNCC in federal district court. Xu attached copies of some of the district court pleadings. All three remand motions argued that the outcome of Xu\u2019s removal proceedings would change if he succeeded in overturning UNCC\u2019s academic suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">On February 27, 2009, the BIA denied Xu\u2019s appeal. The BIA concluded that Xu\u2019s appeal was untimely as to the IJ\u2019s November 30, 2007 removal order, but was timely as to the IJ\u2019s ruling on the \u201cmotion for reconsideration.\u201d The BIA found, <em>inter alia, </em>that Xu\u2019s <em>pro se </em>\u201cmotion for reconsideration\u201d was \u201cin the nature of a motion to reopen.\u201d The BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s refusal to reopen the removal proceedings because Xu had not presented any new or previously unavailable evidence that would warrant reopening Xu\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>The BIA denied Xu\u2019s three motions to remand, concluding that Xu\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d evidence of his ongoing litigation relating to his UNCC suspension merely supported arguments already made to and rejected by the IJ. As for Xu\u2019s motions for a continuance, the BIA agreed with the IJ that Xu had not shown good cause. The BIA noted that there had been an adverse ruling in Xu\u2019s state court action and no resolution of Xu\u2019s federal court action. Given that the IJ \u201cwas not prepared to continue [Xu\u2019s] case indefinitely\u201d and \u201cthe speculative and collateral nature of\u2019 the UNCC litigation, the BIA concluded that the IJ had not erred in denying Xu\u2019s requests for a continuance. The BIA declined to address Xu\u2019s constitutional claims, stating that it had \u201cno jurisdiction over the constitutionality of the statutes and regulations we administer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">E. Motions to Reconsider and to Reopen Before the BIA</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">On March 30, 2009, Xu filed a motion to reconsider with the BIA in which Xu argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the BIA had erred in treating his December 27, 2007 \u201cmotion for reconsideration\u201d as a motion to reopen and had violated his constitutional right to a criminal trial by refusing to continue his removal proceedings. On May 27, 2009, Xu filed a motion to reopen with the BIA and attached a new state court complaint filed against UNCC in March 2009.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Xu reasserted his argument that if he prevailed against UNCC, UNCC would have to reinstate him as a student and he would not be removable.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">In an August 13, -2009 order, the BIA denied both motions. The BIA concluded it had properly treated Xu\u2019s December 27, 2009 \u201cmotion for reconsideration\u201d as a motion to reopen. As to the denial of Xu\u2019s request for a continuance, the BIA concluded that Xu\u2019s constitutional claim was moot because it was apparent Xu was able to attend the January 3, 2008 criminal hearing. Alternatively, the BIA concluded that Xu\u2019s arguments lacked merit because Xu\u2019s pending criminal charges and UNCC civil litigation did not provide proper bases for giving Xu additional time to remain in the United States. Xu petitioned this Court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AnJ\">A. Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">On September 8, 2009, Xu filed a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s August 13, 2009 order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, Xu\u2019s appeal brief mainly challenges rulings in the BIA\u2019s February 27, 2009 decision, including the BIA\u2019s (1) denial of Xu\u2019s three motions to remand; (2) affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of Xu\u2019s two motions for a continuance; and (3) affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of Xu\u2019s \u201cmotion for reconsideration\u201d construed as a motion to reopen.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s February 27, 2009 decision because the September 8, 2009 petition for review was not filed within thirty days of the entry of that order. <em>See </em>Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (providing that an alien seeking review of a final order of the BIA must file a petition for review within thirty days of the issuance of the final order); <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that the period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>for filing a petition for review \u201cis mandatory and jurisdictional, [and] not subject to equitable tolling\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). A motion for reconsideration filed with the BIA does not toll the time for filing a petition for review. <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Jaggemauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1350-51 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Xu\u2019s petition is dismissed to the extent Xu challenges any rulings in the BIA\u2019s February 27, 2009 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">The petition for review is timely as to the BIA\u2019s August 13, 2009 order denying Xu\u2019s motion to reconsider and motion to reopen. Therefore, we address only these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">B. Motion to Reconsider</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">An alien may file a motion to reconsider before the BIA within thirty days of the entry of a removal order. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). \u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C). A motion to reconsider that merely restates the arguments the BIA previously rejected provides no basis for the BIA to change its prior decision. <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir. 2007). \u201cTherefore, merely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA does not constitute \u2018specifying ... errors of fact or law' as required for a successful motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1)) (alteration in original).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Xu\u2019s motion to reconsider. Xu\u2019s motion argued that the BIA erred in treating his December 27, 2007 \u201cmotion for reconsideration\u201d (filed with the IJ) as a motion to reopen. As the BIA pointed out, although Xu\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion was styled a \u201cmotion for reconsideration,\u201d its contents did not identify any \u201cerrors of law or fact.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C) (requiring a motion to reconsider to specify \u201cerrors of law or fact\u201d in the IJ\u2019s prior decision); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(2) (same). Instead, the motion asked the IJ to decide Xu\u2019s withholding of removal claim anew based on documentary evidence he did not submit at his removal hearing. Xu also asked for voluntary departure based on the new fact that his criminal hearing had been postponed until January 3, 2008, which he supported with documentary evidence. Thus, Xu\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion was in substance a motion to reopen his removal proceedings based on new evidence. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(B) (providing that a motion to reopen removal proceedings states \u201cnew facts that will be proven\u201d and is \u201csupported by affidavits or other eviden-tiary material\u201d); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3) (same). Denying the motion to reconsider on this ground was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">Xu\u2019s motion to reconsider also re-argued: (1) that the IJ\u2019s denial of his motions to continue his removal proceedings violated his rights to a criminal trial and due process; and (2) that his case should be remanded because his UNCC litigation was ongoing and if he won that litigation, he would not be subject to removability. The BIA had already considered and rejected these arguments in its February 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>2009 decision. Because Xu claimed the BIA had \u201coverlooked\u201d his constitutional claims, the BIA reiterated that those claims did not provide basis for continuing, reopening or remanding Xu\u2019s case. Given that Xu\u2019s motion to reconsider did not identify any errors of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s February 27, 2009 decision, and merely repeated arguments Xu had made unsuccessfully in his earlier motions, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">C. Motion to Reopen</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">A motion to reopen may be granted if the alien presents to the BIA new evidence that is material and could not have been discovered or presented at the removal hearing. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). An alien moving to reopen bears a \u201cheavy burden\u201d and must show that the \u201cnew evidence offered would likely change the result in the case.\u201d <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 813 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">Xu argues that his second state court complaint against UNCC attached to his motion to reopen constituted new evidence that he could not have presented at his removal hearing. However, the BIA did not deny Xu\u2019s motion to reopen because his evidence was not \u201cnew,\u201d but because the new evidence did not warrant reopening, that is, that Xu\u2019s new evidence, would not likely change the result of Xu\u2019s removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">When the BIA issued its February 27, 2009 decision affirming the IJ\u2019s final removal order, the BIA noted that Xu\u2019s state court litigation against UNCC had been dismissed. Although Xu\u2019s federal court action remained pending, the BIA concluded that whether Xu would prevail in that action was speculative and thus did not warrant reopening or remanding his removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-14\">Xu\u2019s motion to reopen advised the BIA that he had begun a new state court action against UNCC. Given that Xu\u2019s ability to prevail in this new state court action was also speculative, the fact that he had filed such an action would not change the result of the BIA\u2019s decision. As the BIA explained, what Xu needed to submit was evidence that he maintained lawful non-immigrant status, something his new state court complaint against UNCC did not show. Because Xu failed to show that, if proceedings were reopened, the result would be different, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-15\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b979-9\">. Xu stated that the UNCC defendants had failed to answer his state court complaint and that he had filed a motion for a default judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b980-7\">.Xu argued that this new action against UNCC was not barred by res judicata, had not been dismissed and was likely to succeed because the defendants had failed to file an answer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b980-12\">. The only decision listed in Xu's petition for review is the BIA's August 13, 2009 order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b980-14\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>our own subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Avila v.
