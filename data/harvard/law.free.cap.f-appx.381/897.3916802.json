He argues that the district court erred by denying his motion for a psychiatric exam and that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. After a thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">In 2009, a federal grand jury indicted Mallory for knowingly possessing and receiving child pornography that had traveled in interstate commerce. Before trial, Mallory moved for a mental evaluation. After receiving reports on Mallory\u2019s mental health from probation officers, and questioning him directly, a magistrate judge denied Mallory\u2019s motion. Mallory did not file objections to this order in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-14\">At trial, Special Agent Thomas Witten\u2014 the government\u2019s only witness \u2014 testified that he found questionable content on Mallory\u2019s computer during an investigation of suspicious peer-to-peer computer networks. After executing a search warrant, Witten found child pornography on the hard drive of Mallory\u2019s computer. Although Witten admitted that there was no way to prove Mallory had viewed these images, he testified that Mallory was the only person with access to the files and that they had been downloaded between September 11, 2008 and October 14, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-15\">At the conclusion of the government\u2019s case, Mallory moved for a judgment of acquittal, which the district court denied. Mallory then testified on his own behalf, stating that he did not view all of the images on his computer and that he never knowingly viewed child pornography. On cross examination, Mallory explained that he did not believe images of 16-year-olds were child pornography and that a 14-year-old was not necessarily a child. Mallory conceded that his beliefs contradicted the law, but said that he had never acted on them or molested children. At the conclusion of his case, Mallory did not renew his motion for acquittal, and the jury convicted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-16\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b922-17\">On appeal, Mallory first argues that the district court erred by denying his motion for a mental evaluation because the magistrate judge\u2019s order was based on assessments from probation officers who were not licensed as doctors, psychiatrists, or psychologists.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-18\">\u201cThe law is settled that appellate courts are without jurisdiction to hear appeals directly from federal magistrates.\u201d <em>United States v. Renfro, </em>620 F.2d 497, 500 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Federal Rule of Criminal Pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>cedure 59(a), which became effective December 1, 2005, provides that, if the magistrate judge issues an order on a non-dispositive matter, a \u201cparty may serve and file objections to the order within 14 days after being served with a copy of a written order or after the oral order is stated on the record.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 59(a). Furthermore, \u201c[fjailure to object in accordance with this rule waives a party\u2019s right to review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Despite Rule 59(a)\u2019s waiver language, we have continued to hold that a failure to object to a magistrate judge\u2019s order deprives us of jurisdiction to review that issue. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>441 F.3d 1330, 1352 n. 9 (11th Cir.2006) (applying <em>Renfro </em>\u201cbecause the [new Rule 59(a) ] rule is in complete accord with our own circuit case law, which clearly prohibits us from considering Brown\u2019s argument on appeal\u201d). Because Mallory did not appeal the magistrate judge\u2019s order to the district court, we lack jurisdiction to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">Second, Mallory argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because the government failed to show that he knew the images and materials on his computer were child pornography or that he received this material over the internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">A defendant\u2019s failure to renew his motion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of evidence forecloses any appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence unless there has been a miscarriage of justice. <em>United States v. Bichsel, </em>156 F.3d 1148, 1150-51 (11th Cir.1998). Because Mallory did not renew his motion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of all evidence, we will affirm Mallory\u2019s convictions unless the evidence \u201con a key element of the offense is so tenuous that a conviction would be shocking.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>144 F.3d 1397, 1402 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">Subsections 2252A(a)(5)(B) and (a)(2)(A) make it illegal for any person to knowingly possess or receive any child pornography that has been transported or produced \u201cusing any means or facility ... in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer.\u201d The government presented evidence that Mallory had been using peer-to-peer networks to search for suspicious material over the internet and that child pornography had been downloaded onto his hard drive. Furthermore, the jury was entitled to discredit Mallory\u2019s testimony that he was not knowingly looking at child pornography and believe the opposite. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>53 F.3d 312, 314-15 (11th Cir.1995). Finally, Mallory bolstered the government\u2019s case when he testified that his definition of child pornography was in conflict with the law. Thus, Mallory\u2019s convictions were not \u201cshocking,\u201d <em>Williams, </em>144 F.3d at 1402, and are therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-12\">. In <em>Bonner v.
