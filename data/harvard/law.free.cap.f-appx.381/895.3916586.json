The district court ruled that an arbitration clause in Jones\u2019s contract with DirecTV was unenforceable because its waiver of the right to maintain a class action was unconscionable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-21\">In 2002, Jones subscribed for satellite television service from DirecTV. Jones\u2019s customer agreement stated that she could \u201ccancel [her] service\u201d if she disagreed with any term of the agreement and continued use of the service constituted acceptance of the agreement. In May 2007, Jones leased two DirecTV receivers from a Best Buy store in Georgia and signed an equipment lease addendum. The addendum incorporated a revised customer agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-22\">The revised agreement provided that any dispute between DirecTV and a customer would be \u201cresolved only by binding arbitration.\u201d The arbitration clause stated that the customer had to \u201cpay an arbitration initiation fee ... not to exceed $125\u201d and DirecTV would \u201cpay any additional fee or deposit required by JAMS to initiate ... arbitration.\u201d The clause also stated that DirecTV \u201cagree[d] to pay the costs of the arbitration proceeding,\u201d but \u201c[o]ther fees, such as attorney\u2019s fees and expenses of travel\u201d would \u201cbe paid in accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>with JAMS Rules.\u201d Those rules vest an arbitrator with discretion to \u201callocate\u201d attorney\u2019s fees and expenses \u201cif provided by the Parties\u2019 agreement or allowed by applicable law.\u201d JAMS Comprehensive Arb. R. 24(g) (available at http://www.jamsadr.com/ files /Uploads/Documents/JAMS-Rules/JAMS_comprehensive_ arbitra-tion_rules-2009.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 2, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). The agreement prohibited a customer from \u201carbitrating] any claim as a representative member of a class,\u201d but the agreement stated that, if that provision were unenforceable, the \u201centire\u201d arbitration clause would be \u201cunenforceable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">In November 2008, Jones sent DirecTV a letter complaining that she had been overcharged by $5.39 each month since she had leased the two receivers. Jones warned that unless DirecTV \u201csubmitted] a reasonable tender of settlement\u201d within 30 days, she would sue DirecTV for making \u201cmisrepresentations and breaches of contract ... in violation of the Georgia Fair Business Practices Act of 1975, O.C.G.A. \u00a7\u00a7 10-1-390, <em>et seq. </em>and the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, O.C.G.A. \u00a7\u00a7 10-1-370 <em>et seq.\u201d </em>DirecTV did not settle the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">In January 2009, Jones filed a complaint in a Georgia court \u201con behalf of herself and all others similarly situated\u201d against DirecTV. Jones alleged that DirecTV had \u201ccollected unduly high fees for leasing and lease-related sales tax charges.\u201d Jones complained that DirecTV had breached its contract and been unjustly enriched, and Jones requested an accounting of funds and injunctive and declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">DirecTV removed the case to the district court, under the Class Action Fairness Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(2), and moved to compel Jones to arbitrate her complaint. DirecTV argued that Jones was bound by the arbitration clause in the customer agreement. DirecTV also argued that the clause was enforceable because Jones could, but did not, assert a claim under the Georgia Fair Business Practices Act, which guaranteed to a prevailing party payment of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">The district court denied the motion to arbitrate filed by DirecTV. The district court ruled that the waiver of the right to represent a class in Jones\u2019s agreement was unconscionable based on our decision in <em>Dale v. Comcast Corp., </em>498 F.3d 1216 (11th Cir.2007). The district court reasoned that Jones and the class she sought to represent would have little incentive to pursue arbitration based on \u201cthe limited potential recovery\u201d available. We held in <em>Dale </em>that a waiver of a class action in an arbitration agreement is unconscionable under Georgia law when the \u201ccost of vindicating an individual subscriber\u2019s claim ... is too great.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1224. We explained that several factors are relevant in determining the enforceability of a waiver of a class action, including the \u201cfairness of the provisions,\u201d the cost of individual arbitration in comparison to the potential recovery, the likelihood that attorney\u2019s fees and expenses could be recovered, the power the waiver gave the company \u201cto engage in unchecked market behavior,\u201d and \u201crelated public policy concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We ruled that the waiver of a class action in the Comcast contract was unconscionable because it undermined a public policy favoring the pursuit of small-value claims to deter companies from misconduct and discouraged arbitration by consumers who sought small judgments, but bore significant costs and would otherwise experience difficulty obtaining representation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">This appeal is materially indistinguishable from <em>Dale. </em>Jones and other subscribers each seek to recover about $200, but they have to weigh whether that small recovery would offset their costs of up to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>$125 for initiating the arbitration, the price of expert witnesses, and other expenses. <em>See Dale, </em>498 F.3d at 1224. Jones and other subscribers would face difficulty obtaining individual representation because their complaints about violations of state law do not entitle them to recovery of attorney\u2019s fees and costs unless they can prove that DirecTV acted in bad faith. <em>See </em>Ga.Code \u00a7 13-6-11. The waiver of a class action in the arbitration agreement with DirecTV is unconscionable because the costs of arbitration would significantly deter Jones from pursuing her complaint against DirecTV. <em>See Dale, </em>498 F.3d at 1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">DirecTV argues that, in its cost-benefit analysis, the district court must consider all potential claims available to a plaintiff, but we disagree. The plaintiff is master of her complaint and \u201cselects the claims that will be alleged in the complaint.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>125 F.3d 1418, 1428 (11th Cir.1997). DirecTV cites no authority to support its argument that we must ascribe to Jones a potential claim for relief that has not been pleaded in her complaint. <em>See Pendergast v. Sprint Nextel Corp., </em>592 F.3d 1119, 1141 (11th Cir.2010) (evaluating substantive unconscionability based on grounds alleged in complaint); <em>Dale, </em>498 F.3d at 1222-23 (stating that \u201csubscribers cannot recover attorneys\u2019 fees ... for the specific violations alleged\u201d in the complaint); <em>Jenkins v. First Am. Cash Advance of Ga., LLC, </em>400 F.3d 868, 878 (11th Cir.2005) (rejecting argument that class members would be unable to obtain representation because plaintiff could recover attorney\u2019s fees under \u201cher Georgia RICO claim\u201d); <em>Snowden v. Checkpoint Check Cashing, </em>290 F.3d 631, 638 (4th Cir.2002) (plaintiffs could recover attorney\u2019s fees for alleged violations of the Truth in Lending Act and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act); <em>Honig v. Comcast of Ga. I, LLC, </em>537 F.Supp.2d 1277, 1287 (N.D.Ga.2008) (distinguishing <em>Dale </em>on the ground that the plaintiffs \u201cfirst and primary claim ... is brought pursuant to the Georgia Fan* Business Practices Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">The decision to deny the motion to arbitrate is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
