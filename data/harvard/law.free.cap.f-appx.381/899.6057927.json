He now appeals his sentences, arguing that they are procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-19\">We review a sentence for procedural or substantive reasonableness, employing an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201c[W]hen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The reasonableness of a sentence depends on the district court\u2019s application of the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>Procedural errors at sentencing may include the district court\u2019s failure to calculate, or improper calculation of, the guideline range, treatment of the guidelines as mandatory, failure to consider the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), selection of a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failure to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. The district court need not discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor; an acknowledgment by the district court that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as well as the defendant\u2019s arguments, is sufficient. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. \u201cThe sentencing judge should set forth enough [reasons] to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">The review for substantive reasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. A sentence may be substantively unreasonable if it does not achieve the purposes of sentencing as defined in \u00a7 3553(a). We will vacate a sentence and remand for resentencing, however, only when we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191. The weight given to any \u00a7 3553(a) factor is within the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007). As the U.S. Supreme Court explained, \u201c[t]he fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">With respect to the procedural reasonableness of his sentences, Portney contends that the Guidelines relating to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 should be given little weight because they were developed based on Congressional mandate, not empirical data. We have already rejected a similar argument challenging \u00a7 2G2.2. <em>See Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1201 n. 15. Thus, Portney\u2019s argument is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008) (recognizing that \u201ca prior panel\u2019s holding is binding on all subsequent panels\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">With respect to the substantive reasonable of Portney\u2019s sentences, the district court sentenced Portney to the low-end of the Guidelines sentencing range after considering the seriousness of the crimes, the need for deterrence, the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the facts and circumstances surrounding the offense, and Portney\u2019s arguments in mitigation, including his history, character, and family support network. That the district court chose to give more weight to the seriousness of the crime and the need for deterrence than to Portney\u2019s history, character, and family support network was within the sound discretion of the district court which. <em>See Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">The sentences in this case are, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-9\">.
