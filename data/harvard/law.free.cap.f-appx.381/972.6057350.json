Johnson, </em>541 F.3d 1064, 1066 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence appeal waiver is effective if it is made knowingly and voluntarily. <em>Id. </em>In this case, the record shows that the district court reviewed the sentence appeal waiver with Gaetan at the plea hearing, Gaetan confirmed that he understood the waiver, and Gaetan stated that he was agreeing to the waiver freely and voluntarily as part of his plea agreement. We therefore find that Gaetan entered into a valid, enforceable waiver. <em>See United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1351 (11th Cir.1993). Because none of the arguments listed above fall within the limited exceptions to the sentence appeal waiver, we dismiss as to these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-14\">Gaetan also challenges his sentence on the ground that it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment, because the sentence is disproportionate to the offense and also because the mandatory minimums forced the district court to impose a sentence that failed to account for his unique circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-15\">\u201cWe review challenges to the constitutionality of a sentence <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Sanchez, </em>586 F.3d 918, 932 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cIn non-capital cases, the Eighth Amendment encompasses, at most, only a narrow proportionality principle.\u201d <em>United States v. Brant, </em>62 F.3d 367, 368 (11th Cir.1995). The Supreme Court has made it clear that \u201c \u2018[ojutside the context of capital punishment, <em>successful </em>challenges to the proportionality of particular sentences [will be] exceedingly rare.\u2019 \u201d <em>Solem v. Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277, 289-90, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 3009, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 272, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 1138, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-16\">Gaetan has not shown that his sentence is \u201cgrossly disproportionate to the offense committed.\u201d <em>Brant, </em>62 F.3d at 368. Gaetan committed two armed robberies, and Congress has determined that such crimes should be punished with lengthy consecutive sentences. We must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>accord \u201csubstantial deference\u201d to Congress, which possesses \u201cbroad authority ... in determining the types and limits of punishments for crimes.\u201d <em>Solem, </em>463 U.S. at 290, 103 S.Ct. at 3009. \u201c \u2018In general, a sentence within the limits imposed by statute is neither excessive nor cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>451 F.3d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir.2005)). Because the district court sentenced Gaetan within the statutory limits, he has not made a threshold showing of disproportionality with respect to his sentence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">The fact that the mandatory m\u00ednimums prevented the district court from considering Gaetan\u2019s unique circumstances does not render the sentence unconstitutional. \u201c \u2018[A] sentence which is not otherwise cruel and unusual does not become so simply because it is mandatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1324 (11th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted) (quoting <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 995, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 2701, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991)). We have previously rejected Eighth Amendment challenges to the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences under several different statutes. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Arias-Izquierdo, </em>449 F.3d 1168, 1187 (11th Cir.2006) (air piracy); <em>Raad, </em>406 F.3d at 1324 (smuggling aliens into the United States); <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>215 F.3d 1210, 1214 (11th Cir.2000) (Armed Career Criminal Act); <em>United States v. Willis, </em>956 F.2d 248, 251 (11th Cir.1992) (drug trafficking). We see no reason to differentiate those offenses from the offense for which Gaetan was convicted, carrying and brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. For the foregoing reasons, Gaetan\u2019s 435-month sentence does not violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">DISMISSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
