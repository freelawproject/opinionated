He contends that he was improperly convicted under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) instead of \u00a7 1326(b)(1) because his 1995 Florida conviction for aggravated battery was not an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). Ugiagbe argues that the error affected his sentence because it raised the statutory maximum from ten to twenty years, which may have influenced the district court\u2019s decision to sentence him to forty-one months.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-15\">Since Ugiagbe did not raise this argument in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360-61 (5th Cir.2009). To show plain error, Ugiagbe must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-18\">Ugiagbe\u2019s 1995 Florida conviction was not an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) because it carried no sentence of imprisonment. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 368-69; <em>see also Singh v. US. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>561 F.3d 1275, 1280 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that aggravated felony did not exist until alien\u2019s sentence to community control was revoked and term of imprisonment imposed). Thus, it was error to convict and sentence Ugiagbe under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). However, the record does not indicate that the district court\u2019s error affected Ugiagbe\u2019s substantial rights. Whether the Florida conviction was a felony or an aggravated felony did not affect the Guideline range, and the district court, after an extensive discussion with Ugiagbe at the sentencing hearing, sentenced him to the lowest within-range sentence. There is no indication in the record that the statutory maximum played any role in the district court\u2019s decision. Therefore, Ugiagbe has failed to demonstrate reversible plain error. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>F.3d at 369. We do, however, reform the judgment of the district court to indicate that Ugiagbe was sentenced under \u00a7 1326(b)(1) instead of \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Even though Ugiagbe\u2019s sentence is at the bottom of the correctly calculated sentencing range, he contends that the sentence is substantively unreasonable. He contends that the district court failed to give sufficient effect to his duress argument by conflating duress as a defense to the commission of an offense and duress as a mitigating factor at sentencing. He asserts that even incomplete or imperfect duress may serve as a basis for a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.12. According to Ugiagbe, his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to give mitigating effect to his experiences in Nigeria.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Under the now-discretionary guidelines scheme, the sentencing court has a duty to consider the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and to correctly determine the applicable guidelines range. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005). Following <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we must determine whether the sentence imposed is procedurally sound, including whether the calculation of the advisory guidelines range is correct, and whether the sentence imposed is substantively reasonable. Review is for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Ugiagbe concedes that the Guideline range was properly calculated and that he was sentenced within the range. \u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). This court \u201cwill give great deference to that sentence\u201d and \u201cwill infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">The district court did not minimize Ug-iagbe\u2019s argument for a departure or variance based on events in Nigeria, nor did it conflate duress as a defense and duress as a sentencing factor. The district court simply did not believe that Ugiagbe could escape Nigeria only by fleeing to the United States, from whence he already had been deported, or that the only way he could reach Canada was by traversing the United States. Indeed, Ugiagbe flew from Nigeria to Brazil, then entered the United States from Mexico, having to cross through several countries along the way. His testimony that he could get to Spain only on a wooden boat due to his inability to obtain a Spanish visa also strains credulity.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">The district court considered Ugiagbe\u2019s reasons for a lower sentence and explained why it discredited them. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356-57, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (suggesting that district courts should explain why nonfrivolous departure arguments are rejected). Ugiagbe has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness accorded his within-range sentence. See <em>Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554. Therefore, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing the forty-one month sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">AFFIRMED.
