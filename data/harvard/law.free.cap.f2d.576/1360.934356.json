WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1415-20\">The trustee in bankruptcy for Best Distribution Company (Best) appeals from an order of the district court affirming the bankruptcy judge\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> finding that he did not have summary jurisdiction over the trustee\u2019s counterclaim. Wells Fargo Bank (Bank) cross appeals from the district court\u2019s order granting a set off in the amount of the trustee\u2019s counterclaim. The cross-appeals present these questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-21\">(1) Did the Bank timely file its petition for review of the bankruptcy judge\u2019s order?</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>(2) Did the bankruptcy judge have summary jurisdiction over the trustee\u2019s counterclaim?</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-4\">(3) Did the district court err in granting the set off?</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-7\">Best was adjudicated bankrupt in December, 1968. In that proceeding, the Bank filed a creditor\u2019s claim based on Best\u2019s written guarantees of the Bank\u2019s loans to an affiliated bankrupt corporation. The trustee contended that the guarantees were invalid and counterclaimed, alleging that the Bank was indebted to Best for wrongful charges to Best\u2019s bank account and for failure to credit Best\u2019s account with two deposits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-8\">On September 4, 1970, the bankruptcy judge issued a show cause order returnable on October 7, later amended to November 17. On the day before the return date, the Bank filed its response and objected to the bankruptcy judge\u2019s summary jurisdiction over the trustee\u2019s counterclaim. After trial, on November 4, 1971, the bankruptcy judge concluded that it had summary jurisdiction over the trustee\u2019s counterclaim, disallowed the Bank\u2019s claim, and awarded affirmative relief on the trustee\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-9\">On November 9 the Bank requested an extension of time to November 24 for filing its petition for review, which the court granted. On the latter date the Bank filed a second petition for an extension. The bankruptcy judge again extended the deadline, this time to December 1, on which date the Bank filed its petition for review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1416-10\">The district court affirmed the bankruptcy judge\u2019s order disallowing the Bank\u2019s claim,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and remanded for a finding whether the Bank had consented to summary jurisdiction. The bankruptcy judge found no consent. The district court vacated the bankruptcy judge\u2019s order of affirmative relief to the trustee. The court instead granted the trustee a set off against any future claims the Bank may assert against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-14\">TIMELINESS OF THE BANK\u2019S PETITION FOR REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"A_j\">The trustee argues that the district court was without jurisdiction to disturb the bankruptcy judge\u2019s order because the Bank did not file its petition for review within the time allowed by \u00a7 39 c of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 <em>et seq.). </em>The Bank disagrees with that interpretation of the Act, and argues alternatively that its December 1 filing was due to \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-15\">As originally enacted, \u00a7 39 c provided: \u201cA person aggrieved by an order of a referee may, within ten days after the entry thereof or within such extended time as the court may for cause shown allow, file with the referee a petition for review . . .\u201d The Chandler Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 840, 858-59. Until \u00a7 39 c was enacted, petitions for review had to be filed within a \u201creasonable time\u201d unless local rules provided a specific period. <em>American Trust Co. v. W. S. Doig, Inc., </em>23 F.2d 398 (4th Cir. 1928); <em>Bacon v. Roberts, </em>146 F. 729 (3rd Cir. 1906); <em>Crim v. Woodford, </em>136 F. 34 (4th Cir. 1905); <em>In Re Foss, </em>147 F. 790 (D.Me.1906); <em>In Re Grant, </em>143 F. 661 (D.R.I.1906).</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-17\">The purpose of \u00a7 39 c was to provide a uniform degree of finality to orders of bankruptcy judges. However, because the 10-day limitation, on its face, applied only to \u201cperson[s] aggrieved,\u201d the circuits divid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>ed on whether the limitation merely restricted the right to file petitions for review, or whether it also restricted the district courts\u2019 discretionary power to entertain late petitions. <em>In Re Pfister, </em>123 F.2d 543, 548 (7th Cir. 1941), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>317 U.S. 144, 63 S.Ct. 133, 87 L.Ed. 146 (1942); <em>In Re Albert, </em>122 F.2d 393 (2nd Cir. 1941); <em>Thummess v. Von Hoffman, </em>109 F.2d 291 (3rd Cir. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-5\">In 1942 the Supreme Court held that \u00a7 39 c limits only an aggrieved party seeking review as a matter of right. <em>Pfister v. Northern Illinois Finance Corp., </em>317 U.S. 144, 152-153, 63 S.Ct. 133, 87 L.Ed. 146 (1942). Upholding a district court\u2019s jurisdiction based upon a petition filed after the 10-day period, the Court concluded that Congress had expressed no intention to limit the discretion district courts had traditionally exercised in this area. <em>Id., </em>citing H.R.Rep. No. 1409, 75th Cong., 1st Sess. 11; Committee Print, H.R. 12889, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. 149-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-6\">Dissatisfied with the lack of finality that accompanied the discretionary power to entertain late petitions, Congress amended \u00a7 39 c in 1960 for the specific purpose of legislatively overruling <em>Pfister. In Re Benefiel, </em>500 F.2d 1219, 1220 (9th Cir. 1974). As amended \u00a7 39 c provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1417-7\">A person aggrieved by an order of a referee may, within ten days after the entry thereof or within such extended time as the court <em>upon petition filed within such ten-day period may </em>for cause shown allow, file with the referee a petition for review . . . . Unless the person aggrieved shall petition for review of such order within such ten-day period, or any extension thereof, the order of the referee shall become final. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1417-9\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 67(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-10\">The purpose of the 1960 amendment was to limit the period for filing petitions for review, to give a greater and more uniform degree of finality to bankruptcy courts\u2019 orders. The legislation limited district court\u2019s discretion to entertain late petitions. As the Senate Report explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1417-13\">There is now uncertainty as to the finality of a referee\u2019s order under [the <em>Pfister </em>] doctrine . . . . The purpose of the bill is to fix a definite period within which an application for review must be filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1417-15\">The bill amends section 39 c so as to make it clear that a petition for review must be filed within the prescribed 10-day period or within such extended time as the court may allow upon <em>petition for extension itself filed within such 10-day period.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqV\">S.Rep. No.' 1689, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1960] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, vol. 2, at 3194-95 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-16\">We have held that Congress intended the 10-day period to be \u201cstrictly construed and compulsorily applied.\u201d <em>In Re Great Western Ranches, Inc., </em>511 F.2d 1021, 1024 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>citing In Re Benefiel, supra. </em>Strict construction is necessary to negate the discretion afforded the reviewing court under the <em>Pfister </em>rule and to satisfy the purpose of the 1960 amendment, <em>i. </em>e., \u201cto fix a definite period\u201d for the filing of review petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-17\">For the same reasons we conclude that a petition filed during an extension is timely only if the extension itself is granted within the 10-day period. We believe this interpretation comports with the plain, unambiguous language of the statute and the available expressions of congressional purpose. Furthermore, we think that any other interpretation would destroy the effectiveness of the 10-day filing period and herald a return to the unbridled discretion afforded district courts under <em>Pfister.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1417-18\">Here the Bank did not file its petition for review within an extension granted \u201cupon petition filed within such ten-day period.\u201d It was therefore untimely.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>The Bank argues that this is an overly technical interpretation of \u00a7 39 c and suggests that we interpret \u00a7 39 e in light of the concededly inapplicable Bankruptcy Rule 802(c), which superseded \u00a7 39 c in 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"A-N\">Rule 802(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1418-4\">The referee may extend the time . for a period not to exceed 20 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by this rule. A request to extend the time . . . must be made before such time has expired .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1418-6\">The Bank contends that because the extensions granted here were within the overall 30-day limit prescribed under Rule 802(c), the second extension should be deemed within the contemplation of \u00a7 39 c and valid..</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-7\">We conclude, however, that Rule 802(c) is, at best, ambiguous and inconclusive support for the Bank\u2019s position and, at worst, contrary to it. The use of the words \u201ca period\u201d in the first sentence of that rule suggests that only one extension may be granted. Furthermore, Rule 903<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> militates against an interpretation authorizing multiple extensions. <em>See </em>Collier on Bankruptcy, vol. 13, 1 802.07[3], at 8-35 (14th ed. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-8\">The Bank argues, in the alternative, that its late filing is excusable. It cites <em>Thompson v. INS, </em>375 U.S. 384, 84 S.Ct. 397, 11 L.Ed.2d 404 (1964), for the proposition that reliance on an erroneous ruling of a trial court is \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-9\">In <em>Thompson, </em>after the applicable 60-day limitation had expired, the petitioner filed his appeal, relying on a district court\u2019s ruling that untimely post-trial motions were timely and that they had postponed the 60-day deadline. The Court concluded that in those \u201cunique circumstances,\u201d the court of appeals erred in dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-10\">We are not presented with the same circumstances. The appellant in <em>Thompson </em>allowed the remaining 48 days in the filing period to lapse in reliance on the district court\u2019s ruling, during which period he presumably would have filed his notice of appeal. The Bank, however, requested an extension in the eleventh hour. Its time had nearly run.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-13\">If, as the Bank then contended, it requested the second extension for cause (/. e., for one reason or another, it was unable to file its petition during the first extension), then its failure to file during the first extension was not in reliance on the bankruptcy court\u2019s order granting the second extension, but for the reasons it gave in its second request. Alternatively, if the Bank actually was prepared to file during the first extension, its request for the second extension was a delaying tactic which we will not condone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-14\">Because we conclude the Bank\u2019s petition was not filed timely, we do not consider the remaining questions concerning the order of the district court, which was entered without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-15\">The order of the district court is vacated and the bankruptcy judge\u2019s order of November 4, 1971, is reinstated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1415-12\">. For clarity and uniformity, \u201cbankruptcy judge\u201d refers to those traditinally called \u201creferee.\u201d \u201cBankruptcy court\u201d refers to the forum over which the bankruptcy judge presides, and appeals from the bankruptcy court lie in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1416-11\">. The trustee, who unsuccessfully argued that the petition for review was untimely, sought review of the referee\u2019s order granting the second extension. The district court affirmed the extension order. We dismissed the trustee\u2019s appeal as premature. <em>In the Matter of Best Distribution Co., </em>No. 72 1836 (9th Cir. May 16, 1974) (unpub. mem.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1416-18\">. The Bank appealed that order to this court. We dismissed on the Bank\u2019s motion. <em>In the Matter of Best Distribution Co., </em>No. 75-1357 (9th Cir. Oct. 9, 1975) (unpub. order). That order is now final.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1417-11\">. The Tenth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion in <em>Potucek v. Cordeleria Lourdes, </em>310 F.2d 527, 529 (10th Cir. 1962). It correctly noted that the purpose of the 1960 amendment was to eliminate confusion as to the finality of bankruptcy judges\u2019 orders, but it followed <em>Pfis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>ter. We disagree because the legislative history identifies <em>Pfister </em>as the cause of the uncertainty the 1960 amendment sought to eliminate. <em>See </em>[1960] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, vol. 2, at 3194-97.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1418-25\">.
