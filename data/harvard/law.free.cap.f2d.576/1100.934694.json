Wycoff Co., </em>344 U.S. 237, 73 S.Ct. 236, 97 L.Ed. 291 (1952), circumscribes the power of a federal district court to entertain a constitutional challenge to a state statute. The district court, relying primarily upon dictum in <em>Wycoff, </em>concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over appellants' claims. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-11\">The appellants in this case are six air carriers, Braniff International, Inc., Delta Airlines, Inc., Eastern Airlines, Inc., Northwest Airlines, Inc., Southern Airways, Inc., and Transworld Airlines, Inc., all of which are engaged in interstate and foreign commerce pursuant to \u201cCertificates of Public Convenience and Necessity\u201d issued by the Civil Aeronautics Board. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1371(a). The appellees are the Florida Public Service Commission, its chairman and individual members. The Commission is an agency of the State cf Florida charged with the regulation of utilities and transportation companies doing business entirely within the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-15\">In 1972 the Florida Legislature, with the express purpose of regulating air carriers within the state,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> enacted the following statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1155-16\">The [public service] commission is empowered to disapprove, after notice and hearing, any change in a rate, fare, or schedule between points in this state of <em>a person engaged in air transportation pursuant to a certificate or certificates issued by the civil aeronautics board </em>pursuant to section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, ... if such change would impose an undue economic burden on state certificated air carriers operating between the same points. The commission <em>shall </em>adopt rules and regulations requiring such persons to file notice of such changes with the commission on the effective date thereof, and the commission <em>shall </em>cause notice thereof promptly to be delivered to every state certificated carrier. A notice of hearing <em>shall </em>be issued within thirty days after such effective date upon complaint of any state certificated air carrier, and the hearing may be held after thirty days after service of such notice of hearing upon the person making such change in a rate, fare, or schedule. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1155-18\">Fla.Stat. \u00a7 330.53 (1973) (emphasis added). There is no dispute but that the statutory language purports to empower the Commission, under the prescribed circumstances, to regulate certain business activities of the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-19\">In accordance with the express statutory command that it do so, the Commission, on May 16,1975, proposed to adopt the following rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1156-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>1. All persons engaged in air transportation pursuant to a certificate . issued by the Civil Aeronautics Board . shall file with the Florida Public Service Commission notice of any change in their rates, fares or schedules between points in the State of Florida. Such notice shall be filed not later than on the effective date thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1156-4\">2. The Commission shall cause notice thereof promptly to be delivered to every state certificated air carrier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1156-5\">3. A notice of hearing shall be issued within thirty days after such effective date upon complaint of any state certificated air carrier. The hearing may be held after thirty days after service of such notice of hearing upon the person making such change in a rate, fare or schedule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1156-6\">4. The Commission may disapprove, after notice and hearing, any change in a rate, fare or schedule between points in this state, ... if such change would impose an undue economic burden on state certificated carriers operating between the same points.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1156-7\">Fla.Admin.Code, Rule 25.15-50. Over the objections of the Air Transport Association of America that the statute and proposed rule were unconstitutional,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Commission adopted the rule on August 4, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-8\">The impact of the regulatory scheme was virtually immediate. Only two months after the rule\u2019s effective date, a state certificated carrier complained that appellant Southern had \u201cchanged its schedules so as to compete with the [complaining] carrier.\u201d The Commission\u2019s independent investigation confirmed that Southern had changed its schedules without complying with the statutory notice requirement, prompting the issuance of a show cause order in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1156-13\">ORDERED . . . that Southern Airways, Inc., show cause in writing within thirty (30) days from the date of this order why it should not be penalized by fine and/or ordered to cease and desist from future violations [of the notice provision].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1156-15\">In addition Southern was ordered to appear before the Commission at a time and place to be fixed by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-16\">Consistent with its previously expressed position that the regulatory scheme was unconstitutional, Southern did not comply with the order and, joining with the remaining appellants, filed suit in federal district court. The complaint, which asserted federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1337 and invoked 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2281, 2284 to require appointment of a three-judge court, alleged that the state\u2019s attempts to regulate the schedules of interstate air carriers violated the Supremacy Clause, the Commerce Clause, and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellants sought injunctive and declaratory relief, and a stay of the execution or operation of the show-cause order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-17\">After denying appellants\u2019 request for interim relief,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the district court, without rul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>ing upon a plethora of other motions, proceeded to rule upon appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss. Citing <em>Public Service Comm\u2019n of Utah v. Wycoff Co., </em>344 U.S. 237, 73 S.Ct. 236, 97 L.Ed. 291 (1952), and <em>Allegheny Airlines v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Comm\u2019n, </em>319 F.Supp. 407 (E.D.Pa.1970), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>465 F.2d 237 (3d Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 943, 93 S.Ct. 1367, 35 L.Ed.2d 609 (1973), the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-4\">[P]laintiffs have failed to make out a case for federal-question jurisdiction. This action seeks merely to obtain for plaintiffs a federal defense to the action pending before the Florida Public Service Commission. The cause of action which' defendants threaten to institute will involve only an issue of state law \u2014 whether plaintiffs should be required to comply with the PSC\u2019s notice provision. That a defense based on federal law will be asserted is immaterial to the jurisdiction of this court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">On the sole basis stated above, the court granted the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-6\">Appellants subsequently learned that on July 20, 1976, a state certificated carrier, Florida Airlines, Inc., had filed a complaint under the statute. The complaint alleged that appellant Eastern intended to initiate new service between Jacksonville and Tampa, Florida, and requested the Commission to exercise its statutory authority to disapprove the schedule change. This additional action, which was raised in appellants\u2019 motion to vacate the dismissal order, did not sway the court. The motion to vacate was denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-7\">Before discussing the substance of the case, we think it necessary to illuminate what is not before us on appeal. We are not here concerned with the merits of appellants\u2019 constitutional claims, with the appointment of a three-judge court, or with the availability of injunctive or declaratory relief. The district court did not reach these questions, and we decline to do so on the record before us. The only issue decided below involved the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction over appellants\u2019 claims. It is to that issue, and that issue alone, that we now proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-10\">As already mentioned, the decision in <em>Public Service Comm\u2019n of Utah v. Wycoff Co., </em>344 U.S. 237, 73 S.Ct. 236, 97 L.Ed. 291 (1952), lies at the very core of this appeal. The plaintiff there was engaged in the business of importing, processing and transporting picture film and newsreels. These endeavors required plaintiff\u2019s carriers to traverse the highways between certain points within the State of Utah. In a suit against the Utah Public Service Commission and its members, it was alleged that defendants were violating the Commerce Clause by threatening and attempting to prevent plaintiff\u2019s transportation of materials between Utah cities. Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that its Utah activities constituted \u201cinterstate commerce\u201d and an injunction restraining defendants from interfering with those activities. Significantly, plaintiff did not challenge the constitutionality of any state statute or administrative ruling, nor did it present any evidence of any past, pending or threatened action against it by defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 239-40, 73 S.Ct. 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-11\">Following a trial, the district court agreed with defendants\u2019 contention that plaintiff\u2019s Utah business involved only intrastate commerce and therefore dismissed the complaint. The court of appeals, however, concluding in essence that plaintiff\u2019s \u201cintrastate transportations [were] nonetheless integral parts of interstate transportation,\u201d reversed and remanded for further proceedings. <em>Wycoff Co. v. Public Service Comm\u2019n of Utah, </em>195 F.2d 252 (10th Cir. 1952).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Supreme Court in turn reversed and directed dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-12\">The language in issue here came late in the Court\u2019s opinion. After concluding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>plaintiff was not entitled to injunctive relief, 344 U.S. at 240-41, 73 S.Ct. 236, and that the suit could not continue as one for declaratory relief because of the \u201ccase or controversy\u201d restrictions of Article III, 344 U.S. at 241\u201448, 73 S.Ct. 236, the Court, <em>obiter dictum, </em>observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1158-4\">In this case, as in many actions <em>for declaratory judgement, </em>the realistic position of the parties is reversed. The plaintiff is seeking to establish a defense against <em>a cause of action which the declaratory defendant may assert </em>in the Utah courts. Respondent here has sought to ward off <em>possible action </em>of the petitioners by seeking a declaratory judgment to the effect that he will have a good defense <em>when and if </em>that cause of action is asserted. Where the complaint in an action for declaratory judgment seeks in essence to assert a defense to <em>an impending or threatened state court action, </em>it is the character of the threatened action, and not of the defense, which will determine whether there is federal-question jurisdiction in the District Court. If the cause of action, which the declaratory defendant <em>threatens </em>to assert, does not itself involve a claim under federal law, it is doubtful if a federal court may entertain an action for a declaratory judgment establishing a defense to that claim. This is dubious even though the declaratory complaint sets forth a claim of federal right, if that right is in reality in the nature of a defense to a threatened cause of action. Federal courts will not seize litigations from state courts merely because one, normally a defendant, goes to federal court to begin his federal-law defense before the state court begins the case under state law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">344 U.S. at 248, 73 S.Ct. at 242. (citations omitted) (emphasis added). In relying upon this language to dismiss the present claims, we think it clear that the district court gave it broader effect than was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-6\">At the outset we should note that during the 26 years since its decision in <em>Wycoff, </em>the Supreme Court has never invoked the rationale quoted above to obtain the result reached by the district court here. Several courts of appeals concededly have relied upon <em>Wycoff\u2019s </em>dictum in a variety of contexts. <em>See Milprint, Inc. v. Curwood, Inc., </em>562 F.2d 418, 422 (7th Cir. 1977); <em>Allegheny Airlines, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Comm\u2019n, </em>465 F.2d 237, 241 (3d Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 943, 93 S.Ct. 1367, 35 L.Ed.2d 609 (1973); <em>McCorkle v. First Pennsylvania Banking &amp; Trust Co., </em>459 F.2d 243, 250-51 (4th Cir. 1972); <em>Thiokol Chem. Corp. v. Burlington Indus., Inc., </em>448 F.2d 1328, 1330-31 (3d Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 1019, 92 S.Ct. 684, 30 L.Ed.2d 668 (1972); <em>Chandler v. O\u2019Bryan, </em>445 F.2d 1045, 1055-56 (10th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 964, 92 S.Ct. 1176, 31 L.Ed.2d 241 (1972); <em>Product Engineering &amp; Mfg., Inc. v. Barnes, </em>424 F.2d 42, 44 (10th Cir. 1970). <em>But see Rath Packing Co. v. Becker, </em>530 F.2d 1295, 1303-1306 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom., Jones v. Rath Packing Co., </em>430 U.S. 519, 97 S.Ct. 1305, 51 L.Ed.2d 604 (1977); La <em>Chemise Lacoste </em>v. <em>Alligator Co., </em>506 F.2d 339, 343-45 (3d Cir. 1974). However, the only common threat appearing in these cases is the dearth of discussion and analysis. Despite appellees\u2019 invitation, we decline to adhere blindly to the cited cases under the circumstances presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-8\">To appreciate the true import of the <em>Wycoff </em>\u201ctest,\u201d it is necessary to consider both its origins and the context in which it was propounded. The <em>Wycoff </em>\u201ctest\u201d originated, albeit in a somewhat different form, in <em>Tennessee v. Union &amp; Planters\u2019 Bank, </em>152 U.S. 454, 14 S.Ct. 654, 38 L.Ed. 511 (1894), where the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1158-9\">\u201c[A] suggestion of one party, that the other will or may set up a claim under the Constitution . . ., does not make the suit one arising under that Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464, 14 S.Ct. at 657; <em>see Gully v. First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>299 U.S. 109, 57 S.Ct. 96, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936); <em>Louisville &amp; N. Ry. v. Mottley, </em>211 U.S. 149, 29 S.Ct. 42, 53 L.Ed. 126 (1908). The basic principle announced in <em>Union &amp; Planters </em>was echoed half a century later in <em>Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Co., </em>339 U.S. 667, 70 S.Ct. 876, 94 L.Ed. 1194 (1950), where relief was sought under the Declaratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <em>Skelly </em>Court, after noting that the Act was not intended to expand federal court jurisdiction, explained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-4\">To sanction suits for declaratory relief as within the jurisdiction of the District Courts merely because . . . artful pleading anticipates a defense based on federal law would contravene the whole trend of jurisdictional legislation by Congress, disregard the effective functioning of the federal judicial system and distort the limited procedural purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">339 U.S. at 673, 70 S.Ct. at 880. We think it plain that <em>Wycoff </em>is but a logical reiteration of similar concerns in a different setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-7\">It must be remembered that the <em>Wycoff </em>\u201ctest\u201d was stated in a case in which the only available remedy was a declaratory judgment. Moreover, there was \u201cno evidence whatsoever of any past, pending or threatened action by the [defendant] touching [the plaintiff\u2019s] business in any respect.\u201d 344 U.S. at 240, 73 S.Ct. at 238. Given the circumstances, it seems clear that the \u201ctest\u201d represents a concern that a plaintiff not be allowed, by asserting a defense to impending or threatened state action, to proceed under the fountainhead of federal-question jurisdiction in a case which otherwise could not be heard in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-8\">The plaintiff in <em>Wycoff, </em>however, faced hurdles not present in the case at hand. The <em>Wycoff </em>Court, with the benefit of a full trial record, had determined on the merits that no injunction could issue, since there was \u201cno proof of any threatened or probable act of the defendants which might cause the [requisite] irreparable injury.\u201d 344 U.S. at 240-41, 73 S.Ct. 239. In the present case the state, through the Commission, already had set in motion the very regulatory processes whose constitutionality was challenged through appellants\u2019 suit. As developed by the pleadings and other matters thus far a part of the record, it simply cannot be said that injunctive relief is foreclosed here as it was in <em>Wycoff. </em>Appellants\u2019 suit, therefore, cannot be characterized as nothing more than an attempt \u201cto ward off possible action of the appellees by seeking a declaratory judgment to the effect that [they] will have a good defense when and if\u201d that action is taken. 344 U.S. at 248, 73 S.Ct. at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-13\">Nor can it be doubted that these appellants, whose standing in this matter cannot seriously be questioned,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> have not presented a true \u201ccase or controversy\u201d as required by Article III. That defect undoubtedly played a crucial role in the judicial demise of the <em>Wycoff </em>plaintiff\u2019s claim. Here, however, the circumstances show that \u201cthere is a substantia] controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant [relief].\u201d <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co., </em>312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S.Ct. 510, 512, 85 L.Ed. 826 (1941), <em>quoted in Golden v.

In summary, we hold that where a party seeks injunctive and declaratory relief based upon the unconstitutionality of a state statute, and where there are no other concrete'impediments to a proper exercise of federal-question jurisdiction,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the mere fact that the constitutional claims might be raised before a state administrative body charged with enforcement of the statute does not alone deprive the court of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-11\">The judgment of the district court is REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>2.

The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-6\">The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions wherein the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $10,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1160-7\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-8\">The appellants\u2019 action, which is founded directly upon the Supremacy Clause, the Commerce Clause, and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, undoubtedly \u201carises under the Constitution\u201d as the Supreme Court has interpreted that phrase. See <em>Powell v. McCormack, </em>395 U.S. 486, 513-14, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969); <em>Bell v. Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 685, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946); <em>Gully v. First Nat'l Bank, </em>299 U.S. 109, 112-13, 57 S.Ct. 96, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Kansas City Title Co., </em>255 U.S. 180, 199-200, 41 S.Ct. 243, 65 L.Ed. 577 (1921). <em>See generally </em>C. Wright, <em>Law of Federal Courts </em>\u00a7 17 at 54 \u2014 59 (2d Ed. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-9\">The complaint in this case alleges the requisite jurisdictional amount. Although this claim was put in issue by appellees\u2019 motions to dismiss, the district court made no ruling in this regard. Of course, the law on this question is quite clear. In injunction and declaratory judgment actions, the amount in controversy is not the amount that might be recovered at law, but rather the value of the right to be protected or the extent of the injury to be prevented. <em>See Western &amp; A.R.R. v. Railroad Comm\u2019n of Georgia, </em>261 U.S. 264, 267, 43 S.Ct. 252, 67 L.Ed. 645 (1923); <em>Glenwood Light &amp; Water Co. v. Mutual Light, Heat &amp; Power Co., </em>239 U.S. 121, 125 26, 36 S.Ct. 30, 60 L.Ed. 174 (1915); <em>City of Milwaukee v. Saxbe, </em>546 F.2d 693, 702 (7th Cir. 1976); <em>Jackson v. American Bar Association, </em>538 F.2d 829, 831 (9th Cir. 1976); <em>cf. Premier Indus. Corp. v. Texas Indus. Fastener Co., </em>450 F.2d 444, 446 (5th Cir. 1971) (same standard applied in context of diversity action to enforce settlement agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-14\">In the final analysis it may be that this question need not be resolved, since appellants also alleged jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337. That statute confers original jurisdiction, without regard to the amount in controversy, in civil actions \u201carising under any Act of Congress regulating commerce.\u201d In this case the question of whether appellants\u2019 action \u201carises under\u201d the Federal Aviation Act is subject to the same principles applicable in suits under \u00a7 1331. <em>See Felter v. Southern Pacific Co., </em>359 U.S. 326, 329 n. 4, 79 S.Ct. 847, 3 L.Ed.2d 854 (1959); <em>Peyton v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>316 U.S. 350, 353, 62 S.Ct. 1171, 86 L.Ed. 1525 (1942); <em>Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co. v. Local 327, IBEW, </em>508 F.2d 687, 699 n. 34 (3d Cir. 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1160-15\">.
