Brady, Inc. (Brady). The court based its ruling on a finding that the union\u2019s actions had not been directed at a third party and thus fell within the statutory protection for primary activity. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(4)(B). Nonetheless, the court preliminarily enjoined Local 282 from any further striking or picketing on Brady\u2019s construction site, finding that Local 282\u2019s actions had had the object of requiring Brady to assign particular work to employees represented by Local 282, and therefore had been in violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(4)(D)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">Samuel Kaynard, Regional Director of Region Twenty-nine of the National Labor Relations Board appeals from the order of the district court insofar as it does not include an injunction against \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B) violations by Local 282. Furthermore, the NLRB complains that the scope of Judge Weinstein\u2019s injunction was too narrow and that the court improperly assigned work among the unions on the Brady construction site. We agree with the Board that the district court had reasonable cause to believe that Local 282 had violated \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B). We also conclude that the injunction\u2019s protections should have been broader in their scope and that the district court improperly included within its order provisions assigning work among the unions on the construction site. We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s judgment in these respects and remand to the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>for appropriate modifications of its injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Brady is the general contractor for construction of a United States Postal Service mail handling facility at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Jamaica, New York (J.F.K. site). Brady is party to a July 1, 1975, collective bargaining agreement\u2014 known as the \u201cHigh-Rise Contract\u201d \u2014 with Local 282; this agreement remains in effect until June 30,1978. According to the terms of the High-Rise Contract all truck driving done on any construction site under Brady\u2019s management must be done by members of Local 282. Two exceptions to this general rule are expressly noted: First, Local 282 does not claim jurisdiction over vehicles driven by \u201cmechanics and skilled tradesmen incidental to the trade itself with their hand, of their trade\u201d; second, the agreement allows persons not members of Local 282 to make deliveries to and pick ups from the construction site, provided these deliveries and pick ups are made to and from only one location at the site. The High-Rise Contract specifically provides that Brady may not subcontract truck driving work to any company not bound by the Brady-Local 282 agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">On March 8,1977, Brady subcontracted to Active Fire Sprinkler Corp. (Active), a manufacturer and installer of automatic fire sprinkler systems, all plumbing and fire protection work for Brady\u2019s project at the J.F.K. site. Active\u2019s plumber employees, under an August 8, 1975, collective bargaining agreement, are represented by Plumbers Local Union No. 1 of Brooklyn and Queens (Local 1); its truck driving employees are members of Local 918, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America (Local 918), whose collective bargaining agreement was entered into with Active on August 18, 1974. None of Active\u2019s employees are represented by Local 282, nor is Active a party to the High-Rise Contract. Moreover, nothing in Active\u2019s subcontract with Brady provides that the plumbing contractor is subject to the general contractor\u2019s agreement with Local 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">In addition to Active, two other subcontractors \u2014 Burmar Electric Corp. (Burmar) and Novid Corp. (Novid) \u2014 are present on the J.F.K. site. The record does not show that any of Burmar or Novid\u2019s employees belong to Local 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-16\">Since it entered the J.F.K. site in March 1977, Active has used three types of drivers to transport its materials to and around the site. For deliveries, Active uses both its own drivers (represented by Local 918) and independent drivers (not represented by any union). These drivers deliver loads of pipe and other materials from Active\u2019s main office in Brooklyn and from independent suppliers around the country to various points on the J.F.K. site: Some deliveries are made to a single storage facility on the site; other deliveries are made directly to some or all of the twenty-two locations at which Active is performing work on the project. In addition to using the unrepre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>sented drivers and those represented by Local 918, Active has its plumber employees (who are represented by Local 1) use Jeep trucks to transport materials, men, and small tools between the central supply facility on the site and the twenty-two working locations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">On March 22, 1977, Local 282\u2019s business agent informed Active\u2019s superintendent that single deliveries to more than one location on the construction site violated the High-Rise Contract. When Active ignored this warning, the Local 282 representative, on March 23, said that, although the union \u201ccouldn\u2019t do anything to [Active],\u201d it would \u201cget\u201d Brady. Thereafter, until July 1, 1977, a Local 282 shop steward regularly followed Active\u2019s trucks around the construction site observing their movements. During April and May of 1977 Local 282 representatives also routinely stopped all Active trucks coming onto the J.F.K. site, demanded to see the drivers\u2019 union cards, and informed the drivers that deliveries could be made only to single locations on the construction site. Moreover, Local 282\u2019s business agent repeatedly urged Active\u2019s superintendent to hire members of Local 282 to drive Active\u2019s Jeep trucks around the site. But Active rebuffed all attempts by Local 282 to alter Active\u2019s method of transporting materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Having failed to induce Active to employ Local 282 members as truck drivers, Local 282 shifted its attention to Brady. Thus, on May 21, 1977, the Local 282 business agent approached Louis Ferrari, Brady\u2019s general superintendent, and demanded that Brady add a Local 282 member to its payroll to make up for Active\u2019s refusal to hire members of Local 282; Ferrari refused. Thereafter, from May 21 until June 15, a Local 282 member unsuccessfully applied every day for work as Active\u2019s truck driver on the J.F.K. site. At the same time Brady, acting through Ferrari, began to urge .Active\u2019s President to hire Local 282 members to drive the subcontractor\u2019s trucks. Further, Ferrari attempted to enlist Local l\u2019s business agent in the campaign to coerce Active to change its policy. Thus, in early June Local 1\u2019s business agent, at the urging of Ferrari, met with a representative from Local 282, who told him that Local 282 could \u201cmake Active sign an agreement with [Local] 282 through Brady.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">After both direct and indirect attempts to coerce Active to hire Local 282 members had failed, on the morning of June 16 Local 282 put a picket line at the only gate to the J.F.K. site, resulting in the cessation of work by all Brady, Burmar, and Novid employees. Later in the day, Local 282 took its complaints to the Local 282-Building Contractors Association Joint Trade Board (Trade Board), the body to which initial resort is to be had under the High-Rise Contract. The Trade Board ruled that any truck driving done on the J.F.K. site, other than the initial drop of materials at a single location, had to be done by Local 282 members; accordingly, the Trade Board ordered Brady to place truck drivers from Local 282 in each of Active\u2019s trucks.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">Late in the afternoon of June 16, Local 282 removed the picket line at the J.F.K. site and work resumed when the union was told that Brady intended to comply with the mandate of the Trade Board. To that end, Brady unsuccessfully tried once again to persuade Active to hire a Local 282 member for the J.F.K. site; failing that, Brady itself hired a member of Local 282 and voluntarily gave him seventeen days\u2019 backpay, covering the days he had reported to Active and was denied work driving the subcontractor\u2019s truck. After threatening on June 27 to renew its strike because of Brady\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>failure to secure compliance with the Trade Board\u2019s directive,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Local 282 placed a picket line at the J.F.K. site once again on June 28, thereby stopping work by Brady, Bur-mar, and Novid employees. In order to end the strike, on June 30 Brady suspended for three weeks all work by Active on the J.F.K. site; the picketing ceased on July 1, 1977. Active remained off the construction site until July 21, 1977, when Judge Weinstein granted a temporary restraining order against further picketing by Local 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">On June 29, 1977, Active filed unfair labor practice charges against Local 282 with the Regional Office of the NLRB, claiming that the union had been violating \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B) and (D) of the NLRA. After investigating the charges, Regional Director Kaynard issued a complaint covering the \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B) violation,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and petitioned the district court to enjoin any further picketing of the J.F.K. site by Local 282, pending final adjudication by the NLRB of the \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B) and (D) charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">On July 20, 1977, the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the Regional Director\u2019s request for an injunction under \u00a7 10 of the NLRA. By written opinion of August 1, 1977, Judge Weinstein granted part of the government\u2019s request: The court issued a preliminary injunction forbidding any picketing or strike by Local 282 designed to \u201cforce or require Brady or its subcontractor Active to assign the work of driving trucks at the J.F.K. site carrying materials from point to point within the job site to employees who are represented by [Local 282] rather than to employees who are represented by Local 1.\u201d The court based its injunction, however, on the \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D) violation alone, finding no reasonable cause to believe that Local 282\u2019s actions constituted secondary picketing prohibited by \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B). In addition, the court provided that Local 1 members could transport by truck only 25 pounds of lead in any one trip; anything beyond this must be done by cherry pickers or trucks driven by members of Local 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">The NLRB appeals from the court\u2019s judgment insofar as- it was not based on alleged violations of \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B) as well as \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the Board asks that we remove the restriction on the amount of materials that may be transported in trucks driven by members of Local 1 and that we expand the scope of the injunction to cover attempts by Local 282 to affect the assignment of work presently done on the J.F.K. site by members of Local 918 and unrepresented employees of Active.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A6Y\">A. Secondary Boycott</p>\n<p id=\"AXs\">\u00a7 10(7) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(7), provides that whenever the NLRB receives a charge that any person has violated \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B) of the Act, and a NLRB regional attorney, after an investigation, finds that there is reasonable cause to believe the charge is true,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7o\">he shall, on behalf of the Board, petition any United States district court within any district where the unfair labor practice in question has occurred for appropriate injunctive relief pending the final adjudication of the Board with respect to such matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">We have held that such requests for injunctive relief by representatives of the Board should be granted if: (1) deferring to the statutory interpretation and rational factual inferences of the Board, there is reasonable cause to believe that there has been a violation of the Act; and (2) the equitable relief requested is just and proper. See <em>Danielson v. International Organization of Masters, </em>521 F.2d 747, 751 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>Seeler v. Trading Port, Inc., </em>517 F.2d 33, 36 (2d Cir. 1975). Applying this standard to the case at bar, we conclude that the district court erred in refusing to enjoin Local 282 from committing further violations of \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B) of the Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Appellee does not claim that granting the injunction against Local 282 was in any way unjust or improper; like the district court, appellee argues only that the strikes and picketing of Brady were not secondary activities and therefore were not in violation of \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B). The Supreme Court has said that a union\u2019s conduct violates \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B) if it is coercive, is \u201caimed directly at [parties] . . . not involved in the dispute,\u201d and is intended to force a neutral third party to cease doing business with another. See <em>NLRB v. Local 825, International Union of Operating Engineers, </em>400 U.S. 297, 304, 91 S.Ct. 402, 27 L.Ed.2d 398 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">Here there is little question that Local 282\u2019s actions in striking and picketing against Brady were coercive; indeed, they were successful inasmuch as they coerced the general contractor to hire an unnecessary employee and to ask Active to leave the construction site. Moreover, unlike the district court, we believe that the Regional Director was well justified in concluding that Local 282\u2019s actions taken against Brady were designed to alter Active\u2019s employment practices. From the beginning of troubles at the J.F.K. site, Local 282\u2019s attentions were directed toward Active with the single goal of compelling the subcontractor to alter its method of transporting materials on the site. As we have noted, Local 282\u2019s own representatives told representatives of both Local 1 and Active that Local 282 would reach Active through actions taken against Brady.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">Local 282 argues that its strike and picketing were primary activities protected under \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B) because they had as their objective the enforcement of the High-Rise Contract between Brady and Local 282. The existence of a collective bargaining agreement, however, can never protect what is otherwise illegal secondary activity. See <em>NLRB v. Local 638, Ass\u2019n of Steam Pipefitters, </em>429 U.S. 507, 520-21, 97 S.Ct. 891, 51 L.Ed.2d 1 (1977). Thus, since Local 282\u2019s actions were \u201ctactically calculated to satisfy [the union\u2019s] objectives elsewhere,\u201d <em>National Woodwork Manufacturers\u2019 Assn. v. NLRB, </em>386 U.S. 612, 644, 87 S.Ct. 1250, 1268, 18 L.Ed.2d 357 (1967), no provision of the High-Rise Contract pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>tects those actions from the prohibition of \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">In addition to being coercive and aimed at a third party, Local 282\u2019s conduct was designed to force Brady to \u201ccease doing business\u201d with Active. Only when Brady had ordered Active off of the construction site did Local 282 remove its pickets. Indeed, on appeal Local 282 urges that Brady could easily have remedied the labor dispute at the J.F.K. site by exercising the contractor\u2019s right under its contract with Active to terminate the latter\u2019s role in the project. Throughout its dealings with Brady and Active, Local 282 made abundantly clear its intention that, absent Active\u2019s submission to the union\u2019s demands, Active be removed from the site. See <em>NLRB v. Local 825, International Union of Operating Engineers, </em>400 U.S. 297, 304-05, 91 S.Ct. 402, 27 L.Ed.2d 398 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">We conclude, therefore, that there is reasonable cause to believe that Local 282 violated \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B) of the Act when it took action against Brady.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The injunction of the district court accordingly must be modified to include a prohibition on any strike or picketing against Brady which has as its objective the coercion of Active either to alter its employment practices concerning on-site trucking or to leave the site. Any redress Local 282 may be entitled to for breach of the High-Rise Contract must be sought against Brady in a court of law \u2014 not on a picket line.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">B. Local 918 and Unrepresented Employees</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">As we have noted, the district court\u2019s order forbad strikes or picketing by Local 282 only insofar as such activities have as their object forcing \u201cBrady or its subcontractor Active to assign the work of driving trucks at the J.F.K. site carrying materials from point to point within the job site to employees who are represented by Local. 282 <em>rather than to employees who are represented by Local 1 </em>\u201d (emphasis supplied). The NLRB appeals from this order because of its limitation to activity aimed at reassignment from Local 1-represented employees to employees represented by Local 282. Rather, the Board argues, the injunction\u2019s protection should extend to Active employees represented by Local 918 and unrepresented truck drivers delivering Active materials as well as to those belonging to Local 1. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">A review of the record shows that from the beginning of the troubles on the J.F.K. site Local 282 was concerned with all truck driving done for Active on the site. Representatives from Local 282 stopped unrepresented drivers and Active drivers belonging to Local 918 and insisted that anything more than deliveries to a single location on the site was illegal. In ruling on Local 282\u2019s complaint, the Trade Board made a general determination regarding truck driving on the J.F.K. site; it did not limit its attention to the Jeep trucks driven by Active employees represented by Local 1. Moreover, when the Board issued its determination under \u00a7 10(k) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(k), concerning assignment of work on the J.F.K. site, that determination applied to all drivers for Active, including those represented by Locals 1 and 918 and those not belonging to any union. We conclude, therefore, that Local 282\u2019s actions were directed toward reassignment of work presently performed by members of Local 918 and unrepresented employees as well as by members of Local 1. The order of the district court must be amended accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">C. Assignment of Work</p>\n<p id=\"b532-14\">Finally, the district court included as part of its order a provision that use of Jeep trucks on the J.F.K. site by members of Local 1</p>\n<p id=\"b532-15\">shall be limited to the transportation of 25 pounds of lead and pipe of a length not exceeding 5 feet for each pipe in any one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>trip. Other material transported on-site by Active shall be transported by \u201ccherry-pickers\u201d or by a member of [Local 282],</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The NLRB appeals from this portion of the order which assigns specific work to members of a specific union, arguing that the authority to assign work is vested exclusively in the Board under \u00a7 10(k) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Under \u00a7 10(k) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(k), whenever the Board receives a charge that a union has violated \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D) by attempting to coerce an employer into assigning specific work to members of a specific union, the NLRB must hear and determine the dispute out of which the charge has arisen. In <em>NLRB v. Local 1212, Radio &amp; Television Broadcast Engineers, </em>364 U.S. 573, 586, 81 S.Ct. 330, 338, 5 L.Ed.2d 302 (1961), the Supreme Court held that under \u00a7 10(k), \u201cit is the Board\u2019s responsibility and duty to decide which of two or more employee groups claiming the right to perform certain work tasks is right and then specifically to award such tasks in accordance with its decision.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">On the record before it, the district court had no power to assign the work which was the subject of the dispute. The purpose of a preliminary injunction under \u00a7 10(7) of the NLRA is to preserve the status quo in order to give the Board time to adjudicate fully the claims of the parties and take appropriate action. See <em>Compton v. National Maritime Union of America, </em>533 F.2d 1270, 1276-77 (1st Cir. 1976); <em>McLeod v. National Maritime Union of America, </em>457 F.2d 490, 496 (2d Cir. 1972). Here the district court\u2019s order prohibiting further strikes or picketing fully protected the status quo, and any further order was improper because unnecessary. We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s order insofar as it placed restrictions on the work to be assigned members of Local 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Reversed in part and remanded with instructions to amend the order of the district court in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b527-12\"> Senior District Judge of the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.

The Trade Board refused, however, to grant the union\u2019s request that back pay be given the Local 282 member who had reported for work and been denied a job as Active\u2019s truckdriver each day between May 22 and July 1, 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b530-6\">. After receiving Local 282\u2019s threat to strike, Brady filed with the NLRB an unfair labor practice charge, claiming that the union was violating \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D) by attempting to force Brady to assign work to Local 282 drivers. This charge was later withdrawn.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b530-7\">. The Regional Director\u2019s complaint covering the \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D) charge was held in abeyance pending the outcome of NLRB proceedings under \u00a7 10(k), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(k). On December 14, 1977, the Board issued its decision in the \u00a7 10(k) proceeding, finding that Active\u2019s employees \u2014 and not Local 282 members \u2014 were entitled to the disputed work. <em>Local 282; International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Active Fire Sprinkler Corp.), </em>223 NLRB No. 166 (Dec. 14, 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b530-8\">. Because Local 282\u2019s actions against Brady have largely been aimed at achieving reassignment of work currently done by Active employees, the injunction of the district court against \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D) violations reaches, in large part, potential violations of \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B) as well. Often the application of \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B) overlaps in this way with that of \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D). See, e. g., <em>NLRB v. Local 825, International Union of Operating Engineers, </em>400 U.S. 297, 305-06, 91 S.Ct. 402, 27 L.Ed.2d 398 (1971). At oral argu'ment we were told that, although the NLRB acknowledges that the injunction as it now stands will suppress most potential difficulties on the J.F.K. site, it was appealing out of concern for the harmful precedent set by the district court\u2019s ruling. In addition to such considerations, we find it necessary to review the claimed \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B) violation because circumstances might develop in which Local 282\u2019s secondary purpose would be other than work reassignment. Alternatively, the Board might finally adjudicate the claim under \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D) \u2014thereby dissolving the injunction \u2014 before reaching the claim under \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B). In either case, an injunction against \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B) violations would have a different effect than one against \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D) violations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b530-13\">. Although Local 282 filed no notice of cross appeal, it would have us review and reverse Judge Weinstein\u2019s finding of reasonable cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>to believe the union had violated \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D). Because of the union\u2019s failure to comply with F.R.A.P. 4, this issue is not properly before us. In any event, the record amply supports the district court\u2019s finding that Local 282, in striking and picketing against Brady, sought to coerce an employer to assign particular work to members of a particular union. Thus, there was reasonable cause to believe there had been a violation of \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b531-13\">. On appeal, the question whether there is reasonable cause to believe an unfair labor practice has been committed is one of law \u2014 subject to appellate review. See <em>Danielson v. Joint Board of Coat, Suit &amp; Allied Garment Workers Union, </em>494 F.2d 1230, 1244 (2d Cir. 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b532-8\">. We note that, since the time Judge Weinstein entered his order, an Administrative Law Judge has reviewed the record and issued an opinion finding that Local 282 violated \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B) when it struck against Brady. <em>Local 282, IBT (Active Fire Sprinkler Corp.), </em>JD-164-78 (March 22, 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\">. The Board urges us to extend the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis to give the NLRB the exclusive right so to assign work tasks. We need not decide whether there ever may be circumstances in which a district court may temporarily assign work over which there is a dispute, as we hold only that these are not such circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
