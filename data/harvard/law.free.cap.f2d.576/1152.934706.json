He used the name of Charles Townsend, an acquaintance, and rented the car with an American Express card issued to Townsend. Though Edwards had previously visited Townsend in Oklahoma, Townsend testified that he had not given the driver\u2019s license or credit card to Edwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-27\">On June 1, 1977, Edwards returned from Mexico at El Paso when he was stopped by a border guard. At first he claimed to be Townsend but later he admitted his real identity. The defendant, his three fellow passengers and the car were searched. The guard found the Hertz rental agreement in the glove compartment and Edwards\u2019 real driver\u2019s license in the boot of one of the passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-28\">Defendant was tried and convicted below for violation of the Dyer Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312 (interstate transportation of stolen vehicle). He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-29\">\n<em>The Comment on Edwards\u2019 Silence.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-30\">In his closing argument the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>But look, the point is, ladies and gentlemen, when he did finally fess up to the fact that he was the man in this driver\u2019s license here, did he even tell them hey\u2014 when they also found Government\u2019s Exhibit No. 1 [the rental contract] in his glove compartment, did he say, \u201cHey, wait a minute, let me tell you what the story is. I got this car a month ago over in Atlanta, Ga. I\u2019ve been down visiting relatives . . . .\u201d or whatever reasonable explanation he might have, did he give it to them? No way. Not to this good day. No way. Remember that ladies and gentlemen, there was no reasonable explanation given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">At this point defense counsel objected to the prosecutor\u2019s statement on the ground that it was a reference to Edwards\u2019 failure to testify \u2014 not that it was a reference to defendant\u2019s silence at arrest. The judge immediately instructed the jury that defendant was under no obligation to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-6\">Were these statements by the prosecutor a reference to defendant\u2019s silence? A comment is deemed to be such a reference if either (1) it was the prosecutor\u2019s manifest intention to refer to the defendant\u2019s silence, or (2) the remark was of such a character that the jury would \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d take it to be a comment on defendant\u2019s silence. <em>See United States v. Rochan, </em>563 F.2d 1246, 1249 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-7\">Despite the apparent sense of the prosecutor\u2019s statements, the government contends that they were not a reference to Edwards\u2019 silence but rather a permissible reference to the standard presumption, indulged in in Dyer Act cases, that in the absence of some reasonable explanation a jury may infer knowledge that a vehicle was stolen from the fact that defendant was found in possession of it shortly after the time it was, in fact, stolen. We have construed comments on the absence of a reasonable explanation in this manner, e. <em>g., United States </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>552 F.2d 1080 (5th Cir. 1977), but we think the contention somewhat far-fetched when made on the facts of this case. Defendant\u2019s knowledge that the car was stolen was not at issue in the trial. The evidence showed conclusively that he had \u201crented\u201d the car and been in continuous possession of it. Whatever the facts about its \u201cstolenness\u201d might be, it was undisputed that Edwards knew them; he was their architect. There was no occasion to draw inferences from Edwards\u2019 mere possession of \u201cstolen\u201d property. Once the factfinder concluded the car was stolen its inquiry,, on these facts, was at an end. Edwards was the thief. Given these circumstances and the content of the remarks themselves, then, we think it fairly clear that the prosecutor meant his comments as remarks on defendant\u2019s silence upon arrest and perhaps also on his failure to take the stand. (\u201cNot to this good day\u201d). At all events, it seems the jury would \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d so interpret them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-9\">With limited exceptions not applicable here, it is the rule that a prosecutor may not comment on a defendant\u2019s silence at arrest. <em>See Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 468 n. 37, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966); <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>565 F.2d 900 (5th Cir. 1978). <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976), prohibits the use of such evidence even to impeach a defendant\u2019s testimony at trial. Such comments may constitute plain error, <em>United States v. Henderson, supra </em>at 905, and a judge\u2019s cautionary instruction will not suffice to cure the error. <em>United States v. Hale, </em>422 U.S. 171, 95 S.Ct. 2133, 45 L.Ed.2d 99 (1975); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Henderson, supra. </em>Thus, defendant\u2019s failure to object on these grounds does not preclude review. Moreover, most of these observations apply equally to comments on the defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand, and defendant raised a timely objection on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-10\">Even though it appears that the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were violated by the prosecutor\u2019s comments on his silence at arrest and his failure to testify, such violations need not lead to reversal if harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>547 F.2d 1240 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 908, 97 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>1705, 52 L.Ed.2d 393 (1977). The prosecutor\u2019s comments, insofar as they went to defendant\u2019s silence on arrest, arose in an unusual setting. Usually such comments come where defendant has given an exculpatory story at trial and the prosecutor seeks to raise doubts about its veracity by suggesting that if it were true defendant would have told it to the police upon his arrest. Here Edwards did not take the stand. The story that the prosecutor suggests defendant might have given the border guard, \u2014 that he had rented the car, etc. \u2014 is exactly what the prosecutor\u2019s evidence at trial proved had occurred, i. e., that defendant had rented the car with Townsend\u2019s identification and credit card. But the prosecutor\u2019s further comment that no reasonable explanation was given suggests that if defendant had an exculpatory story to tell he would have given it to the border guard. His further arguable comment that defendant had not testified at trial, the \u201cnot to this very day\u201d remark, suggests that defendant\u2019s failure to testify meant he had no exculpatory story to give. Thus, the comments, taken as a whole, were undoubtedly prejudicial. Whether they were so prejudicial as to make the \u201charmless error\u201d doctrine inapplicable depends on the strength of the evidence against defendant. To this we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-5\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-6\">Edwards contends that the car was not really stolen because Hertz had not been deprived of any of the beneficial uses of ownership. In support of this contention, he argues, and the record shows, that Hertz had not reported the car as stolen when he was arrested and that Hertz did not consider the car to be stolen, merely overdue. However, since the question is not how Hertz viewed the matter, but whether Edwards exceeded the scope of the rental agreement, this contention is merit-less. <em>See United States v. Richards, </em>425 F.2d 432 (5th Cir. 1970). Similarly, his exceeding the scope of the rental agreement would support a jury finding that he intended to steal the car. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>488 F.2d 688 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-7\">Defendant also argues that there was no direct evidence that the rental price for the full time defendant had the car had not been paid. The government does not strenuously contend otherwise but suggests that Townsend\u2019s testimony that he would have paid the bill had defendant asked him to is sufficient to support an inference that the bill had in fact not been paid. We think it more properly supports an inference that <em>Townsend </em>had not paid it and little if anything further. Defendant\u2019s third contention is that there was no conclusive evidence that the rental contract, which expired 23 days before defendant\u2019s arrest, had not been extended by agreement of defendant and Hertz. A Hertz employee testified that the contract bore no notation to indicate that it had been extended but that it was possible that defendant had called in on a weekend to extend the contract. If defendant had done so, no notation of the extension would have been made on the contract because on weekends Hertz personnel do not have access to the contracts. These latter contentions would require the government to prove a negative and any doubt which they raised might properly have been seen by the jury as not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-8\">In sum, although the evidence is somewhat thin, it is sufficient to support the conviction. However, the weakness of the evidence makes it impossible to view the prosecutor\u2019s comments on Edwards\u2019 silence as harmless error, as we might do were the evidence stronger. The prosecutor by his comments brought the defendant\u2019s silence upon arrest and at trial to the attention of the jury, apparently intending to shore up his less-than-overwhelming evidence by leading the jury to make inferences of guilt from defendant\u2019s silence. We must therefore reverse. In so doing we note that the comment upon silence of the accused is a crooked knife and one likely to turn in the prosecutor\u2019s hand. The circumstances under which it will not occasion a reversal are few and discrete. We suggest that it be abandoned as a prosecutorial technique.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-9\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
