BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b105-17\">Bernard Stewart was convicted by a jury of burglarizing a Federal Credit Union in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(a). He was given a three-year sentence. Stewart appeals from the denial of a motion to suppress a confession he signed after having been given incomplete <em>Miranda </em>warnings. That confession, read in full to the jury after two timely objections, contained not only a step-by-step account of the burglary, but also an admission of a prior conviction for armed robbery. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-18\">\n<em>Suppression Hearing And Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b105-19\">The suppression hearing was held just before the trial began. Agent Worochock of the Office of Naval Intelligence, who had conducted the interrogation and had typed the confession, testified to the circumstances under which Stewart\u2019s statement was recorded.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Asked if Stewart was free to go during the interrogation, Worochock said, \u201cNo.\u201d Tr. 42.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The confession read in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-20\">I, Bernard Stewart . . . have been advised by Special Agent . Worochock .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-22\">(1) That I have the right to remain silent and make no statement at all;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-23\">(2) That any statement I do make may be used as evidence against me in a Court of Law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-24\">(3) That I have the right to consult with a lawyer, if I desire;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-25\">(4) That I have the right to have my lawyer present during this interview; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>(5) That I am not in custody, and that I am free to leave or terminate this interview at any time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Stewart initialed each numbered item. It is undisputed that he was never advised that he had a right , to have an attorney present during the interrogation and that counsel would be appointed for him before the hearing if he was unable to afford one.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">At the conclusion of the testimony, the District Court, in denying the motion to suppress, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">Gentlemen, <em>I don\u2019t really want any argument. I think I am relatively familiar with the controlling law.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">The Court finds that the warnings required by Miranda were given; that the defendant <em>knowingly </em>and <em>intelligently waived </em>his privilege against self-incrimination and to have an attorney present; that he <em>voluntarily </em>and <em>intelligently waived his rights to have </em>retained or <em>appointed counsel present at any interrogation </em>and that any statement or confession made by him was freely and voluntarily given. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Tr. 44 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Agent Worochock thereafter testified before the jury during the government\u2019s casein-chief. As government counsel proposed to publish<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the confession to the jury, this exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">MR. KAPLAN: Your Honor, I would object to the introduction of the statement <em>on two grounds.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-11\">I would like to approach the Bench. THE COURT: I am going to overrule the objection, and I am going to admit the document in evidence as Government\u2019s Exhibit No. 1, and permit counsel, if he wishes, to publish it to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUP\">Tr. 56 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">As Worochock was reading the confession to the jury, the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-15\">[WOROCHOCK]: \u201c * * * The crowbar, screwdriver, cloth sack and money from the cash box have been recovered from the room where he [Stewart\u2019s accomplice] and I were hiding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-17\">\u201cI was convicted \u2014 \u25a0\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-18\">MR. KAPLAN: Objection to the publication of the next sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-19\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-20\">A \u201cI was convicted and sentenced for armed robbery in Key West during 1975. As a result of that conviction I served fifteen months in Lake Butler, Florida, penitentiary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-21\">\u201cI have read, understand, and initialed all corrections in the foregoing statements, which consist of two typewritten pages, typed in my presence and at my request by Mr. Worochock, and swear that it is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\u201d /s/ Bernard Stewart.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-22\">THE COURT: Just a moment, please.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-23\">Ladies and gentlemen, that part which the agent read about this defendant\u2019s prior conviction has nothing whatsoever to do with his guilt or innocence in this particular case. And so, in determining that, you are to disregard it. It has evidentiary value only if the defendant should take the stand. If he takes the stand and testifies, then it is a matter which affects his credibility. Otherwise, in arriving at your decision as to his guilt or innocence in this particular matter, you are to disregard that prior conviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-24\">\n<em>Double Whammy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b106-25\">In <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>1966, 384 U.S. 436, 472-73, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1626-27, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, the Supreme Court discussed the necessity for ensuring that Fifth Amendment safeguards were made available to indigents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>If an individual indicates that he wishes the assistance of counsel before any interrogation occurs, the authorities cannot rationally ignore or deny his request on the basis that the individual does not have or cannot afford a retained attorney. The financial ability of the individual has no relationship to the scope of the rights involved here. The privilege against self-incrimination secured by the Constitution applies to all individuals. The need for counsel in order to protect the privilege exists for the indigent as well as the affluent. In fact, were we to limit these constitutional rights to those who can retain an attorney, our decisions today would b\u00e9 of little significance. The eases before us as well as the vast majority of confession cases with which we have dealt in the past involve those unable to retain counsel. While authorities are not required to relieve the accused of his poverty, they have the obligation not to take advantage of indigence in the administration of justice. Denial of counsel to the indigent at the time of interrogation while allowing an attorney to those who can afford one would be no more supportable by reason or logic than the similar situation at trial and on appeal struck down in <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), and <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>California, </em>372 U.S. 353, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-5\"><em>Miranda </em>also established the rule that the warnings required and the waiver necessary to accord with its standards were \u201cprerequisites to the admissibility of any statement made by a defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 476, 86 S.Ct. at 1629. \u201c[Ujnless and until such warnings . are demonstrated by the prosecution at trial, no evidence obtained as a result of interrogation can be used against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479, 86 S.Ct. at 1630.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">It is true that the absolutism of the last-quoted statement has been somewhat diluted. In <em>Harris v. New York, </em>1971, 401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1, the Court held that statements given to the police without a warning that the defendant was entitled to appointed counsel could be used to impeach the defendant\u2019s direct testimony at trial. But the Court added, <em>\u201cMiranda </em>barred the prosecution from making its case with statements of an accused made while in custody prior to having or effectively waiving counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224, 91 S.Ct. at 645. <em>See also Oregon v. Hass, </em>1975, 420 U.S. 714, 95 S.Ct. 1215, 43 L.Ed.2d 570 (inculpatory information, given after full <em>Miranda </em>warnings and defendant\u2019s request to call attorney, held admissible solely for impeachment purposes after defendant takes the stand and testifies to the contrary). In <em>Michigan v. Tucker, </em>1974, 417 U.S. 433, 94 S.Ct. 2357, 41 L.Ed.2d 182, the testimony of a third party identified in defendant\u2019s exculpatory statement without a warning of his right to appointment of counsel if he was indigent was held admissible when the interrogation took place <em>prior to, </em>but the trial occurred after, the <em>Miranda </em>decision. Despite this dilution, we know of no case in which the Supreme Court has sanctioned the admissibility of a defendant\u2019s in-custody confession<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>government\u2019s case-in-chief in the absence of <em>full </em>warnings or a showing of effective waiver. Indeed, the Court in <em>Tucker, supra, </em>premised the holding in part on the fact\u2014 reemphasized several times \u2014 that the defendant\u2019s own statements had been properly excluded from evidence. 417 U.S. at 448, 449, 450, 451, 452, 94 S.Ct. 2357.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In this connection, see the <em>post-Miranda </em>case of <em>Orozco v. Texas, </em>394 U.S. 324, 89 S.Ct. 1095, 22 L.Ed.2d 311. There the Court reversed a conviction for murder when a police officer related to the jury during the- government\u2019s case the defendant\u2019s incriminating statements which had been elicited by the police at the defendant\u2019s home without informing him of the rights to remain silent, to have a lawyer\u2019s advice before making a statement, and to have a lawyer appointed to assist him if he could not afford one.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Following <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>command, the Fifth Circuit \u2014 in a long line of cases \u2014 has reversed convictions when defendants\u2019 in-custody statements or confessions given in the absence of any one or all of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings have been admitted into evidence during a jury trial. <em>Fendley v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1967, 384 F.2d 923 (although defendant was informed of right to court-appointed counsel, he was not advised of right to have court-appointed counsel present during interrogation); <em>Windsor v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1968, 389 F.2d 530 (failure to advise of right to have a retained or appointed attorney present during interrogation); <em>Cook v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1968, 392 F.2d 219 (appropriate warning was not given, citing <em>Fendley, supra); Montoya v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1968, 392 F.2d 731 (failure to advise of right to have counsel provided before making the statements); <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1968, 391 F.2d 455 (failure to advise of right to presence of retained or appointed attorney during interrogation); <em>Lathers v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1968, 396 F.2d 524 (failure to advise of right to have attorney appointed and present before uttering a syllable); <em>Atwell v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1968, 398 F.2d 507 (failure to advise of right to counsel before and during interrogation); <em>Caparrosa v. Government of Canal Zone, </em>1969, 411 F.2d 956 (failure to advise of right to have counsel present during interrogation); <em>Agius v. United States, </em>5th Cir., 1969, 413 F.2d 915 (failure to give complete <em>Miranda </em>warnings); <em>Gilpin v. United States, </em>1969, 415 F.2d 638 (failure to advise of right to have attorney during interrogation); <em>Sanchez v. Beto, </em>1972, 5th Cir., 467 F.2d 513, <em>cert. denied, </em>1973, 411 U.S. 921, 93 S.Ct. 1548, 36 L.Ed.2d 314 (failure to advise of right to presence of retained or appointed attorney at the interrogation). <em>See also Harney v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1969, 407 F.2d 586 (effects of earlier invalid interrogation after inadequate <em>Miranda </em>warnings by state authorities not sufficiently dissipated by subsequent full warnings by FBI); <em>United States v. Castellana, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 500 F.2d 325, 327 (en banc) (statements by defendant prior to any <em>Miranda </em>warnings properly suppressed). As Judge Wisdom explained in <em>Gilpin, supra, </em>\u201c[fjailure of the interrogating officers to give all of the <em>Miranda </em>-bundle of warnings will destroy the voluntariness of the confession.\u201d 415 F.2d at 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">In the present case, the warning given was more deficient than that given in <em>Fendley, supra, </em>where the defendant was told that if he could not afford an attorney, one would be appointed for him when he went to court. Thus <em>Fendley </em>and the other cases cited would ordinarily require reversal. The District Court\u2019s finding \u2014 made, ironically, after a downright refusal to hear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>legal argument \u2014 that Stewart \u201cvoluntarily and intelligently waived his rights to have retained <em>or appointed </em>counsel present at any interrogation\u201d was obviously erroneous. As we stated in <em>Agius, supra, </em>the appellant of course \u201ccould not waive rights he knew nothing about.\u201d 413 F.2d at 916 n.l. On the record the Judge could credit there was not a stitch of evidence that Stewart knew or, for that matter, had ever heard from any source that he had these rights which the Judge declared as a <em>fact </em>he knowingly gave up.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">But quite apart from the amazingly detailed confession of the crime for which Stewart was tried, the confession also contained an admission of a prior conviction for armed robbery. Rule 404(b), Federal Rules of Evidence, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake. or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Evidence that the accused committed a pri- or criminal offense is inherently dangerous because of the likelihood that prejudice to the defendant may result from confusing the issues by leading the jury to infer that since the accused has committed a similar offense, he must have committed the crime for which he is on trial. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Turquitt, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 557 F.2d 464, 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Furthermore, evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior crimes is not rendered admissible because it was contained in a voluntary confession. <em>United States v. Stallings, </em>5 Cir., 1971, 437 F.2d 1057; <em>Sang Soon Sur v. United States, </em>9 Cir., 1948, 167 F.2d 431. <em>A fortiori </em>it could not be clothed with admissibility because it was born in a confession violative of <em>Miranda. </em>Stewart did not take the stand and thus neither his character nor credibility was placed in issue. The government does not seriously contend otherwise. Indeed, in a refreshing display of candor, the United States writes (brief at 9), \u201c[t]he Government recognizes the impropriety of presenting to a jury evidence of prior crimes such as was contained in defendant\u2019s confession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">Rather, the government\u2019s position on the appeal with regard to the admission of this double-whammied confession is that because there was overwhelming evidence of guilt, the reading before the jury constituted harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt under <em>Chapman v. California, </em>1967, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705. While cases of this Circuit recognize the appropriate application of the <em>Chapman </em>harmless error rule to <em>Miranda </em>violations<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and to erroneously admitted evidence of prior crimes,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the harmless error rule is of no avail to the government here.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-13\">The United States has boxed itself into an anomalous corner. First, it states that there was overwhelming evidence of guilt (brief at 6), opining that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s confession was merely a statement of the obvious.\u201d Next, it refers to the \u201cunfortunate inclusion of defendant\u2019s prior conviction.\u201d Brief at 9. Despite this apologia, it pleads <em>Chapman. </em>Had Stewart\u2019s confession really been a mere statement of the obvi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>ous, the government\u2019s determination to gild the lily by introducing it despite the motion to suppress and the timely objections defies comprehension, particularly because the Government knew that the demonstrable failure to assure counsel was constitutionally deficient. Risking affirmance on <em>Chapman </em>grounds is risky business. <em>See United States v. </em>Blair, 5 Cir., 1972, 470 F.2d 331, 338, <em>cert. denied, sub nom. Crews </em>v. <em>United States, </em>1973, 411 U.S. 908, 93 S.Ct. 1536, 36 L.Ed.2d 197 (Brown, C. J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">But apart from this anomalous position, we have more important concerns here. We are faced with what was clearly a trial which disregarded fundamental notions of fairness. As detailed earlier, the Trial Judge refused to hear legal argument on the motion to suppress the confession. When the time came for its offer, the Judge overruled \u2014 without even permitting defense counsel to state his two grounds \u2014 the objection to the confession. And even after the witness had gotten Stewart\u2019s \u201cI-was-convicted\u201d words before the jury, and after defense counsel quickly objected a second time, the District Judge again overruled the objection without allowing counsel to state the basis for that objection.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, the Court\u2019s hopelessly tardy attempt to unring the bell, to put the cat back in the bag, to deodorize the jury box of the skunk\u2019s presence, and to unsing the song (quoted in text, <em>supra, </em>at note 5), may well have caused the jury to be suspicious of Stewart\u2019s failure to take the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">All things considered, the treatment Stewart received at the hands of the United States (which, under its approach, did not need the double-barreled confession) <em>and </em>the District Judge (who denied defense counsel on three separate occasions an opportunity to prevent the Court from straying down the path to reversible error) does not comport with our sense of justice or the Due Process Clause. Although we do not rest our result on the constitutional basis, we find this trial unacceptable to our responsibility to exercise supervisory powers over the administration of justice in courts of this Circuit. See <em>United States v. Florea, </em>6 Cir., 1976, 541 F.2d 568, 572. We cannot, as the government urges, allow the <em>Chapman </em>harmless error rule to be a Monday-morning-quarterbacking appellate vehicle that justifies ignoring the plainest requirements of established constitutional and procedural principles as though they did not exist. <em>See United States v. Candelaria-Gonzalez, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 547 F.2d 291, 297-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\"><em>Miranda </em>has often been criticized as imposing too rigorous a requirement on law enforcement officers who, with the prey almost in hand, fail in some phase of the on-the-spot liturgy of <em>Miranda. </em>But we do not face a situation involving the actions of the officers on the ground. To be sure, the investigating officer made a mistake, undoubtedly a good faith mistake. But he could not commit the Government to pursue that mistake to the bitter end or to foreclose a means of correction. The prosecutor had to know that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were critically deficient. And yet the Government persisted in offering the confession. We are forced to conclude that despite the Government\u2019s awareness of the palpable, nonexcusable violations of <em>Miranda, </em>they presumed that this Court would excuse all with an admonition to go and sin no more. This would be the result of our finding harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">We do not review here the untutored policeman in hot pursuit who commits an error of constitutional law. This is <em>the </em>Government, through its sophisticated, supposedly informed legal representatives, deliberately imposing on the Trial Judge a position not necessary to the Government\u2019s case and for which \u2014 as the brief by the United States Attorney affirms \u2014 no legitimate basis existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">Our distress over the proceedings below does not rest solely on these events. The Government\u2019s errors did not stop there. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>With the prosecutor and the witness obviously having the confession in hand, the Government, in the face of the gasping objections of defense counsel, proceeded to read to the jury a recitation of a prior crime. Again the Government proceeded as though indifferent to established rules of almost constitutional origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">These Government tactics were made worse by the Trial Judge who would not listen to the earnest objections of defense counsel, cutting him off without even looking at the confession. The moment the Judge heard the awful words of the prior conviction he knew that this was not for the jury. And he told them so \u2014 after he overruled the objection to its publication. But alas! \u2014 this was not his role. The Judge had the duty to keep such information from the jury in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The errors here were not of the constable on the beat. They were those of the office of the United States Attorney, whose adversary contentions and approach dragged the Trial Judge into flagrant errors. If under these circumstances all can be washed out by a finding of \u201charmless error,\u201d prosecutors will be encouraged to urge that Judges should allow them to take indefensible paths, confident that we will forgive if not forget.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">A defendant who has had the sort of trial afforded here has not had the kind of hearing that we demand and that we cherish, no matter how overwhelming the indicia of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The conviction is reversed for a new, confessionless, and fundamentally fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-13\">.

The evidence which the prosecution successfully sought to introduce was not a confession of guilt by respondent, or indeed even an exculpatory statement by respondent, but rather the testimony of a third party who was subjected to no custodial pressures. There is plainly no reason to believe that Henderson\u2019s testimony is untrustworthy simply because <em>respondent </em>was not advised of <em>his </em>right to appointed counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF6\"><em>Id., </em>417 U.S. at 449, 94 S.Ct. at 2366 (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b109-9\">. <em>United States v.
