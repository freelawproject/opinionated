Davis, former warden of the Dauphin County Prison in Harrisburg, Pa., appeals from the judgment of sentence imposed following his conviction in a jury trial for a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The indictment on which he was tried charged that in numerous instances he solicited or accepted bribes \u201cas consideration for a decision, opinion, recommendation, vote and exercise of discretion as the Warden,\u201d contrary to 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4701(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to trial, Davis moved for the dismissal of the indictment both as time-barred and as failing to aver sufficient facts to give him notice of the charges against him. This motion was denied, the case was tried, and a verdict of guilty was returned. On appeal, Davis makes several contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-16\">I. THE TIME BAR</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-17\">RICO prohibits a person from engaging in a \u201cpattern racketeering activity.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c). \u201cRacketeering activity\u201d is defined, for purposes of this case, as bribery or extortion \u201cwhich is chargeable under State law and punishable for more than one year.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1)(A). Davis contends that prosecution for all the acts of bribery which the government charged and proved was barred by the relevant Pennsylvania statute ' of limitations. Because he contends that in RICO Congress intended to borrow state statutes of limitations for the predicate state offenses, Davis urges us to read the words \u201cchargeable under State law\u201d to mean \u201cpresently chargeable under State law.\u201d In <em>United States v. Forsythe, </em>560 F.2d 1127, 1134 (3d Cir. 1977), we held that the governing statute of limitations is found, not in state law, but in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-18\">Davis argues that <em>Forsythe </em>was incorrectly decided, but that in any event it did not explicitly reject a refinement of his argument which we should now accept. That refinement is that the word \u201cchargeable\u201d does more than refer to state statutes of limitations; it defines the federal of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>fense. An offense, in other words, that is not \u201cchargeable under State law\u201d is not indictable under RICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">It is true that <em>Forsythe </em>did not in so many words pass on this more refined argument, but we think it rejected it implicitly. The holding in <em>Forsythe </em>was that Congress intended to permit federal indictment within the time specified in \u00a7 3282 for offenses which, when committed, were \u201cchargeable under State law and punishable for more than one year.\u201d The last-quoted words were meant to limit RICO to serious offenses, offenses which in many but not all jurisdictions would be called felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">We now make explicit what was implicit in <em>Forsythe: </em>the words \u201cchargeable under State law\u201d in \u00a7 1961(1)(A) mean \u201cchargeable under State law at the time the offense was committed.\u201d Davis, therefore, has no ground for objecting to the timeliness of the indictment. We note, furthermore, that in this case three of the five acts of bribery which the government proved took place within the applicable state statute of limitations. Three acts of bribery make a pattern of racketeering activity. The relevant dates show that the pattern continued until well within even the state limitation. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 108. For this additional reason, the indictment against Davis was timely returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">II. VAGUENESS</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-8\">Davis\u2019s next argument is that the indictment did not give him fair warning of the offense with which he was charged. He acknowledges that it listed bribes in specific amounts from named individuals at designated times and places. But he claims that it failed to inform him of what precisely he was alleged to have done in return for each bribe. The indictment, which adopted almost verbatim the wording of 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4701(a)(1), charged that each bribe was received \u201cas consideration for a decision, opinion, recommendation, vote and exercise of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-12\">The short answer to Davis\u2019s argument is that the gravamen of the offense defined in \u00a7 4701 is the solicitation or acceptance of a bribe, not the delivery of its <em>quid pro quo. </em>In an analogous case we have held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-13\">The essence of the crime here charged is the receiving of the money, not the quid pro quo received or promised for that money, and where the statutes use the disjunctive to describe the alternate means of committing the same statutory offense and only one crime is charged, the means of commission are permissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL4\"><em>United States v. Laverick, 348 </em>F.2d 708, 714 (3d Cir. 1965) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-14\">The government\u2019s position on appeal is that, because Davis did not object to the charge quoted in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he cannot now contend that the indictment should have specified the <em>quid pro quo. </em>We note that Davis did challenge the sufficiency of the indictment in a pretrial motion. For that reason, we do not rest our affirmance on Fed.R.Crim.P. 30. We hold instead that the indictment was sufficiently specific and that the charge was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-15\">III. EVIDENCE OF OTHER CRIMES</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-16\">In addition, Davis urges that the trial judge erred when he permitted witnesses Sedesche and Myers to testify concerning other crimes of a similar nature. We have recently reaffirmed the importance of avoiding the undue prejudice which arises from the admission of evidence concerning prior crimes which has little probative value for the issues being tried. <em>See United States v. Cook, </em>538 F.2d 1000 (3d Cir. 1976). In this case, however, the testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>mony of Sedesche and Myers was relevant to Davis\u2019s motive or intent in accepting the money tendered. The evidence was, therefore, admissible under Fed.R.Ev. 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">IV. MOTION FOR JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">Davis\u2019s final contention is that his motion for a judgment of acquittal should have been granted. In light of the record, this contention is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-7\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1120-11\">. Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Pub.L.

I agree that at the time of the original indictment on June 1, 1977 and the superseding indictment on July 13, 1977, at least three incidents of bribery constituted acts \u201cchargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for mpre than one year\u201d. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1)(A). And with the majority I agree that these acts constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, sufficient to sustain a conviction under the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-10\">I part company with my brothers of the majority on a philosophical note only, a note that does not affect the outcome of our decision, but nevertheless reflects an important difference in interpreting a federal criminal statute widely used by the Department of Justice. I would hold that the acts of bribery occurring in 1972 and 1974<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> should not have been considered as \u201cracketeering activity\u201d under a 1977 federal indictment based on \u00a7 1961(1)(A) because these acts were no longer chargeable and punishable under Pennsylvania law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-12\">\n<em>I.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-13\">Under the federal statutory schema, the essential elements of a racketeering offense require an analysis of both federal and state law. Thus, a pattern of racketeering is defined as \u201cat least two acts of racketeering activity\u201d, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(5), and racketeering activity is defined (for the purposes of this case) as \u201cany act or threat involving . . . bribery which is chargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year . . . .\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-16\">The indictment alleged that the acts were violations of the Pennsylvania crime of bribery, proscribed in 18 P.S. \u00a7 4303 (prior to June 6, 1973), and 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4701(a). By the provisions of 19 P.S. \u00a7 211, prosecution of this state crime is barred after the passing of two years from the date of the commission of the alleged act. Nevertheless, Count II of the indictment averred acts occurring on or about May 3, 1972, and November 22, 1974. Clearly, even if \u201cchargeable\u201d under Pennsylvania law, these offenses were not \u201cpunishable\u201d in 1977, at the time of the federal indictment, because of the interposition of the state statute of limitations. Accordingly, I would hold that even applying the <em>federal </em>statute of limitations, <em>United States v. Forsythe, </em>550 F.2d 1127 (3d Cir. 1977), the essential ingredients of a <em>federal offense </em>were lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-17\">It is conceded that bribery of a state official is not a discrete offense under federal criminal statutes. It is equally clear to me that since the federal definitional statute requires that the racketeering offense be both chargeable <em>and </em>punishable under state law, the government could not, and did not, prove all the elements necessary under the federal statute. It was a simple case of legal impossibility of performance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">Although proper judicial interpretation of any federal statute is always important, proper judicial interpretation of a criminal statute is critical. The maxim <em>nullum crimen sine lege, nulla poena sine lege </em>reminds us that the courts may not punish conduct as criminal unless that conduct has transgressed the clear, plain, or fair meaning of the defined offense. In the federal courts, this means a congressionally defined offense, because there is no federal common law of crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">Nevertheless, an interesting notion is volunteered here that bribery activities which occurred in 1972 and 1974 can still fall within the congressional definition of racketeering in 1977, by declaring judicially that \u201cthe words \u2018chargeable under State law\u2019 in \u00a7 1961(1)(A) mean \u2018chargeable under State law at the time the offense was committed.\u2019 \u201d (At 1067). This is not statutory <em>interpretation </em>; it is statutory <em>construction </em>in the pristine fabricating sense. It is a judicial, not legislative, definition of criminal activity, a genre of statutory interpretation outlawed by a host of Supreme Court decisions. <em>See, e. g., Huddleston </em>v. <em>United States, </em>415 U.S. 814, 831, 94 S.Ct. 1262, 39 L.Ed.2d 782 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-7\">This semantic excursion ignores the precise language Congress utilized in \u00a7 1961(1)(A), to-wit, \u201cany act or threat involving . . . bribery . . . which <em>is </em>chargeable under State law . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added). The present tense of the copulative verb \u201cis\u201d was used. The use of the present tense indicates that this provision is to apply only to those acts chargeable and punishable at the time of the indictment. Had Congress intended otherwise it just as easily could have added \u201cwas or has been\u201d; indeed, Congress could have used the words the majority has added to the statute: \u201cis chargeable under State law <em>at the time the offense was committed.\u201d </em>But Congress did not add these words, and we cannot. We cannot, because to do so is to run counter to a basic tenet of interpretation of penal statutes, best evidenced by Mr. Justice Reed\u2019s statement in <em>United States v. Bramblett, </em>348 U.S. 503, 509, 75 S.Ct. 504, 508, 99 L.Ed. 594 (1954): \u201cThat criminal statutes are to be construed strictly is a proposition which calls for the citation of no authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-12\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-13\">Strict interpretation of a penal statute, of course, cannot be applied <em>in vacuo; </em>it cannot be utilized to thwart clearly expressed statutory text, or, in the event of ambiguity, the legislative purpose expressed in the statute or its legislative history. The reasoning and policy considerations guiding the interpretation of ambiguous statutory language were set out by Mr. Justice Marshall in <em>United States v. Bass, </em>404 U.S. 336, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-14\">[A]s we have recently reaffirmed, \u201cambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\u201d ... In various ways over the years, we have stated that \u201cwhen choice has to be made between two readings of what conduct Congress has made a crime, it is appropriate, before we choose the harsher alternative, to require that Congress should have spoken in language that is clear and definite.\u201d <em>United States v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp., </em>344 U.S. 218, 221-222 [, 73 S.Ct. 227, 97 L.Ed. 260] (1952). This principle is founded on two policies that have long been part of our tradition. First, \u201ca fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>derstand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed. To make the warning fair, so far as possible the line should be clear.\u201d <em>McBoyle v. United States, </em>283 U.S. 25, 27 [, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816] (1931) (Holmes, J.) See also <em>United States v. Cardiff, </em>344 U.S. 174 [, 73 S.Ct. 189, 97 L.Ed. 200] (1952). Second, because of the seriousness of criminal penalties, and because criminal punishment usually represents the moral condemnation of the community, legislatures and not courts should define criminal activity. This policy embodies \u201cthe instinctive distaste against men languishing in prison unless the lawmaker has clearly said they should.\u201d H. Friendly, Mr. Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes, in Benchmarks 196, 209 (1967).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">404 U.S. at 347-48, 92 S.Ct. at 522-523 (1971) (footnote and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">I have indicated that I find no ambiguity in the present tense descriptive language of those state offenses incorporated in \u00a7 1961(1)(A) as federal offenses. Assuming without conceding that there is ambiguity, my examination of the legislative history compels no contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">\n<em>A.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-7\">The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute (RICO) had as its genesis the Senate\u2019s Organized Crime Control Bill, introduced in early 1969. \u201cRacketeering activity\u201d was originally defined, in relevant part, as \u201cany act involving the danger of violence to life, limb, or property indictable under State or Federal law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.\u201d The Justice Department, however, took the position that the suggested language was \u201ctoo broad and would result in a large number of unintended applications, as well as tending toward a complete federalization of criminal justice.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It suggested that \u00a7 1961(1)(A) be redefined as follows: \u201cAny act or threat involving murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, usury, or dealing in narcotic drugs, marihuana or other dangerous drugs, which is indictable under State law and punishable for more than one year.\u201d The Department stated, \u201cIt is felt that by thus narrowing the definition of the class of applicable state crimes in terms of their generic meaning the definition of \u2018racketeering activity\u2019 contained in Section 1961(1)(A) will be both broad enough to include most state statutes customarily invoked against organized crime yet narrow enough to be constitutional. <em>United States v. Nardello, </em>393 U.S. 286, 89 S.Ct. 534, 21 L.Ed.2d 487 (1969).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-10\">The Senate accepted the gist of the Justice Department\u2019s recommendations in its final passage of the crime control bill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApQ\">\u00a7 1961(1). \u201c[Racketeering activity\u201d means (A) any act or threat involving murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, or dealing in narcotic or other dangerous drugs, which is chargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1124-11\">S.Rep.No. 91-617, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 21 (1969). The bill was subsequently favorably considered in hearings before SubCommittee No. 5 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., and, with minor amendments, was eventually enacted as the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, P.L. 91-452, 84 Stat. 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-12\">\n<em>B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-13\">From this legislative history, I draw several significant conclusions. The Justice Department\u2019s request that the statutory definition not be \u201ctoo broad\u201d was respected: state crimes were defined in \u201cterms of their generic meaning\u201d and federal crimes were defined with specificity in \u00a7 1961(1)(B). The Senate Committee report noted that \u201c[t]he state offenses are included by generic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>designation,\u201d Senate Report, <em>supra, </em>at 158, and the House Committee stated that \u201c \u2018[racketeering activity\u2019 is defined in terms of specific State and Federal criminal statutes\u201d, and that \u201cState offenses are included by generic designation.\u201d 1970 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 4010, 4032.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\">Congress therefore can be said to have heeded the Justice Department\u2019s admonition to avoid \u201ca large number of unintended applications\u201d and \u201ca complete federalization of criminal justice.\u201d Therefore, \u00a7 904 of Title IX of P.L. 91-452, which provided that \u201c[t]he provisions of this title shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purpose,\u201d must be read in light of the language of the statute and the legislative history. And in viewing the legislative purpose, I detect nothing that precludes the application of the rule of narrow construction of penal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">\n<em>IV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">In sum, I find the statutory language to be clear. For a federal offense to exist, by definition there must also be a state offense. There was no federal offense here, because the acts had to be \u201cchargeable and punishable\u201d under state law. \u201cIf the language of a statute be plain, admitting of only one meaning, the Legislature must be taken to have meant and intended what it plainly expressed.\u201d <em>Reuther </em>v. <em>Trustees of Trucking Employees, </em>575 F.2d 1074 (3d Cir. No. 77-1986, 1978), <em>quoting </em>Lord Atkinson in <em>Vacher &amp; Sons, Ltd. v. London Society of Compositers, </em>[1913] A.C. 107, 121-22 (House of Lords). \u201cIf the language be clear it is conclusive. There can be no construction where there is nothing to construe.\u201d <em>United States v. Hartwell, </em>73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 385, 396, 18 L.Ed. 830 (1868).</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">And even assuming that there is ambiguity, we must resort to the principle that \u201cambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\u201d <em>United States v. Bass, supra. </em>In view of the statute\u2019s text and its history, especially the congressional acquiescence in the Justice Department\u2019s request to narrow the definition of state offenses, the application of the traditional principle of strict construction of this penal statute effectuates, rather than defeats, the obvious legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-10\">For all these reasons, I would hold that where one has been acquitted of a state offense, <em>see, e. g., United States v. Frumento, supra, </em>(Aldisert, J., dissenting), or where, as here, prosecution of a state offense is outlawed by a state statute of limitations at the time of the federal indictment, there is no generic state crime \u201cchargeable and punishable under State law,\u201d and there cannot be a federal offense under \u00a7 1961(1)(A).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1122-11\">.
