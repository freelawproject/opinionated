Upon consideration thereof, since the court agrees with the trial judge\u2019s recommended decision, with a minor modification, as hereinafter set forth, it hereby affirms and adopts the recommendeji decision, as modified, as the basis for its judgment in this case. Therefore, it is concluded that plaintiff is not entitled to recover and, accordingly, plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied, defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment is granted and plaintiff\u2019s petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">OPINION OF TRIAL JUDGE <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">SPECTOR, Trial Judge: This contract case originates in an Invitation for Bids (IFB) issued by the Department of the Army on September 28, 1971, for the procurement of 22,324,100 M48A3 fuzes. It is important to a decision in this case to observe that funds for the entire quantity had been authorized before the IFB was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">One-half of this quantity (11,162,050) was designated as a so-called labor surplus area set-aside. The non set-aside portion was scheduled to be awarded first.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">The IFB invited prospective bidders to purpose unit prices on any or all of specified quantities, within certain ranges, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-16\">Range A, 3.000. 000 to 4,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGZa\">Range B, 4.000. 001 to 5,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azs\">Range C, 5.000. 001 to 6,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtX\">Range D, 6.000. 001 to 7,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ami\">Range E, 7.000. 001 to 8,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvE\">Range F, 8.000. 001 to 9,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQcS\">Range G, 9.000. 001 to 10,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjA\">Range H, 10.000. 001 to 11,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKK\">Range I, 11.000. 001 to 12,000,000</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-26\">Award of the non set-aside portion (which is directly involved in this case) was further governed by the following \u201caward note:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APP\">Selection of the successful offeror or offerors for the non set-aside will be made on the basis of the lowest price (after all appropriate evaluation) for a single award <em>or multiple awards. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-27\">Deliveries were scheduled to be made in 12 approximately equal monthly installments, beginning in February 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-28\">The dispute herein centers around a reservation in the IFB, affording the Government an option to increase the quantities awarded, in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-29\">The Government reserves the right to increase the quantity of each Range awarded by a quantity of up to and including, but not exceeding 50% and at the price specified in the schedule or at the Price(s) quoted below, whichever is lower, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>unless a lower unit price is negotiated in consideration of the increased quantities. Delivery of the items to be added by the exercise of this option provision <em>may be made concurrent </em>with or follow immediately after deliveries called for under this contract. Production on a concurrent basis shall not exceed 50% of the maximum monthly schedule of the basic award. The Contracting Officer may exercise this option at any time prior to 30 Nov 72 by giving written notice to the Contractor. Subject to the limitations contained in this paragraph, the Government may exercise this option <em>on one or more occasions. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">On the procedure to be followed in evaluating bids, the IFB further provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW9R\">If the Government elects <em>to exercise an option simultaneously with award, </em>bids or proposals will be evaluated for purposes of award on the basis of the total price for the basic quantity and the option quantity exercised with award. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Plaintiff was one of nine bidders responding to the IFB. Its prices within each range were the same for both the basic and option quantities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">Range A 3,000,000 to 4,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">Rail $1.255</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">Motor 1.251</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">Range B 4,000,001 to 5,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-10\">Rail $1.252</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-11\">Motor 1.248</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-12\">Range C 5,000,001 to 6,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-13\">Rail $1.240</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-14\">Motor 1.236</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-15\">Range D 6,000,001 to 7,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-16\">Rail $1.236</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-17\">Motor 1.232</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-18\">Range E 7,000,001 to 8,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-19\">Rail $1.396</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-20\">Motor 1.392</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-21\">Range F 8,000,001 to 9,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-22\">Rail $1.394</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-23\">Motor 1.390</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-24\">Range G 9,000,001 to 10,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-25\">Rail $1.389</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-26\">Motor 1.385</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-27\">Range H 10,000,001 to 11,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7qa\">Rail $1.389</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A76\">Motor 1.385</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adq\">Range I 11,000,001 to 12,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATG\">Rail $1.389</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZa\">Motor 1.385</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-37\">The price jump at Range E is significant. It represents the point at which plaintiff would have had to acquire additional tooling and floor space to produce quantities in excess of Range D.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-38\">Plaintiff was at the time of bidding in agreement with the Government\u2019s interpretation of the option clause above-quoted, to this extent at least. It acknowledges that the clause gives the Government the right to require delivery of a 50 percent option quantity <em>concurrently </em>with the base award, <em>if </em>efforts to award the basic quantity have been exhausted. Accordingly, it was within plaintiff\u2019s contemplation that it could be awarded a Range F (8,000,001 to 9,000,000) quantity at a Range D (6,000,001 to 7,000,-000) price, by award of an option quantity equal to the difference between the two ranges.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-39\">By bidding in all ranges, for example, plaintiff was risking award to it of the full 11,162,050 non set-aside quantity, plus an option quantity of up to 5,581,025 (one-half of 11,162,050), or a total of 16,743,075 fuzes, all for delivery in 12 monthly installments. It is very doubtful that plaintiff could have produced that quantity within the required time. Testimony before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (on appeal from an adverse contracting officer\u2019s decision) indicates plaintiff was gambling that the Government would limit any award to a particular contractor\u2019s capacity, as determined in a preaward survey to be conducted by the Government. The Government did thereafter conduct such a survey, and fpund that plaintiff\u2019s capacity was 758,000 units per month, or a 12-month capacity of slightly over 9 million units.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>After opening of the bids, the Government conducted a price analysis to determine what award or combination of awards would result in the lowest total cost to the Government.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The analysis was conducted with awareness of the fact that no bidder had the capability of producing the entire 11,162,050 non set-aside quantity, so that at least two awards would be required to procure that quantity. Since the minimum awardable quantity under the IFB was 3 million (Range A), the maximum quantity awardable to plaintiff was 8,162,050. This quantity fell within Range F, for which plaintiffs bid of $1,394 (shipment by rail) was low. However, noting the price jump at Range E, the Government chose to award plaintiff a total of 8,162,050 by awarding it the maximum number (7 million) at its Range D price of $1,236 (rail), plus a simultaneous quantity of 1,162,050 for concurrent delivery at the same price, under the \u201coption\u201d clause above-quoted. Plaintiff\u2019s Range D price was also low for that range. The contracting officer considered this to be a proper and permissible exercise of the option provision. Plaintiff\u2019s argument is essentially that it represented sharp practice, not contemplated by the IFB in evaluating bids for the <em>basic, </em>fully-funded quantity to be procured. For example, \u201c(n)owhere in this award are bidders informed that Range B is really Range A plus fifty (50%) per cent of Range B. * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The remaining 3 million units of the non set-aside quantity were then awarded to Walter Kidde &amp; Co. at its Range A price of $1.24. The Government\u2019s price analyst testified that had the option provision been deemed unavailable for procuring the basic quantity of 11,162,050 units, then 7 million units would have been awarded to plaintiff at the Range E price, and 4,162,050 to Walter Kidde at $1.24 (which was also its Range B price). This would have produced the second most economical award combination from the standpoint of the Government. This combination would have cost the Government far less than an award of 8.162.050 to plaintiff at its Range F price, coupled with a 3 million unit award to Walter Kidde at its Range A price.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">When plaintiff learned in December 1971 that it was being awarded a Range F quantity at a Range D price, its representative telephoned the contracting officer for an explanation. Plaintiff was advised that the 1.162.050 portion was an \u201coption\u201d quantity, and that award in this manner was \u201cin the best interest of the Government.\u201d Plaintiff did not protest further at this time because it believed that exercise of the option had occurred only after award of the entire basic quantity and that the award as made, therefore constituted the exercise of what it at that time regarded as a \u201clegal option.\u201d In plaintiff\u2019s view, an \u201coption\u201d could be exercised only if the entire 22,324,100 units (both set-aside and non set-aside) had been awarded. It believed that only amounts in excess of the entire 22,324,100 units were \u201coption\u201d amounts that could be awarded under the option provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">This belief on the part of plaintiff was based on the fact, noted at the beginning of this opinion, that the 22 million fuzes were firm, fully-funded requirements, and the additional important fact that section 1\u2014 1503(b) of the Armed Services Procurement Regulations (ASPR), prohibited the use of \u201coption\u201d clauses for procurement of firm, fully-funded requirements, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A46\">Option provisions and clauses shall <em>not </em>be included in contracts when\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-14\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-15\">(v) the option quantities represent <em>known firm requirements for which </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number><em>procurement funds are available. * </em>* [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Nevertheless, plaintiff did not inquire as to whether the entire 22 million fuzes had been awarded prior to exercise of the option, or whether in the alternative the option quantity was part of a firm, fully-funded requirement. In any event, the Government representatives made no misrepresentation as to those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">As earlier stated, on December 7, 1971, plaintiff was awarded a contract to produce 8.162.050 fuzes at a price of $1.236. The contract explained that the total quantity awarded included the exercise of an option for concurrent delivery, in the amount of 1.162.050 fuzes.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">By letter of January 13, 1972, the Government notified plaintiff of all other awards made under the IFB up to that time. The letter stated, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">d. Name of firms receiving awards, prices, and quantities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-10\">\n<em>Contractor Unit Price Quantity</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahy\">\n<em>Non-Set-Aside Awards</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av4\">E. Walters Co., Inc. Elk Grove Village, 111. $1.236 8,162,050</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acd\">Walter Kidde &amp; Co., Inc. Belleville, New Jersey 1.24 3,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjS\"><em>Set-Aside Award </em>Keystone Micro-Scan, Inc. 1.20352 6,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeR\">Upon completion of the Set-Aside quantities you will be advised accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-17\">It became evident to plaintiff upon receipt of the January 13, 1972 letter that the option quantity awarded it was part of the 22 million firm, fully-funded basic quantity, and was not, therefore, what it had regarded as a \u201clegal option.\u201d It is noteworthy, however, that plaintiff did not protest the Government\u2019s use of the option provision at that time. Its representative elected to remain silent, and to postpone any protest, due to fear that a protest at that time would bring \u201cthe wrath of the Government\u201d upon it, in light of delinquencies in delivery of which it was aware. Plaintiff does not contend, however, that its silence and its failure to protest was the product of any threats, intimidation or economic duress originating with Government representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-20\">When the Government was unable to award the remainder of the set-aside portion, it exercised the option provision in all three contracts awarded up to that time. Keystone received a maximum option of a 50 percent increase, <em>i. e., </em>3 million units. On February 23, 1972, plaintiff\u2019s quantity was increased by an additional option quantity of 937,500 fuzes, bringing its total award to slightly more than 9 million, that being its maximum capacity of 758,000 fuzes per month. Walter Kidde received the remainder of the set-aside quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-21\">It is noteworthy that plaintiff did not protest this second exercise of the option provision in its contract. Although the additional award still represented part of the basic 22 million firm, fully-funded quantity, plaintiff apparently does not protest this second exercise of the option clause because the Government had by then been unable to place the remainder of the set-aside portion, and had therefore been unable to fulfill its basic requirements without resort to options.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-22\">In September 1972, plaintiff first mentioned that it deserved its Range F price rather than its Range D price. This occurred at a meeting with the contracting officer that was primarily concerned with the subject of deliveries. Plaintiff did not, however, ask the Government to correct the price at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-23\">In December of 1973, 6 months after final deliveries under the contract had been completed, but before final payment, plaintiff made its first formal, written claim for an increase in the contract price to its Range F price of $1.394. The contracting officer issued a final decision denying plaintiff\u2019s claim on March 26, 1974, and plaintiff duly appealed to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-24\">Plaintiff\u2019s appeal was denied<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the grounds that any claims stemming from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Government\u2019s exercise of the option clause had been waived by performance without protest until after final delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Plaintiff urges here that the Government\u2019s initial use of the option provision violated both the letter and spirit of the ASPR provision as above-quoted, and that, therefore, plaintiff is entitled to recover losses resulting from the violation, namely, the difference between its Range <em>D </em>and Range F prices over the entire contract quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The argument is not valid. Granted that this use of the \u201coption\u201d provision was clearly prohibited by the procurement regulations, and for good and sufficient policy reasons,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the fact that a procurement practice is prohibited does not necessarily mean that it is therefore actionable. The discipline to be administered in such cases is a responsibility of the cognizant procurement officials within the agency in which the violation took place. It is not a type of discipline to be administered by this court, in the form of judgment for the party allegedly aggrieved by the violation of the' procurement regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">Were the provision in question susceptible to an interpretation rendering it in harmony with that procurement policy, such an interpretation would naturally be favored over an interpretation placing it in direct conflict with that expressed procurement policy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The \u201coption\u201d clause in this case, however, is not susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore the ASPR provision is of little help to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">Nor did plaintiff timely protest the exercise of the first option. The board opinion is correct in characterizing this silence until after final delivery, as a waiver.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By January 13, 1972, plaintiff knew of all awards made to that date. Any misunderstanding on plaintiff\u2019s part with regard to how defendant viewed the option clause, ended with receipt of the Government\u2019s letter specifying the award pattern. Testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>before the board indicates that plaintiff was aware that it had a possible claim for the difference between the Range D and Range F price soon after the arrival of that letter. But it chose to remain silent, to postpone any protest, and to fully perform the contract as if there were contemporaneous agreement of the parties on the proper interpretation of the terms of the IFB. Plaintiff\u2019s telephone inquiry in December 1971 as to why it had received a Range F quantity at a Range D price was insufficient, without more, to constitute a formal protest. Similarly plaintiff\u2019s mere \u201cmentioning\u201d in September 1972 that it deserved the Range F price was insufficient and, in any event, was too late. By that time, the Government had been prejudiced in consideration of other alternatives. No recognizable and formal protest was forthcoming until December 1973, 2 years after the letter of award, and approximately 6 months after final delivery under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">In these circumstances, the doctrine of estoppel is also for application. Had plaintiff protested the use of the option provision at the time of award, defendant would have been in a position to either reaffirm its use of the option provision, in apparent disregard of the ASPR prohibition, with the further knowledge that it could later be faced with a claim for the Range F price, at an additional cost of over $1 million; or it could have elected instead, to award the non set-aside quantity in the next least expensive manner, as previously discussed. This would have consisted of an award of 7 million units to plaintiff at its Range D price, and of 4,162,050 units to Walter Kidde at a price of $1.24. That combination of awards was only about $5000 above the combination actually employed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s silence deprived the Government of that relatively painless alternative.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This case is analogous to those in which it is found that the Government is presumed to have elected not to terminate a delinquent contractor for default, because it permitted the due date to pass in silence and without action, thereby encouraging the contractor to continue performance and to incur additional costs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">All of the foregoing considered, it is determined that the board\u2019s findings of the relevant facts are supported by substantial evidence in its record, and that its conclusions on the legal issues are correct. Plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied, defendant\u2019s cross-motion is granted, and the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-30\"> The trial judge\u2019s recommended decision and conclusion of law are submitted in accordance with Rule 166(c). The necessary facts are stated in the opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-40\">. Plaintiff now argues that the Government\u2019s surveys found it capable of producing the entire 11,162,050 units. It directs attention to the following statement in the \u201cRemarks\u201d box of \u201cSection III Factors to be Investigated and Investigation Results\u201d in the November 12 and 23, 1971 surveys: \u201cCapability to perform in all ranges bid.\u201d The board found, however, that the Government\u2019s surveys determined plaintiff\u2019s capacity to be 758,000 units per month. There are statements to this effect in the reports. Therefore, and because the statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>plaintiff refers to is ambiguous as to whether it was a \u201cfactor to be investigated,\u201d or a \u201cresult of investigation,\u201d it is concluded that the board\u2019s finding on this point is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b419-8\">. As the \u201caward note\u201d earlier quoted provides, multiple awards to achieve lowest overall price were contemplated by the IFB. Thus, even if plaintiff had the capacity of producing all 11,-162,050 units, it could have expected award of that quantity only if its price for Range I was less than that of any other possible combination of awards to the various bidders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b420-18\">. 76-1 BCA * 11,767. Plaintiff seeks review against the standards set forth in the Wunderlich Act, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 321-22 (1970). The petition also seeks reformation and a trial on that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>issue, which was beyond the board\u2019s jurisdiction. In its present motion, the reformation issue is not mentioned, and argument is limited to an attack on the legal conclusions in the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b421-8\">. ASPR sections l-1503(b) and 1-1506 (now 7-104-27). The board finds those sections to be clearly inconsistent with the procurement procedures followed here, and that \u201cthe clause itself is patently unfair to bidders, especially where, as here, concurrent delivery of the option quantities required expansion of facilities.\u201d The policy expressed in the ASPR is to deter contingency costs in proposals by prospective bidders, who are otherwise required to consider the additional cost of producing the base quantities. In addition, a bidder faced with the contingency of a concurrent \u201coption\u201d quantity, has this dilemma to contend with: Should he limit his bid for base quantities to an uneconomical portion of his capacity, in order to leave room for a possible additional \u201coption\u201d award; or bid to capacity, thus risking an \u201coption\u201d award in excess of capacity? When employed as here, to award base quantities by \u201coption,\u201d the provision has a potential for generating disputes, such as has occurred here. The board even suggests that use of the options clause may have been \u201cunlawful,\u201d but finds it unnecessary to decide that question. <em>See, G. L. Christian &amp; Associates v. United States, </em>312 F.2d 418, 160 Ct.Cl. 1, <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 954, 84 S.Ct. 444, 11 L.Ed.2d 314 (1963), which is cited by plaintiff on this issue. Defendant replies that the ASPR provision does not render use of the option provision illegal, because it \u201cis intended to protect the interests of the Government.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b421-16\">. For example, where a specification is written around the product of a specific manufacturer, in contravention of a procurement regulation prohibiting restrictive specifications, because they inhibit competition.

It is interesting to observe, however, that the board opinion finds the second sentence of the \u201coption\u201d clause susceptible to another interpretation.
