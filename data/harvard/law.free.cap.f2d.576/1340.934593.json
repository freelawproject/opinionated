But before the ensuing appeals were heard, this court remanded the matter to permit the district court judge to entertain several post-judgment motions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1396-7\">The parties then entered into a written agreement looking to the entry of a stipulated judgment settling the dispute. The formal agreement, following a recital that \u201cas used herein, the term \u2018540\u2019 shall be taken to mean an aircraft instrument covered by one or more of the claims of U.S. letters patent 3,043,540, 3,112,905 and 3,327,972,\u201d provided that plaintiff\u2019s patents numbered 540, 905 and 972 were valid and had been infringed; that defendants would pay plaintiff an agreed sum as damages in return for a complete release and settlement of all claims arising from the use, etc., of the patents, but with the proviso that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyY3\">\u201c10. Upon the expiration of patent 3,043,540, or if patent 3,043,540 is held invalid by a final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, which decision is unappealed or unappealable, United Control shall thereafter, provided two years have passed from date of this agreement, have the right to make, use and sell \u2018540\u2019 devices free of any charges or claims of infringement by Safe Flight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1396-12\">The district judge accepted the parties\u2019 stipulation and Settlement Agreement and rendered judgment accordingly, awarding plaintiff $2.5 million in damages and granting it a permanent injunction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1396-13\">The Washington suit was not the only litigation in which plaintiff was involved. In 1968, plaintiff filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, charging persons other than these defendants with infringement of its 540 patent. This latter suit was entirely separate from the one in Washington against defendants and was pending but untried when the parties in this suit entered into their Settlement Agreement. When the California suit was tried, the judge there held the 540 patent invalid. Upon appeal, we affirmed and certiorari was thereafter denied. <em>Safe Flight Instrument Corp. v. McDonnell-Douglas Corp., </em>482 F.2d 1086 (9th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1113, 94 S.Ct. 843, 38 L.Ed.2d 740 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-14\">Following these dispositions of the California suit and after more than two years had passed since the date of the parties\u2019 Settlement Agreement, defendants\u2019 successor in interest (Sundstrand) moved the Washington District Court to vacate its injunction. As grounds, defendants asserted that the contingency provided for in paragraph 10 of the Settlement Agreement had occurred and thus, to paraphrase the language of Rule 60(b)(5), F.R.Civ.P., it was no longer equitable to accord the injunction, entered pursuant to that agreement, further effect.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>The district judge, following a hearing, concluded that \u201cthe settlement agreement entered into by the parties on July 13, 1968, was the underlying basis upon which the Consent Judgment was presented to [the district judge] and signed that same date.\u201d He further concluded that, in light of paragraph 10 of the Settlement Agreement and the affirmance by the Court of Appeals of the final judgment entered in the California suit adjudicating the 540 patent invalid, the permanent injunction granted pursuant to the prior consent judgment was \u201cno longer necessary or valid, and is of no further force and effect.\u201d He entered an order vacating the injunction, but solely as to the 540 patent. Both parties have appealed\u2014 plaintiff from the partial vacation of the injunction and defendants from the refusal to vacate the injunction in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-4\">The power of a court of equity to vacate or otherwise modify the prospective effect of its decrees is too well-established to merit extended discussion. <em>State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling &amp; Belmont Bridge Co., </em>18 How. 421, 15 L.Ed. 435 (1855); 7 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice H 60.-16[6] and cases cited at n. 1. The power to effect such a modification, \u201cinherent in the jurisdiction of the chancery\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co., </em>286 U.S. 106, 114, 52 S.Ct. 460, 462, 76 L.Ed. 999 (1932)) is, as indicated, explicitly conferred on the district courts by the terms of subsection (b)(5) of Rule 60, F.R.Civ.P. Its exercise lies within the discretion of the trial court, guided by traditional principles of equity jurisprudence <em>(System Federation v. Wright, </em>364 U.S. 642, 648, 81 S.Ct. 368, 5 L.Ed.2d 349 (1961); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co., supra, </em>286 U.S. at 115, 52 S.Ct. 460) and a reviewing court will not disturb the trial court\u2019s disposition except upon demonstrated abuse <em>(Bank of America Nat\u2019l Trust &amp; Sav. Ass\u2019n v. Mamakos, </em>509 F.2d 1217 (9th Cir. 1975) and cases cited at 1219).</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-5\">The Settlement Agreement and other papers before the district court manifest the parties\u2019 formal recognition that the 540 patent might conceivably be declared invalid. That contingency having occurred in the course of the California suit, the district judge in the Washington suit did not abuse his discretion in granting defendants\u2019 application for post-judgment relief in order that the unmodified decree should not obstruct full effectuation of the parties\u2019 agreement and thereby be \u201cturned through changing circumstances into an instrument of wrong.\u201d <em>United States v. Swift &amp; Co., supra, </em>286 U.S. at 115, 52 S.Ct. at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-8\">Plaintiff vigorously contends that the district judge, in granting defendants Rule 60(b)(5) relief on the basis of the judgment in the California suit declaring the 540 patent invalid, in effect nullified its own prior decree upholding the 540 patent. From this premise, plaintiff argues that it has been collaterally estopped by the judgment of invalidity entered in the California suit and should at the least have been permitted to demonstrate before the Washington district court that it did not have a \u201cfair opportunity procedurally, substantively and evidentially to pursue [its] claims\u201d in the California suit, citing <em>Blonder-Tongue Laboratories v. University of Illinois Foundation, </em>402 U.S. 313, 333, 91 S.Ct. 1434, 1445, 28 L.Ed.2d 788 (1971). But plaintiff\u2019s argument, while ingenious, has no application to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-9\">In seeking relief from the prospective effect of the consent judgment, defendants made no attempt to invoke collaterally the California judgment to invalidate the Washington court\u2019s decree adjudicating the patents valid. Instead, defendants relied on the subsequent judgment as the materialization of a contingency expressly provided for by paragraph 10 of the parties\u2019 settlement agreement. The relief granted below was founded upon the express agreement of the parties as reflected in the Settlement Agreement; that relief simply holds plaintiff to its bargain and is hardly inconsistent with equitable principles. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>thus have no occasion in this case to consider \u201cthe inevitable problems that can arise in determining the effect of the determination of [a patent\u2019s] invalidity upon a prior judgment of validity if collateral estoppel is applied to all later suits.\u201d <em>Blumcraft of Pittsburgh v. Kawneer Co., </em>482 F.2d 542, 549 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-4\">Similarly, there is no merit in plaintiff\u2019s contention that the consensual nature of the Washington judgment somehow precludes relief under Rule 60(b)(5), where otherwise appropriate. Plaintiff contends that the revision of the prospective features of the consent decree impairs the res judicata effect to which such judgments are entitled. It is true that, as a general rule, consent decrees are accorded res judicata effect. <em>See, e. g., Wallace Clark &amp; Co. v. Acheson Industries, </em>532 F.2d 846 (2d Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 976, 96 S.Ct. 2177, 48 L.Ed.2d 800 (1976), and cases cited, 532 F.2d at 848. But the revision of the decree exacted by the district court in this case was consistent with the familiar distinction between the conclusive, res judicata effect properly accorded decrees adjudicating accrued rights and those prospective features of a decree \u201cthat involve the supervision of changing conduct or conditions and are thus provisional and tentative.\u201d <em>United States v. Swift &amp; Co., supra, </em>286 U.S. at 114, 52 S.Ct. at 462. As the Court observed in <em>System Federation v. Wright, supra, </em>364 U.S. at 647-48, 81 S.Ct. at 371: \u201cA balance must ... be struck between the policies of <em>res judicata </em>and the right of the court to apply modified measures to changed circumstances.\u201d Here, where the possibility of changed circumstances was expressly provided for by the very terms of the parties\u2019 Settlement Agreement, we are clear that the district judge did not abuse his discretion in modifying the prospective features of the decree to conform thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-5\">However, we are also clear that the district judge should have granted defendants\u2019 motion <em>in toto. </em>The Settlement Agreement clearly and unambiguously covers all three patents, not simply the 540 patent. Not only does the recital (quoted earlier) in the Settlement Agreement state that the term \u201c540\u201d was intended to cover the other two patents and indicate that it was merely a shorthand method of referring to all patents in suit, but paragraph 10 is also consistent with such an intent: \u201c[u]pon the expiration of patent 3,043,540 or if patent 3,043,540 is held invalid . [defendants] shall . . . have the right to make, use and sell \u2018540\u2019 devices free of any charge or claim of infringement by Safe Flight.\u201d We think it plain that the draftsmen\u2019s careful use of the term \u201c \u2018540\u2019 devices\u201d in paragraph 10 refers back to the definition of the term \u201c \u2018540\u2019 \u201d in the recital quoted earlier and includes all three patents in issue. Had the intention of the parties been otherwise, that is, had they contemplated that upon the occurrence of the conditions precedent specified in paragraph 10, defendants could use, etc., only the 540 patent free of any claim of infringement, it would have been a simple matter to say so. But this was not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-8\">Moreover, paragraph 10 provides that \u201c[u]pon the <em>expiration </em>of patent 3,043,540 . [defendants] shall thereafter . have the right to make, use and sell \u2018540\u2019 devices . . . .\u201d (Our emphasis.) Obviously, if the parties had intended the term \u201c540\u201d as used in paragraph 10 to mean only patent number 3,043,540, the expiration provision would have been unnecessary. There is nothing in the agreement to show any intent other than one to enable defendants or its successor to manufacture, etc., aircraft instrument devices covered by any of the three patents in suit upon the occurrence of the conditions prescribed in paragraph 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-10\">The final paragraph of the order appealed from is accordingly modified to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVX\">ORDERED that the injunction provided for in Paragraph 7 of the Judgment entered in the above-entitled case on July 31, 1969, be and the same is hereby VACATED.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1398-12\">As thus modified, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1396-8\">.
