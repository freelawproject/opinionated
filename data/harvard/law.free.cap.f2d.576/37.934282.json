The district court found that Valdosta\u2019s schools had achieved unitary status, and denied the United States\u2019 motion for supplemental relief. We vacate and remand for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>A desegregation order for the Valdosta, Georgia school system was issued in 1971. Valdosta has complied with this plan, and has in large part successfully eradicated the dual school system that existed prior to 1971. Nevertheless, implementation of the plan has resulted in the continued existence of several racially identifiable elementary schools. This court has due regard for the success of the Valdosta school board in abolishing the vestiges of the dual system at the junior and senior high school levels. We acknowledge that \u201cthe existence of some small number of . virtually one-race schools ... is not in and of itself the mark of a system that still practices segregation by law.\u201d <em>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., </em>402 U.S. 1, 26, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1281, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). Yet we cannot conclude that Valdosta has fully eliminated its dual school system. In evaluating this appeal we look to the law of school desegregation as currently understood in this Circuit. See <em>Dandridge v. Jefferson Parish School Bd., </em>5 Cir., 456 F.2d 552, 554, <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 978, 93 S.Ct. 306, 34 L.Ed.2d 240 (1972). The critical issue here is whether a unitary system has been achieved at any time subsequent to the imposition of the desegregation order. Thus, this case is not comparable to the situation in <em>Pasadena City Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler, </em>427 U.S. 424, 96 S.Ct. 2697, 49 L.Ed.2d 599 (1976), where a unitary system already had been achieved, and the racial concentrations were the result of demographic changes rather than the actions of the school board. <em>See United States v. South Park Independent School Dist., </em>5 Cir., 1978, 566 F.2d 1221, 1224-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">A number of post-Swann cases in this Circuit have evaluated school districts operating in compliance with pre-Swann desegregation orders and found that the continued existence of a significant number of virtually one-race schools is constitutionally suspect. <em>See, e. g., United States v. South Park Independent School Dist., supra. </em>These decisions have drawn on <em>Swann\u2019s </em>declaration that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">in a system with a history of segregation the need for remedial criteria of sufficient specificity to assure a school authority\u2019s compliance with its constitutional duty warrants a presumption against schools that are substantially disproportionate in their racial composition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">402 U.S. at 26, 91 S.Ct. at 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">As the following table illustrates, some of Valdosta's elementary schools remain racially identifiable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">School</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV4\">1970 1976</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQk\">Black White % Black Black White % Black</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APa\">S.

Fifty-five percent of Valdosta\u2019s elementary school population is black, and 80% of those black students attend schools that are over 90% black \u2014 West Gordon, Lomax, and Southeast elementary schools. \u2022 This high incidence of racially identifiable schools belies the school board\u2019s contention that Valdosta has achieved a unitary school system.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-49\">This case must, therefore, be remanded to the district court for the development of a plan that is designed to alleviate the incidence of virtually one-race elementary schools. Under the facts of this case, we cannot conclude that this pupil assignment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>plan constitutes full performance of the school board\u2019s duty to eradicate the dual school system.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">In remanding this case we emphasize that the remedy should be tailored to achieving a unitary system rather than a systemwide racial balance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Dayton Bd. of Educ. v. Brinkman, </em>433 U.S. 406, 412-20, 97 S.Ct. 2766, 2775, 53 L.Ed.2d 851 (1977); <em>Swann </em>v. <em>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., </em>402 U.S. 1, 24, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1280, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">If we were to read the holding of the District Court to require, as a matter of substantive constitutional right, any particular degree of racial balance or mixing, that approach would be disapproved .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">The constitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every school in every community must always reflect the racial composition of the school system as a whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">The district court should give further consideration to the steps necessary to create a unitary school system in Valdosta. We note with approval the declaration of this court in <em>United States v. State of Mississippi (Laurel), </em>5 Cir., 1978, 567 F.2d 1276, 1277, that a \u201cfresh approach may offer a better solution, but solution must indeed be found <em>ft</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">On remand, this matter should be expedited. The parties and the court are directed to see to the implementation of a desegregation plan at the earliest practicable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-13\">.
