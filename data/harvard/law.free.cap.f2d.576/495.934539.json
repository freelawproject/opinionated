One concerns the valued right of a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>to be protected against inaccurate statements harming his reputation. The other deals with one of the most indispensable freedoms in a democratic state, namely, that of untrammeled expression regarding the conduct of a public official. Although the reconciliation of these principles in the context of a particular factual configuration seldom will be easy, it is essential to the healthy survival of each. That is the task which this Court is now called upon to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s objection to the publication he challenges \u2014 a television broadcast\u2014 is that it gave rise to innuendoes which are defamatory of him. Specifically, Alfred R. Pierce claims that a broadcast by Capital Cities Communications, Inc., owner and operator of a Philadelphia television station, WPVI-TV, and Richard Kellman, a reporter for the station, defamed him by creating the false impression that he had misused his public position in seeking private pecuniary gain. In response, the defendants urge that the First Amendment analysis in the landmark case of <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), and in succeeding decisions, which protect speech about public officials absent a showing of \u201cactual malice,\u201d bars recovery in the present situation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Pierce was the Mayor of Camden, New Jersey, for a ten-year period ending in 1969, and a Commissioner of the Delaware River Port Authority from June 4, 1962, until May 11, 1970. From January 1, 1969, until May 11, 1970, he was Chairman of the Authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">On November 30, 1973, more than three years after Pierce was last a member of the Port Authority, WPVI-TV televised a program, entitled \u201cPublic Bridges and Private Riches,\u201d which explored the activities of the Port Authority and, in particular, the performance of Ralph Cornell, then its Chairman.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During the broadcast, Pierce was named approximately five times in his capacity as former Camden Mayor and Port Authority Chairman.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">Since Pierce\u2019s position is that the television program as a whole was actionable as to him, even if no single- remark in it was defamatory, it is necessary to set forth in some detail its major aspects. The introduction included a statement that, while preparing for the broadcast, \u201cAction News reporter, Richard Kellman\u201d travelled \u201cthe bridges of the Delaware River Port Authority and the high speed road to profit.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The structure of the Port Authority, the cost of its projects and the use of tolls to pay its debts were then described.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-15\">Following the introduction, a segment of the telecast dealt with a cost increase for steel lattice work essential to building the superstructure of the Commodore Barry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Bridge. A controversy in 1969 among the members of the Port Authority, relating to the desirability of seeking new bids on the contract for steel, was elaborated, and statements by two participants in the dispute, including- Ralph Cornell, were juxtaposed. Then Kellman displayed the minutes of a Port Authority meeting held on September 17, 1969, which recorded the votes on a motion for new bids on the steel contract, and he stated that \u201cNew Jersey commissioners voting \u2018no\u2019 included Chairman Alfred R. Pierce and the present Chairman Ralph Cornell.\u201d At the conclusion of this portion of the program, Kellman narrated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\">And so ... as the toll-payers shelled out nickels, dimes and quarters to pay for the project \u2014 some Port Authority commissioners saw an opportunity for enormous profits, profits on land deals made possible by the very bridge motorists would be paying for well into the year 2000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">After a pause for a commercial announcement, the program showed Kellman noting that there was a close relationship between the construction of the Commodore Barry Bridge, which runs from Chester, Pennsylvania to Bridgeport, New Jersey, and the increase in land values in the Bridgeport area. The mayor of Bridgeport was quoted as saying that the values of land in the town had risen directly as a result of the construction of the bridge. As to Pierce\u2019s own interest in land in the vicinity of the Commodore Barry Bridge, Kellman remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">Among the properties with identifiable owners ... is this 90-acre plot of Route 322 . . . where the expressway linking Routes 130 and 295 will be built. The deed is recorded at the Gloucester County Courthouse in Woodbury. It shows the property is owned by Alfred R. Pierce . . . former Mayor of Camden and Port Authority Chairman at the time the Barry bridge was approved. On the day Pierce bought his 90 acres . he also bought 22 acres more . just across the road . and on the same day ... in April of last year ... he sold the 22 acres to a corporation that also has the deed to 67 acres farther up the road where Route 322 crossed Route 295.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">The broadcast proceeded to focus on the development of the Lindenwold Hi-Speed Line, a mass transit facility that was built and is operated under the auspices of the Port Authority and runs from Philadelphia to Lindenwold, New Jersey. Kellman indicated that \u201c(t)here\u2019s talk of extending the Hi-Speed Line past Lindenwold to the Jersey Shore\u201d in the event of the areas\u2019 continued expansion, residentially and commercially. Certain land near the Ferry Avenue station of the Lindenwold Hi-Speed Line, described as \u201cprime commercial property,\u201d was said to be owned by \u201ca combine called ABJ, Inc.,\u201d whose shareholders \u201cinclude former Camden Mayor and Port Authority Chairman Alfred R. Pierce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">Kellman mentioned a third parcel of real estate in which Pierce was portrayed as having an interest that was said to be located in Woodbury, New Jersey, near a proposed extension of the Hi-Speed Line. As Kellman said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-12\">A Port Authority study recommended the Gloucester route to Woodbury where there are five acres of land owned by a corporation that includes as shareholders former Camden Mayor and Port Authority Chairman Alfred Pierce and former Port Authority Commissioner John Crisconi of Philadelphia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-13\">In mid-October, Port Authority engineers confirmed their recommendation that the Woodbury station would be built here, adjacent to the propoerty (sic) owned in part by Pierce, Crisconi and Cornell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">In the aftermath of those remarks, Kellman questioned Cornell about the \u201cguidelines\u201d he followed in his work in order to avoid a conflict of interest, and Cornell replied that he adhered to \u201cthe ten commandments.\u201d A prominent Philadelphia banker, John Bunting, who has since been appointed to the Port Authority, was quoted as saying that, in his view, \u201ccertainly buying land raises doubts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Kellman then explained that the director of bridges for the Port Authority, Andrew Ferenz, had been fined and given a suspended jail sentence for \u201cusing Port Authority building materials on his own home.\u201d Ferenz was described as the brother-in-law of \u201cformer Camden Mayor and Port Authority Chairman, Alfred R. Pierce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">On May 16, 1974, five-and-one-half months after the airing of the broadcast, Pierce filed a complaint, predicated on diversity jurisdiction, charging that the television program falsely \u201caccused plaintiff of acting in his own selfish interest and in abuse of his public trust.\u201d Pierce also alleged that harmful \u201cinnuendoes\u201d arising from it subjected him to \u201cpublic ridicule, contempt, and humiliation,\u201d injuring his \u201cgood name and reputation\u201d and thereby defaming him. He sought compensatory damages in the amount of two million dollars, as well as punitive damages for the same sum.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the defendants filed an answer, there was extensive pre-trial discovery. On the basis of the information acquired during discovery, the defendants moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The district court, in an opinion and order dated February 7, 1977, 427 F.Supp. 180, held that the application of the principles enunciated in <em>New York Times </em>required a grant of summary judgment on behalf of the defendants, for Pierce had not set forth sufficient facts showing, as a public official is required to do, that the publication in question, even if defamatory, was made with \u201cknowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">Pierce urges that the district court erred in not fully considering the harmful innuendoes, or the inferences drawn from context, that necessarily flowed from the language and composition of the television broadcast viewed as a whole.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If one takes account of such innuendoes, Pierce submits, it can only be concluded that the requirement of a showing of \u201cactual malice\u201d established by <em>New York Times </em>does not bar recovery here.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">It is maintained by Pierce, for instance, that the discussion in the broadcast of the 1969 vote by members of the Port Authority over rebidding a contract for steel to be used in constructing the Commodore Barry Bridge raised the incorrect implication that Pierce had cast his vote in order to expedite the construction, and thereby accelerate his realization of profits from the resale of land he had acquired near the bridge. Also, Pierce charges that the broadcast impliedly suggested \u2014 again, falsely \u2014 that he had used knowledge gained as a public official in making his private acquisitions of real estate. Further, Pierce claims that the opinions expressed in the program, such as by John Bunting, to the effect that land purchases by Port Authority Commissioners are improper, and the program\u2019s title, \u201cPub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>lie Bridges and Private Riches,\u201d tended to defame him contextually, although admittedly not literally.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Defendants\u2019 knowing or reckless disregard of the falsity of the publication, Pierce suggests, may be inferred from the fact that the broadcast, while it mentioned him in connection with three real estate transactions, did not explicitly reject the implication that Pierce had utilized insider information in buying the land in question. He points in particular to Kellman\u2019s deposition and to memoranda written by Kellman to his superiors during the preparation of the program which, Pierce claims, demonstrate that the reporter fully recognized that Pierce\u2019s purchases occurred <em>after </em>he had left office and <em>after </em>the public had been told of the Port Authority projects in question \u2014 even though, in the broadcast, the time sequence was not made clear.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">In response, the defendants press the point that Pierce has not been able to identify any specific statement in the telecast relating to him that is false other than the comment \u2014 which defendants claim is immaterial in any event \u2014 that he is the brother-in-law of Andrew Ferenz.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Defendants note that, in this appeal, Pierce appears to have abandoned the argument that the remark about Pierce\u2019s relationship with Ferenz may be construed as having defamed him. Even so, defendants stress, there is no indication in the record that they knew or had reason to know of the falsity of their identification of Ferenz as Pierce\u2019s brother-in-law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Further, the defendants contend that the various, allegedly harmful \u201cinnuendoes\u201d ascribed to the broadcast are incapable, under <em>New York Times </em>and succeeding decisions, of giving rise to actionable defamation. With respect to the program\u2019s title and its introduction, which purportedly paint a picture of less-than-scrupulous activity by members of the Port Authority, the defendants maintain that such language should be perceived as the kind of hyperbole or colorful phraseology that is protected by the First Amendment. And as to the observation by Bunting that in his view purchases of land by Port Authority Commissioners are questionable, defendants suggest that such a statement is precisely the sort of opinion about public affairs which should be accorded constitutional protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">Also, regarding the plaintiff\u2019s contention that defamatory innuendoes arose from the defendants\u2019 failure to negative the possibility that Pierce acted improperly by purchasing three parcels of real estate, the defendants emphasize that such a position depends fundamentally on an interpretation of various aspects of the broadcast, not on anything directly said in it. When the cited innuendoes are taken in turn, it is argued, the constitutional standard cannot be met.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">Specifically, as to the supposed \u201cinnuendo\u201d arising from the discussion of the vote regarding rebidding of the contract for steel for the Commodore Barry Bridge, defendants argue, first, that nothing was said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>in the program to the effect that Pierce voted \u201cno\u201d on the rebidding proposal in order to speed up the receipt of profits from the sale of land near the bridge. Moreover, it was stated that Pierce\u2019s purchase of real estate near the bridge occurred in \u201cApril of last year,\u201d which would have been in April of <em>1972, </em>the year prior to the broadcast. Since the controversy about the rebidding of the steel contract occurred in <em>1969, </em>defendants argue, it is plainly unreasonable to conclude that the broadcast created the misimpression that Pierce owned the land on the occasion of the crucial vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Because the program did include the time sequence of the vote on the steel contract and of Pierce\u2019s acquisitions of land near the Commodore Barry Bridge, defendants declare also that it cannot be claimed that the broadcast raised the inaccurate implication that Pierce approved the location of the Commodore Barry Bridge at the time that he owned land near where the bridge ultimately was built. Again because the relevant timing was stated in the broadcast, defendants further contend that it is unreasonable to conclude that it created the false impression that Pierce took advantage of insider information when he initially bought the real estate near the Commodore Barry Bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">As to the other two parcels of land in which Pierce had an interest \u2014 those near an existing, as well as a proposed, station of the Hi-Speed Line \u2014 defendants concede that the program did not provide the time sequence of official action and of Pierce\u2019s purchases. Despite that omission, defendants would have us affirm the district court\u2019s ruling. For, they stress, Pierce was said to have owned the two plots in question jointly with Ralph Cornell, then the incumbent Chairman of the Port Authority. Since such a revelation is the sort of comment about a public official that should be accorded protection under the First Amendment, and since some compression of facts relating to an item covered in a television broadcast is inevitable, defendants argue that no policy of the First Amendment would be served, and key ones would be undermined, by concluding that the statements about the Ferry Avenue and Wood-bury real estate constituted actionable defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Regarding Kellman\u2019s deposition and his memoranda to his superiors, defendants insist that they fail to display the existence of any knowing or reckless disregard of falsity \u2014 but rather indicate only that the defendants wondered whether to charge the plaintiff with a conflict of interest, and decided ultimately not to do so.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">In resolving this dispute, we initially consider the governing tort law in order to ascertain whether, in the present situation, defamation has occurred. For before investigating whether the constitutional principles of <em>New York Times </em>operate to bar recovery, it would appear appropriate to ask whether a state tort has arisen in the first place. Moreover, since our jurisdiction over the case is predicated upon the diversity of the citizenship of the parties, under <em>Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938) and its progeny, we are admonished to start with the applicable state law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">A threshold question in this regard is which state\u2019s law should be utilized. The parties indicated, at oral argument, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>law of Pennsylvania governs. Such a position apparently rests on the fact that the business activities of the television station and the reporter charged with defamation are based in Philadelphia and, as a result, that jurisdiction has an abiding interest in the lawsuit.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the absence of any suggestion that there exists here a true conflict of law \u2014 that is, that Pennsylvania law differs from that of another interested forum having a strong competing stake in the case arguably outweighing Pennsylvania\u2019s interest \u2014 there is no occasion to diverge from the parties\u2019 position. This being so, we must decide what resolution a Pennsylvania court would reach with regard to the issues in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Pennsylvania has adopted the definition of defamation incorporated in the <em>Restatement, Torts </em>\u00a7 559 (1938), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">A communication is defamatory if it tends so to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIYI\">In Pennsylvania as well as under the <em>Restatement, </em>whether or not language can reasonably be construed as defamatory is a question of law to be determined by a court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">Ascertaining whether a communication is capable of a defamatory meaning depends upon what a recipient \u201ccorrectly, or mistakenly but reasonably, understands\u201d that the statement was intended to express.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is established that a court should not scrutinize simply the literal references of the language in question, but also should weigh the words \u201ctogether with their context.\u201d <em>Restatement, Second, Torts </em>\u00a7 563, Comment (d). In Pennsylvania, the burden of proving that a statement is defamatory \u2014 as well as establishing its publication by the defendant, its application to the plaintiff, and the recipient\u2019s understanding of its defamatory meaning \u2014 is on the plaintiff.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-14\">Under Pennsylvania eases handed down after the Supreme Court decided <em>New York Times, </em>the definition of defamatory speech has been held to include consideration of the constitutional principles articulated in that seminal opinion. Thus, even though in analyzing this case we start with Pennsylvania tort law, no rigid line of demarcation may be maintained between state law rules and constitutional norms, for both are intermixed in the Pennsylvania precedents.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-15\">In <em>Redding v. Carl</em>ton,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> it was concluded that the challenged allegations, which were published during a campaign to prevent the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>purchase of a proposed building site for a township headquarters and referred to the town supervisor\u2019s dual role as supervisor and landowner, were not libelous. The defendant had complained that the supervisor\u2019s position evidenced a \u201c \u2018conflict of interests at the very least, and perhaps much more.\u2019 \u201d In analyzing whether such a remark may be said to be defamatory, the Pennsylvania court declared that \u201c(f)ree speech would be endangered if innocuous statements were found capable of possessing a defamatory meaning.\u201d It is necessary, the court underscored, to decide whether a defamation has occurred in light of the principles enunciated in <em>New York Times </em>\u2014 namely, that our country has a \u201cprofound commitment\u201d to the notion that debate on public matters should be \u201cuninhibited, robust, and wide-open,\u201d and that our nation\u2019s political and moral undertaking presupposes that some \u201cunpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials must be protected.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As the court in <em>Red-ding </em>wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">To prevent a chilling effect on free speech, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has held that \u201cstatements which represent differences of opinion or are annoying or embarrassing, are without more not libelous.\u201d <em>Bogash v. Elkins, </em>... 405 Pa. 437, 440, 176 A.2d 677, 679 (1962). Neither is a statement libelous which is \u201cno more than rhetorical hyperbole\u201d or \u201ca vigorous epithet\u201d used to describe what the publisher believes to be another\u2019s extremely unreasonable position. <em>Greenbelt Cooperative Publishing Ass\u2019n v. Bresler, </em>398 U.S. 6, 14, 90 S.Ct. 1537, 26 L.Ed.2d 6 . . . (1970).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The <em>Redding </em>court, in view of these guiding postulates, determined that the challenged statement that the town supervisor\u2019s role evidenced a conflict of interest <em>\u201c </em>'at the very least, and perhaps much more\u2019 \u201d was a remark characterized by \u201cthe type of rhetorical hyperbole common to American politics,\u201d and as such it is protected by the First Amendment.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> With regard to the only misstatement in the defendant\u2019s publication \u2014-namely, the assertion that the plaintiff\u2019s property was adjacent to, rather than near, the proposed building site \u2014 the <em>Redding </em>court noted that it is \u201cminor,\u201d and moreover that it is incapable of bearing a defamatory meaning since it is analogous to the \u201crhetorical hyperbole\u201d or \u201cvigorous epithet\u201d that commonly is heard in American public life.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">Additionally, while avowing that the defendant\u2019s comments dealt, at least in part, with factors motivating the plaintiff\u2019s actions, <em>Redding </em>emphasized that errors of fact about such matters are almost unavoidable. <em>Redding </em>embraced the comment in <em>Sweeney v. Patterson</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 which the Supreme Court also quoted with approval in <em>New York Times </em>\u2014where it was stated that \u201c(e)rrors of fact, particularly in regard to a man\u2019s mental states and processes, are inevitable . . . . Whatever is added to the field of libel is taken from the field of free debate.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>Redding </em>concluded that to hold that the questioned publications were capable of a defamatory meaning would unduly infringe upon \u201cthe field of free debate.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">On the basis of the analysis in <em>Red-ding, </em>which appears consistent with the precepts articulated by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in <em>Bogash v. Elkins, </em>405 Pa. 437, 176 A.2d 677, 678-79 (1962), and <em>Volomino v. Messenger Publishing Co., </em>410 Pa. 611, 189 A.2d 873, 874-75 (1963), we have concluded that the Pennsylvania courts would hold that the broadcast of concern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>here, in terms of both the specific statements in it as well as their innuendoes, is incapable of a defamatory meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The only specific error in the program was a comment about Pierce\u2019s relationship with Ferenz, which suggested that the two men had a closer family tie than in fact they had \u2014 although there was some such connection.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> That misstatement certainly is a minor matter in the context of the broadcast in its entirety. For the burden of the discussion of the relationship between the two men was that <em>some </em>interlocking connections existed among the individuals involved in Port Authority activities, not that any particular relationship obtained.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Further, in response to Pierce\u2019s objection to the implications of some of the program\u2019s language that may be said to constitute hyperbole \u2014 such as the title, and the introductory remarks that the public should \u201chold onto your dollars\u201d and that the reporter investigating the story pursued the \u201chigh speed road to profit\u201d \u2014 it should be noted that such language would appear to fall squarely within the reach of the principles elaborated in <em>Redding. </em>Moreover, since <em>Redding </em>grants protection to the bald assertion of a conflict of interest, it would seem a <em>fortiori </em>that the Pennsylvania courts would safeguard the statements about Pierce\u2019s land purchases, which are said by plaintiff only to carry the implication of a conflict of interest.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">Thus, under Pennsylvania law no defamation has occurred in the present situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-14\">But even if we have misconstrued the Pennsylvania law of defamation, the result in this appeal would not be altered. This is so since, even if the publication here were held to be. actionable under state law, it nevertheless would be protected on constitutional grounds.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-15\">Discussions by the Supreme Court of the constitutional privilege for defamatory speech about public officials have reflected a keen awareness that this area of the law entails a definite tension between two fundamental ideals, and that an accommodation between them must be struck in each case. On the one hand, our legal system recognizes the principle that an individual should be protected against incorrect statements which dishonor his name.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Indeed, \u201c[sjociety has a pervasive and strong interest in preventing and redressing attacks upon reputation.\u201d <em>Rosenblatt v. Baer, </em>383 U.S. 75, 86, 86 S.Ct. 669, 676, 15 L.Ed.2d 597 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>(1966).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> On the other hand, our courts must adhere to the notion, expressed in <em>New York Times </em>and the eases following it, that free expression about public matters on the part of citizens and the press must be zealously guarded.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The foundation for an attempt to accommodate both of these precepts, of course, is the Supreme Court\u2019s elaboration in <em>New York Times </em>of the constitutional framework for defamation analysis. Prior to <em>New York Times, </em>the Supreme Court had announced in dicta that libelous words were not safeguarded by the Constitution.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The Court\u2019s approach was dramatically altered in 1964 by <em>New York Times </em>which, in the words of one commentator, \u201ccreated an entirely new system of liability for defamation.\u201d <footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-16\">In reversing a decision by the Alabama courts holding a publisher strictly liable for defamatory falsehoods in an advertisement soliciting funds for the civil rights movement,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> <em>New York Times </em>took as its basic premise the central meaning of the First Amendment, which was said to be \u201ca profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The majority rejected the position, advocated by three concurring Justices,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> that speech defaming public officials should be accorded absolute immunity.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Instead, the Court established for such speech a qualified privilege defeasible only on proof of \u201cactual malice\u201d on the part of a defendant.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> \u201cActual malice\u201d is not at all synonymous with common law malice, which includes spite or ill-will<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> What is meant by the term in the defamation context is either that the defendant knew of the falsity of the communication in question or that he published the comment in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\"><em>New York Times </em>thus stands, <em>inter alia, </em>for the proposition that a calculated lie about a public official, or a statement uttered out of reckless inattention to its falsity, is beyond the pale of constitutional protection. <em>See Garrison v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 64, 75, 85 S.Ct. 209, 13 L.Ed.2d 125 (1964). In laying down this standard, the Court took pains to guard against too sweeping a definition of actionable defamation. It stressed that, as a general matter, \u201cerroneous. statement is inevitable in free debate,\u201d <footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and that speakers or publishers, if exposed broadly to liability for defamation, might well engage in self-censorship. Such self-checking could be expected to follow as much from the threat of a sanction as from the actual enforcement of one,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> for not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>only is it frequently difficult to prove the truth of a defamatory communication,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> but also the risk incurred in attempting to establish truth before fallible juries or judges is considerable.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Consequently, <em>New York Times </em>determined not to shield speech about public officials merely on a case-by-case basis, but rather to enunciate a general protective principle designed to leave room for courts to guard the individual against malicious attacks on his reputation and, at the same time, to prevent undue \u201cchilling effects\u201d on such expression.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The meaning of the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cactual malice\u201d requirement was amplified in <em>Garrison v. </em>Louisiana<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> where the Court distinguished between an \u201chonest utterance, even if inaccurate,\u201d which is to be constitutionally safeguarded, and the \u201cuse of calculated falsehood,\u201d which is not.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The knowing and deliberate lie about a public official is not accorded First Amendment protection, the Court in <em>Garrison </em>indicated, because it is \u201cat odds\u201d with the norms of a democratic polity and with the requisites of \u201corderly\u201d social, political and economic change.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> <em>Garrison </em>invoked as support for this idea the dictum in <em>Chaplinsky v. New </em>Hampshire<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> that certain types of utterances, such as a conscious prevarication about a public official, \u201care no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">In the present case, as has been noted, the only falsity identified in the broadcast is a statement regarding Pierce\u2019s relationship with Ferenz. However, as to this remark, there is no indication that any calculation or deliberateness on the defendants\u2019 part entered into the act of publication. Because there was a basis on which Kellman could have reasonably believed that Pierce was Ferenz\u2019 brother-in-law,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> the comment is most properly understood as an \u201chonest utterance, even if inaccurate,\u201d and therefore as constitutionally protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">Further, the Supreme Court has made it clear that the \u201crecklessness\u201d component of \u201cactual malice\u201d cannot be inferred simply from the failure to act in conformity with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>the conduct of a prudent or reasonable person. In <em>New York Times </em>itself, the Court held that the plaintiff did not satisfy his burden of proof because the record did not demonstrate that the publisher was aware of the likelihood that he was circulating false information. That was the case even though it might have been negligent not to have cheeked the accuracy of the copy -of the advertisement against stories in the newspaper\u2019s own files.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> And in <em>St. Amant v. Thompson</em><footnotemark><em>56</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court emphasized that in order to establish \u201cactual malice\u201d, one must show more than negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-4\">reckless conduct is not measured by whether a reasonably prudent man would have published, or would have investigated before publishing. <em>There must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication. Publishing with such doubts shows reckless disregard for truth or falsity and demonstrates actual malice. </em>(emphasis supplied)<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Consequently, in determining whether a defendant has been reckless, the operative inquiry is whether he published the statement even though he \u201cin fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.\u201d <footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">There is no indication in the present record. that the defendants \u201centertained serious doubts\u201d about the truth of any remark in the broadcast. As defendants have pointed out, the Reliman memoranda and the other materials adduced during discovery on which Pierce seeks to rely do <em>not </em>demonstrate that they knew that utterances in the broadcast were of questionable validity. To the contrary, these memoranda establish that they considered whether to charge Pierce \u2014 and Cornell \u2014 with utilizing insider information for private gain, and decided on the basis of the data before them not to do so.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">Moreover, the publication of \u201chyperbole,\u201d even if caustic and irritating, cannot by itself support the inference that the publisher evidenced \u201cactual malice\u201d. In <em>Greenbelt Cooperative Publishing Assn. v. Bresler</em><footnotemark><em>60</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the plaintiff complained that he had been defamed by statements reported in defendant\u2019s newspaper which charged him with \u201cblackmail.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the use of such an inflammatory term, the Supreme Court held that \u201cas a matter of Constitutional law, the reference to \u2018blackmail\u2019 in these circumstances was not slander when spoken, and not libel when reported\u201d in the newspaper. The rationale for this result was that \u201ceven the most careless reader must have perceived that the word was no more than rhetorical hyperbole, a vigorous epithet used by those who considered Bresler\u2019s negotiating position extremely unreasonable.\u201d The Court refused to permit the imposition of liability on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>newspaper in such circumstances because it would \u201csubvert the most fundamental meaning of a free press, protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ai3\">It appears that, in the situation under consideration, some of the statements in the program\u2019s introduction as well as its title would be construed by a reasonable television viewer as being essentially historical comment or hyperbole. As such, they must be accorded the full measure of constitutional protection mandated by Greenbelt.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The further claim by Pierce is that \u201cactual malice\u201d may be inferred from the fact that the defendants published remarks giving the impression, without saying so explicitly, that he was engaged in a pattern of using insider knowledge for private gain through real estate transactions \u2014 even though, in fact, he had purchased the land in question after leaving public office. That argument, by its own terms, concedes that no specific statement about the land transactions was incorrect. It rather rests upon the notion that \u201cactual malice\u201d is established by the fact that the defendants failed to rule out the possibility that Pierce used insider knowledge when buying land whose value was affected by decisions of the public agency on which he sat.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Pierce\u2019s contention thus hinges primarily on the <em>negative </em>implications said to flow from the program\u2019s treatment of his ownership of the three plots of land. Regarding the first parcel, however, as has been noted, the broadcast did provide the correct time sequence of Pierce\u2019s membership on the Port Authority and his later purchase of the real estate. In light of the fact that the publication was literally correct, it cannot fairly be said that, from the discussion about the land near the Commodore Barry Bridge, one may infer \u201cactual malice\u201d on the part of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">Mere lack of a statement of such time sequence as to the other two parcels of land in which Pierce had an interest cannot be held to establish the existence of \u201cactual malice\u201d on the defendants\u2019 part. For the remarks about Pierce\u2019s interests in the real estate on Ferry Avenue and in Woodbury explicitly included the phrase <em>\u201cformer </em>Camden Mayor and Port Authority Chairman.\u201d (emphasis supplied) We cannot agree with the plaintiff\u2019s suggestion that \u201cactual malice\u201d is demonstrated simply by the fact that the modifier \u201cformer\u201d was not placed before the title \u201cPort Authority Chairman,\u201d but was situated before \u201cCamden Mayor.\u201d Although there is arguably some ambiguity in the program regarding Pierce\u2019s membership on the Port Authority at the time of the real estate transactions, that alone, in our view, does not suffice to sustain the burden of establishing with convincing clarity knowing or reckless disregard of falsity.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">Beyond the details relating to the various statements in the broadcast are fundamental principles of First Amendment jurisprudence compelling the conclusion that no actionable defamation occurred here. Since Pierce was a public official and did have, or at least appeared to the public to have, \u201csubstantial responsibility for or control over the conduct of governmental af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>fairs,\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> his claim lies within the heartland of defamation actions covered by <em>New York Times. </em>In addition, there is no doubt that the remarks in the telecast about Pierce were pertinent to his official conduct, for \u201canything which might touch on an official\u2019s fitness for office is relevant.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The fact that the program was not shown until after Pierce was out of office does not undermine these points.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Consequently, the strong First Amendment policy of protecting the free flow of ideas about public officials and their activities \u2014 even when some vehement or unpleasantly sharp comments may be involved \u2014 is fully operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">In view of these circumstances, and because the media such as are involved in this case personify the First Amendment values in the free exchange of ideas and open debate about public officials,<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> the publication challenged by Pierce should be protected by the First Amendment. Any other conclusion would have \u201cdisquieting implications for criticism of governmental conduct,\u201d <footnotemark>69</footnotemark> for it would likely lead to the kind of chilling effect on the media that <em>New York Times </em>and its successors directly seek to avoid.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">Thus, under Pennsylvania law as well as under federal constitutional standards, there is no basis for holding that the district court erred in granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Consequently, the court\u2019s judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\">.
