The particular questions to be resolved are: (1) whether a rebuttable presumption that a person intends the probable consequences of his acts coupled with an exclusion of all psychiatric evidence offered to show lack of capacity to form intent, unconstitutionally relieves the prosecution of proving the intent element of the crime; and (2) whether an evidentiary rule excluding psychiatric testimony on the issue of specific intent, by itself, is impermissible. Finding that both questions must be answered in the positive, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-8\">The facts are stated in detail in the Wisconsin Supreme Court opinion, <em>Hughes v. State, </em>68 Wis.2d 159, 227 N.W.2d 911 (1975), and will be briefly'summarized here. After a period of marital difficulties, petitioner and his wife, Jacquelin Hughes, entered into a formal separation agreement and divorce proceedings were commenced. In the early morning hours of February 25, 1973, following a telephone argument regarding petitioner\u2019s scheduled visitation with his five-year-old daughter, petitioner broke into the house of his wife\u2019s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Gross, where his wife and daughter were staying. Mrs. Gross escaped to the home of a neighbor and telephoned Mr. Gross, who was at work, and the police. After the neighbor, Mr. Kasprzak, went to the Gross house to attempt to calm the petitioner, Mrs. Gross heard two loud noises. When the police arrived, they found petitioner with his daughter in the living room and Mrs. Hughes and Mr. Kasprzak dead of gunshot wounds in the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-12\">Petitioner was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and, under Wisconsin\u2019s bifurcated trial system, he pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to the trial, petitioner was examined by court-appointed psychiatrists. Upon receiving the psychiatric report, petitioner withdrew his plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect and proceeded only upon the not guilty plea. As explained by his counsel at the pretrial conference, it was petitioner\u2019s theory of defense that he lacked the requisite specific intent for first-degree murder and was guilty only of second-degree murder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Tr. 25, 71.) At trial, after the close of the state\u2019s case, petitioner called a psychiatrist to testify regarding petitioner\u2019s mental state at the time of the act. The trial court granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion to exclude the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony and the defense made the following offer of proof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>If Dr. Kevin Kennedy were called as a witness ... he would testify that at the time, [defendant] was suffering from a depraved mind and that he was, in forensic psychiatry, termed an antisocial personality or a psychopath, and that an abnormal mental condition prevented him from forming the specific intent to kill.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">(Tr. 548-549.) The defense offered no other evidence and, after being given instructions, including one regarding the legal presumption of intent, the jury found the petitioner guilty on both counts. The court imposed two consecutive life sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-6\">The Wisconsin Supreme Court subsequently affirmed petitioner\u2019s conviction. <em>Hughes v. State, supra. </em>The Wisconsin opinion, in relevant part, rejected petitioner\u2019s argument that since specific intent is an element of first-degree murder, psychiatric evidence must be admitted to enable a defendant to rebut the legal presumption that a person intends the natural and probable consequences of his acts. In so deciding, the Wisconsin Supreme Court cited several of its prior decisions <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which held that psychiatric evidence was admissible only on the issue of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-7\">Petitioner then filed for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. After examining established Wisconsin policy against admitting psychiatric evidence on intent, the district court granted the writ. <em>Hughes v. Mathews, </em>440 F.Supp. 1272 (E.D.Wis.1977). The state brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-12\">We begin by examining several aspects of Wisconsin law relevant to our inquiry. First, Wisconsin statutes provide for first- and second-degree murder<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which are distinguished only by the degree of intent required for conviction. One who causes the death of another by conduct \u201cevincing a depraved mind\u201d is guilty only of second-degree murder since he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-13\">has a general intent to do the acts and the consciousness of the nature of the acts and possible result but lacks the specific intent to do the harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1307-14\"><em>State v. </em>Weso, 60 Wis.2d 404, 411-12, 210 N.W.2d 442, 446 (1973). <em>See also Wagner v. State, 76 </em>Wis.2d 30, 48, 250 N.W.2d 331, 341 (1977) (intent to kill is not an element of second-degree murder).</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-15\">Second, Wisconsin has established a rebuttable presumption of intent: \u201c[t]he law presumes a person intends the natural and probable consequences of his own acts but the presumption may be rebutted.\u201d <em>State v. Carlson, </em>5 Wis.2d 595, 604, 93 N.W.2d 354, 359 (1958).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See also State v. Wells, </em>51 Wis.2d 477, 483-84, 187 N.W.2d 328, 331 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 907, 92 S.Ct. 1614, 31 L.Ed.2d 817 (1972). In the present case, the state trial court instructed the jury on the presumption of intent: \u201cwhen there are no circumstances to prevent or rebut the presumption, the legal and natural presumption is that death was intended.\u201d (Wis. J.I. \u2014 Crim. 1100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-16\">Finally, as noted above, Wisconsin provides for a bifurcated trial system when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>defendant pleads not guilty and not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This section effectuates Wis.Stats. \u00a7 971.15 (1975) which establishes and defines the insanity defense in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 4.01 and 4.03 of the American Law Institute\u2019s Model Penal Code (ALI-MPC).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Significantly, ALI-MPC \u00a7 4.02, which specifically provides for admissibility of evidence regarding mental disability whenever such evidence was relevant to the state of mind element of the offense, was not enacted by the Wisconsin legislature. The rejection of \u00a7 4.02, the mandatory language of \u00a7 971.175 regarding the sequential order of proof, and several public policy considerations, led the Wisconsin Supreme Court to refuse to admit psychiatric testimony on the issue of intent during the guilt portion of a bifurcated trial. <em>See Sprague v. State, </em>52 Wis.2d 89, 187 N.W.2d 784 (1971) <em>and </em>cases cited note 3 <em>supra. </em>This rule excluding psychiatric evidence on the issue of intent was extended to single stage trials, where no insanity defense was raised, in <em>Muench v. State, supra </em>note 3, and was reaffirmed in <em>Hughes v. State, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-6\">Given this factual and state law background, we consider first the validity of Wisconsin\u2019s instruction on presuming intent where the presumption cannot be rebutted by psychiatric evidence that the defendant lacked specific intent. The Supreme Court has held that all elements of a crime must be proven by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). <em>See also Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975) (state must prove criminal intent to convict defendant of murder). A conclusive presumption which relieves the state of its duty to prove all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt is, therefore, unconstitutional. <em>See Morrissette v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 275, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-14\">In Wisconsin, specific intent to kill is an element of first-degree murder and is the sole factor which distinguishes that crime from second-degree murder. The district court reasoned that by instructing the jury that all persons are presumed to have intended the consequences of their acts unless facts or circumstances rebut the presumption and then prohibiting the petitioner from presenting those facts, Wisconsin constructed an irrebuttable presumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>intent which improperly relieved the prosecution of the burden of proving that element of the crime. <em>Hughes v. Mathews, supra </em>at 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-4\">In response, the State argues that the petitioner was free to rebut the presumption by introducing other evidence, such as that showing mistake or accident, which would negate specific intent. The State, citing <em>Patterson v. New York, </em>432 U.S. 197, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 53 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977) and <em>Leland v. Oregon, </em>343 U.S. 790, 72 S.Ct. 1002, 96 L.Ed. 1302 (1952), maintains that it has merely chosen not to recognize the defense of lack of capacity to intend which is within its legitimate power over the criminal process. However, these cases are clearly inapplicable since they merely recognize the right of the state to shift the burden of persuasion to the defendant on affirmative defenses to crimes. Specific intent to kill is an \u201celement\u201d of first-degree murder in Wisconsin, <em>Wagner v. State, supra, </em>and is not a \u201cdefense\u201d to the crime. While a state has the power, within constitutional limits, to define its crimes as it wishes, once it has stated what combination of factors constitutes a crime it must prove each of them beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the district court was correct in holding that by instructing the jury to presume intent if not rebutted, and by excluding psychiatric evidence offered to rebut the presumption, Wisconsin set up a conclusive presumption which unconstitutionally relieved the prosecution of the burden of proving the element of specific intent beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">Were this simply a case where a jury instruction on presuming intent improperly left the jury with the impression that the petitioner had the burden of persuasion to disprove an element of the crime, we would be satisfied to affirm the writ of habeas corpus and send the case back to the state courts for a new trial with directions to avoid the suspect instructions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, the constitutional error present in the Wisconsin procedure is not merely the result of a rebuttable presumption becoming improperly conclusive when combined with a valid exclusionary rule. The exclusion of psychiatric evidence offered to show that the petitioner lacked the capacity to form specific intent to kill the two victims, is, by itself, constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-8\">While a conclusive presumption which establishes an element of the crime is considered violative of due process because it relieves the prosecution of the burden of proving each element beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>In re Winship, supra, </em>the right of a defendant to present evidence is a right which has independent status under the sixth and fourteenth amendments.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Washington v. Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 18-19, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967) (state defendant has sixth amendment right to obtain witnesses); <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973) (strict application .of state evidentiary rules to exclude defendant\u2019s evidence violated due process). In <em>Chambers, </em>the Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1310-4\">The right of an accused in a criminal trial to due process is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity to defend against the state\u2019s accusations. The rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and to call witnesses in one\u2019s own behalf have long been recognized as essential to due process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 294, 93 S.Ct. at 1045. <em>See also Webb v. Texas, </em>409 U.S. 95, 98, 93 S.Ct. 351, 34 L.Ed.2d 330 (1972) (trial judge\u2019s intimidating remarks drove defense witness off the stand and thereby violated defendant\u2019s due process rights).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-6\">A defendant\u2019s right to present evidence is violated where \u201cthe State has recognized as relevant and competent the testimony of this type of witness, but has arbitrarily barred its use by the defendant.\u201d <em>Washington v. Texas, supra </em>388 U.S. at 25, 87 S.Ct. at 1926 (Harlan, J., concurring). <em>See also People v. Wells, </em>33 Cal.2d 330, 202 P.2d 53, 62-63, <em>cert. denied, </em>338 U.S. 836, 70 S.Ct. 43, 94 L.Ed. 510 (1949). Consequently, in deciding whether this due process standard was met in petitioner\u2019s trial, we will first determine whether the evidence offered by the defense is relevant; second, determine whether the evidence is competent; and third, if the evidence is found to be both relevant and competent, examine the reasons for the rule excluding the evidence to determine if the rule is arbitrary.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-12\">\n<em>A. Relevance of Psychiatric Testimony.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-13\">First we must determine if the psychiatric evidence offered is relevant at a first-degree murder trial in Wisconsin. Under Wisconsin law, Wis.Stats. \u00a7 904.01 (1975), relevant evidence is both material and probative. That is, evidence is relevant when it pertains to a fact in issue and has a tendency to prove or disprove that fact.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Since the degree of intent is particularly in issue when distinguishing between first- and second-degree murder in Wisconsin, one would assume that psychiatric testimony regarding petitioner\u2019s mental state would pertain to and have some bearing on the resolution of the issue.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We note first that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>while Wisconsin has held that proof of insanity is not proof that defendant lacks the capacity to intend, <em>State v. Hebard, supra </em>note 3, 50 Wis.2d at 420, 184 N.W.2d at 163, it would be consistent to admit that psychiatric evidence which does not prove insanity might raise a reasonable doubt as to whether a defendant did or could form specific as opposed to general intent.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In addition, we note that Wisconsin has viewed psychiatric testimony to be \u201chighly relevant\u201d on the issue of competency to stand trial under Wis.Stats. \u00a7 971.14 (1975), <em>State ex rel. Haskins v. Dodge County Court, </em>62 Wis.2d 250, 266, 214 N.W.2d 575, 583 (1974), and relevant on the issue of intent to kill. <em>King v. State, 75 </em>Wis.2d 26, 43, 248 N.W.2d 458, 467 (1977).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, we conclude that in Wisconsin psychiatric testimony is relevant evidence on issues regarding a defendant\u2019s mental state including the question of whether the defendant had the capacity to form specific as opposed to general intent.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">\n<em>B. Competence of Psychiatric Testimony.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">The second inquiry is whether psychiatric testimony is competent evidence in Wisconsin. Assuming the individual qualifications of the psychiatrist were proper, we believe the question of competence involved in this case is whether Wisconsin recognizes psychiatric testimony as trustworthy evidence of mental state. <em>See generally </em>McCormick On Evidence, \u00a7\u00a7 61-71 (2d ed. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-11\">The State argues that the Wisconsin Su-. preme Court and the state legislature have expressed their distrust of psychiatric evidence and prohibited its admissibility on the issue of intent. <em>See, e. g., Curl v. State, supra </em>note 3 and the rejection of ALI-MPC \u00a7 4.02 noted in Part II of this opinion. <em>Curl v. State, supra, </em>stated that the reason for excluding psychiatric evidence on the intent issue was a lack of belief in the ability of psychiatry to define the degree of mental abnormality less than insanity. 40 Wis.2d at 485-86, 162 N.W.2d at 83. In response to the State\u2019s argument, we first question the validity of a system which views psychiatric testimony as trustworthy evidence as to whether a person is mentally capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his conduct but untrustworthy to express an opinion regarding a person\u2019s mental capacity to form specific intent to kill when such testimony is the only relevant evidence available.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> More importantly, however, we in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>terpret <em>Curl v. State, supra, </em>as stating that the true reason for excluding psychiatric evidence on the issue of intent in Wisconsin courts is the fear that persons who are legally sane will escape punishment. 40 Wis.2d at 485-86, 162 N.W.2d at 83. This is more of a justification for excluding competent evidence than a reason why the evidence is incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">The best indication that Wisconsin views psychiatric testimony as competent evidence is its use in other parts of the criminal proceeding. It is admitted on the question of insanity during the second stage of a bifurcated trial. <em>See </em>cases cited note 3 <em>supra. </em>Psychiatric testimony is also used to determine if the accused has the capacity to stand trial. <em>State ex rel. Haskins </em>v. <em>Dodge County Court, supra; </em>Wis.Stats. \u00a7 971.14 (1975). Finally, psychiatric diagnosis satisfies the general test for admissibility of scientific evidence since it is \u201csufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular field to which it belongs.\u201d <em>Frye v. United States, </em>54 App.D.C. 46, 47, 293 F. 1013, 1014 (1923). <em>See also Watson v. State, </em>64 Wis.2d 264, 272-74, 219 N.W.2d 398, 402-03 (1974); <em>State v. Stanislawski, </em>62 Wis.2d 730, 736-41, 216 N.W.2d 8, 11-13 (1974). Thus, we find that psychiatric testimony is generally considered competent evidence in Wisconsin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-5\">\n<em>C. State Justifications.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-6\">While the right of a defendant to present relevant and competent evidence is not absolute and may \u201cbow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process,\u201d the Supreme Court in <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, supra, </em>required that any competing interest be \u201cclosely examined.\u201d 410 U.S. at 295, 93 S.Ct. [1038] at 1046. Thus, our third step is to determine whether Wisconsin\u2019s justifications for excluding psychiatric testimony on the issue of specific intent withstand close scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-11\">The State has suggested two main justifications for the rule excluding psychiatric testimony on the issue of intent.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The first, as noted above, is the fear that admitting psychiatric testimony to disprove specific intent may cause judges and juries to find legally sane defendants not guilty and, consequently, \u201cguilty\u201d persons will be absolved of criminal responsibility for mental abnormalities not amounting to insanity.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Whatever validity this argument might have when a finding of no intent would result in no criminal responsibility, it is unpersuasive in the present case where the testimony was offered only to show that a second-degree murder conviction was proper. We expressly leave open the question of whether the State\u2019s fear of the \u201cguilty\u201d going free is sufficient justification for excluding psychiatric testimony on the issue of capacity to form intent when there is no lesser included crime of which, absent specific intent, a defendant would be guilty.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1312-12\">The second justification for excluding psychiatric testimony on the question of the degree of intent is that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>exclusion ensures the integrity of Wisconsin\u2019s bifurcated trial system. However, confining ourselves to the facts of this case, the petitioner withdrew his plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect and, consequently, there was no second trial of that issue. Thus, the State\u2019s concern that admission of psychiatric testimony during the guilt portion of trial would result in duplication of evidence and eliminate the need for a bifurcated trial, <em>State v. Hebard, supra, </em>note 3, 50 Wis.2d at 421-22, 184 N.W.2d at 163-64, is not applicable here. Also not involved is the fear that the petitioner\u2019s fifth amendment rights would be jeopardized if incriminating statements given during a pre-trial psychiatric examination were used by the prosecution at the guilt phase of trial. <em>State ex rel. LaFollette v. Raskin, supra </em>note 6, 34 Wis.2d at 623, 150 N.W.2d at 326. In this case, petitioner admitted the act and argued only that he did not have the requisite specific intent for first-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">Having found that petitioner\u2019s rights were violated, we must address the State\u2019s final argument that any error which occurred was harmless and a new trial is unnecessary.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The State maintains that petitioner\u2019s offer of proof at trial, that petitioner was an \u201cantisocial personality or a psychopath,\u201d does not describe a mental abnormality which would render him incapable of forming specific intent to kill. Also, the State points to the petitioner\u2019s actions and statements the night of the crime as overwhelming proof of his specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">To accept the State\u2019s argument, we must find the error to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). We are not prepared to say, as a matter of law, that the psychiatric testimony offered could not have proven that the petitioner was incapable of forming specific intent. <em>See Henderson v. Morgan, </em>426 U.S. 637, 647, 96 S.Ct. 2253, 49 L.Ed.2d 108 (1976).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-11\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-12\">In conclusion, we emphasize first what we have not done. We have not sought to impose a \u201cdiminished responsibility\u201d defense for emotional problems upon Wisconsin. The fashioning of such affirmative defenses involves the type of \u201csubtle balancing of society\u2019s interests against those of the accused [which has] been left to the legislative branch.\u201d <em>Patterson v. New York, supra </em>432 U.S. at 210, 97 S.Ct. at 2327. Nor have we attempted to further \u201cconstitutionalize\u201d the law of evidence by constructing a constitutional right to introduce psychiatric testimony. <em>See Chambers v. Mississippi, supra </em>410 U.S. at 308, 93 U.S. 1038 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). What we have done is to recognize that a state may not relieve the prosecution of its duty to prove all elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt by improper use of presumptions. We have also recognized the due process right of the defendant to present relevant and competent evidence in the absence of a valid state justification for excluding such evidence. Upon the particular facts of this case, we find Wisconsin\u2019s justifications to be inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-13\">For the reasons stated above, the order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1306-9\">.

In the present case, the trial court excluded the proffered evidence, and the State Supreme Court upheld the exclusion, without a preliminary finding that the testimony would not be helpful in determining whether the petitioner had the capacity to form specific intent.

It is interesting to note that the first of the five Wisconsin Supreme Court cases preceding the present case, <em>Curl v. State, supra </em>note 3, overruled <em>Hempton v. State, </em>111 Wis. 127, 135, 86 N.W. 596, 598 (1901) which expressly found evidence of an abnormal mental condition to be \u201cmaterial upon the general issue of not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ADDN\">We also note, by way of clarification, that petitioner here is seeking to introduce psychiatric testimony to support his theory of \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d to form specific intent rather than to support a defense of \u201cdiminished responsibility.\u201d <em>See </em>Arenella, <em>The Diminished Capacity and Diminished Responsibility Defenses: Two Children of a Doomed Marriage, </em>77 Colum.L.Rev. 827 (1977) [hereinafter cited as Arenella], Although the title of the above article characterizes diminished capacity as a \u201cdefense,\u201d we view the petitioner\u2019s attempts here as being directed toward disproving an element of the crime of first-degree murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"Aoh\">. We note that there are semantical difficulties in distinguishing between what is an element and what is a defense. The Supreme Court in <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>discussed the problem of states defining their crimes in such a way as to relabel facts which were historically \u201celements\u201d so that they become \u201cdefenses\u201d which must be proved by the defendant. <em>Id </em>432 U.S. at 210, 97 S.Ct. 2319. In the present action, while terming the lack of capacity to intend a \u201cdefense,\u201d the state does not dispute its obligation to prove intent. Thus, this case is not as close as <em>Patterson v. New York, supra. </em>It is true that by showing lack of capacity to have specific intent, petitioner would be presenting what is referred to as a \u201cdefense.\u201d However, what he actually is doing is attempting to disprove an element of the crime, not prove a defense. The propriety of excluding the petitioner\u2019s evidence will be examined in Part IV, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1309-10\">. Indeed, the State has advised us that the Wisconsin Uniform Criminal Jury Instructions Committee has adopted a new instruction regarding the intent element of first-degree murder and other intent cases designed to avoid the presumption. App. 122.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1309-11\">. It can also be argued that the right of a defendant to present evidence is a corollary of the right to have all elements of the crime proven by the prosecution. This follows since, presumably, the more favorable evidence an accused presents to the court, the more difficult is the prosecution\u2019s task of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1310-7\">. The State relies on <em>Fisher v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 463, 66 S.Ct. 1318, 90 L.Ed. 1382 (1946) which held that the defendant in a first-degree murder case was not entitled to an instruction, under Washington, D.C. law, that the jury should consider his abnormal personality in determining intent and premeditation. We agree with the district court and the D.C. Circuit that <em>Fisher </em>did not deal with the constitutional question involved here. <em>See United States v. Brawner, </em>153 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 471 F.2d 969, 999-1002 (1972). Also, in contrast to the present case, the defendant in <em>Fisher </em>was permitted to introduce all psychiatric testimony ' he offered. 328 U.S. at 467, 66 S.Ct. 1318.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1310-9\">. Given the state\u2019s power over its criminal process, we look to state law to determine the relevance and competence of the evidence. <em>See Irvine v. California, </em>347 U.S. 128, 134, 74 S.Ct. 381, 98 L.Ed. 561 (1953). However, just as a state may not exclude relevant and competent evidence arbitrarily, it may not arbitrarily classify evidence to be irrelevant or incompetent. <em>Cf. Patterson v. New York, supra </em>432 U.S. at 210, 97 S.Ct. 2319.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-10\">In <em>Washington v. Texas, supra, </em>the Supreme Court mentioned several state rules which presumably would meet the constitutional test. For example, state rules may exclude relevant and competent evidence if the exclusion is based upon nonarbitrary considerations such as with the testimonial privileges of lawyer-client and husband-wife. 388 U.S. at 23 n. 21, 87 S.Ct. 1920. Also, rules which exclude relevant evidence which is not competent are permissible; <em>i. e., </em>rules disqualifying witnesses who are infants or otherwise mentally or physically incapable of observation and testimony. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1310-15\">. We note that the prosecutor here conceded the relevance of the psychiatric testimony in his argument to the trial court in support of excluding the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1310-16\">We do not dispute in any way that perhaps expert testimony on the question of mental responsibility would have been or would be of assistance in resolving the subjective question. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1310-17\">(Tr. 540-41.)

The State suggests <em>King </em>did not present the same issue we confront in this case since there the defendant was permitted to introduce psychiatric testimony of his non-aggressiveness toward others as character evidence to support his theory of accident. While the distinction between permitting psychiatric testimony as character evidence and excluding the same testimony on the issue of mental state is subtle at best, we agree that <em>King </em>is not alone dispositive of the relevancy of psychiatric testimony since the Wisconsin Supreme Court did not deal directly with the relevancy of such evidence to prove lack of capacity to form intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1311-13\">. <em>But see Curl v.
