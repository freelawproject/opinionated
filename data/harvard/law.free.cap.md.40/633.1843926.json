The indictment charged the offence to have been committed by the parties named, \u201cnot being then and there regular practitioners of medicine.\u201d On a demurrer to the indictment on the ground that it did not sufficiently negative the proviso of the statute, it was Held :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b645-12\">That the indictment expressly negatived the fact that the traversers were regular practitioners of medicine, and consequently they did not come within the proviso of the Act, and were not authorized under any circumstances to cause abortion.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>H. and M. were jointly indicted for producing an abortion upon R. who died from the operation. Upon the trial of H. the State offered in evidence a paper, alleged to have been handed by M. to R., directing her when she should leave home, and informing her at what point of the journey he would meet her. Up to the time this paper was offered in evidence, no evidence had been introduced to connect H. with M. or with the commission of the offence charged in the indictment; nor was the offer of the paper accompanied by an offer to follow it up with further evidence tending to prove a conspiracy or combination between M. and H. to produce an abortion upon R. Evidence was introduced, however, during the progress of the trial tending to prove that there was such conspiracy. Held :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b646-5\">That the paper was inadmissible in evidence at the time it was offered, as it was not accompanied with an offer to follow it up with further proof to show the conspiracy and combination between the parties jointly indicted; but as such evidence was introduced during, the progress of the cause, after which the paper would have been admissible, its admission at the particular time at which it was admitted, did the traverser no injury, and the judgment should not, in consequence of such admission, be reversed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b646-6\">H. and SI. having been jointly indicted for unlawfully producing an abortion on R., it is competent on the trial of H. to give in evidence the declarations of M., with reference to the condition of R. for the purpose of showing that he knew she was then pregnant, the State offering to follow up such evidence with proof of conspiracy or confederation between M. and H. to produce the abortion charged in the indictment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b646-7\">Where a party is being tried for having produced an abortion upon one who at the time was an inmate of her house, it is competent to show the character of the house\u2014that it is a house of ill-fame\u2014in order that the jury may know whether the place is one where the crime charged, could be committed without fear of detection and punishment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b646-8\">On the trial of a party for having produced an abortion, it is competent for the prosecution to give in evidence the statement made by the accused, when she was examined as a witness before the coroner\u2019s inquest, of the circumstances attending .the arrival at her house of the deceased, and her sickness and death there\u2014the accused at the time of the examination not being under arrest, and no charge having been preferred against her.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b646-9\">On the trial of a party charged with having produced an abortion, a physician, as witness for the defence, testified that he attended the person upon whom the abortion had been produced, at the house of the traverser, and he described her symptoms and condition, and stated that she complained of a pressing and burning in her stomach. The traverser then offered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>prove by this witness that on the occasion of his visit, beside making a personal examination of the deceased, he inquired of her symptoms and feelings, and that in reply she stated, in addition to what he had before testified to, that she started from her home for the house of the traverser, in Hagerstown, and on her way something like a lump dropped from her, and that she had been taking some stuff, and she did not know exactly what was the matter with her. On objection to this evidence by the prosecution, it. was Held :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b647-5\">That the statement of the deceased as to something having dropped from her on her way to Hagerstown; that she had been taking some stuff, and that she did not know what was the matter with her, was a mere narrative of what had taken place before the physician visited her, and was not admissible in evidence, either as a dying declaration or as a part of the <em>res geslce.</em></headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"history\"

The Court, (Alvby and Motter, J.,) overruled the demurrer, and the traverser thereupon pleaded \u201cnot guilty.\u201d At the trial five exceptions were taken by the traverser; these are sufficiently set out in the opinion of this Court. The paper to the admission of which in evidence the first exception was taken, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-6\">\u201c <em>Liew, </em>start to Leightersburgh to-morrow at three o\u2019clock, and 1 will meet you between bill Huyett\u2019s and ehewsville, and I think that will be the best way for us to go. <em>Be shure and start at just </em>three, <em>so I toill meet you at the rite place.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-7\">From you <em>no Who.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-8\">The jury rendered a verdict of guilty, and the traverser appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b649-9\">The cause was argued before Bartol, C.

Kyd Douglas, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-5\">The indictment does not sufficiently negative the proviso of the Act of 1868, chap. 119, which is an amendment of the Act of 1861, chap. 185. The first, second and fourth counts charge, that the traversers were not regular practitioners of medicine, and that is all they say about the proviso. This is not sufficient, for if they had been regular physicians, it would have been no excuse, unless the other requirements set out in the proviso had been complied with.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-6\">The third count attemjrts to remedy the omission of the other counts, but it fails to do so. It is not quite as defective as the other three, yet it is fatally so. <em>Rawlings vs. The State, </em>2 Md., 201; <em>State vs. Nutwell, </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>54 ; <em>Rex vs. Jarvis, </em>1 <em>East, </em>647; <em>Commonwealth vs. Hart, </em>2 <em>Criminal Lead.

S. vs. Cooke, </em>17 <em>Wall., </em>168.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-7\">But if it were not necessary to negative the proviso, the result is the same. If an indictment undertakes to recite a statute, and misrecites it, it is fatal. <em>Rawlings vs. State, </em>2 <em>Md., </em>201; <em>Bacon\u2019s Abridgment, u Statutes.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-9\">The paper to the admission of which in evidence, the first exception was taken, was not sufficiently identified to go to the jury for their speculations. The old lady, by whom its identity was established, could neither read nor write. This paper was found in a box, in an open, unlocked drawer, after Louisa had left home, and it went from hand to hand, not appearing how it got into the court-house.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-10\">But if it were the same piece of paper which John McCauley gave Louisa, did he write it ? His name is not signed to it, and there was no attempt to prove his handwriting. It was not enough for the Court to tell the jury, that they were to consider it as evidence against Mrs. Hays, if they believed it to be the same piece of paper given by McCauley to Louisa Ross.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>But conceding that the identity of the paper was established, was it admissible when offered as evidence against the appellant? It was a transaction out of her presence, and neither at that time nor ever afterwards brought to her knowledge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-5\">The Court below said, the evidence was admissible to shew the circumstances under which she left her home, and by whom induced to leave it. But how does that reflect upon Mrs. Hays? It does not implicate her; for instead of pointing to her guilt, the paper itself shews that it was not the intention of the person who wrote that note, to take Louisa to Hagerstown, hut to Leitersburg.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-6\">Could there have, been any conspiracy, as was afterwards insisted upon at the trial, between McCauley and Mrs. Hays at that time? Clearly not. But if such was the supposition or theory of the State, the conspiracy should have been proved before this testimony was admitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-7\">At the time this paper was offered by the State and admitted, there was not only no evidence of conspiracy between McCauley and Mrs. Hays (for up to that point her name had not been mentioned,) but <em>there was no proffer by the State to prove such conspiracy. </em>And yet, with the explanation set forth in. the bill of exceptions, that piece of paper, pregnant with prejudice and suspicions, was permitted to go to the jury as evidence against a party who had never heard of it. 1 <em>Greenl.

Ev., </em>383, 387.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-8\">The testimony to the admission of which the second exception was taken, was equally objectionable. It is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>pretended that Mrs. Hays ever knew anything of this conversation, it was not shown or pretended, that she or McCauley ever knew each other at that time, or that she had then ever heard of Louisa Ross.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-5\">Up to this point, there was nothing in the case except the joint indictment, to indicate or establish a conspiracy. Nothing but assertion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-6\">The State's attorney asked one of his witnesses \u201cwhat character of house does Susan Hays keep ? \u201d to which he replied, that he knew nothing, except from general reputation, and that was, that she kept a house of ill-fame. This was an indirect effort to notify the jury as a matter of prejudice against the traverser, that she was a woman of bad character.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-7\">The only issue which the State was called upon to maintain, was that raised by the indictment, and no matter how good the previous character of the traverser may have been, it would not have saved her if the allegations of the indictment were clearly proven. Upon what principle, then, was evidence of her bad character introduced by the State as evidence in chief. She had not put it in issue and there is a long and unquestioned line of authorities which establish, that unless a defendant puts her character in issue, the prosecution cannot call witnesses to impeach it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-8\">If a prisoner on trial offers no evidence of good character, no legal inference can arise from such omission that he is guilty of the offence charged, or that his character is bad, for the law presumes his character to be good. If then in the absence of evidence, the law presumes good character, on what principle should the State be permitted to give evidence which compels the defendant to prove what the law does not require to be proved ? 1 <em>Taylor on</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-9\"><em>Evd., sec. </em>327 ; 1 <em>Whart.

It was conceded, that it -was competent to give in evidence what Louisa Ross said to the witness, Dr. Riddlemoser, as her physician, with regard to her feelings and symptoms at the time of her conversation with him. If this testimony be admissible, it is difficult to assign any sound reason for the exclusion of the proffered testimony. In examining into the condition of a patient, for the purpose of prescribing for her, is it not proper and necessary that a physician shall enquire and know not only the present feelings, pains and symptoms of his patient, but also, how she has suffered, what she has taken, what she has been doing just previous to and leading up to her sickness ? Can he not enquire of her what has gone before, connected with her malady? Else, how could he treat her intelligently? And if he may do this, why is not the answer to such enquiries as much evidence as her statements with regard to what he himself may see and partially know ? 1 <em>Greenl. Evd., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number><em>sec. </em>102; 1 <em>Phil. Evd., </em>232, 233; 1 <em>Whart. Crml.

Ev., </em>29.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-5\">But there is another ground upon which the proffered testimony was admissible. It constituted part of the <em>resgestee. </em>The principal and only charge under investigation was an abortion, and this testimony was closely connected with it, and threw a flood of light upon the whole transaction. It not only bore directly upon the crime charged in the indictment, but if there was an abortion, what more important evidence was offered during the trial. Was there an abortion? If so, who caused it? That was the issue involved ; was not the condition of Louisa Ross, part of that issue ? And how could evidence be more pertinent, or more immediately connected with the subject of enquiry ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-6\">The dying declarations of the injured, are often admitted to charge a prisoner with the crime. Ought not Mrs. Hays, in fairness and in law, to have had the benefit of the exculpatory statements of Louisa Ross on her deathbed? 1 <em>Greenl.

There was evidence tending to show that the paper produced at the trial, was the one given by McCauley to Louisa Ross. Whether the evidence was sufficient, was a matter of fact to be determined by the jury. The paper was admissible as evidence as tending\u2019 to show how Louisa Ross left her home\u2014under what circumstances\u2014by whom induced\u2014for what purpose\u2014that it was her seducer who decoyed her from her father\u2019s house, under the pretence of taking her to Leitersburg, but in fact bringing her to Hagerstown, where Susan Hays lived. It was also evidence tending to show that Louisa Ross got to the appellant\u2019s house by design. The paper was also evidence of the acts and conduct of Mc-Cauley, a co-conspirator and confederate. It was also evidence tending to show an intention on the part of McCauley and Louisa Ross to produce the abortion, resorting to an artifice to conceal her whereabouts. Conspiracies are generally only proven by circumstances. 3 <em>Greenleaf </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number><em>on Ev., secs. </em>93 <em>and </em>94; <em>Roscoe on Crim.

His knowledge of her condition was certainly a circumstance as <em>against him </em>in connection with the solicitation to her to leave home, and the facts developed in the subsequent period of the trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-6\">The acts, knowledge and declarations of one co-conspirator, whilst the conspiracy is in motion, are evidence against the others. The parties here are charged, and the record supports the charge, with a confederation to commit the crime charged; and the knowledge by McCauley of the situation of Louisa Ross, explains his subsequent as well as his previous conduct, and throws light on the connection proved in this case between him and Susan Hays. The evidence was offered with the proffer to follow it up with proof of the confederation between the parties charged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-7\">Proof of the common purpose between the parties charged, and the knowledge of the condition of Louisa Ross by McCauley, not only explains <em>his </em>conduct, but the conduct of the appellant. It was a. fact that shed light on the conduct of each. The motives, purposes, acts and conduct of McCauley, are evidence against the appellant charged with being in complicity with him in the same crime. His knowledge gives color and meaning to his acts, and these acts are evidence against the appellant. 1 <em>Greenl. on Ev., sec. </em>111; 3 <em>Greenl. on Ev., secs. </em>93, 94; <em>Roscoe\u2019s Crim. Ev., </em>387, 388, <em>(side.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-8\">The question as to the character of the house of the traverser, and the answer thereto, were proper and legitimate. It was certainly legitimate to prove the character of the house, and show that it was not a hotel, a boarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>house, a lying-in house, or any other hind of house for the accommodation of the sick and ailing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-5\">But the proof tended to show that the place where the girl had been taken, was one suited for the perpetration of such a crime as is charged here. It was a fact, a circumstance that went to sustain the case; and although it affects incidentally, or in the distance, the character of the accused, yet it is not for that reason inadmissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-6\">A house of ill-fame would he one of the very places most fitted for the perpetration of a crime like this. Such an establishment, above all others, would he one in which a guilty party, as McCauley was, would he most likely to look for and find confederation in his unlawful purpose, and at the same time secure concealment against exposure or detection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-7\">The character of the place where McCauley had concealed this girl, and the pursuits, occupations and habits of the owner of the house, were all involved in the question and answer objected to. There was no other mode of ascertaining the character of the house.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-8\">And the character of a house, like that of individuals, must he proved by general reputation, and can bo proved only in that way. 2 <em>Bishop\u2019s Cr.

The proviso is in the following words : <em>\u201c </em>Provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be construed- so as to prohibit the supervision and management by a regular practitioner of medicine of all cases of abortion, occurring spontaneously, either as the result of accident, constitutional debility, or any other natural cause; or the production of abortion by a regular practitioner of medicine when, after consulting with one or more respectable physicians,* he shall be satisfied that the fcetus is dead, or that no other method will secure the safety of the mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Without stopping to inquire whether, looking to the Act and its proviso, it was necessary in this case to negative the proviso, we are clearly of opinion that each count of the indictment does sufficiently negative the proviso. The Act makes it a criminal offence for any one to cause an abortion, unless it is caused by a regular practitioner of medicine, and even he is prohibited from causing it except under the circumstances particularly mentioned and described in the proviso. The indictment expressly negatives the fact, that the defendants, who were jointly indicted, were regular practitioners of medicine. It followed, therefore, as a necessary consequence, that they did not come within the proviso, and were not authorized, under any circumstances, to cause abortion. The demurrer was therefore properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The first exception was taken to the admission in evidence of the paper found in a box in Louisa Eoss\u2019 drawer, two days after she left her home at Beaver Creek. The paper was objected to on two grounds ; first, because it was not sufficiently identified as the paper which was handed to her by McCauley on the 14th August; and, secondly, because no evidence had been offered, up to that stage of the trial, tending to prove a conspiracy or combination between McCauley and the appellant, and therefore no act, declaration or letter of McCauley was admissible in evidence against her, and there was no offer to follow up the introduction of this paper with further evidence to connect the appellant with the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Mrs. Eoss testified that she could neither read nor write, hut that she saw McCauley hand Louisa Eoss a piece of paper the day before she left her home, and that she put the paper in a box in her drawer, and that the Sunday after she left home, the witness found the paper, offered in evidence, in the same box and drawer into which Louisa had put it, and in which there were no other papers ; that she believed it to be the same paper, which was given by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>McCauley to her daughter, because it looked like it had been torn from a blank-book ; that she had observed blue lines upon it, and that it had not been torn straight; that she and her husband had been the only occupants of the house in which they lived, after Louisa left, and that the latter had left home on the day designated in said paper, and had gone in the direction therein 'mentioned. It was further proved that Mrs. Ross, upon finding the paper, handed it to Annie Ross to read. Annie Ross then proved that the paper, so handed to and read by her, was the same paper then proposed to be offered in evidence. In connection with the offer of the said paper, the State further offered to prove that McCauley was seen with Louisa Ross, the same evening she left her home, in Hagerstown, six miles from her home. The Court admitted the paper to be read to the jury with an instruction from the Court that, if they believed it to be the same paper given by McCauley to Louisa Ross, then it was evidence tending t\u00f3 show the circumstances under which she left her home, and by whom induced to leave it; but that, if they were not satisfied of the identity of the paper as that given by McCauley to Louisa Ross, then they should\u201d not consider it at all. There was certainly evidence tending to prove that the paper offered was the same that was given by McCauley to Louisa Ross on the 14th August, and it was manifestly proper for the Court to submit that evidence to the jury, especially when so carefully guarded by the instruction accompanying its submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">It does appear that, at the time this paper was submitted to the jury, no evidence had been introduced to connect the appellant with McCauley, or with the commission of the offence charged in the indictment, and it does not appear from the record, that the offer of the paper was accompanied by an offer to follow it up with further evidence, tending to prove a conspiracy or combination between McCauley and the appellant, to produce an abortion upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Louisa Ross. If such an offer had accompanied the offer of the paper, the latter would have been properly admissible, and if the State had failed to introduce further proof tending to connect the appellant with the crime, the Court would, on motion of the appellant\u2019s counsel, have withdrawn said paper from the jury, and instructed them not to consider it in making up their verdict. The record shows however, that evidence was introduced during the progress of the trial, to prove that there was a conspiracy between McCauley and the appellant, to produce an abortion upon Louisa Ross. One of the witnesses swore, that the appellant told her in June, that she expected a girl from Beaver Creek, to arrive at her house to be operated upon, to have her baby put away, but did not state the name of the girl. It was further proved, that on the evening of the day, on which Louisa Ross left her home, she was seen in company with McCauley in Hagerstown, going in the direction of the appellant\u2019s house, and that she remained at the appellant\u2019s house until the time of her death. It further appears in proof, that McCauley went to summon a doctor to attend her at the appellant\u2019s house, that an abortion was there produced by the appellant, and that McCauley went to the house and carried the child away. All these facts were testified to, and they tended strongly to prove a conspiracy between McCauley and the appellant, and if they had been proved before the paper was offered, there can be no question that the paper would then have been legally admissible. So, as we have before said, would it have been admissible if the offer of it, had been accompanied by an offer, to follow it up with further proof to show the conspiracy and combination between the parties jointly indicted. The paper being inadmissible at the time it was offered, solely upon the ground of a want of a formal offer to follow it up with further proof, its rejection at that stage of the trial, would have only had the effect of postponing its introduction to a later stage of the trial, when the evidence of the conspiracy we have referred to, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>had heen introduced. As it would have been clearly admissible after the introduction of such proof, and such proof was submitted to the jury, we are of opinion that the appellant was not injured by the admission of the paper at the particular time when it was admitted, and that the judgment ought not to be reversed upon this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The second exception was taken to the admission in evidence of certain declarations of McCauley in July, with reference to Louisa Ross\u2019 condition, for the purpose of showing that he knew she was then pregnant, the State offering to follow it up with proof of conspiracy, or confederation between him and the appellant, to produce the abortion as charged in the indictment. What we have said in disposing of the first exception, disposes of this-also. There was no error in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The third exception was taken to the question, \u201c What character of house does Susan Hays keep?\u201d and the answer thereto, \u201cfrom general reputation, she keeps a house of ill-fame.\u201d It had already been proved, that Louisa Ross had been an inmate of the appellant\u2019s house, that an abortion had been produced upon her at that house, and that McCauley had been seen to visit it, while Louisa Ross was there. The time, place and circumstances, at, and under, which a crime is committed, are always admissible, and proper evidence upon a criminal trial. If one entices another into a retired and secluded place, and there kills him, the character and surroundings of the place are always the subject of proof to the jury, or if one takes a girl to a house of ill-fame, and there causes an abortion to be jnoduced upon her, the character of the house is admissible in evidence, in order that the jury may know, whether the place is one where such a crime could be committed without much danger of detection and punishment. Such evidence is not an attack upon the good character of the party charged. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>such proof' may incidentally affect it, is no ground of objection to the admissibility of the evidence. We find no error in the ruling of the Court in this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">There is no error in the ruling of the Court in the fourth exception. After Louisa Ross\u2019 death there was a coroner\u2019s inquest, and the appellant was sworn and examined as a witness before the inquest. At that time no charge had been preferred against her, nor was she under arrest. She at that time gave an account of the circumstances attending the arrival of Louisa Ross at her house and her sickness and deatli there. It is always competent 1'or the State, in trials for criminal offences, to prove that the parties charged have previously made false or contradictory statements with respect to the circumstances attending the commission of the crime and the facts bearing upon themselves. We can discover no valid objection to the introduction of such statements made by the appellant in this'case.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Dr. Riddlemoser, a witness on the part of the defence, proved that he was a physician, and had attended Louisa Ross at the appellant\u2019s house, and described her symptoms and condition, and stated that she complained of a pressing and burning in the stomach; the traverser then offered to prove by this witness that besides making a personal examination of her, he inquired her symptoms and feelings, and that, in reply, she stated, in addition to what he had before testified to, that she started from her home, on Beaver Creek, which was six or seven miles from Hagerstown, on her way to Mrs. Hays, and on her way, something like a lump dropped from her, and that she had been taking some stuff, and that she did not know exactly what was the matter with her. Upon objection made to this evidence by the State, the Court sustained the objection to that part of the offer which proposed to give the statement of Louisa Ross as to something having dropped from her on her way to Hagerstown; that she had been taking some stuff, and that she did not know what was the matter with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>her, hut decided that any thing she said relating to her then condition, the seat of her pain and her description of its nature and extent, and any expression of her bodily and mental feelings, and any representation of her then \u25a0existing disease or malady, were admissible. What she stated in regard to her journey, and what happened while \u25a0on her way, and that she had been taking some stuff was a mere narrative of what had taken place before the physician visited her,t and was not legally admissible. We think the ruling of the Court went to the full extent to which the rules of evidence permit the declarations of sick persons to be given to the jury.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b664-8\">(Decided 25th June, 1874.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The statement which was excluded by the 'Court was not admissible, as contended for by the appellant\u2019s counsel, either as a dying declaration or as <em>res </em>gestee, and was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The judgment appealed from will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
