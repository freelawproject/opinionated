On the same day judgment was rendered by confession in favor of the plaintiff for $1010.00, with interest from the 24th of February, 1873, and costs. On the 16th of July, 1873, a <em>fi.fa. </em>was issued upon this judgment, and upon the 8th of September, following, the sheriff made return of a levy and sale made by him and of his application of the proceeds of sale to the payment of costs and expenses, leaving a net balance in his hands of $797.83, which he was ready to bring into Court. Subsequent to this return a petition was filed \u2019by J ames W.

If then, this money has vested in the assignee in bankruptcy under the operation of the Bankrupt law, it would seem to be the duty of this Court to direct it to be paid to him instead of the plaintiff in the cause. But it is contended on the part of the plaintiff, that the money has vested in the assignee by reason of a forfeiture declared by the Bankrupt law, and that all such forfeitures should be enforced by appropriate proceedings in Courts of the United States, and that therefore this Court has no jurisdiction of the matter. It is not denied that the assignee as the representative of the bankrupt and of his creditors would have the right to collect by the aid of a State Court an ordinary debt, or any money due to the bankrupt, by virtue of the laws of the State or the principles of the common law, hut it is insisted that because the judgment in this case is fraudulent and void by virtue of the provisions of the Bankrupt law, this Court by directing payment to the assignee, would be enforcing a forfeiture under that Act, which it has no right to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-6\">\u201cIn questions growing out of the Bankrupt law, as in other matters, it is no doubt often difficult to settle the true line of distinction between the jurisdiction of the Courts of the States, and those of the United States, but the manner in which the question is presented in this case, relieves it of .all difficulty. This Court is not called on to institute proceedings to declare a forfeiture under that Act, but to pay over a fund actually in Court to the person lawfully entitled. The facts are admitted, and no proceedings are necessary to establish a forfeiture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number><em>\u201c </em>It is conceded that the judgment is fraudulent and void under the provisions of the Bankrupt law. Section 35 of the Brankrupt law, provides, that where an improper preference has been given, the assignee in bankruptcy \u2018 may recover the property or the value of it from the person receiving it or so benefited.\u2019 The provision is without doubt constitutional. But the Courts of the United States have no jurisdiction over a judgment in this Court, or over a fund in its custody. This being so, there is no proceeding by which the assignee can obtain possession of the fund, except by filing a petition in this Court, and there can he no valid objection to his doing do. It would be strange indeed, if the plaintiff should be held to be entitled to the fruits of a fraudulent judgment for the reason that it is fraudulent, and is therefore made void by the bankrupt law., The demurrer must therefore he <em>\u2018 </em>overruled,\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-5\">The plaintiff then answered the petition, making certain denials which are set forth in the opinion of this Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-6\">The case being heard upon the petition and answer, the Court below passed an order dismissing the petition and directing the money in Court, after deducting a claim for rent, to be paid to the plaintiff. The petitioner appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b417-7\">The cause was argued before Babtol, C. J., Milleb, Alvey and RoBisrsosr, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-8\"><em>Harris J. Chilton, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-9\">A fraudulent assignment, under six months, is <em>per se, </em>an act of bankruptcy under the 35th section of the Bankrupt Act, of March 2d, 1867. A confession of judgment is a transfer of property; if without a stay of execution it can he made available as a lien at any moment by an execution. Such a transfer under the six months\u2019 clause is about the same kind of preference as a confession of judgment under the four months\u2019 clause; or, in other words, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>the two sections are about the same in meaning, and therefore any \u201ctransfer\u201d or \u201cgift\u201d of a judgment under six months, with intent to give a preference, is void <em>per se. </em>It is the intention of the Bankrupt Act to strike at the root of all preferences obtained by a creditor when his debtor is insolvent. <em>Bump on Bankruptcy, and many cases cited on page </em>592.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-5\">The intent is the main thing, even if the fraud and preference were after - six' months. It makes the intent to prefer or give an advantage to one creditor the important thing, and this may concur with pressure on the part of the creditor. <em>(Bump, </em>542.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-6\">The fact that Downey wanted a confession of judgment instead of an open suit, shows clearly that he wanted a preference. Where the bankrupt, being indebted to a creditor on promissory notes due and to become due, gave a promissory note, payable one day after date, with warrant to confess judgment, and judgment thereon was obtained in November, and execution levied on the bankrupt's goods, before proceedings in bankruptcy, instituted by other creditors in January following, it was held that this act of the bankrupt was an act of bankruptcy, and sought to give a preference. <em>Fitch, et al. vs. McGie, District of Wisconsin.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-7\">The judgment creditor claims a preference by reason of execution and levy, but the Court says, \u201can insolvent debtor commits an act of bankruptcy when he gives any warrant to confess judgment, or procures or suffers his property to be taken on,legal process.\u201d It does not name anjr time, in this opinion, making the intention and knowledge of the creditor the guide, even if over six months. <em>American Law Times Reports, May number, A. D. </em>1869, <em>No. </em>5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-8\">\u2022The 35th and 39th sections of the Bankrupt Act make certain things done acts of bankruptcy <em>per se, </em>but from the spirit and intention of the law, acts of fraud, even after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>the limitations as to time, are acts of bankruptcy. <em>\u201c </em>When a creditor accepts a security he is conclusively presumed to know what appears on its face, and to have reasonable cause to believe it was intended to accomplish its ordinary and necessary effect/ \u2019 <em>In </em>re, <em>Lewis B. Graham vs. Assignee of Caroline A. Martin and E. B.

On the 20th November, 1873, we filed a petition and exhibits, which clearly bring to the notice of the State Court the bankruptcy proceedings officially. And after the demurrer was put in to our petition, the Court should have turned the money over to the assignee, but instead of making an order, the Court files an extended opinion overruling tlie demurrer, in which the Court says: \u201cIf then this money has vested in the assignee in bankruptcy under the operation of the Bankrupt law, it would seem to be the duty of this Court to direct it to he paid to him instead of the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-7\">Now because of this portion of the opinion filed, tbe judgment was a judgment on the merits of the case, and not simply a decision overruling the demurrer filed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-8\">\u201c A decision upon a demurrer which has clearly gone to the merits of the case, is an effectual bar to further litigation.\u201d <em>Bigelow on Estoppel. </em>121.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-9\">\u201cA judgment on general demurrer to the declaration is a judgment on the merits and is conclusive in a subsequent suit on the same cause of action.\u201d <em>Perkins vs. Moore, </em>16 <em>Alabama, </em>17.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-10\">\u201cA general demurrer to a plea confesses all facts stated in the plea, provided such facts be well pleaded.\u201d <em>Wash. and Balt.

F. Bump, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-7\">The demurrer was interposed upon the ground that the Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the petition, for two reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-8\">1st. The petition proceeds upon the ground that the plaintiff by the levy obtained a preference, which is void under the 35th section of the Bankrupt law. The provisions of that section are penal, and the State Courts have no jurisdiction to enforce them. <em>Vorhees vs. Frisbie, </em>25 <em>Mich., </em>476 ; <em>Bingham vs. Clafflin, </em>31 <em>Wis., </em>607 ; <em>Gilbert vs. Priest, </em>65 <em>Barb., </em>444; <em>S.

The assignee intervening in a court of law, must show a <em>legal title to the fund. </em>The money in Court never belonged to the bankrupt, and consequently he cannot claim it by mere succession to the debtor\u2019s rights. If he claims it by virtue of the 35th section of the Bankrupt law, he can only do so by alleging that the sheriff\u2019s sale is void. If that sale is void, the money becomes vested in the purchaser at that sale from whom the money came. Consequently the title will not then vest in him. <em>Lawrence vs. Bank, </em>35 <em>N.

That the debtor was insolvent. 2nd. That the transfer was made with a view to give a preference. 3rd. That the creditor had reasonable cause to believe the debtor to be insolvent; and, 4th. That the creditor also had reasonable cause to believe that the transfer was in fraud of the provisions of the Act. 5th.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AcD\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">We fully concur in the ruling of the City Court upon the demurrer, and in the reasoning upon which the learned Judge rested his decision. In support of these,views, we may refer to the decision of the Court of Appeals of New York, in <em>Cook vs. Waters, </em>9 <em>N. B. R., </em>155, as expressing the true ground upon which the rights of an assignee in Bankruptcy may be asserted by proceeding in a State Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">It was there held that such assignee \u2018\u2018may sue in a State Court for the enforcement of any right vested in him by the bankrupt Act, as for the recovery of property transferred in fraud of that Act within six months prior to the commencement of bankrupt proceedings. That the State Court in passing upon claims of assignees in bankruptcy, is not proceeding under the bankrupt Act; but simply recognizes that Act as the source of the assignee\u2019s title, in the same manner as it would, if he derived his title from a deed or contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">That decision was contrary to the ruling of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in <em>Bingham vs. Claflin, 7 N. B. R., </em>412, and that of the Supreme Court of Michigan in <em>Vorhees vs. Frisbie, </em>8 <em>N. B. R., </em>152. But it is supported by <em>Ward vs. Jenkins, </em>10 <em>Met., </em>583, a case under the former bankrupt Act; and by <em>Stevens vs. Mech. S. Bank, </em>101 <em>Mass., </em>109; <em>Forbes vs. Howe, </em>102 <em>Mass., </em>428; <em>Hastings vs. Folder, </em>2 <em>Carter, </em>216; <em>Boone vs. Hall, </em>7 <em>Bush., </em>66, <em>and Mays vs. Man. N.

The object of the demurrer was merely to raise the question of jurisdiction, and being overruled, the appellee was entitled to file an answer, and be heard upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The petition alleges that one Isaac Larnberd was adjudicated a bankrupt on the 29th day of July, 1873, and the appellant was duly appointed assignee. That on the 27th day of February, 1873, the appellee obtained a judgment against Larnberd, by confession. That <em>fieri facias </em>had been issued thereon, the personal property of Larnberd had been seized and sold by the sheriff, and the sum of $797.83 realized from the sales; which was then in Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The petition charges that the judgment was a fraud upon the bankrupt Act, because it was confessed at a time when the defendant (Larnberd) was unable in the ordinary course of business to pay his debts, and was hopelessly bankrupt; and that the appellee knew these facts ; and further that the confession of judgment was made in contemplation of bankruptcy, and the petitioner claims the fund in Court, realized under the execution, as properly payable to him as assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The appellee in his answer states that the judgment was obtained on an indebtedness for that sum, due and owing to him from Larnberd ; that the same was rendered <em>more than four months before the proceedings in bankruptcy were commenced.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">\u201cHe denies all charges of fraud in obtaining the judgment, denies that Larnberd was at the time the judgment was rendered or the levy made, either insolvent or bankrupt, within the respondent\u2019s knowledge; and further denies, that at either of those times he had reasonable cause to believe Larnberd to be insolvent, and avers that the judgment was not confessed in contemplation of bankruptcy, so far as the respondent has any knowledge; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>that the levy was not made with a view to obtain any preference over other creditors, for he did not know that there were any other creditors, and that the judgment was not confessed with any such view by the defendant, Lamberd.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The answer is Verified by oath, and no evidence was produced to contradict it. It is difficult to see, on what ground the appellant\u2019s claim can be maintained in the face of the uncontradicted statements in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">It is contended that the confession of judgment was a fraudulent preference and void under the 35th section of the bankrupt law.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">That section contains two clauses the difference between which, is very clearly defined by Mr. Justice Swayne in <em>Gibson vs. Warden, </em>14 <em>Wall., </em>244, 298, 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">We quote from the head note.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">\u201cThe two clauses of the 35th section differ mainly in their application to two different classes of recipients of the bankrupt\u2019s property or means, that is to say the first clause is limited to a creditor, or person having a claim against the bankrupt, or who is under any liability for him, and who receives money or property by way of preference; and the second clause applies to the purchase of property of the bankrupt, by any person who has no claim against him and is under no liability for him,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">It is obvious that-the transaction here assailed, if within the Act, must fall within the first clause of the 35th section, which avoids the prohibited acts \u201cif done within four months before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, \u2019 \u2019 14 <em>Wal., </em>248, and to bring the case within this clause it must appear that Lamberd was at the time insolvent, or in contemplation of insolvency, that the judgment was confessed with a view to give a preference to the appellee, and <em>that the appellee hnew </em>or had reason to believe that the transaction was in fraud of the statute, 14 <em>Wal., </em>248.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">Now in this case the judgment was confessed more than four months before the proceedings in bankruptcy were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>begun, and besides tbe answer distinctly avers (and there_ is no, proof to tbe contrary) that tbe appellee had no knowledge of the insolvency of Lamberd, or any reason to believe that he was insolvent, or in contemplation of bankruptcy.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b425-9\">(Decided 23rd June, 1874.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">In this state of facts the Court below was right in dismissing the petition. It is well settled that the proceedings by an assignee authorized by the 39th section, must depend upon his rights under the 35th section. The two sections are to be construed together, as said by Judge Shaeswood in <em>Holl vs. Deshler, </em>71 <em>Pa., </em>302. The words in the 39th section \u201cif.such person shall be adjudged a bankrupt, the assignee may recover back the money, or other property so paid, sold, assigned or transferred contrary to this Act,\u201d must be construed so as to be consistent with the 3oth section, namely, provided the petition be filed <em>within fov/r months, </em>in case of a preference to a creditor, or within six months, in case \u201cof a transfer to a stranger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The same decision was made in <em>Collins vs. Gray, </em>8 <em>Blatchford, C. C. R., </em>483, where are cited to the same effect, <em>Hubbard vs. The Allaire Works, </em>7 <em>Blatchf. C. C. R., </em>284, and <em>Bean vs. Brookmire, </em>1 <em>Dillon, C. C. R., </em>24.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The order of the City Court in this case, will be affirmed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
