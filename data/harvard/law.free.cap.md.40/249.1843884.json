Brooke, as trustee for Martha G. Brooke, the wife of said Wm. Pinkney Brooke, his promissory notes, in settlement of the said indebtedness, and on the 11th of the same month he and his wife executed a mortgage of real estate in Prince George\u2019s county, to said John B. Brooke, as trustee, to secure the payment of said notes. At the time the \u2022 indebtedness to Wm. Pinkney Brooke was so transferred to his wife he was himself insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-7\">An attachment was subsequently issued by the appellant in this case, upon a judgment recovered against Wm.' Pinkney Brooke, which was laid in the hands of J ohn B. Brooke, trustee of Wm. Pinkney Brooke, and as trustee of Martha G. Brooke, and upon the interest of Wm.

Bartholow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-8\">No judgment of condemnation was entered against J. P. Bartholow, n\u00f3r were any pleas filed by him. The case as against all the garnishees was laid before the Court by consent, and after all the evidence was in and the prayers had been submitted to, hut not passed upon by the Court, the plaintiffs moved that a separate suit might he docketed against said Bartholow, as the evidence showed, or tended to show, that he was separately, and not jointly, indebted to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-9\">This motion the Court refused to grant, and its refusal is one of the grounds of this appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-10\">At the time of the trial W.

Bartholow to John B. Brooke, trustee for Martha G. Brooke, wife of Wm. Pinkney Brooke, was an acquisition of property passing from the husband to the wife \u201cin prejudice of the rights of subsisting creditors,\u201d and not valid. <em>Code of Pub. Genl.

Bartholow to William Pinkney Brooke, from William Pinkney Brooke to John B. Brooke, trustee of Mrs. Martha Gr. Brooke, wife of W. Pinkney Brooke, was invalid, because upon the facts set forth -in the prayer it was void as against subsisting creditors, of whom the plaintiff was one. <em>Spindler vs. Atkinson, </em>1 <em>Md. Ch. Dec., </em>507 ; <em>Waters vs. Dashiell, </em>1 <em>Md., </em>470; <em>Jones vs. Slubey, </em>5 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>372.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-6\">The Court erred in refusing the second prayer, if the first prayer should not have been granted. The second prayer stated the law even too favorably for the defendants. The first prayer went as far as the law requires in order to find the transfer invalid. If the acquisition of property, in the amount secured to be paid by the said notes and mortgage, was not valid as against the plaintiffs, then, although assigned by Mrs. Brooke, to whom the trustee sent them, before the attachment was laid, she could pass no greater interest than she acquired, namely, the property in the notes and mortgage, subject to the rights of the subsisting creditors of the husband.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-7\">The rights of the subsisting creditors of Wm. Pinkney Brooke not\" having passed, she could transfer no greater-rights than she or he.r trustee acquired.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-8\">The third prayer proceeds upon the distinction between the notes or indebtedness itself, and the mortgage executed to secure the same. The execution of the notes and mortgage transferred or conveyed all the rights of Bartholow to John B. Brooke, trustee of Mrs. Brooke, except so far as the rights of subsisting creditors were concerned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-9\">The law would therefore deal with the notes as charged <em>cumonere: </em>that is with the claim of subsisting creditors. The transfer of the notes would not relieve them of this burden. Hence the law, there being no assignment of the mortgage proved, would not treat the mortgage as being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>assigned, but all tbe right, title and interest conveyed hy Bartholow and wife to John B. Brooke, trustee, would remain in him under the mortgage, to the extent of the claims of subsisting creditors, and this the plaintiffs were entitled to have condemnation of, as the attachment had been laid on this interest in the land under the mortgage, which had been conveyed to secure the payment of the indebtedness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-5\">This interest in the land conveyed hy the mortgage to John B. Brooke, trustee, was <em>separate </em>and <em>distinct </em>from the indebtedness. If Bartholow had only executed the notes, then John B. Brooke, a trustee, to whom the notes were drawn payable, prior to the payment of the notes to him, could only be treated as claimant of the amount due on the notes. The indebtedness existing on the notes alone would he reached by laying the attachment in the hands of Bartholow. This was clone to bind the rights, and credits, and indebtedness evidenced by the notes. But the interest and right and title which a mortgagee takes in the land itself to secure the payment of the debt, is something which is liable to be attached.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-6\">Under the third prayer the plaintiffs were entitled to a judgment of condemnation of all the right, title and interest of John B. Brooke, trustee of Martha G-. Brooke, as mortgagee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-7\">When the attachment was issued the plaintiffs were entirely ignorant whether Bartholow had ever paid the money due on the note or not, and in point of fact supposed from what they had been informed, that the money had heen paid and was held by John B. Brooke, trustee of Mrs. Brooke, or if the whole had not been paid they did not know how much was due by Bartholow, and what amount had heen paid to John B. Brooke. The evidence clearly showed that no part of the money had been paid by Bartholow. Bartholow, as garnishee, had put in no plea. William Pinkney Brooke, the defendant in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>judgment, had put in no plea for him. The plaintiffs were, therefore, entitled to judgment of condemnation of the amount due*on the notes by Bartholow against him. 1 <em>Code, Art. </em>10, <em>secs. </em>13 and 17 ; <em>Dawson, Adm\u2019r, vs. Contee, </em>22 <em>Md., </em>27; <em>Groome, Adm\u2019r, vs. Lewis, </em>23 <em>Md., </em>137.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-5\">The garnishee, Bartholow, having made no defence, the plaintiffs were entitled to have a separate suit docketed against him so as to have judgment against him, which judgment would be final against him in the separate suit, and would not be liable to await the decision of this Court on appeal in this case. <em>Berry vs. Matthews, </em>13 <em>Md., </em>558 ; <em>Evans\u2019 Pract., </em>139.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b268-6\"><em>Alexander H. Hobbs, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b268-7\">Grason, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AOX\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">This cause was submitted to the Court below, without the intervention of a jury, and two exceptions were taken by the plaintiffs, one to the rejection of. its four prayers and the other to the overruling its motion to have a separate suit docketed against Jeremiah P. Bartholow, one of the garnishees.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">At the argument of the case in this Court it was conceded by the appellants\u2019 counsel that the fourth prayer was properly rejected; so that it is only necessary to consider whether there was error in refusing to grant the instructions asked by the first, second and third.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">It appears from the record that the notes, given by Bartholow to John B. Brooke, trustee of Mrs. Martha G-. Brooke, were transferred to W. B. Bowie. At what time this transfer took place the record does not disclose ; but the proof shows that they were delivered , by John B. Brooke, trustee, to either Mrs. Martha G-. Brooke or Baker, within a very short time after they came into his possession, and there is no evidence to show that they had not been transferred to W. B. Bowie before the attachment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>this case was issued. As these notes were given for a debt due by Barth olow to William Pinkney Brooke, who was then insolvent, the transfer of the indebtedness to his wife was in prejudice of the rights of his then subsisting creditors, and was void as against them so far as she and her trustee were concerned. But the notes were transferred to W. B. Bowie, and lie would be entitled to tbem and to the mortgage given to secure their payment, unless he received them without consideration, or had knowledge that they were given to the trustee of Mrs. Brooke for an indebtedness due to Wm. Pinkney Brooke, and that the transfer of this indebtedness by him to his wife was in prejudice of the rights of his creditors. There is nothing on the face of the notes or mortgage to indicate the real facts of the transaction, nor was any proof whatever offered tending to show that Bowie did not pay value for the notes, or that he had any notice that they were given for a debt due to Wm. Pinkney Brooke, or that the transaction was in prejudice of the rights of Wm. Pinkney Brooke's creditors. It was incumbent upon the plaintiff to adduce proof of these facts, and having failed to do so, the presumption is that Bowie is the <em>bona fide </em>holder of the notes for consideration, and without notice, and the three first prayers of the plaintiff\u2019 were therefore properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">After all the proof had been offered, and after the prayers had been presented, but before the Court bad delivered its opinion upon them, it appearing from the evidence that Bartholow, if indebted to Wm. Pinkney Brooke, was separately indebted to him and not jointly with the other garnishees, the plaintiff filed a motion to have a separate suit docketed against him. The Court overruled the motion and refused to docket such separate suit. The motion having been made before the case was closed, it was in time, and it was error to overrule it. Where an attachment is laid in the hands of several garnishees, who are severally indebted to the defendant in the attachment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>or who severally have his property in their possession, the correct practice is to docket separate suits against each garnishee, so that the suit against each may he proceeded with independently of the others. <em>Berry vs. Matthews &amp; Chapman, </em>13 <em>Md., </em>558. Section 31 of Article 10, of the Code, provides that, if neither the defendant nor the garnishee, in whose hands an attachment is laid, appear at the return of the attachment, and show sufficient cause to the contrary, the Court shall condemn the property and credits so attached, and award execution thereof. In this case neither the defendant in the attachment nor Bartholow appeared at the return of the attachment, and shewed, cause to the contrary, and therefore the plaintiff was entitled to have condemnation of the credits attached in the hands of Bartholow, and to this end a separate suit ought to have keen docketed against him.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b270-8\">(Decided 4th June, 1874.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The rulings of the Court helow in the first exception are affirmed, hut upon the second exception its judgment will he reversed, and the cause remanded, in order that a separate suit may he docketed against Jeremiah P. Bartholow, garnishee of Wm. Pinkney Brooke, and then he will have the opportunity of making his defence, if he have any, to a condemnation of credits in his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
