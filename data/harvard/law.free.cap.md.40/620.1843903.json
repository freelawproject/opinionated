Extracts from the Code of Virginia were also filed, and admitted to be in force in the month of November, 1861?, by which the duties of clerks of Courts in docketing, indexing and furnishing abstracts of judgments were prescribed, and by which it was further prescribed, that all judgments for money theretofore or thereafter to be rendered against any person, should be a lien on all his real estate held at or after the date of the judgment, or if rendered in Court, at or after the commencement of the term at which it was rendered; and also that no judgment should be a lien on real estate as against a purchaser for a valuable consideration, without notice unless it be docketed as prescribed in said extracts. One of the judgments referred to in said agreement, was recovered in the County Court of Pittsylvania prior to the month of November, lSOV, in which month one of the defendants in the judgment made a conveyance of a parcel of land situate in said county. The grantee under this conveyance took out a policy of insurance upon the buildings on the land, and also upon certain machinery therein. The policy contained the following proviso: \u201cAny incumbrance on the property hereby insured, whether existing at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>time of issuing this policy or imposed subsequently thereto, must he assented toby the company, otherwise the policy shall he void.\u201d The existence of the judgments was not made known to the company.

The property was located in the county of Pittsylvania in the State of Virginia. The 19th clause of the policy provides that, \u201cany incumbrance on the property hereby insured, whether existing at the time of issuing this policy or imposed subsequent thereto, must he assented to by this companjr, otherwise the policy shall be void \u201d A commission to take testimony was issued to the State of Virginia, under which the abstracts of certain judgments rendered in that State, were filed with an agreement that they might be offered in evidence as records of the Court therein styled, with the same effect as if the said judgments and records had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>been duly autbentioated as sucb according to tbe Act of Congress and tbe laws of Maryland; tbe plaintiff reserving tbe right to object to sucb records, as evidence upon all other grounds except the want of due authentication as records, and with the same reservation, the facts set forth in the certificates accompanying said abstracts were admitted to be true. One of the judgments according to the abstracts furnished, appeared to have been rendered on the 24-th of August, 1867, in the county Court of Pittsylvania, in favor of Wm. R. McCoy, for the benefit of Elisha Barks-dale, Jr., against W. M. Keen and J. M. Walker for $5250 with interest and costs ; and to have been entered on the lien docket November 9th, 1867. On the 13th of November, 1867, J. M. Walker conveyed to the plaintiff certain land situated in Pittsylvania county, upon which is located the property insured under the policy now in suit. The following extracts from the Code of Virginia, were also filed with an agreement that they were in full force as part of the laws of Virginia in the month of November, 1867, when the deed from Walker to Bowman was executed and recorded, viz :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-5\">Oh. 186, sec. 3. \u201cIn the following section the word \u2018judgment\u2019 shall include any bond or recognizance which has the force of a judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-6\">\u201cSect. 4.

Walker, dated August 24th, 1867, for $5250, with interest from 1st January, 1864, is conclusive evidence of the existence of the judgment therein referred to in the County Court of Pittsylvania county, and the jury cannot find that there was not such a judgment in said County Court of Pittsylvania county, and there being no evidence that the existence of said judgment was made known to the Insurance Company at the time of the insurance, or assented to by said company, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, provided the jury believe the evidence as to the law of the State of Virginia with reference to the lien of judgments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b637-7\">The Court, (Dobbin, J.,) granted the plaintiff\u2019s first prayer with the following modification:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b637-8\">Unless the jury shall find the facts stated in the defendant\u2019s prayer, in which event they will find for the defendant ; and rejected all the other prayers of the plaintiff, and granted the prayer of the defendant.

This clause seems necessarily to be intended as a warning to the insured,.that if he place incumbrances upon the insured property without first obtaining the assent of the company, he will avoid his policy, and (unless it he mockery) gives to him the right of choosing whether he will avoid his policy or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b638-5\">But-a judgment is not an incumbrance of this character. So far -from being <em>imposed by </em>the insured, it may be, and generally is, imposed upon him in spite of his strenuous resistance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b638-6\">The seventh condition of the policy, provides that <em>\u201c </em>when the interest of the assured in the property insured is impaired or conveyed away by sale, gift, or otherwise, this insurance to the extent of such impairment of interest, is thereby abatedthis suggests the question, how is this clause reconcilable with the first and eighteenth clauses\u2014 keeping in view the acknowledged rule of interpretation that doubtful clauses should be construed most favorably for the insured? It would seem, indeed, in view of this seventh clause that not only is a judgment no such incumbrance as will avoid this policy, but that it is, at least, doubtful whether such avoidance of the policy would result from even a sale or conveyance, which merely impaired, without absolutely destroying the interest of the assured in the insured property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b638-7\">The Courts have invariably held that covenants in leases and other instruments providing a forfeiture in case of sale, without the assent of the landlord or other party, are not to be construed as applying to cases where the sale, &amp;c., has taken place by operation of law, and without the vol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>untary agency of the party bound by the covenant, and sales under process upon judgments are always held to be \u2018 \u2018 <em>in invitum. \u2019 \u2019 Smith vs. Putnam, </em>3 <em>Pick., </em>221; <em>Starkweather vs. Insurance Co., </em>2 <em>Abbott U.

An incumbrance is an embarrassment of an estate or property, so that it cannot be disposed of without being subject to it. <em>Bouv.

Grant it! but the narrowest, and least rigid rule of interpretation the Court can adopt, is to say, that that is an incumbrance, which by law is a charge on the property, and of which the world has constructive notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-6\">Mortgages have always been held to be incumbrances. <em>Smith vs. Columbia Ins.

And if it be a mutual company, to know the incumbrances, so as to determine the value of their lien for payments and assessments. Hence, the Courts have not tied themselves to recorded charges or incumbrances.

In regard to the first question presented on this appeal, we can have no doubt. There would have been no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>reason for the agreement, dispensing with due and formal authentication of the records of the several judgments given in evidence, if the objection now urged could he maintained. It was expressly agreed, that the abstracts of judgments then made and filed with the commissioner, might he offered in evidence, as records of the Court therein styled, <em>with the same effect as if the judgments onid records had been duly authenticated as </em>such, according to the Act of Congress, and the laws of Maryland; the plaintiff reserving the right to object to such records as evidence, on other grounds than the want of due authentication ; and with the same reservation of right to object, the facts stated in the certificates accompanying the abstracts were admitted to be true. Under this agreement, the short abstracts of the judgments were to he received and have allowed to them the same force and effect as if formal and duly authenticated records of those judgments had been produced; and by virtue of the agreement, in connection with the sections of the Code of Virginia, which, were produced and admitted to he in force in that State, where the property was situate and the judgments were rendered, the abstract of the judgment of <em>McCoy, use of Barksdale, vs. Keen and Walker, </em>referred to in the Court\u2019s instruction, was not only conclusive evidence of the existence of the judgment, hut of the lien created thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">2. The 19th clause of the conditions of the policy sued on provides, that \u201cAny incumbrance on the property hereby insured, whether existing at the time of issuing this policy, or imposed subsequently thereto, must he assented to by the company, otherwise the policy shall he void; \u2019 \u2019 and the second question presented is, whether a judgment lien is an incumbrance within the meaning of this provision of the policy ?</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">It is conceded that judgment liens on the property insured existed at the date of the policy, and that the fact of their existence was not disclosed to the insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>company, and consequently were never assented to by it. Does the failure to disclose the existence of the liens render the policy void? If a judgment lien constitutes an incumbrance, within the meaning of the policy, there can be but one answer to the question, and that in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">According to the well understood meaning of the word incumbrance, it lias always been supposed to embrace judgment liens. Indeed no incumbrance is more common than that created by the liens of judgments. It has been repeatedly held, if judicial decisions could he required on such a question, that the term incumbrance does embrace judgment liens. <em>Jenkins vs. Hopkins, </em>8 <em>Pick., </em>346; <em>Smith vs. McCampbell, </em>1 <em>Blackf., </em>100; <em>Hall vs. Dean, </em>13 <em>John., </em>105; and we have not been able to find anything in any of the numerous conditions and stipulations of the policy, which, by any fair construction, will justify the restricted meaning- attempted to he assigned to the term by the plaintiff in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The condition in the policy is a substantia] and important one for the protection of the company, and there is no good reason to suppose that judgment lien's were not as much within the object of the provision as any other incumbrance. The great purpose of all such provisions in policies of insurance is to enable the insurer to determine the extent of the risk, and the nature and extent of the interest of the. insured in the premises. If the property to be insured is incumbered by judgments, mortgages, or liens for unpaid purchase money, it is always of importance for the insurance company to he informed of the fact, as upon the existence or non-existence of real interest and motive on the part of the insured to protect and preserve the property, the premium for insurance may justly be regulated. This is a substantial element in the contract of insurance; and there is no good reason for the restricted construction of the clause contended for by the counsel of the plaintiff. Clauses of a similar im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>port to the one under consideration, have heen construed by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and that Court has held, without the slightest hesitation, that judgment liens are incumbrances within the meaning of the condition.

Co., </em>56 <em>Penn., </em>210.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">As to what would be the effect on the policy of a judgment rendered against the insured <em>in invitum, </em>it is not now necessary to determine; hut as to judgments in existence at the date of the policy, and such as are thereafter rendered against the insured, by his consent or confession, and which constitute liens on the property insured, we think they are clearly within the meaning of the condition. And as the plaintiff wholly failed to make known the existence of the judgment liens, on the property at the time he applied for and obtained the policy sued on, it follows from what we have said, that the policy is void, according to the express stipulation of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">3. The third and last question presented is, whether, as part of the insurance was on the building, and part on the machinery therein, it was competent to the plaintiff to recover on the policy such amount as was apportioned to the machinery, notwithstanding the policy is void as to the building?</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">In regard to this question, the difficulty in the plaintiff\u2019s way is, that the contract is entire. The consideration for it was entire; and in such case the contract is held to be entire, although its subjects may consist of several distinct and wholly independent items. Moreover, the stipulation in regard to the forfeiture, applies to the policy as an entirety. This question is settled in this State, as it is in many of the other States, adversely to the right claimed by the plaintiff here. <em>Assum vs. Asso. Fire Ins.
