In response, Rothchild pushed Tate; and after Tate turned to discard a radio that he was holding, Rothchild punched Tate in the head, causing Tate to begin bleeding. Tate further alleged that Rothchild beat him, threw him to the floor, and handcuffed him before taking him to the shift office. Captain Shirley Smith arrived at the shift office, interrupted Correctional Lieutenant Steven Lane (who was in the office) before Lane could begin to beat Tate, and ordered Lane to leave the office after Lane repeatedly threatened to kill Tate. Smith then ordered Rothchild and several other officers to escort Tate to the infirmary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>Tate further alleged that Lieutenant Lane was waiting in the hallway on the way to the infirmary and that, after Lane told the officers \u2018yall know what to do,\u201d Rothchild and the officers twisted Tate\u2019s handcuffs, pushed him against the wall, and beat him in the head with handcuffs\u2014 causing Tate to bleed profusely. Upon hearing the altercation, Captain Smith ran into the hallway and was knocked to the ground by Rothchild and other unknown officers. After picking herself up from the floor, Smith asked Lane whether he would help stop the beating; but Lane \u2014 according to Tate \u2014 only smiled in response. Smith eventually was able to stop the beating by yelling repeatedly, and Tate was taken to the infirmary and then the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">The district court determined that the record could not support a conclusion that the officers used excessive force in subduing Tate either during the initial confrontation in the prison dormitory or during the altercation in the hallway outside the shift office. The court specifically noted that (1) Rothchild\u2019s use of force was motivated by a good-faith effort to end Tate\u2019s disruptive and violent outburst, (2) Tate\u2019s resulting injuries were <em>de minimis, </em>and (3) the prompt administration of medical treatment tempered the severity of the officers\u2019 forceful response. The court stressed that Tate\u2019s acts posed a danger to all of the officers and inmates in the area, as well as to Tate himself. The court concluded that there was no support in the record for Tate\u2019s allegation that he was attacked without justification by the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">On appeal, Tate argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because there were genuine issues of material fact about whether he or Roth-child escalated the initial encounter in the dormitory. He maintains that the evidence established that it was Rothchild who struck him and created a chaotic and dangerous situation. He further states that he was handcuffed and not resisting when Rothchild and the other officers assaulted him in the hallway.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). A district court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom, to the extent supported by the record, \u201cin the light most favorable to the nonmovant.\u201d <em>Jean-Baptiste v. Gutierrez, </em>627 F.3d 816, 820 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">The Eighth Amendment prohibits the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment. U.S. Const, amend. VIII. In considering an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim, we must consider both a subjective and objective component: (1) whether the \u201cofficials actfed] with a sufficiently culpable state of mind,\u201d and (2) \u201cif the alleged wrongdoing was objectively harmful enough to establish a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 8, 112 S.Ct. 995, 999, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992) (internal quotations omitted). Tate failed to establish the subjective and objective components of an excessive force claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">Under the subjective part of our analysis of excessive force claims under the Eighth Amendment, force is deemed legitimate in a custodial setting only so long as it is applied \u201cin a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline [and not] maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\u201d <em>Skrtich v. Thornton, </em>280 F.3d 1295, 1300 (11th Cir.2002) (citation omitted). Relevant to ascertaining whether force was used \u201cmaliciously and sadistically\u201d for the purpose of causing harm are, at least, five factors: (1) the need for the application of force, (2) the relationship between that need and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>amount of force used, (3) the extent of the prisoner\u2019s injuries, (4) the threat reasonably perceived by the officials on the basis of the facts known to them, and (5) efforts made to temper the severity of the force. <em>Cockrell v. Sparks, </em>510 F.3d 1307, 1311 (11th Cir.2007). When considering these factors, we \u201cgive a wide range of deference to prison officials acting to preserve discipline and security, including when considering decisions made at the scene of a disturbance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks, alterations, and citation omitted). We strive to avoid judgments based on hindsight.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Under the objective component, we consider whether the alleged wrongdoing was \u201cobjectively harmful enough to establish a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>503 U.S. at 8, 112 S.Ct. at 999. Eighth Amendment claims based on <em>de minimis </em>uses of physical force by prison guards are not cognizable unless they involve force that is \u201crepugnant to the conscience of mankind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9-10, 112 S.Ct. at 1000. We have determined that \u201can injury can be \u2018objectively, sufficiently serious\u2019 [to constitute a constitutional violation] only if there is more than <em>de minimus </em>injury.\u201d <em>Boxer v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1111 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">Here, the district court did not err in concluding that no genuine issues of material fact exist about whether defendants used excessive force in subduing Tate during either of the incidents giving rise to the complaint. That Tate and Rothchild were involved in a physical altercation in the prison dormitory while Rothchild was the only prison official in an area filled with inmates is undisputed. Tate does not dispute that Rothchild \u2014 in advance of a struggle \u2014 ordered Tate to step away from the gate several times after Tate approached Rothchild about getting Tate\u2019s identification card. After Rothchild attempted to push Tate away, Tate admits that he pushed Rothchild\u2019s hand away. A struggle between Rothchild and Tate resulted: Rothchild\u2019s uniform was ripped and bloodied, and Rothchild lost his radio and security keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">Tate argues that an internal investigation conducted by the Alabama Department of Corrections determined that Rothchild engaged in the unnecessary escalation of violence. The report also noted that, instead of simply locking the gate to avoid the physical confrontation, Rothchild entered the dormitory alone to confront Tate, resulting in an altercation during which Rothchild did not use just reasonable, necessary physical force. After an administrative hearing, Rothchild, however, was later found not guilty of applying unnecessary force. <em>See Fennell v. Gilstrap, </em>559 F.3d 1212, 1217 (11th Cir.2009) (highlighting that, the standard for showing excessive force in violation of the Constitution is higher than that required by a law enforcement department\u2019s administrative policies). Rothchild was found to have violated some prison policies and procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">As the district court observed correctly, Tate\u2019s threats, coupled with his refusal to obey Rothchild\u2019s commands to be quiet and move away from the gate made use of force necessary, particularly because the altercation occurred in the presence of other inmates and Rothchild was the only officer in the area. <em>See Skrtich, </em>280 F.3d at 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">On the later incident in the hallway, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Tate, shows these circumstances. Tate was placed in handcuffs while being escorted to the healthcare unit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After an officer twisted his hand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>cuffs, Tate turned around; and an officer pushed Tate against the wall and several officers beat him. Rothchild and another officer hit Tate with handcuffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\">Tate argues that the district court did not consider the facts and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to him. Furthermore, in her declaration\u2014 submitted by defendants \u2014 Captain Smith described that, although she continuously yelled for the officers (including Rothchild) to stop beating Tate in the hallway, none of them complied immediately with her orders, even when Tate ceased resisting. Our precedent, however, permits the use of force even when a defendant is not physically resisting. We have concluded that when a prisoner created a disturbance by failing to follow a prison guard\u2019s instructions and shouting obscenities, it was not unreasonable for the guard to grab the prisoner by the throat and shove him against the prison bars. <em>Bennett v. Parker, </em>898 F.2d 1580, 1538 (11th Cir.1990). Indeed, we previously concluded that the use of force sufficient to break bones did not violate the Eighth Amendment under the circumstances even though the prisoner had not offered physical resistance. <em>See Cockrell, </em>510 F.3d at 1311. And the total record shows a complex set of circumstances actually faced the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Tate does not dispute that the hallway was filled with other inmates and that he had been yelling obscenities <em>and threats </em>against the officers. The officers knew that Tate had been violent and disruptive and that he already had been involved in a recent physical altercation with Rothchild in the prison dormitory. In the light of Tate\u2019s threats and recent prior violent behavior, when Tate turned around in the hallway, the officers might have reasonably believed that force was necessary to ensure his compliance. The officers likely also recognized that a struggle with Tate could escalate to involve the other inmates in the hallway; and, therefore, they acted with the force necessary to subdue Tate and maintain order and discipline. <em>See id. </em>Force was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">About the objective part of his excessive force claim, the evidence shows Rothchild applied the amount of force necessary simply to restore order; it was not excessive. The medical records bely Tate\u2019s claim that his injury was not <em>de minimis: </em>briefly stated, he had a laceration on his forehead, several small abrasions and cuts, and a swollen right eye. It is important that he suffered no broken bones or additional injuries and that nothing evidences that he suffered permanent injury or debilitating pain. <em>See Boxer, </em>437 F.3d at 1111. Tate never lost consciousness. By the way, some of the officers were also injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">In sum, the district court did not err in concluding that no genuine issue of material fact existed on whether defendants used excessive force in violation of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-7\">.

Tate also alleged an Eighth Amendment claim against Correctional Lieutenant Steven Lane for instigation and failure to intervene, and a Fourteenth Amendment due process violation against Correctional Lieutenant James English.
