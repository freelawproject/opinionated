The district court denied White\u2019s IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP status, White is challenging the district court\u2019s certifieation. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-19\">As a threshold issue, we must first examine the basis of our jurisdiction. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). White did not timely file a notice of appeal within 30 days of the entry of the district court\u2019s order dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim and denying his motion to amend his complaint. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). Therefore, we do not have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s order. <em>See Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-20\">Although White\u2019s notice of appeal was filed within 30 days of the entry of the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of his motion to amend, the district court had already denied the motion to amend and, therefore, the motion was no longer pending before the magistrate judge at the time that the magistrate judge ruled on it. <em>See, e.g., </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1); <em>see also Smith v. School Bd. of Orange County, </em>487 F.3d 1361, 1366 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that pending objections to magistrate\u2019s order, which denied plaintiff\u2019s various discovery motions, were moot in light of district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for defendant). The issuance of a redundant order did not provide White with a second opportunity to appeal. <em>See, e.g., In re Weston, </em>18 F.3d 860, 863 (10th Cir.1994) (stating that the court would not review the appeal of a January order because a December order remained the final resolution of the matter, independent of subsequent events). Further, White would be required to appeal any ruling by the magistrate judge to the district court first, rather than to this court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1). Accordingly, White\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, and his appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
