Over three and a half years later, Perez challenged his conviction by filing a <em>pro se </em>motion under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b), arguing that his conviction was a miscarriage of justice and requesting that it be vacated. The district court asked Perez whether he wanted it to construe his filing as a motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, but Perez insisted that he wanted the district court to rule on the merits of his Rule 60(b) motion. The district court then denied that motion on the ground that Rule 60(b) does not provide relief from a criminal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">On appeal, we affirm. Rule 60(b) applies only in civil eases; a motion under that rule is not a proper way to challenge a criminal conviction or sentence. <em>United States v. Mosavi, </em>138 F.3d 1365, 1365 (11th Cir.1998); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 1 (stating that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u201cgovern the procedure in all civil actions in the United States district courts\u201d) (emphasis added). The district court offered to construe Perez\u2019s filing as a petition under the appropriate statute, but Perez declined. Nor has he argued to this Court that he is entitled to relief under any rule or statute other than Rule 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
