Specifically, he challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to award him a three-level sentencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Castillo asserts that he timely pleaded guilty and that, although he moved to withdraw the plea, the motion was based on bad advice from fellow inmates. He states that he subsequently apologized and sought to rectify the error during debriefing and that he was therefore entitled to the reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The district court\u2019s denial of a sentencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility was not \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Juarez-Duarte, 513 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.2008). Castillo moved to withdraw his plea based on his alleged confusion over the type of drug involved in his offense, which confusion the district court found to be incredible, and which credibility finding Castillo has never contested. Because Castillo falsely denied knowing that his offense involved methamphetamine in an attempt to reduce his culpability, he acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.3); <em>United States v. Medina-Aninacio, </em>325 F.3d 638, 648 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see also United States v. Angeles-Mendoza, </em>407 F.3d 742, 753 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b466-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
