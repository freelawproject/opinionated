On appeal, Thomas argues that the ALJ erred by finding that he had a \u201climited education.\u201d Thomas also argues that the ALJ erred by determining that \u201cthere were a significant number of jobs which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>existed in the national economy which the appellant could perform.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">When an ALJ denies benefits and the Appeals Council denies review, we review the ALJ\u2019s decision as if it is the Commissioner\u2019s final decision. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). We review to \u201cdetermine whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards. Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe may not decide facts anew [or] reweigh the evidence\u201d and we must defer to the ALJs decision if it \u201cis supported by substantial evidence ... even if the proof preponderates against it.\u201d <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Eligibility for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income requires that the claimant is under a disability. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423(a)(1), 1382(a)(l)(2). The ALJ must complete a five-step sequential evaluation process to determine whether a claimant is disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920. This evaluation looks to whether the claimant: (1) is engaged in substantial gainful activity; (2) has \u201ca severe medically determinable physical or mental impairment,\u201d or combination of impairments, \u201cthat meets the duration requirement\u201d; (3) has an impairment that meets or equals a statutory listing and meets the duration requirements; (4) can perform his past relevant work in light of his residual functional capacity; and (5) can adjust to other work given his residual functional capacity, age, education, and work experience. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4), 416.920(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">Thomas first argues that the ALJ erred by determining that he had a \u201climited education.\u201d A claimant\u2019s education is one of the elements that the ALJ must consider when determining whether a claimant can adjust to other work under step five of the disability determination process. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(v). In evaluating a claimant\u2019s education, formal schooling or training is the primary factor, but the ALJ may also consider past work experience and responsibilities, daily activities, and hobbies. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1564(a), 416.964(a). \u201cThe term education also includes how well [the claimant] is able to communicate in English.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 404.1564(b), 416.964(b). A claimant who is determined to have a \u201climited education\u201d has \u201cability in reasoning, arithmetic, and language skills, but not enough to ... do most of the more complex job duties needed in semi-skilled or skilled jobs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 404.1564(b)(3), 416.964(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">Thomas argues that the ALJ erred in her analysis of his educational level in several ways. First, Thomas says that the ALJ failed to \u201caddress[ ] his testimony in her decision.\u201d However, the ALJ specifically mentioned portions of Thomas\u2019s testimony in her opinion. For example, the ALJ\u2019s opinion explains how Thomas testified that he \u201cparticipated in special education classes in grade school,\u201d \u201cquit school in the ninth grade,\u201d and \u201cwas unable to understand the questionnaires that were sent to him from the Social Security Administration.\u201d While there were other parts of Thomas\u2019s testimony that the ALJ did not specifically refer to, such as Thomas\u2019s failing grades in school, the ALJ is not required to discuss every piece of evidence in her decision. <em>See Dyer, </em>395 F.3d at 1211. The ALJ must only discuss enough evidence to demonstrate that she consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>ered the claimant\u2019s condition as a whole. <em>See id. </em>We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s opinion does not demonstrate that she considered Thomas\u2019s condition as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Second, Thomas argues that the ALJ erred by relying on Thomas\u2019s numerical grade level. \u201c[I]f there is no other evidence to contradict it,\u201d an ALJ can use a claimant\u2019s \u201cnumerical grade level to determine [his] educational abilities.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1564(b), 416.964(b). Thomas\u2019s ninth grade level put him in the \u201climited education\u201d category, which generally includes individuals with <em>\u201ca </em>7th grade through the 11th grade level of formal education.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1564(b)(3), 416.964(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">Thomas asserts that his testimony contradicted his numerical grade level and therefore, it was improper for the ALJ to rely on that level to presume that he had a \u201climited education.\u201d However, there is substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s determination that Thomas had a \u201climited education\u201d independent of his numerical grade level. For example, Dr. Mussenden, who observed and examined Thomas, concluded that he \u201chad normal and appropriate speech; displayed moderate judgment and common sense; .... had a good recall for remote and recent events; ... had a good fund of general knowledge and information; ... had good mathematical skills; ... and could interpret abstract concepts.\u201d The ALJ\u2019s decision was also supported by Thomas\u2019s past work experience. Thomas worked as a \u201cself-employed tree surgeon,\u201d a semi-skilled position. This experience suggests that Thomas must have at least a \u201climited education\u201d because even individuals with \u201climited education\u201d generally cannot \u201cdo most of the more complex job duties needed in semi-skilled jobs.\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1564(b)(3), 416.964(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">Third, Thomas argues that the ALJ erred by \u201cnot stat[ing] whether she found [his] testimony credible\u201d and by not fulfilling her \u201cobligation to develop the record further on the issue of the Appellant\u2019s actual educational level.\u201d These arguments were not raised before the magistrate judge. Thus, they have been waived. <em>See Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1161 (11th Cir.2004); <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">We therefore conclude that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s finding that Thomas had a \u201climited education.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">Thomas\u2019 second argument is that the ALJ erred by \u201cfinding that there were a significant number of jobs which existed in the national economy which [he] could perform.\u201d At the fifth step of the disability determination process the burden is on the Commissioner to show that, based on the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity, age, education, and work experience, there is other work available in significant numbers in the national economy that the claimant can perform. <em>Doughty, </em>245 F.3d at 1278 &amp; n. 2. If the Commissioner shows that such jobs exist, \u201cthe claimant must then prove that he is unable to perform [those] jobs\u201d in order to be considered disabled. <em>Id. </em>at 1278 n. 2. The ALJ may use a vocational expert to determine whether there are jobs that the claimant can perform and that are available in significant numbers in the economy. <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-13\">The ALJ in this case relied on a vocational expert. The vocational expert testified that several jobs are available in significant numbers for individuals with the \u201csame age, education, past ... relevant work,\u201d and physical restrictions as Thomas. Specifically, the vocational expert listed new account clerk, rental clerk, cashier, and parking attendant as possibilities. Thomas argues that, contrary to the ALJ\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>findings, he is unable to perform any of these jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">First, with respect to the new account clerk and rental clerk positions, Thomas argues that \u201c[t]he ALJ should have definitely excluded\u201d these jobs because the vocational expert testified that they require a high school diploma, which he does not have. Thomas is correct that these two jobs are not consistent with his educational level. However, as the magistrate judge suggested, it is not clear that the ALJ actually held that Thomas could perform these jobs. Further, this is, at most, a harmless error because, as discussed below, there was substantial evidence to support a finding that Thomas could work as a cashier and parking lot attendant, which are jobs available in significant numbers in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Second, Thomas \u201ctakes issue with the District Court\u2019s finding that the vocational expert testified that there were 115,000 cashier jobs in the United States and 1,300 in the State of Florida for persons with a limited education <em>and </em>who needed a sit/ stand option.\u201d (emphasis added). This argument fails. The vocational expert explained that those figures represented cashier jobs \u201cwith a sit/stand option\u201d that would accommodate Thomas\u2019s need to \u201calternate positions at will.\u201d While the vocational expert did not explicitly say that those same cashier jobs would also accommodate someone with a limited education, her later testimony clarified that they would. The vocational expert explained that when \u201clooking at sit/stand cashiers that was [sic] basically working at the airport or a parking garage.\u201d When asked about which jobs required a high school diploma, the vocational expert explained that the same category of cashier jobs, airport or parking garage cashiers, \u201cnormally would not need a high school diploma,\u201d Therefore, substantial evidence supported a determination by the ALJ that there were 115,000 cashier jobs in the United States and 1,300 cashier jobs in Florida that Thomas would be able to perform given both his physical and educational limits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">Third, Thomas argues that he is unable to work as a parking attendant because \u201cit is obvious from reading the description of the job in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, that there are parts of the job that are going to require standing and walking as needed by the employer and not at the option of the employee.\u201d The relevant section of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, does not specifically discuss whether a parking attendant may sit and stand as he pleases. <em>See </em>Department of Labor, <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>\u00a7 915.473-010 (rev. 4th ed.1991). An ALJ can rely on a vocational expert to supplement the information in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles and where the two conflict the vocational expert\u2019s testimony \u201ctrumps.\u201d <em>See Jones, </em>190 F.3d at 1229-30. Here, the vocational expert explained that an individual who \u201cevery 20, 30 minutes or so\u201d must be able to \u201csit/stand at will\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>would be able to work as a parking lot attendant. Therefore, there was substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Thomas could work as a parking attendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Finally, Thomas argues that the testimony was too \u201cinaudible or at best vague\u201d to support the ALJ\u2019s determination. This argument was likely waived. <em>See e.g., Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1161 (refusing to consider an argument that the claimant failed to raise in the district court). Even if it was not waived, it lacks merit because, as illustrated above, there was substantial evidence, clearly presented by the vocational expert, to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">After a careful and thorough review of the administrative record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b939-15\">. The parties consented to the jurisdiction of the Magistrate Judge. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b942-6\">. Thomas also argues that, based on his testimony, he did not have the educational ability and \"reasoning level\u201d required for the cashier position. As explained, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s finding that Thomas had a \"limited education.\u201d The vocational expert acknowledged that Thomas had \"a limited education\u201d and explained that someone with his education level would be able to work as a cashier. Further, Thomas had previously worked in positions that had at least the same specific vocational preparation level as these types of cashier jobs, level 2. The vocational expert testified that airport or parking garage cashiers would likely require \"basic math skills in order to give change,\" but there is no reason to doubt that Thomas has those skills because Dr. Mussenden determined that Thomas has \"good mathematical skills\u201d and Thomas has experience handling money from his time working as a self-employed tree surgeon.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
