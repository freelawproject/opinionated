Lightbourn did not, however, point to any clerical errors in any judgment or order.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">We review the district court\u2019s application of Rule 36 <em>de novo. United States v. Portillo, </em>363 F.3d 1161, 1164 (11th Cir.2004). Rule 36 provides that a \u201ccourt may at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising from oversight or omission.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 36. Rule 36 may not be used to substantively alter a criminal sentence. <em>Portillo, </em>363 F.3d at 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Because all of the arguments in Lightb-ourn\u2019s motion requested substantive changes to his conviction and sentence, none was properly brought under Rule 36. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Lightbourn\u2019s motion to correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
