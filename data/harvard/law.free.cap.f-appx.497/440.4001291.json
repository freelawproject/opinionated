Tickles, </em>661 F.3d 212 (5th Cir.2011) (per curiam), held that the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d) does not apply retroactively to a defendant who is sentenced after the effective date of the FSA if the offense preceded that effective date. <em>See </em>661 F.3d at 214-15. However, in <em>United States v. Berry, </em>No. 11-51050, 701 F.3d 808, 2012 WL 5906899 (5th Cir. Nov. 26, 2012) (per curiam), this Court determined that <em>Tickles </em>had been overruled by <em>Dorsey v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). In <em>Dorsey, </em>the Supreme Court announced that the more lenient penalties of the FSA apply to offenders who were sentenced after the effective date of the FSA if the underlying offense was committed before the effective date of the FSA. 132 S.Ct. at 2326.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">The Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated, and remanded this case for further consideration in light of <em>Dorsey. </em>We, therefore, VACATE the judgment of sentence and REMAND for resentencing in accordance with <em>Dorsey.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b463-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
