We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-15\">McCone\u2019s complaint stemmed from his receipt of four traffic citations for violating a municipal ordinance that prohibited parking in a space with an expired parking meter. <em>See </em>Orlando, Fla., Code \u00a7 39.45. McCone contested the citations. An officer of the City parking bureau held a hearing on one citation and found McCone guilty of the parking offense, but an official vacated the decision for the citation to be adjudicated before a judge. After another hearing officer consolidated McCone\u2019s three other citations and adjudicated him guilty of the parking offenses, McCone appealed. The Circuit Court of Orange County reversed two of McCone\u2019s adjudications, but affirmed his third adjudication. McCone then petitioned the Fifth District Court of Appeals for a writ of certiorari, which the court denied. Dissatisfied with that decision, McCone intended to \u201cfile[] in the 5th [District Court] [a] motion for rehearing, rehearing en banc, request for written opinion, and certification of conflict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-16\">McCone sought monetary and injunctive relief from the defendants on the grounds that they had violated his rights of due process and equal protection by prosecuting the citations, denied him access to the traffic courts to appeal the decisions, and retaliated after he exercised his right to appeal. He alleged that the City could not prove that he had violated the parking ordinance; the City and Zollar had \u201cabus[ed] the process and engag[ed] in extortion\u201d when they prosecuted McCone\u2019s citations; and Ellis, Lall, and the City had revoked McCone\u2019s parking permit because he challenged the citations in the traffic court. McCone also alleged that a City official refused initially to file a form required to contest the citations, but McCone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>also alleged that the official later submitted the form to the traffic court. McCone attached to his complaint copies of his parking citations and his correspondence with City officials, the decision of the Circuit Court of Orange County, and partial transcripts of hearings before officers of the parking bureau. McCone moved to proceed as an indigent.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">A magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny McCone\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss McCone\u2019s complaint. The magistrate judge concluded that McCone could not obtain \u201creview of the judgment entered in the state court concerning his parking citations\u201d because \u201cthe state court decisions [were] not final\u201d and, \u201c[e]ven if the judgments were final, the Court [lacked] jurisdiction to review or overturn state court judgments adverse to [McCone].\u201d <em>See D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1803, 76 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). In the alternative, the magistrate judge concluded that McCone failed to state a claim because the penalties that McCone faced did not implicate a constitutional right; the state court judges were entitled to absolute immunity; and McCone had failed to establish that Ellis and Lall were state actors.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">The district court adopted the recommendation of the magistrate judge \u201cin all respects\u201d and dismissed McCone\u2019s complaint. The district court ruled that McCone\u2019s claims involving his prosecution for parking offenses were barred under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine and that McCone\u2019s claims against Ellis and Lall were \u201cbarred by the state actor requirement.\u201d The district court also ruled that McCone\u2019s claim \u201cagainst judges ... for the conduct of their judicial functions [was] ... barred by the doctrine of absolute immunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, <em>Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009), and for failure to state a claim, <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997). We also review <em>de novo </em>the grant of judicial immunity. <em>Smith v. Shook, </em>237 F.3d 1322, 1325 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cWe may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any ground that appears in the record, whether or not that ground was relied upon or even considered by the court below.\u201d <em>Powers v. United States, </em>996 F.2d 1121, 1123-24 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">The district court correctly dismissed McCone\u2019s complaint. McCone sought to overturn a decision of the state courts finding him guilty of one parking offense and to thwart prosecution of a second similar offense, but comity required that the district court abstain from interfering with McCone\u2019s ongoing proceedings in the state court. <em>See Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971); <em>The News-Journal Corp. v. Foxman, </em>939 F.2d 1499, 1510 n. 13 (11th Cir.1991). The district court could not grant McCone relief against the three state court judges because an injunction would have interfered with the judicial function of the state courts, <em>see Wexler v. Lepore, </em>385 F.3d 1336, 1339, 1341 (11th Cir.2004), and because the judges were immune from McCone\u2019s claim for damages, <em>see Sibley v. Lando, </em>437 F.3d 1067, 1071 (11th Cir.2005). McCone lacked standing to seek relief for being denied access to the courts because he was permitted to challenge his citations in the traffic court. <em>See Jackson v. State Bd. of Pardons and Paroles, </em>331 F.3d 790, 797 (11th Cir.2003). And McCone failed to state a claim that Ellis and Lall acted under color of state law when they revoked McCone\u2019s parking permit. <em>See Focus on the Family v. Pinellas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number><em>Suncoast Transit Auth., </em>344 F.3d 1263, 1277 (11th Cir.2003). The correspondence attached to McCone\u2019s complaint established that Ellis decided unilaterally to revoke the parking permit because it did not want to jeopardize its lease with the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of McCone\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
