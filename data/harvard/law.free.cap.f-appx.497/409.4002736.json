He asserts that the district court plainly erred in calculating a guidelines range of 77 to 96 months based on a determination that Perez was required to register as a Tier III sex offender. According to Perez, the correct guidelines range was 70 to 87 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-26\">Even if Perez could show a clear or obvious error and that the correct range was 70 to 87 months, he fails to show that the error affected his substantial rights where his sentence falls within both ranges. He relies upon the district court\u2019s statement that it was \u201cgoing to assess a sentence in the middle of the Guidelines.\u201d We have rejected a nearly identical argument. <em>See United States v. Blocker, </em>612 F.3d 413, 416-17 (5th Cir.2010). A \u201ccasual statement\u201d by the district court does not establish the requisite reasonable probability that Perez would have received a lesser sentence under a lower range. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, he fails to establish reversible plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>Blocker, </em>612 F.3d at 416-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-27\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
