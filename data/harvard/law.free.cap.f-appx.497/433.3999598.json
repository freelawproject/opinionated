Sheppard maintains that he is entitled to a reduction to his sentence based upon the crack cocaine amendments. He thus asserts that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-24\">\u201cThe crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>as career offenders.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Webb, </em>425 Fed.Appx. 406, 407 (5th Cir.2011) (relying on <em>Anderson </em>to affirm the denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion under Amendment 750 where the appellant was sentenced as a career offender). Sheppard\u2019s sentence was based not on the amount of drugs, but on his status as a career offender. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Sheppard\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b455-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
