The district court denied Blackmon\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and his motion for reconsideration of that denial. Blackmon filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-18\">Blackmon argues that the district court procedurally erred when it failed to make the initial determination whether he was eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) as required by <em>Dillon v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). The district court\u2019s determination that Blackmon was eligible for such relief was implied by its consideration of the issue whether relief was warranted in this case. <em>See United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 936 (5th Cir.2011). Blackmon also argues that the district court did not comply with Dillon\u2019s requirement that it consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors contemporaneously in making the discretionary decision whether relief was warranted. <em>See Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2692. This argument, however, is contradicted by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-21\">Asserting further procedural error, Blackmon argues that the district court failed to consider his post-sentencing conduct. In deciding whether relief is warranted under \u00a7 3582, a district court is allowed to consider such conduct, but it is not required to do so. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 &amp; n. 10 (5th Cir.2009); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). Blackmon\u2019s post-sentencing argument was presented in the district court, and we assume that the district court considered the argument. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672-73. Blackmon\u2019s contention that the law-of-the-case doctrine prevented the district court from considering his past criminal activity and the fact that his criminal history score underrepresented that criminal history is unavailing as the Sentencing Guidelines instruct the district court to consider such information. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(i-ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Finally, Blackmon maintains that the district court\u2019s denial of relief indicates that it was blind to the guidelines amendments\u2019 purpose of reducing the disparity between sentences for crack and powder cocaine offenses. The order denying relief referenced the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and reflects that the district court gave due consideration to Blackmon\u2019s motion as a whole. Thus, there was no abuse of discretion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674; <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
