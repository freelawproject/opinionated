We shall hold that <em>de facto </em>parenthood is not recognized in Maryland. Accordingly, we conclude, in order to overcome the constitutional rights of a legal parent to govern the care, custody, and control of his or her child, even a person who would qualify as a <em>de facto </em>parent, who seeks visitation or custody, must demonstrate exceptional circumstances as a prerequisite to the court\u2019s consideration of the best interests of the child as a factor in that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">In this case, one member of a committed same-sex relationship is seeking custody of, and/or visitation with, the child adopted by the other member of that relationship. Janice M., the petitioner, and Margaret K., the respondent, were involved in a committed same-sex relationship for approximately eighteen years, during the course of which Janice M. adopted Maya, for whose custody Margaret M. filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. That court denied Margaret K.\u2019s prayer for custody, but, having found that Margaret K. was a <em>defacto </em>parent, granted her visitation. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed that judgment. <em>Janice M. v. Marga</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number><em>ret K., </em>171 Md.App. 528, 910 A.2d 1145 (2006). We granted Janice M.\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari and Margaret K.\u2019s cross petition to consider the standard a trial court should employ when considering visitation and custody matters under the circumstances presented by this case. <em>Janice M. v. Margaret K., </em>396 Md. 524, 914 A.2d 768 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Janice M. and Margaret K. are two women who were involved in a committed same-sex relationship. The couple met in 1986, and, for most of the approximately eighteen years they were together, they lived together in a residence owned by Janice M. In the summer of 2004, the parties separated and Margaret K. moved out of Janice M.\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Janice M. desired very much to be a mother, a sentiment which she often expressed during the course of their relationship. When her attempts to become pregnant by use of <em>in vitro </em>fertilization proved unsuccessful and after discussing her options with Margaret K.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Janice M. pursued adoption in India. That pursuit was successful; Janice M. adopted Maya, who, in December 1999, arrived in the United States. Margaret K. did not ever attempt to adopt Maya in Maryland.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>From the time that Maya arrived in the United States in 1999 until the summer of 2004, when the parties separated, she lived with both Margaret K. and Janice M. During that time, the parties shared most duties regarding Maya\u2019s care. Janice M. and Margaret K. divided the responsibilities for preparing Maya\u2019s food, changing her diapers, bathing her, handling her schooling, addressing her healthcare needs, and performing most other caretaking duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Following the parties\u2019 separation, Margaret K. initially saw Maya between three and four times a week. Those visits were largely unsupervised. As the relationship between Margaret K. and Janice M. increasingly became strained, Janice M. placed certain restrictions on Margaret K.\u2019s visitation. In October 2004, Janice M. sent Margaret K. a letter in which she enumerated specific conditions on visitation, Margaret K.: was required to arrange visitation through Janice M. rather than with Maya directly; could take Maya only to places that Janice M. approved, could not speak disparagingly about Janice M., and was required to inform Janice M. of any people who would accompany Margaret K. during visits. Thereafter, Margaret K. continued unsupervised visitation with Maya approximately twice a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">By January 2005, Margaret K. had become dissatisfied with the prescribed conditions, restrictions, on visitation. As a result, in that month, Margaret K.\u2019s attorney sent Janice M. a letter concerning visitation with Maya. Janice M. responded by denying Margaret K. all visitation and prohibiting her all access to Maya.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Margaret K. filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, seeking custody, or, in the alternative, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>visitation. At an evidentiary hearing on the complaint, Margaret K. testified about her relationship with Maya, as did several of the couple\u2019s friends and acquaintances. At the conclusion of Margaret K.\u2019s case, the Circuit Court granted Janice M.\u2019s motion for judgment on the issue of custody. As an initial matter, the court determined that Janice M., as an adoptive parent, was entitled to a presumptive right of custody. After finding \u201cno evidence as to lack of fitness on the part of [Janice M.],\u201d the court considered whether extraordinary circumstances existed to overcome the presumption that Janice M. was entitled to custody of Maya. The Circuit Court concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">\u201cAs far as extraordinary circumstances, the circumstances have to be extraordinarily exceptional or compelling, such circumstances as require the court to remove the child from the biological parent in order to protect the child from harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">\u201cIn reviewing <em>Karen v. Christopher, </em>163 Md.App. 250, 878 A.2d 646 (2005), I think that case can be distinguished from the facts of this case. In that case the biological parent abruptly removed the child from the State of Maryland making it almost impossible for the person seeking custody, Christopher in that case, to communicate with them. The biological parent did not allow the child to see Christopher except infrequently with restrictions, including that visitation had to be in her presence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">\u201cBasically, in that case the court found that the biological parent through a pattern of immaturity and selfishness in an effort to elevate her own personal interests took actions which actually rendered the child fatherless to break the bond totally between the father and child. In this case we do have some restrictions being set forth in this October 6th, 2004 letter, but I don\u2019t see that those restrictions are anywhere near the level of what was going on in the cited case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">\u201cIn fact, very clearly [Janice M.] is saying, I do not want to deny Maya the opportunity to see you. You have been allowed to communicate and visit with Maya each week, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>etcetera, etcetera. I\u2019ve encouraged her to call you, although she may not want to invite you to be part of our activities. It\u2019s because I love Maya, and I know that she cares about you that you have been granted the opportunity to visit with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">\u201cSo I think based on this letter anyhow there are rules being set forth, but you don\u2019t have a situation where the child is being taken out of state, and so I don\u2019t see that this establishes\u2014I don\u2019t see where the facts of this case rise to the level of extraordinary, exceptional or compelling circumstances or even close. So I\u2019m going to grant the motion as to custody, and we\u2019ll proceed on the visitation issues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Following the conclusion of all the evidence, the Circuit Court addressed the issue of visitation, concluding that Margaret K. was entitled to visitation. Relying primarily on the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>S.F. v. M.D., </em>132 Md. App. 99, 751 A.2d 9 (2000), the court found that Margaret K. was Maya\u2019s <em>de facto </em>parent and, therefore, visitation would be in the best interests of Maya. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\">\u201cUnder the case of <em>S.F. v. M.D., </em>since we\u2019re dealing strictly with visitation right now, having already dismissed the issue of custody at the end of the plaintiffs case, I find that the plaintiff is a <em>de facto </em>parent under that case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-9\">\u201cThe four factors are met. The first one being, did the legal parent consent to and foster the relationship between the third party and the child? Clearly, I believe [Janice M.] did do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-10\">\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the second prong is met. The third party must have lived with the child. [Margaret K.] lived with the child for about three and a half years I believe it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-11\">\u201cThe third factor, the third party must perform parental functions for the child to a significant degree. I think that\u2019s very clear from all the testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>\u201cAnd then the fourth factor, which the case says is the most important, is there a parent-child bond that had been forged? I think the evidence is clear that that\u2019s occurred as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">\u201cSo I find that the plaintiff is a <em>de facto </em>parent. Having found that in the context of visitation, there then is no presumption in favor of the biological parent, or here, the adoptive parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">\u201cSo then you look at the best interests of the child, and the court finds as a matter of fact that it is in the best interests of the child that there be visitation with the plaintiff. It was not only her testimony, but it was also the testimony of the other witnesses that there is this relationship, and I\u2019m finding that it would be detrimental that it be cut off totally.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Janice M. noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court and its finding that Margaret K. qualified as a <em>de facto </em>parent. The intermediate appellate court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">\u201cIn <em>S.F. v. M.D., </em>132 Md.App. 99, 751 A.2d 9 (2000), Judge James Eyler stated for this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-10\">\u2018In determining whether one is a de facto parent, we employ the test enunciated in <em>In re Custody of H.S.H.-K., </em>193 Wis.2d 649, 533 N.W.2d 419 (1995), and <em>V.C. v. </em>163 N.J. 200, 748 A.2d 539 (2000). Under that test, \u201cthe legal parent must consent to and foster the relationship between the third party and the child; the third party must have lived with the child; the third party must perform parental functions for the child to a significant degree; and most important, a parent-child bond must be forged.\u201d ... Consequently, ... a non-biological, non-adoptive parent, ... [who] is a <em>defacto </em>parent, ... is not required to show unfitness of the biological parent or exceptional circumstances ... [to be] entitled to visitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 111-12, 751 A.2d [at 15].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">\u201cThe person who claims to be a child\u2019s <em>de facto </em>parent must successfully shoulder the burdens of (1) pleading, (2) production of evidence, and (3) persuasion. We can take judicial notice that in almost every home occupied by adults and children, the adults perform <em>some </em>parental functions on behalf of the children. Under the above quoted test, however, a person who performed parental functions is not entitled to <em>defacto </em>parent status unless the court finds as a fact that the child\u2019s legal parent has actually fostered such a relationship. Because the test we adopted in <em>S.F. v. M.D., supra, </em>is a strict one, neither our holding in that case nor our holding in the case at bar will open the floodgates to claims of <em>de facto </em>parenthood asserted by persons who can prove nothing more than that, while living with the natural or adoptive parent of a child, they performed some parental functions on behalf of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">\u201cRare are the cases like the case at bar, in which the circuit court was presented with evidence that (as summarized in the argument of Margaret K.\u2019s counsel) \u2018Maya was with Margaret K. every day of her life in this country until August of 2004 [and] [t]he only reason that Margaret K. has been deprived of the opportunity to have a relationship with her daughter is because she wasn\u2019t on that decree of adoption.\u2019 Under these circumstances, there is no merit in Janice M.\u2019s argument that the evidence presented to the circuit court was insufficient to support the factual finding that Margaret K. is Maya\u2019s <em>defacto </em>parent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\"><em>Janice M. v. Margaret K., </em>171 Md.App. 528, 538-40, 910 A.2d 1145, 1152 (2006). The Court of Special Appeals also affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s \u201cholding that \u2018a non-biological, non-adoptive parent, ... [who] is a <em>de facto </em>parent, ... is not required to show unfitness of the biological parent or exceptional circumstances ... [to be] entitled to visitation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530, 910 A.2d at 1146-47 (quoting <em>S.F., </em>132 Md.App. at 111-12, 751 A.2d at 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Janice M. petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which we granted to address the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>\u201cDoes an exceptional circumstances standard rather than a best interests standard apply to visitation with a <em>de facto </em>parent?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">We also granted Margaret K.\u2019s cross-petition, which sought resolution of the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">\u201c1. Must a <em>defacto </em>parent prove that a legal parent is unfit or that exceptional circumstances exist for the <em>de facto </em>parent to obtain custody of his or her <em>de facto </em>child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AX3\">\u201c2. Is a <em>defacto </em>parent entitled to visitation with his or her <em>defacto </em>child if it is in the child\u2019s best interest?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-7\"><em>Janice M. v. Margaret K., </em>396 Md. 524, 914 A.2d 768 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">The United States Supreme Court long has recognized that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the rights of parents to direct and govern the care, custody, and control of their children. <em>See Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 69-70, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 2062, 147 L.Ed.2d 49, 58-59 (2000); <em>Santosky v.

In <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49, writing for the plurality, Justice O\u2019Connor explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-10\">\u201cThe Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State shall \u2018deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u2019 We have long recognized that the Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, like its Fifth Amendment counterpart, guarantees more than fair process. The Clause also includes a substantive component that provides heightened protection against government interferences with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>\u201cThe liberty interest at issue in this case\u2014the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children\u2014 is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court. More than 75 years ago, in <em>Meyer v. Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390, 399, 401[, 43 S.Ct. 625, 626-27, 67 L.Ed. 1042, 1044-46] (1923), we held that the \u2018liberty\u2019 protected by the Due Process Clause includes the right of parents \u2018to establish a home and bring up children\u2019 and \u2018to control the education of their own.\u2019 Two years later, in <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510, 534\u2014535[, 45 S.Ct. 571, 573, 69 L.Ed. 1070, 1078] (1925), we again held that the \u2018liberty of parents and guardians\u2019 includes the right \u2018to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control.\u2019 We explained in <em>Pierce </em>that \u2018[t]he child is not the mere creature of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 535[, 45 S.Ct. at 573, 69 L.Ed. at 1078]. We returned to the subject in <em>Prince v. Massachusetts, </em>321 U.S. 158[, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645] (1944), and again confirmed that there is a constitutional dimension to the right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children. \u2018It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child resides first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 166[, 64 S.Ct. at 442, 88 L.Ed. at 652].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">\u201cIn subsequent cases also, we have recognized the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children. In light of this extensive precedent, it cannot now be doubted that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-6\"><em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 65-66, 120 S.Ct. at 2059-60[, 147 L.Ed.2d at 56-57] (some internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">In <em>Troxel, </em>the issue before the Supreme Court was the constitutionality of a Washington statute permitting \u201cany third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>party seeking visitation to subject any decision by a parent concerning visitation of the parent\u2019s children to state-court review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67, 120 S.Ct. at 2061[,147 L.Ed.2d at 57]. The respondent, a mother of two children, wanted to limit her children\u2019s visits with their grandparents, the parents of the children\u2019s deceased father. The trial court ordered visitation over the mother\u2019s objection. The Washington intermediate appellate court reversed and the Washington Supreme Court affirmed in a consolidated opinion, <em>In re Custody of Smith, </em>137 Wash.2d 1, 969 P.2d 21 (1998). The Washington Supreme Court held the statute invalid on its face on several grounds. First, the court held that the Constitution permits a State to interfere \"with the right of parents to rear their children only to prevent harm or potential harm to a child and that the statute failed that standard because it required no threshold showing of harm. <em>Id. </em>at 29. Second, the court concluded that the visitation statute swept too broadly, by allowing \u201c \u2018any person\u2019 to petition for forced visitation of a child at \u2018any time,\u2019 with the only requirement being that the visitation serve the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30. The Washington Supreme Court opined that \u201cparents have a right to limit visitation of their children with third persons,\u201d and that, as between parents and judges, \u201cthe parents should be the ones to choose whether to expose their children to certain people or ideas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The United States Supreme Court, in a plurality opinion, affirmed, holding that the Washington statute interfered with the mother\u2019s \u201cfundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of her\u201d children. <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 72, 120 S.Ct. at 2063[, 147 L.Ed.2d at 60]. The plurality noted three important factors. First, the trial court had failed to honor the \u201ctraditional presumption that a fit parent will act in the best interest of his or her child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 120 S.Ct. at 2061[, 147 L.Ed.2d at 59]. Second, the trial court erred in failing to give \u201cspecial weight\u201d to the mother\u2019s determination of her children\u2019s best interest. <em>Id. </em>at 69, 120 S.Ct. at 2062 [, 147 L.Ed.2d at 58]. Finally, the plurality gave weight to the fact that the children\u2019s mother never sought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>eliminate visitation with the grandparents, but instead attempted only to restrict the frequency of visits. <em>Id. </em>at 71, 120 S.Ct. at 2062-63[, 147 L.Ed.2d at 60].</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The plurality declined to define the precise scope of the parental due process right in the visitation context and declined to answer the question of whether the Due Process Clause requires all nonparental visitation statutes to include a showing of harm or potential harm. <em>Id. </em>at 73, 120 S.Ct. at 2064, 147 L.Ed.2d at 61. Instead, the Court rested its holding on the sweeping breadth of the Washington statute, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">\u201cIn this respect, we agree with Justice Kennedy that the constitutionality of any standard for awarding visitation turns on the specific manner in which that standard is applied and that the constitutional protections in this area are best \u2018elaborated with care.\u2019 Because much state-court adjudication in this context occurs on a case-by-case basis, we would be hesitant to hold that specific nonparental visitation statutes violate the Due Process Clause as a <em>per se </em>matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-7\"><em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">Since <em>Troxel, </em>this Court, on several occasions, has addressed a parent\u2019s due process rights in the context of custody or visitation. In <em>McDermott v. Dougherty, </em>385 Md. 320, 869 A.2d 751 (2005), we resolved a custody dispute between a child\u2019s father, McDermott, and the child\u2019s maternal grandparents, the Doughertys. McDermott and the child\u2019s mother had divorced shortly after the child\u2019s birth. Initially, the child\u2019s mother had primary custody. The mother was unable to continue as custodian, however, when she was sentenced to incarceration. During her time in prison, she placed the child in the care of her parents. McDermott, who was on a six-month tour of duty as a merchant seaman, initially consented to this arrangement. Upon McDermott\u2019s return from sea, however, he sought custody of the child. A custody battle ensued between McDermott and the grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">The Circuit Court awarded custody to the grandparents. The court concluded that the child\u2019s mother was unfit to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>custody, and that, while not \u201cunfit,\u201d the father was not entitled to custody, it having also determined \u201cthat his employment in the merchant marine, requiring him to spend months-long intervals at sea, constituted \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 as that term was defined in <em>Ross v. Hoffman, </em>280 Md. 172, 191, 372 A.2d 582, 593 (1977) ... and the \u2018best interest of the child\u2019 and need for a stable living situation thus warranted that custody be placed with the Doughertys,\u201d <em>McDermott, </em>385 Md. at 324, 869 A.2d at 753. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed. We granted McDermott\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to determine when and under what circumstances, where a fit parent and a third party both are seeking custody, it is appropriate t o award custody to the third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">We identified three circumstances in which the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard might arise. The first category involves disputes between fit legal parents, each of whom has equal constitutional rights to parent. The second, and most frequent situation, is in the various types of state proceedings in which the state injects itself into the parenting situation in the role of <em>parens patriae, </em>to protect the child. The third category consists of the third party custody dispute cases, <em>i.e., </em>those cases in which persons other than legal parents or the State attempt, directly or indirectly, to gain or maintain custody or visitation in respect to the children of legal parents.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As to this category, where the focus is on the standard to be applied when the dispute is between a fit parent and a private third party, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">\u201cWhere the dispute is between a fit parent and a private third party ... both parties do not begin on equal footing in respect to rights to \u2018care, custody, and control\u2019 of the children. The parent is asserting a fundamental constitutional right. The third party is not. A private third party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>has no fundamental constitutional right to raise the children of others. Generally, absent a constitutional statute, the non-governmental third party has no rights, constitutional or otherwise, to raise someone else\u2019s child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 353, 869 A.2d at 770. We concluded that before the trial court may consider \u201cthe best interest of the child\u201d test in deciding a custody dispute between fit parents and a third party, the trial court must first find the legal parents unfit to have custody or extraordinary circumstances that could result in serious detriment to the child if that child were to remain in the custody of the parents. <em>Id. </em>at 374-75, 869 A.2d at 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The trial court in <em>McDermott </em>did not find that the father was an \u201cunfit\u201d parent. Accordingly, the only issue to be resolved was whether extraordinary circumstances existed to justify granting custody to the grandparents.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After noting that it is presumed that fit parents act in the best interests of their children and that a third party seeking custody bears the burden of demonstrating exceptional circumstances, we held that the grandparents had failed to establish the exceptional circumstances necessary to justify awarding them custody. <em>Id. </em>at 424-25, 869 A.2d at 812-13. The Circuit Court\u2019s finding of exceptional circumstances was based on the father\u2019s extended periods at sea. <em>Id. </em>at 324, 869 A.2d at 753. The time McDermott spent at work, involuntarily spent away from his child because of the nature of his employment, was insufficient to establish the exceptional circumstances necessary to award custody to a third party, over his objection.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 431-32, 869 A.2d at 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>The bottom line in <em>McDermott </em>is that, \u201cabsent a showing of parental unfitness or exceptional circumstances, \u2018the constitutional right [of parents to the \u2018care, custody, and control\u2019 of their children] is the ultimate determinative factor....\u2019\u201d <em>Koshko v.

Having concluded that an examination of whether exceptional circumstances exist should precede, and determine the need for, a best interest analysis, we reiterated factors set out originally in <em>Ross v. Hoffman, </em>280 Md. 172, 372 A.2d 582 (1977), which may be probative in determining the existence of exceptional circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\">\u201c[1] length of time the child has been away from the biological parent, [2] the age of the child when care was assumed by the third party, [3] the possible emotional effect on the child of a change of custody, [4] the period of time which elapsed before the parent sought to reclaim the child, [5] the nature and strength of the ties between the child and the third party custodian, [6] the intensity and genuineness of the parent\u2019s desire to have the child, [7] the stability and certainty as to the child\u2019s future in the custody of the parent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-6\"><em>McDermott, </em>385 Md. at 419, 869 A.2d at 809 (quoting <em>Hoffman, </em>280 Md. at 191, 372 A.2d at 593).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">In <em>Koshko v. Haining, </em>398 Md. 404, 419, 921 A.2d 171, 180 (2007), we revisited the due process rights of fit parents to control the upbringing of their children. That case differed from <em>McDermott </em>in that the dispute arose when the children\u2019s grandparents sought visitation, rather than custody, over the objections of the natural parents. Relying on Maryland\u2019s Grandparent Visitation Statute, Md.Code (1984, 2006 Rep. Vol.) \u00a7 9-102 of the Family Law Article, the Circuit Court granted visitation to the grandparents. We noted initially that Maryland\u2019s grandparent visitation statute, \u201csimply provides that grandparents may petition for \u2018reasonable visitation\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>and empowers equity courts to grant such petitions if grand-parental visitation is \u2018in the best interests of the child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Koshko, </em>398 Md. at 424, 921 A.2d at 182. In order to save the statute from constitutional infirmity, we read into the statute a presumption that parental decisions regarding their children are valid, both as mandated by substantive due process and Maryland common law. <em>Id. </em>at 426, 921 A.2d at 184. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">\u201cTo preserve fundamental parental liberty interests, we now apply a gloss to the Maryland GVS [Grandparent Visitation Statute] requiring a threshold showing of either parental unfitness or exceptional circumstances indicating that the lack of grandparental 'visitation has a significant deleterious effect upon the children who are the subject of the petition. We do so under the principle of constitutional avoidance previously invoked in this opinion to engraft onto the GVS a parental presumption.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 441, 921 A.2d at 192-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">As a visitation, rather than a custody, case, <em>Koshko </em>addressed the relationship between custody and visitation, and the principles to be applied in determining visitation between the legal parents and grandparents. We pointed out that \u201cvisitation is a species of custody, <em>albeit </em>for a more limited duration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429, 921 A.2d at 185. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">\u201cThere is no dispute that the grant or modification of visitation involves a lesser <em>degree </em>of intrusion on the fundamental right to parent than the assignment of custody. We except from this notion, however, that, because of this conceptualization, visitation somehow ranks lower on the \u2018scale of values\u2019 such that its determination does not require the application of stringent tests as is the case with custody. In other words, although there may be a difference in the degree of intrusion, it is not a difference of constitutional magnitude. Visitation, like custody, intrudes upon the fundamental right of parents to direct the \u2018care, custody, and control\u2019 of their children. Though visitation decisions granting such privileges to third parties may tread more lightly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>into the protected grove of parental rights, they tread nonetheless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><em>Koshko, </em>398 Md. at 430-31, 921 A.2d at 186 (internal footnotes omitted). We made clear that visitation matters deserve no less scrutiny than custody matters, any language from previous decisions to the contrary notwithstanding, which language we disapproved, in the process. <em>Id. </em>at 431, 921 A.2d at 186. Citing <em>Troxel,'</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we stated that, \u201c[f]or the purposes of constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>tional analysis, parental autonomy is encroached upon equally by visitation matters as it is with custody disputes when the state interference is \u2018direct and substantial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434, 921 A.2d at 189. <em>McDermott </em>made clear that parental unfitness and exceptional circumstances are threshold considerations in third party custody determinations; <em>Koshko </em>made clear that those considerations apply in third party visitation disputes. Because we decided that the grandparent visitation statute had been unconstitutionally applied to the Koshkos in the absence of a threshold finding of parental unfitness or exceptional circumstances, we remanded the case to the Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">With this aspect of our custody and visitation jurisprudence as background and firmly in mind, we turn to the issue presented in this case\u2014whether, when the party asserting visitation rights meets the requirements for de facto parent status, a court, without first finding exceptional circumstances or parental unfitness, may apply the best interests of the child standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The term <em>\u201cde facto </em>parent\u201d has a literal meaning, \u201cparent in fact.\u201d It is used generally to describe a party who claims custody or visitation rights based upon the party\u2019s relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>ship, in fact, with a non-biological, non-adopted child.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The American Law Institute, which has promulgated principles governing the allocation of custodial and decision-making responsibilities for children, defines <em>de facto </em>parent as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzBg\">\u201c[A]n individual other than a legal parent or a parent by estoppel who, for a significant period of time not less than two years,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">\u201c(i) lived with the child and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">\u201c(ii) for reasons primarily other than financial compensation, and with the agreement of a legal parent to form a parent-child relationship, or as a result of a complete failure or inability of any legal parent to perform caretaking functions,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">\u201c(A) regularly performed a majority of the caretaking functions for the child, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">\u201c(B) regularly performed a share of caretaking functions at least as great as that of the parent with whom the child primarily lived.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">American Law Institute, Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution: Analysis and Recommendations \u00a7 2.03(l)(c), at 107-08 (softcover ed. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">Relying on <em>S.F. v. M.D., </em>132 Md.App. 99, 751 A.2d 9, the trial judge in the instant case found that Margaret K. is Maya\u2019s <em>de facto </em>parent and, therefore, granted Margaret K. visitation. Janice M. urges this Court to reject the concept of <em>de facto </em>parenthood as it may bear on custody or visitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>determinations, overrule <em>S.F. v. M.D., </em>and hold that all persons other than legal parents are to be treated as third parties, as our holdings in <em>McDermott </em>and <em>Koshko </em>suggest, if not direct. Under Janice M.\u2019s interpretation of <em>McDermott </em>and <em>Koshko, </em>a <em>de facto </em>parent is entitled to no greater consideration than any other non-parent, biological or adoptive, and, thus, should, or would, be treated no differently than any other third party. Consequently, before the best interest of the child factors may be considered in a visitation case between a legal parent and a <em>de facto </em>parent, the trial court would need to find that the legal parent is unfit to have custody or that there are extraordinary circumstances posing serious detriment to the child if that child were to remain in the custody of the legal parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Janice M. argues that all third parties, including those that qualify as <em>de facto </em>parents under the standard enunciated by Court of Special Appeals, must demonstrate either that a legal parent is unfit or that extraordinary circumstances exist to justify granting that third party visitation rights over the legal parent\u2019s objections. According to Janice M., because the Circuit Court found her to be a fit parent, the only way that court properly could have required visitation over her objection was by finding extraordinary circumstances. Because the court stated explicitly that extraordinary circumstances did not exist, she contends that the court erred in granting visitation to Margaret K. Janice M. contends that the liberty interest of a parent in controlling the upbringing of her child mandates that conclusion and, moreover, requires the result she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Margaret K. responds that, once a court has determined that a person is a <em>de facto </em>parent, it has in fact, found the exceptional circumstances necessary to grant either visitation or custody. Indeed, she argues that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 test demonstrates extraordinary circumstances and, therefore, that the Circuit Court was correct to grant her visitation on the basis of the best interests of the child standard. Margaret K. argues also that there is no constitutional bar to the analysis in which the Circuit Court and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>intermediate appellate court engaged or to the determination that they reached. In fact, she continues, the <em>de facto </em>parenthood standard is necessary to protect a child\u2019s constitutional interest in maintaining a relationship with her <em>de facto </em>parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">This Court has not yet addressed the concept of <em>de facto </em>parenthood in the context of either a custody or visitation dispute. Accordingly, we have never determined what legal status, if any, a person has vis-a-vis a non-biologically related or non-adopted child, with whom he or she has established a relationship meeting the requirements of a <em>de facto </em>parent, whether, in other words, such a person must demonstrate that a legal parent is unfit or that exceptional circumstances exist to justify custody or visitation rights, when the parent objects.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">As we have seen, the Court of Special Appeals has considered the concept, as well as the status, of a de facto parent in the context of visitation lights in the case of <em>S.F. v. M.D., </em>132 Md.App. 99, 751 A.2d 9 (2000). It did so, however, prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Troxel, </em>and our decisions in <em>MeDemott </em>and <em>Koshko. </em>That case was a dispute between two women, S.F., and M.D., who had lived together in a committed domestic relationship for six years, from 1991 until 1997. While their relationship was on-going, M.D. gave birth to a child, conceived by means of artificial insemination. The parties separated three years thereafter. Following the separation, M.D. denied S.F. visitation with the child. S.F. responded by filing suit for custody, or, in the alternative, visitation. The trial court found that S.F. was entitled to neither, and S.F. noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, in which she challenged the court\u2019s ruling on the issue of visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The Court of Special Appeals observed, as a threshold matter, that a third party seeking custody will prevail only if that party demonstrates that a legal parent is unfit or that exceptional circumstances exist. <em>Id. </em>at 110-111, 751 A.2d at 15. The intermediate appellate court held, however, that neither showing is necessary to grant visitation where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>third party is a <em>de facto </em>parent to the child.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 111-12, 751 A.2d at 15. After acknowledging that \u201cthe Supreme Court of the United States and the Court of Appeals of Maryland have recognized that a natural parent has a fundamental right regarding the care and custody of his or her child,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 109, 751 A.2d at 14, the Court of Special Appeals determined that \u201c[njevertheless, the best interest of the child may take precedence over a parent\u2019s liberty interests in a custody, visitation, or adoption dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Expressing uncertainty \u201cas to the character of the parental right at stake when the issue involves visitation rights rather than custody or the termination of parental rights,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Wolinski v. Browneller, </em>115 Md.App. 285, 302, 693 A.2d 30, 38 (1997)), the court concluded that \u201ca natural parent does not have a constitutional right to deny all visitation, if visitation would be in the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>S.F., </em>132 Md.App. at 109, 751 A.2d at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">To determine whether a person is a de facto parent, the Court of Special Appeals adopted the test set out by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in <em>In re Custody of H.S.H-K, </em>193 Wis.2d 649, 533 N.W.2d 419 (1995), and the New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>V.C. v. M.J.B., </em>163 N.J. 200, 748 A.2d 539 (2000). Under the Wisconsin and New Jersey test, the establishment of <em>de facto </em>parenthood requires a petitioner to prove the following four elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">\u201c(1) that the biological or adoptive parent consented to, and fostered, the petitioner\u2019s formation and establishment of a parent-like relationship with the child; (2) that the petitioner and the child lived together in the same household; (3) that the petitioner assumed the obligations of parenthood by taking significant responsibility for the child\u2019s care, education and development, including contributing towards the child\u2019s support, without expectation of financial compensation [a petitioner\u2019s contribution to a child\u2019s support need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>be monetary]; and (4) that the petitioner has been in a parental role for a length of time sufficient to have established with the child a bonded, dependent relationship parental in nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><em>V.C., </em>748 A.2d at 551 (quoting <em>In re Custody of H.S.H-K, </em>533 N.W.2d at 421). Applying that test, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that because S.F. qualified as a <em>de facto </em>parent, she was not required to show unfitness of the biological parent or the existence of exceptional circumstances making an award of visitation rights in the child\u2019s best interest. <em>S.F., </em>132 Md.App. at 111-12, 751 A.2d at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">We will not recognize <em>de facto </em>parent status, as set forth in <em>S.F., </em>as a legal status in Maryland. We refuse to do so because, even <em>assuming arguendo </em>that we were to recognize such a status, short-circuiting the requirement to show unfitness or exceptional circumstances is contrary to Maryland jurisprudence, as articulated in <em>McDermott </em>and <em>Koshko.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Even were we to recognize some form of <em>de facto </em>parenthood, the real question in the case <em>sub judice </em>will remain, whether, in a custody or visitation dispute, a third party, non-biological, non-adoptive parent, who satisfies the test necessary to show de facto parenthood should be treated differently from other third parties. We have not been persuaded that they should be. In other words, where visitation or custody is sought over the objection of the parent, before the best interest of the child test comes into play, the <em>de facto </em>parent must establish that the legal parent is either unfit or that exceptional circumstances exist. A fair reading of <em>McDermott </em>and <em>Koshko </em>leads to no other conclusion. We reiterate what we said in <em>McDeimott:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">\u201cIn the balancing of court-created or statutorily-created \u2018standards,\u2019 such as \u2018the best interest of the child\u2019 test, with fundamental constitutional rights, in private custody [and visitation] actions involving private third-parties where the parents are fit, absent extraordinary <em>(i.e., </em>exceptional) circumstances, the constitutional right is the ultimate determinative factor; and only if the parents are unfit or extraordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>nary circumstances exit is the \u2018best interest of the child\u2019 test to be considered----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-6\"><em>McDermott, </em>385 Md. at 418-19, 869 A.2d at 808-09. Clearly, in light of <em>McDermott </em>and <em>Koshko, S.F. </em>no longer reflects Maryland law, and accordingly, is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The visitation dispute in this case arises in the context of two women. We are mindful of the extensive literature in the law reviews on the issue of visitation rights for same-sex partners when their relationships have terminated and especially the difficulties, in some states, that same-sex partners experience when custody or visitation is at issue. The issues inherent in this disagreement, however, are not limited to same-sex couples and could arise in a myriad of other circumstances, including disputes involving step-parents, grandparents, and parties in a relationship with \u201ca significant other.\u201d At oral argument, we inquired of the parties, whether the fact that the parties were of the same sex in the case before the Court should have any bearing on our analysis. Neither argued that it should. Janice M. would embrace a single test for all third parties and would give no special consideration to same-sex partners. Margaret K., when asked, also did not argue for a different test for same-sex couples. Indeed, she acknowledged that, while there is no explicit legal or statutory authority in Maryland for adoption under the circumstances presented herein, she could have petitioned to become a second-party adoptive parent to Maya.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">We are mindful as well that several of our sister states have created third party visitation statutes that grant <em>de facto </em>parents visitation despite objections from the legal parents. <em>See SooHoo v. Johnson, </em>731 N.W.2d 815 (Minn.2007); <em>Rubano v. DiCenzo, </em>759 A.2d 959 (R.I.2000). In <em>SooHoo, </em>731 N.W.2d 815, the Minnesota Supreme Court considered such a statute, Minn.Stat. \u00a7 257C.08, subd. 4 (2006).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Determining that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>statute was constitutional on its face, 731 N.W.2d at 818, the court upheld the trial court\u2019s decision to grant visitation to a third party, who stood <em>in loco parentis </em>to the children who were the subject of the visitation action, over the objections of the children\u2019s adoptive mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The Minnesota statute permits a court to grant reasonable visitation to a person with whom the child has resided for at least two years. The dispute in <em>SooHoo </em>arose after two women, SooHoo and Johnson, ended a long-term same-sex relationship. The couple\u2019s relationship lasted twenty-two years and, prior to their separation, they had lived together in a home they owned jointly. During that time, Johnson adopted two children from China. SooHoo did not attempt to adopt either child. The Minnesota Supreme Court noted, however, that \u201cJohnson and SooHoo co-parented the children, recognized themselves as a family unit with two mothers, and represented themselves to others as such.\u201d <em>SooHoo, </em>731 N.W.2d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Following the couple\u2019s separation, SooHoo petitioned for sole physical and legal custody of the children or, in the alternative, visitation. The trial court awarded visitation under Minnesota\u2019s third party visitation statute, Minn.Stat. \u00a7 257C.08, subdivision 4 (2006). The Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed, holding the statute constitutional. <em>SooHoo, </em>731 N.W.2d at 821. Applying strict scrutiny analysis, the Court noted initially that the government possesses a compelling interest in \u201cpromoting relationships among those in recognized family units (for example, the relationship between a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>child and someone <em>in loco parentis </em>to that child) in order to protect the general welfare of children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 822. Viewing the statute as a narrowly tailored one, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyD\">\u201c[W]e note that section 257C.08, subdivision 4, is, on its face, more narrowly drawn than the Washington statute at issue in <em>Troxel. </em>The Washington statute allowed courts to award visitation to any person at any time so long as it was in the child\u2019s best interests. In contrast, section 257C.08, subdivision 4, limits the class of individuals who may petition for visitation to those persons who have resided with the child for two years or more (excluding foster parents). In addition to that threshold requirement, the statute further narrows the class of those who may be awarded visitation to petitioners who have \u2018established emotional ties creating a parent and child relationship.\u2019 Minn.Stat. \u00a7 257C.08, subd. 4(2). We read this requirement as mandating that the petitioner stand in loco parentis with the child----Therefore, unlike the statute at issue in <em>Troxel, </em>the requirements that the petitioner have resided with the child for two or more years and have a parent-child relationship with the child substantially limits the class of individuals who may successfully petition for visitation.\u201d[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-6\"><em>SooHoo, </em>731 N.W.2d at 822-23. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">\u201cBecause Minn.Stat. \u00a7 257C.08, subd. 4, limits the class of individuals who may be granted third-party visitation to those who have a longstanding parent-child relationship with the child and prohibits the district court from granting visitation if the visitation is not in the child\u2019s best interest or interferes with the custodial parent\u2019s relationship, and because we conclude that the petitioner has the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence, we also conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>that it is narrowly drawn to the state\u2019s compelling interest in protecting the general welfare of children by preserving the relationships of recognized family units. We therefore hold that Minn.Stat. \u00a7 257C.08, subd. 4, is not unconstitutional on its face.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-5\"><em>SooHoo, </em>731 N.W.2d at 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Whether the Maryland General Assembly chooses to enact legislation similar to the Minnesota statute at issue in <em>SooHoo </em>is within its prerogative, of course, and we express no view, in the abstract, as to any such statute\u2019s constitutionality, either under the federal constitution or under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Margaret K. maintains, on the other hand, that this Court has recognized <em>de facto </em>parenthood status as a subset of exceptional circumstances. Citing <em>Monroe v. Monroe, </em>329 Md. 758, 621 A.2d 898 (1993), she argues that the putative father in that case satisfied the requirements for exceptional circumstances because he was a de facto parent. Margaret K. misreads <em>Monroe. </em>In <em>Monroe, </em>we determined that there was ample evidence to support a finding of the exceptional circumstances necessary to overcome the legal parent\u2019s presumptive right to control her child\u2019s upbringing. We did not determine or conclude that a person who qualifies as a <em>de facto </em>parent is not required, <em>per se, </em>to establish exceptional circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">In <em>Monroe, </em>the mother and putative father of a child, Beth, were involved in a custody dispute following their divorce. The putative father, who had not been married to Beth\u2019s mother at the time of conception, and, therefore, was not presumptively the child\u2019s father, had believed he was Beth\u2019s biological father from the time of her birth. That he was not Beth\u2019s presumptive father became important during the custody dispute, when Beth\u2019s mother sought, and the putative father submitted to, a blood test, which proved he was not the child\u2019s biological father. The putative father nevertheless sought custody, and the master presiding over the evidentiary hearing recommended that the putative father be awarded temporary custody of Beth. Both parties noted exceptions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>the master\u2019s recommendation. The putative father challenged the admissibility of the blood test, and the biological mother challenged the custody recommendation. The Circuit Court rejected the master\u2019s findings and found, as a matter of law, that exceptional circumstances did not exist to overcome the presumption that the child\u2019s best interests were served by remaining with her biological mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">On appeal, this Court reiterated the well-settled proposition that, as a third party, Beth\u2019s putative father was entitled to custody only if exceptional circumstances existed to rebut the presumption that custody belonged with the fit biological parent. <em>Id. </em>at 773-74, 621 A.2d at 905. We then reversed the trial court\u2019s finding that exceptional circumstances had not been shown, holding, instead, that \u201cthere was ample evidence to support the master\u2019s determination that exceptional circumstances existed in this case to rebut the presumption that Beth\u2019s best interests lay with being in the custody of her mother.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 777, 621 A.2d at 907. We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">\u201cIn the present case, that the respondent is not Beth\u2019s father is only fortuitous. Prior to her birth, having been told, and after investigation, having come to believe, that she was his child, he allowed his name to be placed on the birth certificate as her father and proceeded to act as her father. He was present in the delivery room when she was born and he lived with her and her mother, with the exception of periods of separation, both before and after he married her mother, from the time of Beth\u2019s birth. He has, in short, treated the child as if she were his biological child from the time of her birth up to, and beyond, the determination that [s]he is not. From the time of her birth, until recently, and then only for a short time, Beth lived in Baltimore County. For much of that time, she lived with the petitioner and the respondent. Even when she was placed in the physical custody of the petitioner, the respondent, pursuant to the separation agreement, exercised liberal visitation. Indeed, he had joint custody with the petitioner. The evidence at the hearing further tended to prove that the child viewed the respondent as her father; she is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>bonded to him, and he to her. According to Dr. Leon Rosenberg, the respondent is Beth\u2019s psychological father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">\u201cOn the other side of the ledger, aside from the relationship between Beth and the petitioner, no evidence was presented concerning what Beth\u2019s living arrangements would be were custody to be transferred to the petitioner. Nor was there evidence presented as to the relationship that exists between Beth and her mother\u2019s paramour.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_Dq\"><em>Id. </em>at 776-77, 621 A.2d at 906-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Although we noted in <em>Monroe </em>that a psychological bond may form between a child and a third party, we did not suggest that this bond alone necessarily will overcome the right of the legal parent to custody and control over visitation. Nor did we conclude that <em>de facto </em>parent status necessarily overcomes such parental rights. <em>Monroe </em>simply is not inconsistent with our holdings in <em>McDermott </em>and <em>Koshko, </em>or our holding today.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\"><em>Monroe </em>was based on an analysis of the record as a whole. In light of the facts before the Circuit Court, we observed that \u201ca trier of fact could find, as the master did, exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 777, 621 A.2d at 907. We acknowledged, however, that the issue could not be resolved as a matter of law. On that point, we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">\u201cWe do not, of course, express any opinion as to the outcome of this custody matter. We do not wish to suggest that, on remand, custody could not be awarded to the petitioner; it certainly could. We simply wish to provide guidance for the trial court in addressing the issue of permanent custody. We want to make clear that, using its independent judgment, the court has to determine whether the circumstances <em>of this case </em>are sufficiently exceptional as to rebut the presumption that custody should be awarded to the petitioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">Our guidance to the Circuit Court was that it was to consider the totality of the facts to determine whether excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>tional circumstances existed. As Margaret K. notes, one of the key issues before the court in <em>Monroe </em>was the psychological bond between the child and father. We emphasized, however, the putative father\u2019s belief that he was the child\u2019s biological father from the time of her birth. We noted that upon learning of her pregnancy, the child\u2019s mother had taken a voice stress analysis test to prove that the putative father was the child\u2019s actual parent. The mother passed that test and, as a result, the putative father took part in the birthing process and placed his name on the child\u2019s birth certificate as her father. The couple lived together with the child from the time of her birth until nearly four years later. During that time they married. When the couple divorced, they agreed in the separation agreement, \u201cto joint custody of the child \u2018born to the parties prior to their marriage,\u2019 that the primary residence of the child would be the [mother\u2019s], and that the [father] would have visitation rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 761, 621 A.2d at 899. Even after the blood tests revealed that the putative father was not the child\u2019s biological parent, he continued to fight for visitation and custody. We noted that in such a situation, the putative father might even have been equitably estopped<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> from disclaiming his paternal obligations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>\u201cWhere a man provides support and care to a child believing, as a result of the mother\u2019s representations, that he is the child\u2019s father and, thereafter, after being told and, indeed, efforts have been made to prove that he is not, he continues to insist that he is, it is quite likely that he will be deemed to be equitably estopped to deny his obligation to continue to provide for the care and support for the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajl\"><em>Id. </em>at 770 n. 7, 621 A.2d at 903 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Contrary to Margaret K.\u2019s contention, <em>Monroe </em>demonstrates that exceptional circumstances are not established through a rigid test, but rather by an analysis of all of the factors before the court in a particular case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See Sider v. Sider, </em>334 Md. 512, 532-33, 639 A.2d 1076, 1086 (1994). <em>See also Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 73, 120 S.Ct. at 2064, 147 L.Ed2d at 61, (noting that \u201cmost state-court adjudication in this context occurs on a case-by-case basis\u201d). Chief Judge Robert C. Murphy, writing for the Court in <em>Sider, </em>334 Md. 512, 639 A.2d 1076, later amplified and explained this principle. In <em>Sider, </em>the Court remanded the case for further proceedings to resolve a dispute between a natural parent and a third party. The issue to be decided on remand was whether exceptional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>circumstances existed to justify granting custody to the third party. Chief Judge Murphy instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-4\">\u201cOn remand, the circuit court should consider the following factors set forth in <em>Ross v. Hoffman, supra, </em>and any other relevant factors, in determining whether exceptional circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">\u2018(1) the length of time the child has been away from the biological parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">\u2018(2) the age of the child when care was assumed by the third party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">\u2018(3) the possible emotional effect on the child of a change of custody;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-8\">\u2018(4) the period of time which elapsed before the parent sought to reclaim the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-9\">\u2018(5) the nature and strength of the ties between the child and the third party custodian;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-10\">\u2018(6) the intensity and genuineness of the parent\u2019s desire to have the child; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-11\">\u2018(7) the stability and certainty as to the child\u2019s future in the custody of the parent.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-12\">\u201cWe listed other important factors in <em>Turner [v.

An important consideration is the child\u2019s past relationship with the putative father, (citation omitted). Finally, other factors might even include the child\u2019s ability to ascertain genetic information for the purpose of medical treatment and genealogical history.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-14\">327 Md. at 116-17[,607 A.2d 935, 940]. We also stated in <em>Monroe, supra:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-15\">\u2018Whether the child has established a relationship with a third party sufficient to constitute exceptional circumstances, rebutting the presumption of custody in the biological parent, is not dependent on its development <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>during the absence of the biological parent. A relationship resulting in bonding and psychological dependence upon a person without biological connection can develop during an ongoing biological parent/child relationship. Particularly is this true when the relationship is developed in the context of a family unit and is fostered, facilitated and, for most of the child\u2019s life, encouraged by the biological parent. That the relationships, one with a known biological parent and the other with an acknowledged, though, in fact, non-biological, parent, progress at the same time, does not render either less viable.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-4\">329 Md. at 775-76[, 621 A.2d 898, 906]. We would further note that it is ordinarily in the best interest of a child to be raised with his or her siblings. <em>See Hild v. Hild, </em>221 Md. 349, 359, 157 A.2d 442[,447] (1960); <em>Melton v. Connolly, supra, </em>219 Md. [184] at 190, 148 A.2d 387[,390]; <em>Hadick v.

Accordingly, while the psychological bond between a child and a third party is <em>a factor </em>in finding exceptional circumstances, it is not determinative. Likewise, a finding that one meets the requirements that would give that person <em>de facto </em>parent status, were that status to be recognized, is a strong factor to be considered in assessing whether exceptional circumstances exist. It is not, however, determinative as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Accordingly, we hold that the Circuit Court erred in granting visitation to Margaret K. on the grounds that she was a <em>de facto </em>parent without first finding either that Janice M. was an unfit parent or that sufficient exceptional circumstances existed to overcome Janice M.\u2019s liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Although the Circuit Court found that exceptional circumstances did not exist, we shall nonetheless remand for reconsideration of that matter. The Circuit Court based its conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>sion on an improper standard.

I would recognize the concept of <em>de facto </em>parenthood, and would hold that, in the context of visitation, once a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>party establishes that he or she fits within the status of a <em>cle facto </em>parent, proof of parental unfitness or exceptional circumstances is inapplicable, and the decision as to visitation is controlled by the best interest of the child standard alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The <em>defacto </em>parenthood test has its origins in the Wisconsin case of <em>In Re Custody of H.S.H.-K, </em>193 Wis.2d 649, 533 N.W.2d 419 (1995), <em>cert. denied, Knott v. Holtzman, </em>516 U.S. 975, 116 S.Ct. 475, 133 L.Ed.2d 404 (1995). H.S.H.-K. involved a custody battle after a lesbian couple ended their long-term relationship. The birth mother of the child, who had become pregnant through <em>in vitro </em>fertilization and had given birth during the course of the relationship, sought to deny her former partner visitation and custody. The lower courts agreed with the biological mother and denied visitation or custody to the petitioner. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Two questions were presented to the Wisconsin Supreme Court: whether Holtzman could petition for custody and whether she could petition for visitation. <em>Id. </em>at 420. The court said that she could not petition for custody but could petition for visitation based on the judiciary\u2019s equitable power over visitation issues. Petitions for visitation were permissible when a court \u201cdetermines that the petitioner has a parent-like relationship with the child and that a significant triggering event justifies state intervention in the child\u2019s relationship with a biological or adoptive parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435. The Wisconsin Supreme Court adopted the following four-part test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-7\">(1) the biological or adoptive parent must have consented to, and fostered, the petitioner\u2019s formation of a parent-like relationship;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-8\">(2) the petitioner and the child must have lived together in the same household;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-9\">(3) the petitioner must have assumed the obligations of parenthood by taking significant responsibility for the child\u2019s care, education and development, including contributing to the child\u2019s support, without expectation of financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>compensation a petitioner\u2019s contribution to a child\u2019s support need not be monetary; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">(4) the petitioner must have been in a parental role for a length of time sufficient to have established with the child a bonded, dependent relationship parental in nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 435-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">The Wisconsin test set forth a high bar for establishing <em>de facto </em>parent status, minimizing concerns that it could be applied too broadly. The first factor, that the biological parent consented to and fostered the formation of a parent-like relationship, eliminates the majority\u2019s fear that recognition of <em>de facto </em>parenthood will open the floodgates for litigation by babysitters, foster parents and the like. <em>See Janice M. v. Margaret K., </em>404 Md. 661, 686, 948 A.2d 73, 88 (2008) (\u201cThe issues ... could arise in a myriad of other circumstances, including disputes involving step-parents, grandparents, and parties in a relationship with \u2018a significant other\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">The court discussed also the necessity of a significant triggering event to justify state intervention in a child\u2019s relationship with a biological or adoptive parent. The court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-9\">\u201cTo establish a significant triggering event justifying state intervention in the child\u2019s relationship with a biological or adoptive parent, the petitioner must prove that this parent has interfered substantially with the petitioner\u2019s parent-like relationship with the child, and that the petitioner sought court ordered visitation within a reasonable time after the parent\u2019s interference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\">The petitioner must prove all these elements before a circuit court may consider whether visitation is in the best interest of the child. The proceedings must focus on the child. When a non-traditional adult relationship is dissolving, the child is as likely to become a victim of turmoil and adult hostility as is a child subject to the dissolution of a marriage. Such a child needs and deserves the projection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>the courts as much as a child of a dissolving traditional relationship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-6\"><em>H.S.H.-K., </em>193 Wis.2d at 659, 533 N.W.2d at 421 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Since <em>H.S.H.-K, </em>the American Law Institute has adopted and promulgated a definition for a <em>defacto </em>parent in a treatise setting forth principles governing the allocation of custodial and decision-making responsibilities for children. <em>See Janice M. v.

The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court recognized the concept of <em>defacto </em>parent in <em>E.N.O. v. L.M.M., </em>429 Mass. 824, 711 N.E.2d 886 (1999), <em>cert. denied, L.M.M. v. E.N.O., </em>528 U.S. 1005, 120 S.Ct. 500, 145 L.Ed.2d 386 (1999). In <em>E.N.O., </em>the Massachusetts Supreme Court addressed a custody and visitation dispute between a same-sex couple. The biological mother had denied the petitioner access to a child born during the course of their relationship. The court held that the family and probate court traditionally enjoyed equity jurisdiction and, in spite of a lack of statutory authority, the court could find that, pursuant to the best interest of the child, the child\u2019s <em>de facto </em>parent should be allowed visitation with the child. <em>Id. </em>at 892-93. The holding of the court was in part based on its conclusion that \u201crecognition of <em>de facto </em>parents is in accord with notions of the modern family.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 891. The court explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">\u201cA child may be a member of a nontraditional family in which he is parented by a legal parent and a <em>defacto </em>parent. A <em>defacto </em>parent is one who has no biological relation to the child, but has participated in the child\u2019s life as a member of the child\u2019s family. The <em>de facto </em>parent resides with the child and, with the consent and encouragement of the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>parent, performs a share of caretaking functions at least as great as the legal parent. The <em>de facto </em>parent shapes the child\u2019s daily routine, addresses his developmental needs, disciplines the child, provides for his education and medical care, and serves as a moral guide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">The recognition of <em>de facto </em>parents is in accord with the notions of the modern family. An increasing number of same gender couples, like the plaintiff and defendant, are deciding to have children. It is to be expected that children of nontraditional families, like other children, form parent relationships with both parents, whether those parents are legal or <em>de facto. </em>Thus, the best interests calculus must include an examination of the child\u2019s relationship with both his legal and <em>defacto </em>parent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 891 (citations and footnotes omitted). <em>See also V.C. v.

Carvin, </em>547 U.S. 1143, 126 S.Ct. 2021, 164 L.Ed.2d 806 (2006), the Washington Supreme Court was confronted with a custody and visitation dispute between former partners in a same-sex relationship. The court held that Washington\u2019s common law recognizes the status of <em>de facto </em>parents. <em>Id. </em>at 163. The court recognized that \u201c[i]n the face of advancing technologies and evolving notions of what comprises a family unit, this case causes us to confront the manner in which our state, through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>its statutory scheme and common law principles, defines the terms \u2018parents\u2019 and \u2018families.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165. The court concluded that parties who satisfy the requirements of <em>de facto </em>parenthood are \u201cin parity with biological and adoptive parents in our state,\u201d explaining as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-4\">\u201cReason and common sense support recognizing the existence of <em>de facto </em>parents and according them the rights and responsibilities which attach to parents in this state. We adapt our common law today to fill the interstices that our current legislative enactment fails to cover in a manner consistent with our laws and stated legislative policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">We thus hold that henceforth in Washington, a <em>de facto </em>parent stands in legal parity with an otherwise legal parent, whether biological, adoptive, or otherwise. As such, recognition of a person as a child\u2019s <em>de facto </em>parent necessarily \u2018authorizes [a] court to consider an award of parental rights and responsibilities ... based on its determination of the best interest of the child.\u2019 A <em>de facto </em>parent is not entitled to any parental privileges, as a matter of right, but only as is determined to be in the best interests of the child at the center of any such dispute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 176-77 (citations and footnotes omitted). <em>See also C.E.W. v.

Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000), nor does it contradict the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence, or this Court\u2019s jurisprudence, in addressing the liberty interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children. <em>See In re E.L.M. C., </em>100 P.3d 546 (holding that despite <em>Troxel, </em>parental unfitness need not be shown). <em>Troxel </em>did not decide whether a finding of unfitness is a condition precedent to recognizing rights of a nonparent. <em>See W.C. ex rel. A.M.K., </em>907 P.2d 719 (Colo.Ct.App.1995) (rejecting father\u2019s argument that unfitness must be shown to interfere with fundamental right to direct upbringing of child). A <em>defacto </em>parent fits within the category of legal parents and should be treated as though \u201cin parity\u201d with legal parents in visitation matters. <em>See In re Parentage of L.B., </em>122 P.3d at 178. As such, granting a <em>de facto </em>parent equal rights over a child does not implicate the liberty interest a legal parent possesses in the care, custody, and control of his or her child. Significantly, the <em>Troxel </em>plurality expressly decided that it would not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">\u201cconsider the primary constitutional question passed on by the Washington Supreme Court\u2014whether the Due Process Clause requires all nonparental visitation statutes to include a showing of harm or potential harm to the child as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>condition precedent <em>to </em>granting visitation. We do not, and need not, define today the precise scope of the parental due process right in the visitation context.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-5\"><em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. at 73, 120 S.Ct. at 2064.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Furthermore, the test to determine <em>de facto </em>parenthood is narrowly tailored and allows a person to overcome the presumption in favor of a natural parent\u2019s rights only after that party demonstrates that he or she is in essence a parent to the child. As Chief Judge Joseph F. Murphy, Jr. explained, writing for the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Janice M. v. Margaret K.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">\u201cThe person who claims to be a child\u2019s <em>de facto </em>parent must successfully shoulder the burdens of (1) pleading, (2) production of evidence, and (3) persuasion. We can take judicial notice that in almost every home occupied by adults and children, the adults perform <em>some </em>parental functions on behalf of the children. Under the above quoted test, however, a person who performed parental functions is not entitled to <em>defacto </em>parent status unless the court finds as a fact that the child\u2019s legal parent has actually fostered such a relationship. Because the test we adopted in <em>S.F. v. M.D., supra, </em>is a strict one, neither our holding in that case nor our holding in the case at bar will open the floodgates to claims of <em>de facto </em>parenthood asserted by persons who can prove nothing more than that, while living with the natural or adoptive parent of a child, they performed some parental functions on behalf of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-8\">\u201cRare are the case like the case at bar, in which the circuit court was presented with evidence that (as summarized in the argument of Margaret K.\u2019s counsel) \u2018Maya was with Margaret [K.] every day of her life in this country until August of 2004[and][t]he only reason that Margaret [K.] has been deprived of the opportunity to have a relationship with her daughter is because she wasn\u2019t on that decree of adoption.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number><em>Janice M. v.

As the majority in this case notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">\u201cThe plurality [in Troxel] declined to define the precise scope of the parental due process right in the visitation context and declined to answer the question of whether the Due Process Clause requires all nonparental visitation statutes to include a showing of harm or potential harm. <em>Id. </em>at 73, 120 S.Ct. at 2064. Instead, the Court rested its holding on the sweeping breadth of the Washington statute, stating as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">\u2018In this respect, we agree with Justice Kennedy that the constitutionality of any standard for awarding visitation turns on the specific manner in which that standard is applied and that the constitutional protections in this area are best \u2018elaborated with care.\u2019 Because much state-court adjudication in this context occurs on a case-by-case basis, we would be hesitant to hold that specific nonparental visitation statutes violate the Due Process Clause as a <em>per se </em>matter.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-8\"><em>See Janice M. v.

The <em>Troxel </em>plurality noted the lack of \u201cspecial factors\u201d justifying interference with the parent\u2019s liberty interest, comparing the Washington statute to other states, where a standard is required showing that a parent \u201chas denied (or unreasonably denied) visitation to the concerned third party.\u201d <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 68, 71, 120 S.Ct. at 2061, 2063. Justice Souter, in his concurrence, criticized the Washington statute for not requiring a \u201csubstantial rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>tionship\u201d as a threshold matter. <em>Id. </em>at 77, 120 S.Ct. at 2066. Justice Kennedy went further, noting in his dissent that \u201ca fit parent\u2019s right vis-a-vis a complete stranger is one thing; her right vis-a-vis another parent or a <em>de facto </em>parent may be another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100-01, 120 S.Ct. at 2079.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">We have attempted to clarify the principles noted in <em>Troxel </em>in <em>McDermott v. Dougherty, </em>385 Md. 320, 869 A.2d 751 (2005), and <em>Koshko v. Haining, </em>398 Md. 404, 921 A.2d 171 (2007). In <em>McDermott </em>we explained \u201cthat parental unfitness and exceptional circumstances are threshold considerations in third party custody determinations; <em>Koshko </em>made clear that those considerations apply in third party visitation disputes.\u201d <em>See Janice M. v. Margaret K., </em>404 Md. 661, 680, 948 A.2d 73, 84 (2008). Both opinions dealt with the rights of pure third parties, and not those of <em>de facto </em>parents. <em>See McDermott, </em>385 Md. at 356, 869 A.2d at 772 (delineating the distinction between \u201cpure third-party cases\u201d and cases involving \u201cpsychological parents, third parties who have, in effect, become parents\u201d); <em>Koshko, </em>398 Md. at 443, 921 A.2d at 194. They do not address the issue before the Court today.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">In my view, <em>Monroe v. Monroe, </em>329 Md. 758, 621 A.2d 898 (1993), provides support for adoption of the <em>de facto </em>parent doctrine. <em>Monroe </em>dealt with a non-biological party who sought custody and visitation. Writing for the Court, Chief Judge Bell pointed out that \u201c[w]hat is important, rather, is the relationship that exists between the child and each of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 775, 621 A.2d at 906. Significantly, we noted as to a man denying support to a child, even though the child turns out not to be his biological child, we stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">\u201cWhere a man provides support and care to a child believing, as a result of the mother\u2019s representations, that he is the child\u2019s father and, thereafter, after being told and, indeed, efforts have been made to prove that he is not, he continues to insist that he is, it is quite likely that he will be deemed to be equitably estopped to deny his obligation to continue to provide for the care and support of the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 770 n. 7, 621 A.2d at 903 n. 7 (citation omitted). We noted in <em>Monroe </em>that protection of a child\u2019s relationship with a non-biological parent is warranted \u201cwhen the relationship is developed in the context of a family unit and is fostered, facilitated and, for most of the child\u2019s life, encouraged by the biological parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 775, 621 A.2d at 906. Although in <em>Monroe </em>we were discussing \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d the rationale of our discussion applies to the <em>de facto </em>parent discussion. We stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\">\u201cWhether the child has established a relationship with a third party sufficient to constitute exceptional circumstances, rebutting the presumption of custody in the biological parent, is not dependent on its development during the absence of the biological parent. A relationship resulting in bonding and psychological dependence upon a person without biological connection can develop during an ongoing biological parent/child relationship. Particularly is this true when the relationship is developed in the context of a family unit and is fostered, facilitated and, for most of the child\u2019s life, encouraged by the biological parent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-5\"><em>Id. Monroe </em>supports the argument that <em>de facto </em>parent status, if established, is different from a pure third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\"><em>Monroe </em>provides support also for an alternative basis for applying the best interests of the child analysis, the recognition of a parent by estoppel. As the majority notes, we theorized that \u201cthe putative father might even have been equitably estopped from disclaiming his parental obligations.\u201d <em>See Janice M. v. Margaret K., </em>404 Md. 661, 692, 948 A.2d 73, 91-92 (2008). We explicitly said in <em>Monroe </em>that \u201cit is quite likely that [a man providing support and care believing that he is the child\u2019s father] will be deemed to be equitably estopped to deny his obligation to continue to provide for the care and support for the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 770 n. 7, 621 A.2d at 903 n. 7. While the majority argues that equitable estoppel is not an equivalent concept to parenthood by estoppel, <em>see Janice M. v. Margaret K., </em>404 Md. 661, 692 n. 12, 948 A.2d 73, 91-92 n. 12 (2008), the American Law Institute\u2019s definition of a parent by estoppel includes any individual who, though not a legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>parent, is obligated to pay child support under \u00a7 3 of the treatise.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 3.03 provides for the kind of equitable estoppel we discussed in <em>Monroe. </em>The recognition of the psychological bond and equitable estoppel from denying parental support suggested by <em>Monroe </em>provide strong foundation for the recognition of <em>de facto </em>parenthood status in Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">As Margaret K. points out in her brief, a finding that a person qualifies as a <em>de facto </em>parent does not result automatically in visitation rights. Such determination only leads to the next question: What is in the best interest of the child? <em>See, e.g., In re Parentage of L.B., </em>122 P.3d at 177 (stating that \u201c[a] <em>de facto </em>parent is not entitled to any parental privileges, as a matter of right, but only as is determined to be in the best interest of the child at the center of any such dispute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Several of our sister states, in considering non-parents\u2019 assertions of parental rights, reject a finding of parental unfitness as a predicate for state interference with the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>ent\u2019s right to control the upbringing of their children. <em>See, e.g., Downs v. Scheffler, </em>206 Ariz. 496, 80 P.3d 775 (Ct.App. 2003); <em>In re Custody of C.C.R.S., </em>892 P.2d 246 (Colo.1995) (rejecting parental unfitness standard in favor of the best interests of the child test in contest between biological mother and psychological parents); <em>Roth v. Weston, </em>259 Conn. 202, 789 A.2d 431(2002); <em>Rideout v. Riendeau, </em>761 A.2d 291 (Me. 2000); <em>Blixt v. Blixt, </em>437 Mass. 649, 774 N.E.2d 1052 (2002); <em>Moriarty v. Bradt, </em>177 N.J. 84, 827 A.2d 203 (2003); <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>132 N.M. 445, 50 P.3d 194 (Ct.App.2002); <em>State ex rel. Brandon L. v. Moats, </em>209 W.Va. 752, 551 S.E.2d 674, 684 (2001) (concluding that two-prong standard of best interests of child and lack of substantial interference with parents\u2019 right meets <em>Troxel </em>requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">For the reasons noted above, I would hold that a <em>de facto </em>parent stands in legal parity with a legal parent, whether biological, adoptive, or otherwise, for the purposes of visitation. Accordingly, I would not apply the threshold determinations of parental unfitness or exceptional circumstances that we required in <em>McDermott </em>and <em>Koshko. </em>A party who has demonstrated that he or she is a child\u2019s <em>de facto </em>parent should be entitled to visitation rights if such a result is in the best interest of the child.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-9\">. Recognizing <em>de facto </em>parenthood status is especially relevant because, as the majority notes, whether same-sex couples may adopt in Maryland remains unsettled. <em>See Janice M. v. Margaret K., </em>404 Md. 661, 665, n. 3, 948 A.2d 73, 75 n. 3 (2008) (\"The issue of whether same-sex couples may adopt a child in Maryland has not been briefed in this case and we express no opinion on the issue\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b727-8\">. The definition for a <em>de facto </em>parent is set forth in the American Law Institute, Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution: Analysis and Recommendations \u00a7 2.03(l)(c) (2003) (\"ALI Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution\u201d), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-9\">\u201cA <em>de facto </em>parent is an individual other than a legal parent or a parent by estoppel who, for a significant period of time not less than two years,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-10\">(i) lived with the child and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-11\">(ii) for reasons primarily other than financial compensation, and with the agreement of a legal parent to form a parent-child relationship, or as a result of a complete failure or inability of any legal parent to perform caretaking functions,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-12\">(A) regularly performed a majority of the caretaking functions for the child, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-13\">(B) regularly performed a share of caretaking functions at least as great as that of the parent with whom the child primarily lived.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b727-14\">.
