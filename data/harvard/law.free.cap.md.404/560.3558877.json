We shall answer in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">This appeal consists of two separate underlying cases that were consolidated by the Court of Special Appeals, which we have followed. Although the facts of the underlying cases are different, they present the same legal issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\"><em>Dianne Anderson, Individually, et al. v. Council of Unit Owners of The Gables on Tuckerman Condominium, </em>No. 271904, Circuit Court for Montgomery County</p>\n<p id=\"b591-14\">The Gables on Tuckerman Condominium, located at 5800 Tuckerman Lane in Rockville, Maryland, was established by declaration, bylaws and plats recorded among the land records of Montgomery County in August of 1987. The Council of Owners of The Gables on Tuckerman (\u201cCouncil of Gables\u201d) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>the unincorporated association of all owners that was established by its Bylaws.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Dianne Anderson owned a two-level town home in The Gables.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At all times relevant, the Council of Gables carried a master condominium insurance policy on the property with a deductible of $10,000 per occurrence; Ms. Anderson was insured by a condominium owners \u201cCondocover\u201d policy issued by Erie Insurance Exchange (\u201cErie\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">In July of 2004, the water heater on the upper level of Ms. Anderson\u2019s home began leaking and water flowed through the ceiling into the kitchen, \u201ccausing severe water damage to the carpet and walls of the unit,\u201d amounting to $6,358.23. No other condominium town home was affected, nor was any other part of the structure damaged. Ms. Anderson requested that the Council of Gables repair or provide proceeds to repair the damage. The Council of Gables declined, and subsequently, after Ms. Anderson paid the $250.00 deductible, Erie paid for the repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Dianne Anderson, individually, and Erie filed a two count complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, seeking to recover $6,358.23, the amount expended to repair her home. In Count I, they alleged that the Council of Gables breached its duty under Section 11-114 of the Maryland Condominium Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to purchase property insurance on all common elements and units, and in case there was a deductible, apportion that deductible as a common expense, when the Council of Gables refused Ms. Anderson\u2019s request to pay for the remediation, repair or replacement of the damaged portion of her home. Count II alleged that the Council of Gables breached its fiduciary duty by refusing to repair the damage. Ms. Anderson and Erie later amended their complaint by adding that the Council of Gables \u201cnegligently\u201d breached its duty under the Condominium Act in Count I and also filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, to which the Council of Gables responded. The Circuit Court treated the Council of Gables\u2019 response as a Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment. The court conducted a hearing on January 22, 2007, and thereafter, Judge William J. Rowan, III granted the Council of Gables\u2019 motion, denied Ms. Anderson\u2019s and Erie\u2019s motion, and entered judgment in favor of the Council of Gables. Ms. Anderson and Erie appealed to the Court of Special Appeals on January 26, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number><em>Erie Insurance Exchange, et al. v.

The Council of Owners of Bridgeport Condominium (\u201cCouncil of Bridgeport\u201d)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is the unincorporated association of all owners that was established by the Bylaws that govern The Bridgeport Condominium.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Charles and Cindy O\u2019Carroll (\u201cthe O\u2019Carrolls\u201d) owned a home in The Bridgeport Condominium, which they rented to Velma Kiawu.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The O\u2019Carrolls also were insured by a condominium owners \u201cCondocover\u201d policy issued by Erie; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Council of Bridgeport carried a master insurance policy with a deductible of $25,000 per occurrence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">On an evening in March of 2003, a grease fire erupted, which caused the ceiling sprinkler system to engage. Smoke, fire and water damage resulted; carpet, walls, blinds, cabinetry and a microwave in the O\u2019Carrolls\u2019 home were damaged in the total amount of $12,157.14; the damage was confined to the O\u2019Carrolls\u2019 home and the structure of the condominium was not affected. The O\u2019Carrolls asked the Council of Bridgeport to repair or replace the damage, which the Council of Bridgeport declined to do; subsequently, after the O\u2019Carrolls paid their $250.00 insurance policy deductible, Erie paid for the repair or replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Erie, to its own use and to the use of the O\u2019Carrolls, filed a three count complaint in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s Court, seeking to recover $12,257.14,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the funds expended to repair the condominium. Counts I and II contained the same allegations as that filed in the Anderson case, while Count III alleged negligence against Ms. Kiawu. Erie and the O\u2019Car-rolls subsequently amended their complaint by adding an allegation that the Council of Bridgeport \u201cnegligently\u201d breached its duty under the Act in Count I,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and also filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. The Council of Bridgeport filed a motion in opposition, which was treated by the Circuit Court as a Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment. The court conducted a hearing on March 30, 2007, and thereafter, Judge Sherrie L. Krauser o f the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>County denied Erie\u2019s and the O\u2019 Carrolls\u2019 motion, granted the Council of Bridgeport\u2019s motion and entered judgment in its favor. Erie and the O\u2019Carrolls appealed to the Court of Special Appeals on April 27, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">\n<em>The Consolidated Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The intermediate appellate court granted the parties\u2019 Joint Motion to Consolidate Appeals on September 19, 2007, and subsequently, this Court issued, on its initiative, a writ of certiorari prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court. <em>Anderson v. Council of Unit Owners of The Gables on Tuckerman Condo.; Erie Ins. Exch. v. Council of Unit Owners of Bridgeport Condo., </em>402 Md. 352, 936 A.2d 850 (2007). The Appellants, Ms. Anderson, the O\u2019Carrolls and Erie (\u201cthe Owners\u201d) presented the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">Does the Maryland Condominium Act, Md.Code Real Property, \u00a7 11-101 <em>et. seq., </em>in particular, \u00a7 11-114, require a condominium association to repair or replace the damaged portions of an individual condominium unit following a casualty loss?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">We hold that the Maryland Condominium Act does not require a condominium association to repair or replace property of an owner in an individual condominium unit after a casualty loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">In considering a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment, this Court reviews the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Bednar v.

In the present case, there is no genuine dispute of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always \u201cto discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules.\u201d <em>Barbre v, Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 172, 935 A.2d 699, 708 (2007); <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Seay, </em>388 Md. 341, 352, 879 A.2d 1049, 1055 (2005). <em>See also Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Kelly, </em>397 Md. 399, 419-20, 918 A.2d 470, 482 (2007). We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that \u201c \u2018no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 172, 935 A.2d at 708; <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 420, 918 A.2d at 482. <em>See also Kane v. Bd. of Appeals of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>390 Md. 145, 167, 887 A.2d 1060, 1073 (2005). Further, an interpretation should be given to the statutory provisions that does not lead to absurd conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>quences. <em>See Roskelly v. Lamone, </em>396 Md. 27, 53, 912 A.2d 658, 673 (2006); <em>So. Easton Neighborhood Ass\u2019n v. Town of Easton, </em>387 Md. 468, 495, 876 A.2d 58, 74 (2005); <em>Smack v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>378 Md. 298, 305, 835 A.2d 1175, 1179 (2003) (\u201c[T]he statute must be given a reasonable interpretation, \u2018not one that is illogical or incompatible with common sense.\u2019 \u201d). If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends. <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 173, 935 A.2d at 709; <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 419, 918 A.2d at 482; <em>City of Frederick v.

If, however, the language is subject to more than one interpretation, or when the terms are ambiguous when it is part of a larger statutory scheme, it is ambiguous, and we endeavor to resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute. <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 173, 935 A.2d at 709; <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 419-20, 918 A.2d at 482; <em>Smack, </em>378 Md. at 305, 835 A.2d at 1179; <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Chase, </em>360 Md. 121, 129, 756 A.2d 987, 991-92 (2000). When the statute is part of a larger statutory scheme, it is axiomatic that the language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation; rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole considering the \u201cpurpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body,\u201d <em>Serio, </em>384 Md. at 389, 863 A.2d at 961; <em>Drew v. First Guar. Mortgage Corp., </em>379 Md. 318, 327, 842 A.2d 1, 6 (2003), and attempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect. <em>Bowen v. City of Annapolis, </em>402 Md. 587, 613-14, 937 A.2d 242, 258 (2007); <em>Magnetti v. Univ. of Md., </em>402 Md. 548, 565, 937 A.2d 219, 229 (2007); <em>Clipper Windpower, Inc. v. Sprenger, </em>399 Md. 539, 554, 924 A.2d 1160, 1168 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The ambiguity in this case results from comparison of the statutory language involving the coverage of a master policy held by the council of owners with the duty of the condominium council to repair the condominium. Under Section 11-114(a)(1), the council of owners is required to maintain insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>anee on the entire condominium property, \u201cthe <em>common elements </em>and <em>units, </em>exclusive of improvements and betterments installed in <em>units </em>by unit owners,\u201d but under subsection (g), the council of owners is responsible for repairing or replacing \u201cany portion of the condominium damaged or destroyed.\u201d (emphasis added). The word \u201cunit\u201d in (a)(1) creates the ambiguity upon which this dispute rests, and we must look at the entire regulatory scheme of the Condominium Act and its legislative history to illuminate the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>See Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 419-20, 918 A.2d at 482; <em>Mayor &amp; Town Council of Oakland v. Mayor &amp; Town Council of Mountain Lake Park, </em>392 Md. 301, 316, 896 A.2d 1036, 1045 (2006); <em>Smack, </em>378 Md. at 305, 835 A.2d at 1179; <em>Chase, </em>360 Md. at 129, 756 A.2d at 991-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">A condominium is \u201can estate in real property\u201d that \u201ctypically involves an apartment building or other structure consisting of two or more separate apartments or units,\u201d i.e., \u201chorizontal property\u201d or multi-story \u201cstacked units.\u201d <em>See </em>1 Patrick J. Rohan &amp; Melvin A. Reskin, <em>Condominium Law and Practice </em>Section 1.03[l][a] (2007). <em>See also </em>4 <em>Thompson </em>on Real Property 233 (2d ed. 1994) (\u201cIt has been stated that the condominium concept established the creation of a set of vertical boundaries separated into horizontal apartments, units, floors or stories.\u201d). However, as the notion of a condominium has evolved, it has come to also refer to \u201c[tjown houses,\u201d \u201coffices,\u201d and even \u201cstores\u201d with the appropriate recorded declaration, bylaws and condominium plat. 1 <em>Condominium Law and Practice </em>at Section 1.03[l][a]. <em>See also </em>Wendell A. Smith, <em>Creating a Planned Community: First Steps, </em>Probate &amp; Property 18 (July/August 1993) (\u201cThe condominium form of ownership can be used for almost any type of physical structure, including multistory apartment buildings, attached townhouses, detached single-family dwellings or other nonresidential or mixed use projects.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">In <em>Ridgely Condominium Ass\u2019n v. Smyrnioudis, </em>343 Md. 357, 681 A.2d 494 (1996), we provided an overview of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>the condominium form of ownership, explicating that an owner has a \u201chybrid property interest\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\">A condominium is a \u201ccommunal form of estate in property consisting of individually owned units which are supported by collectively held facilities and areas.\u201d <em>Andrews v. City of Greenbelt, </em>293 Md. 69, 71, 441 A.2d 1064 (1982).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">The term condominium may be defined generally as a system for providing separate ownership of individual units in multiple-unit developments. In addition to the interest acquired in a particular apartment, each unit owner also is a tenant in common in the underlying fee and in the spaces and building parts used in common by all the unit owners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">4B Richard R. Powell, <em>Powell on Real Property </em>\u00b6 632.1[4] (1996). A condominium owner, therefore, holds a hybrid property interest consisting of an exclusive ownership of a particular unit or apartment and a tenancy in common with the other co-owners in the common elements. <em>Andrews, supra, </em>293 Md. at 73-74, 441 A.2d 1064; <em>see also Starfish Condo, v. Yorkridge Serv., </em>295 Md. 693, 703, 458 A.2d 805 (1983); <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>295 (6th ed.1990).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-7\"><em>Ridgely Condo.

She or he owns a fee interest in her or his individual property, comprising the exclusive right to use and occupy it. Discussing stacked-unit condominium regimes, Professor Richard R. Powell, in his treatise <em>Powell on Real Property, </em>defined the critical features of a condominium unit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay1\">One easy way to visualize a condominium unit is as a cube of air, the tangible boundaries of which are usually the finished side of the interior sheetrock, ceilings and floors----[T]he condominium unit is generally seen by owners as the \u201cinside\u201d of their structure while the shell and \u201coutside\u201d of the building is a common element.... A typical condominium <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>unit consists of: the finished side of all interior walls, floors, partitions and ceilings; windows; kitchen cabinets and fixtures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">8 Richard R.

The airspace is owned by a unit owner, while other blocks of airspace above, below or beside the unit might be owned by other unit owners.\u201d) and Section 1.03[2][a] (\u201c[T]he unit may be thought of as a block of airspace surrounded by walls, a floor and a ceiling. Often the legal description of the unit will utilize the walls, floor and ceiling as the legal boundaries of the airspace. In such a case, the unit\u2019s boundaries are established by the location of the walls, floor and ceiling.

Maryland Commission on Condominiums, Preliminary Report to the 1978 Session (March 16, 1978). Developers, the Commission noted, had been criticized for \u201cfail[ing] to complete promised amenities,\u201d \u201cunder-estimating the cost of operation for the condominium,\u201d and \u201cfailing] to turn over control of the project to unit owners.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Commission also reflected upon complaints about councils of owners including \u201carbitrary, capricious or prejudiced action in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>enforcement of covenants or rules\u201d and \u201cfailure to enforce rules, architectural guidelines, or to protect the common areas against encroachment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As to the management companies, the Commission iterated that those grievances involved the \u201cfailure to deliver promised management services or to monitor subcontractors to assure delivery of maintenance services\u201d and \u201cfinancial instability or failure, resulting in abrupt end of services to the condominium.\u201d <em>Id. </em>With respect to the owners, the Commission stated that owners had caused problems through \u201cresistance to long-range financial planning or to the segregation of funds into reserve accounts for long-range repairs,\u201d \u201cunilateral architectural alterations being made to commonly-owned exteriors or areas,\u201d \u201cfailure or refusal to pay regular assessments or fees,\u201d \u201cfailure to maintain unit[s], causing health, safety and/or aesthetic problems, and potential costs to other unit owners\u201d and \u201capathy to association activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Owners also complained, the Commission explained, about \u201cnegligent or wilful damage to common areas, thus adding to expenses of association[s] and resulting in increased condo fees,\u201d recognition of the costs, incurred by the council of owners with respect to common areas, that were apportioned to all of the owners collectively. Finally, the Commission noted some general problems, including the \u201cfinancial instability of condominium associations because of an absence of long-range financial planning and either failure to set aside reserve funds, or unwarranted dipping into them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In 1979 and 1980, the Commission conducted meetings throughout the State to further explore the problems.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, \u00a7 11-128 governs the distribution of insurance proceeds if the condominium is terminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Maryland Code (1974, 1981 Repl.Vol.), Section 11-114 of the Real Property Article. Thereafter, between 1982 and 1989, the General Assembly made various minor and nonsubstantive changes to Section 11-114. <em>See </em>1982 Maryland Laws, Chapter 836; 1984 Maryland Laws, Chapter 525; 1986 Maryland Laws, Chapter 360; 1989 Maryland Laws, Chapter 5.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The Owners argue that Section 11-114 requires that the council of owners must provide insurance coverage for and be responsible for the repair and replacement of property in an individual condominium unit, after a casualty loss, and insist that Section 11-108.1 of the Act only requires that the owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>perform ordinary maintenance, so that their \u201cCondocover\u201d insurance policies are irrelevant when a casualty loss is implicated. Essentially, the Owners argue that ordinary maintenance, repair and replacement rests upon an owner under Section 11-108.1, while repair and replacement following a casualty loss are the obligation of the council of owners under Section 11-114 and must be covered by the master policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The Councils, conversely, contend that Section 11-108.1 of the Act is controlling and that the individual owners are responsible for maintenance, repair and replacement of the damaged contents of their own units. They also argue that the Owners\u2019 reliance on the master policy, under Section 11-114, is misplaced because only the common elements and condominium structure are covered under the master policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">When we examine the context of the entire Condominium Act, it becomes clear that the master insurance provision was intended to cover only damage sustained to the common elements or the structure of a condominium. Section 11-114(c) of the Act defines \u201cinsured person\u201d under the council of owners\u2019 master policy, providing in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">Insurance policies carried pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall provide that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">(1) Each unit owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of his ownership of an undivided interest in the common elements or membership in the council of unit owners____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">Maryland Code (1974, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Section 11-114(c) of the Real Property Article. Each owner is not an insured person with respect to his or her individual interest in his or her own property, but rather, is insured under the master policy only as to his or her collective undivided interest in the entire condominium property. Thus, the master policy is meant not to insure each owner\u2019s property or individual unit, but to protect the common interests of all owners as co-owners of the entire condominium.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Additionally, Section 11-108.1 of the Condominium Act dictates the responsibilities for maintenance, repair and replacement of common elements and units; it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">Except to the extent otherwise provided by the declaration or bylaws, the council of unit owners is responsible for maintenance, repair, and replacement of the common elements, and each unit owner is responsible for maintenance, repair, and replacement of his unit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\"><em>Id. </em>at Section 11-108.1. Section 11-108.1 of the Act thus recognizes the hybrid character of condominium ownership by differentiating between the treatment of common elements and the individual units, with the owner being responsible for damage to her or his \u201cairspace,\u201d <em>Sea Watch Stores, </em>115 Md.App. at 5, 691 A.2d at 752-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The Owners argue, nevertheless, that Section 11-108.1 is inapplicable and that the Section only pertains to repair and replacement of a unit in the course of ordinary maintenance, while Section 11-114 prescribes the council of owners\u2019 duty to repair and replace a unit in the event of a casualty loss. We disagree; if the Legislature intended to limit Section 11-108.1 as the Owners suggest, it could have fashioned the statutory language accordingly. Section 11-108.1 does not distinguish the duty of an owner to repair in the course of ordinary maintenance from the duty to repair following a casualty loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Moreover, the legislative history of Section 11-114 is informing. The original Horizontal Property Act, the ancestor of all of this, referred only to multi-story or stacked-unit buildings. In 1981, moreover, in response to a concern over condominium conversions of stacked-unit or multi-story buildings, specifically, that developers were not adding value to the apartment buildings that were being converted into stacked-unit condominium regimes, the General Assembly substantially revised the Condominium Act. Mirroring the Uniform Condominium Act (1980), the amendment called for the council of owners to maintain property insurance on the entire condominium, i.e., the common elements and units, and to repair or replace the damaged portion of the condominium in the event of a casualty loss. The Uniform Act noted that the addition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>the \u201ccommon elements and units\u201d language was a \u201csignificant departure from the present law\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">Subsection (b) represents a significant departure from the present law in virtually all states by requiring that the association obtain and maintain property insurance on <em>both </em>the common elements <em>and </em>the units within buildings with \u201cstacked\u201d units. While it has been common practice in many parts of the country (either by custom or as mandated by statute) for associations to maintain property insurance on the common elements, it has generally not been the practice for the property insurance policy to cover individual units as well. However, given the great interdependence of the unit owners in the stacked unit condominium situation, mandating property insurance for the entire building is the preferable approach____The Act does not mandate association insurance on units in town house or other arrangements in which there are no stacked units. However, if the developer wishes, the declaration may require association insurance as to units having shared walls or as to all units in the development. Many developments will have some units with horizontal boundaries and other units with no horizontal boundaries. In that case, association insurance as to the units having horizontal boundaries is required, but it is not necessary as to other units.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Comment 2 to Section 3-113 of the Uniform Condominium Act (1980) (citation omitted) (some emphasis added). By adopting the \u201cunit\u201d language, ambiguity was created, but that ambiguity is banished by consideration of its historical context, i.e., that the framers were addressing problems involving \u201cstacked units\u201d in multi-story buildings where walls, floors and ceilings constituted the structure of the condominium, in addition to the outer walls. It is clear, moreover, that in town home condominium properties, where no stacked units exist, insurance on the individual town homes was not contemplated by the Uniform Act. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Our conclusion is also supported by Erie Insurance\u2019s own \u201cCondocover\u201d policy, in effect in the present cases, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">We will pay on your behalf the loss assessment charged by the condominium association for direct loss by a peril insured against in your basic policy. Anyone we protect and the other unit-owners must have an undivided interest in the damaged property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">Under Dwelling Protection\u2014Section I, the assessment must result from a direct loss to property, owned by all the property owners collectively, caused by any of the Perils We Insure Against.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Thus, Erie agrees that Section 11-114 only applies to damaged property owned by the owners collectively, and not by an individual owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">The Owners\u2019 interpretation of the statute also would lead to illogical and absurd results by giving the council owners greater responsibility for losses within a unit than a landlord has on the property of a tenant, when the landlord owns the space, while the council of owners does not. <em>See Hemmings v. Pelham Wood Ltd. Liab.

Additionally, the council of owners would be responsible for repairing or replacing property in a unit within which the council has no right to enter to make inspections or perform preventative maintenance. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1974, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Section ll-125(e) of the Real Property Article (stating that the council of owners can only enter a unit to make repairs that \u201creasonably appear necessary for public safety or to prevent damage to other portions of the condominium\u201d). As we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>noted on many prior occasions, the General Assembly reasonably could not have intended such an illogical result. <em>See Ross, </em>387 Md. at 667, 876 A.2d at 702 (rejecting statutory construction advocated by the State Board of Elections because it was \u201c \u2018unreasonable, illogical, unjust, [and] inconsistent with common sense\u2019 \u201d) (alteration in original); <em>In re Colby H., </em>362 Md. 702, 722, 766 A.2d 639, 649-50 (2001) (\u201c \u2018[Construction of a statute which is unreasonable, illogical, unjust, or inconsistent with common sense should be avoided.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Comptroller of Treasury v.

While it has been common practice in many parts of the country (either by custom or as mandated by statute) for associations to maintain property insurance on the common elements, it has generally not been the practice for the property insurance policy to cover individual units as well. However, given the great interdependence of the unit owners in the stacked unit condominium situation, mandating property insurance for the entire building is the preferable approach____ The Act does not mandate association insurance on units in town house or other arrangements in which there are no stacked units. However, if the developer wishes, the declaration may require association insurance as to units having shared walls or as to all units in the development. Many developments will have some units with horizontal boundaries and other units with no horizontal boundaries. In that case, association insurance as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>units having horizontal boundaries is required, but it is not necessary as to other units.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-13\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted) (some emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b614-7\">.
