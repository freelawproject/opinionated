Galloway, of the Circuit Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Carroll County, for hearing pursuant to Rule 16-757(c).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The respondent did not answer the petition and, therefore, an Order of Default was entered against her. When she did not move to vacate the Order of Default, a default hearing, at which the respondent neither appeared nor participated was held, after which the court found facts by clear and convincing evidence and drew conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">As to Bar Counsel\u2019s complaint, the hearing court found the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">One day after filing a Petition For Modification of Custody, on behalf of her client, the respondent filed a Petition For Ex Parte Relief, alleging that the custodial parent intended to expose the minor child to drug dealers and stating that she and her client would appear ex parte in court on the following Monday for the purpose of seeking sole legal custody, both <em>pendente lite </em>and permanently, of the couple\u2019s son. Although the respondent wrote to the defendant advising her of the filing of the petition for ex parte relief and the date, time and presiding judge, she neglected to enclose copies of the court filings, and, contrary to what was said in the letter, no hearing had at that time been set before the judge named. Responding to the respondent\u2019s letter, the defendant obtained counsel and appeared with the respondent and her client at the time, and in the court, designated. The judge who heard the matter, who also happened to be the judge the respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>named in her petition, denied the ex parte relief and, instead, directed, by order, that \u201cthe matter proceed in a normal, timely fashion.\u201d Pointing to \u201cthe procedures employed by the Plaintiff and her counsel and the legal costs foreseeably imposed upon the Defendant by the Plaintiffs actions,\u201d the judge assessed attorney\u2019s fees, in an amount to be determined after the defendant\u2019s request for fees and the respondent\u2019s answer, against the respondent and her client, jointly and severally.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The respondent did not respond to the defendant\u2019s request for counsel fees. As a result, the judge ordered the respondent, and expressly not her client, to pay the defendant counsel fees of $750.00. The fees were to be reimbursed in thirty (30) days. When the respondent did not pay within thirty (30) days, the defendant filed a petition for contempt. Although the respondent did not respond to the petition and judgment was entered against the respondent for $750.00, an order of satisfaction of the judgment was subsequently filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The petitioner, by letter, sought an explanation from the respondent with respect to the court\u2019s order of counsel fees and the reason that the respondent did not timely comply with that order. The respondent failed to respond in the time requested, prompting a second letter from the petitioner. This letter was returned unclaimed. When the petitioner\u2019s investigator spoke to the respondent about the matter, she indicated that she had responded and, having been informed that it had not been received, that, she would locate<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and forward another copy of the response. This was never done.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">As to the complaint of Gladys Bellamy, one of the respondent\u2019s former clients, the court found:</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The respondent agreed to represent the complainant in divorce proceedings against her husband, who resided in California. They entered into a retainer agreement, which called for a flat fee of $ 750.00 and the payment of the $ 120.00 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>filing fee. That filing fee and the fee were paid over time, according to the complainant, \u201cshe paid respondent ... in six $ 100.00 payments and a final payment of $ 150.00 on September 30, 2005.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">After the retainer had begun to be paid, but before it was completed, the respondent filed, in the Circuit Court for Carroll County, a Complaint for Absolute Divorce on the complainant\u2019s behalf and caused a summons to be issued. When that summons and the complaint, which were served by certified mail, were not picked up by the complainant\u2019s husband, the respondent informed the complainant that she would try to serve him once again by \u201cregistered mail.\u201d After more than a month had passed, the complainant e-mailed the respondent at the e-mail address at which she previously had emailed the respondent, but that e-mail was returned as undeliverable. Subsequently, the court, pursuant to the respondent\u2019s request, reissued the summons for the complainant\u2019s husband. Thereafter, before filing a complaint with the petitioner, the complainant sought to contact the respondent at her home, without success, even though automobiles were in the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">In an attempt to get the respondent\u2019s response to the complaint, Bar Counsel sent a letter to the respondent, enclosing the complaint, and asking that she respond in fifteen (15) days. When the respondent did not timely respond, Bar Counsel sent another letter, this time by certified mail, requesting response by ten (10) days. That letter was returned unclaimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">A third letter, again by certified mail, was mailed to the respondent. The respondent acknowledged receipt of the letter, by signing the return receipt card. The respondent however did not respond to the third letter either.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The complainant\u2019s divorce action was dismissed following the respondent\u2019s failure to take any action in response to the Notice of Contemplated Dismissal, pursuant to Maryland Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>2-507.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The respondent did not inform the complainant of the dismissal of her case. But the respondent had not communicated with the complainant since November 2005. Nor did the respondent refund to the complainant any of the retainer or give her an explanation as to why she did not. In an interview with the petitioner\u2019s investigator, the respondent explained that she had not placed any of the complainant\u2019s retainer in escrow \u201cbecause she had charged a flat fee.\u201d Moreover, she told the investigator that she believed that she had sent a response to the complaint and, having learned that one had not been received, promised that she would locate one-niade necessary by flooding in her office\u2014and mail it to the petitioner. No response was ever sent.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">On these findings of fact, the hearing court drew conclusions of law. As the Bar Counsel\u2019s Complaint, it concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"AaK\">\n<em>\u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct violates Rule 1.1.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s actions show a lack of the legal knowledge, as required by Rule 1.1, to obtain a hearing on an emergency basis. It is apparent that she did not consult Rule 1-351, which provided that she certify that all parties had been given notice of the time and place of her presentation of her application. She was also seemingly unaware of the require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ment of Rule 2-311(d) that a motion based on facts not in the record be supported by an affidavit setting forth the necessary acts under oath and advised the opposing party that the request would be heard at a particular time. As a result of her failure to comply with the Rules, she subjected her client to a motion for counsel fees. Her conduct displays a lack of competence in violation of Rule 1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\n<em>\u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct violates Rule 8.1(b).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u201cThe evidence shoes that respondent ignored letters from petitioner dated April 28, 2006 and May 11, 2006. There can be no question that she received them, as she told petitioner\u2019s investigator on October 2, 2006 that she believed that she had mailed in an answer to both of the complaints that are the subject of this litigation. However, no answer was ever received.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\n<em>\u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct violates 84(d).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\u201cRespondent violated Rule 8.4(d) both for the reasons stated in the discussion of Rule 1.1 and also by failing to pay the $750.00 judgment entered against her within 30 days as required by the court\u2019s order of February 13, 2006. While her interview would indicate that she may have been under financial distress, she made no representations to this effect in response to the contempt petition filed by Ms. Hamilton, in a written submission to Bar Counsel, or in this proceeding. Therefore, the evidence supports the finding that her failure to pay as directed by the court was conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">With respect to the Galloway complaint:</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">\n<em>\u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct violates Rule 1.1.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">\u201cRule 1.1 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">\u201cA lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">\u201cCompliance with the Rule requires more than knowing what to do. It requires applying the knowledge to the client\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>problem. The Court of Appeals has said, \u201cEvidence of a failure to apply the requisite thoroughness and/or preparation in representing a client is sufficient alone to support a violation of Rule 1.1.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 891 A.2d 1085, 1097 (2006). In <em>Guida, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the failure of an attorney to pursue a client\u2019s adoption case after taking a fee, even if the attorney knew what to do, violated Rule 1.1. Respondent\u2019s conduct is similar to <em>Guida\u2019s. </em>She took a fee and then abandoned the representation after commencing the litigation. Like Guida, she violated Rule 1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">\n<em>\u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct violates Rule 1.2</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A4P\">\u201cThe evidence shows that respondent did not abide by the client\u2019s decision regarding the objectives of the representation. Complainant\u2019s objective was to obtain a divorce. Instead of purs[u]ing this objective, respondent allowed the case to be dismissed and stopped pursuing the matter altogether. Thus, she failed to abide by the client\u2019s decisions regarding the objective of the representation and violated Rule 1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"AeX\">\n<em>\u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct violates Rule 1.3.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u201cThe evidence shows that respondent failed to act with \u2018diligence and promptness\u2019 as required by Rule 1.3, for the same reasons discussed under Rules 1.1 and 1.2. She abandoned efforts to serve the defendant and took no action after receiving the notice of contemplated dismissal. This is an extreme lack of diligence and a violation of Rule 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"A5l\">\n<em>\u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct violates Rule 1.U</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aze\">\u201cThe evidence shows that respondent violated Rule 1.4(a)(2) by failing to keep the client informed about the status of the matter. From November 2005 onward, she failed to communicate with her client about the client\u2019s case. She did not advise her of the status of service on her husband or of the contemplated dismissal of her case or the dismissal itself. She changed her e-mail address without telling Ms. Bellamy, thus inhibiting communication. Ms. Bellamy became so frustrated with the lack of communication, she even went to respondent\u2019s residence but received no answer after she knocked on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>door even though there were vehicles in the driveway. Respondent clearly violated Rule 1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\n<em>\u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct violates Rule 1.15(a) and Md. Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof. Code Ann., \u00a7 10-304</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u201cThe evidence shows that respondent placed the entire $ 750.00 payment in her operating account at the time it was paid. The fee was for the entire representation and, because respondent\u2019s only substantive action was to file the divorce complaint, most of it was unearned at the time it was deposited in her operating account. Because respondent had not earned the entire fee, some portion of it belonged to the client and met the definition of \u2018trust money\u2019 pursuant to BOP \u00a7 10-301(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s failure to place these funds in her escrow account violates Rule 1.15(a), which requires an attorney to keep the client\u2019s property separate from her own, and BOP \u00a7 10-304, which requires an attorney to keep the client\u2019s property separate from her own, and BOP \u00a7 10-304, which requires a lawyer to deposit trust money into a trust. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Ficker, </em>[399 Md. 445, 453-54,] 924 A.2d 1105, 1111 (2007) (depositing unearned flat fee in operating account violates Rule 1.15(a)); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. McCulloch, </em>[397 Md. 674, 684-86,] 919 A.2d 660, 666, 667-68 (respondent concedes that evidence was sufficient to establish to establish violations of Rule 1.15 and \u00a7 10-304 upon showing that she deposited unearned retainer into operating account).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">\n<em>\u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct violates Rule 1.16(d).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">\u201cRule 1.16(d) requires that \u2018[u]pon termination of a representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client\u2019s interests, such as ... refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred.\u201d In this case, respondent\u2019s fee agreement called for a flat fee of $ 750.00 to handle her divorce case. Respondent filed the case but then was unable to serve the defendant and eventually abandoned the representation without advising complainant that her case was dismissed for lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>of prosecution. She did only a portion of the work required, did not achieve the client\u2019s objective, and kept the entire fee. It is without argument that she did not earn the entire fee and was not entitled to retain all of it. Her failure to refund a portion of it violates Rule 1.16(d). <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Rose, </em>[391 Md. 101,] 892 A.2d 469 (2006) (failure to refund unearned fee for more than one year after discharge violates Rule 1.16(d)); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Tinsky, </em>[377 Md. 646,] 835 A.2d 542 (2003) (failure to return unearned fee after abandonment of representation violates Rule 1.16(d)). \u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct violates Rule 8.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u201cThe evidence establishes that respondent deliberately did not answer letters from Bar Counsel dated April 5, May 2, and May 18, 2006. There is no question that she was aware of these letters as she signed for the third one and told respondent\u2019s investigator that she had mailed in a response. When she was told that no response had been received, she promised to mail in another one but never did. This is a knowing failure to answer Bar Counsel in violation of Rule 8.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\n<em>\u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct violates Rule 84(c).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u201cBy spending fiduciary funds on herself, respondent engaged in dishonest conduct in violation of Rule 8.4(c). Respondent\u2019s conduct is virtually identical to that of the respondent in <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Duvall, </em>[384 Md. 234,] 863 A.2d 291 (2004). In that case, respondent received a $ 1700 advance payment, of which $ 1500 w[ere] for fees, in connection with services regarding the placement of the client\u2019s sister in the National Lutheran Home for the Aged. Respondent eventually abandoned the representation and did not respond to the client\u2019s requests for an accounting of the funds. Her office telephone was disconnected. After the client complained to the Attorney Grievance Commission, she failed to respond to Bar Counsel. Like respondent here, she did not account for or refund the fee, even though in her last billing she stated that the client had a positive balance of $ 1, 097.50, and did not participate in the disciplinary proceedings based on client\u2019s complaint. The hearing judge found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>respondent\u2019s conduct violated Rule 8.4(c) and the Court of Appeals disbarred respondent based on this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"AC2\">\n<em>\u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct violates Rule 84(d).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s failure to pursue her client\u2019s objectives, respond to the notice of dismissal, communicate with her client, or refund an unearned fee are all prejudicial to the administration of justice. Respondent violated Rule 8.4(d) in her representation of complainant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">No exceptions were filed to the hearing court\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law. As indicated, the respondent neither responded to the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action nor appeared or participated in the hearing on that petition. Consistently, she neither filed exceptions to the hearing court\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. The petitioner, in its Petitioner\u2019s Recommendation For Sanctions, expressly declined to take exceptions to the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. Thus, pursuant to Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A), no exceptions having been taken, <em>i.e. </em>filed, we will \u201ctreat the findings of fact as established for the purpose of determining appropriate sanctions, if any.\u201d <em>See e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Wingerter, </em>400 Md. 214, 229 n. 10, 929 A.2d 47, 56 n. 10 (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lawson, </em>401 Md. 536, 572 n. 12, 933 A.2d 842, 864 n. 12 (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Logan, </em>390 Md. 313, 319, 888 A.2d 359, 363 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The petitioner recommends that the respondent be disbarred. The basis for the recommendation is this Court\u2019s rather recent indefinite suspension of the respondent for misconduct quite similar to that with which she was charged and found to have engaged in the instant case\u2014placing an unearned fee in her operating account, spending it for personal purposes before it was earned, failing to communicate with her client, retaining the fee even after the case in which she was retained had been dismissed for lack of prosecution, failing to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiries concerning her client\u2019s complaint. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McCulloch, </em>397 Md. 674, 919 A.2d 660 (2007). The petitioner submits, \u201c[i]t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>is clear that she has learned nothing from the previous complaint,\u201d and concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s violation of Rule 8.4(c) by spending money belonging to her client and her failure to return any portion of an unearned fee is in itself sufficient to warrant her disbarment. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376[, 773 A.2d 463] (2001); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Roberts, </em>394 Md. 137[, 904 A.2d 557] (2006); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Duvall, </em>384 Md. 234[, 863 A.2d 291] (2004) (suspended attorney disbarred when evidence showed she abandoned client and did not return unearned fee); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Tinsky, </em>377 Md. 646[, 835 A.2d 542] (2003) (abandonment of client and failure to return unearned fee warrants disbarment). Moreover, her conduct shows a complete disregard for obligations to her clients, the court, and Bar Counsel. She should be disbarred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The purpose of attorney discipline is the protection of the public, not the punishment of the erring attorney. <em>E.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hill, </em>398 Md. 95, 103, 919 A.2d 1194, 1198 (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Robertson, </em>400 Md. 618, 642, 929 A.2d 576, 590; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Holt, </em>391 Md. 673, 682, 894 A.2d 602, 607 (2006). In determining what sanction will best serve that purpose, we have determined the facts and circumstances of the misconduct to be instructive. <em>E.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Siskind, </em>401 Md. 41, 75, 930 A.2d 328, 347 (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mahone, </em>398 Md. 257, 269, 920 A.2d 458, 465 (2007). Also important are the presence or absence of mitigating factors and the prior disciplinary history of the attorney, <em>see e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Goff, </em>399 Md. 1, 31, 922 A.2d 554, 572 (2007); <em>Wingerter, </em>400 Md. at 224, 929 A.2d at 53, particularly as it reveals the presence or absence of misconduct of the same, or similar, kind to that being addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">In this case, there has been presented no mitigating factors or evidence. There is, however, a disciplinary history that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>evidences rather recent misconduct of the same or similar kind. For that reason, we agree with the petitioner that disbarment is the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST CAROL L.
