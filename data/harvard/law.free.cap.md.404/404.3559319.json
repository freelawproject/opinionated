The husband thereafter filed an Answer and Counterclaim. He raised no jurisdictional objections. Without, however, any advance notification to the wife, and while the Montgomery County action was pending (between the filing of the action for a limited divorce and the filing of the amended complaint for an absolute divorce), the husband, a Muslim and a national of Pakistan, went to the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, D.C., and performed <em>talaq</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>by executing a written document that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>\u201cNow this deed witnesses that I the said Irfan Aleem, do hereby divorce Farah Aleem, daughter of Mahmood Mirza, by pronouncing upon her Divorce/Talaq three times irrevocably and by severing all connections of husband and wife with her forever and for good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">\u201c1.

I Divorce thee Farah Aleem.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Petitioner posits that the performance by him of <em>talaq </em>under Islamic religious and secular Pakistan law, and the existence of a \u201cmarriage contract,\u201d deprived the Circuit Court for Montgomery County of jurisdiction to litigate the division of the parties\u2019 marital property situate in this country.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court found that the marriage contract entered into on the day of the parties\u2019 marriage in Pakistan specifically did not provide for the division of marital property and thus, for that reason alone, the agreement did not prohibit the Circuit Court for Montgomery County from dividing the parties\u2019 marital property under Maryland law. The Court of Special Appeals agreed and stated \u201c[t]hus, the Pakistani marriage contract in the instant matter is not to be equated with a premarital or post-marital agreement that validly relinquished, under Maryland law, rights in marital property.\u201d <em>Aleem v. Aleem, </em>175 Md.App. 663, 681, 931 A.2d 1123, 1134 (2007). The Court of Special Appeals further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">\u201cIf the Pakistani marriage contract is silent, Pakistani law does not recognize marital property. If a premarital or post-marital agreement in Maryland is silent with respect to marital property, those rights are recognized by Maryland law.... In other words, the \u2018default\u2019 under Pakistani law is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>that Wife has no rights to property titled in Husband\u2019s name, while the \u2018default\u2019 under Maryland law is that the wife has marital property rights in property titled in the husband\u2019s name. We hold that this conflict is so substantial that applying Pakistani law in the instant matter would be contrary to Maryland public policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 681, 931 A.2d at 1134.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">Petitioner presents two questions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for our review:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">\u201c1.

The marriage was arranged by the families of the parties. In accordance with Pakistani custom there was a written agreement presented to the wife on the day of the wedding for her to sign. At that time she was 18 years old and her husband was 29 years old. She had just graduated from high school and he was a doctoral candidate at Oxford University in England. The agreement provided as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>\u201cTRUE TRANSLATION <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ALR\">(URDU TO ENGLISH)</p>\n<p id=\"ATB\">FORM NO. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"ASq\">(See Rules : 8 &amp; 10) Under Rules: 8 &amp; 10 of Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (VIII of 1961)</p>\n<p id=\"Adk\">FORM</p>\n<p id=\"AHd\">MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE/ CONTRACT</p>\n<p id=\"AKnK\">1.

During the presentation of the agreement, the wife was advised by her uncle who was acting as a \u201cvakil.\u201d There is no evidence in this case, however, that the wife\u2019s uncle was a lawyer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under Pakistani law, unless the agreement provides otherwise, upon divorce all property owned by the husband on the date of the divorce remains his property and \u201cthe wife has [no] claim thereto.\u201d The opposite is also applicable. The husband has no claim on the property of the wife. In other words, upon the dissolution of the marriage, the property follows the possessor of its title.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Shortly after their marriage, the husband moved to England. The wife joined him later and they resided there for four years while he completed his studies. They then moved to the United States and began to reside in Maryland while the husband worked at the World Bank. They maintained a residence in this State for 20 years and resided here at the time the wife filed for divorce and the husband went to the Pakistan Embassy and performed <em>talaq. </em>The parties have two children, both of whom were born in this country, are United States citizens, and reside in this country. The wife is now a resident of Maryland, and holds a green card status.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The central issue in the present case concerns the wife\u2019s attempt to have the husband\u2019s pension from the World Bank, which relates primarily to his work performed while he was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>resident of this country, declared to be \u201cmarital property\u201d and to have other property declared marital property and thus be entitled to half of that pension and property under Maryland law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">More than a hundred years ago, the Supreme Court of the United States, in an extensive discussion relating to the judgments of foreign countries, discussed the comity due judgments of foreign countries and full faith and credit issues. We include a comprehensive discussion from that opinion, in order to place the issue in historical context. In <em>Hilton v. Guyot, </em>159 U.S. 113, 16 S.Ct. 139, 40 L.Ed. 95 (1895), the Supreme Court of the United States opined, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">\u201cInternational law, in its widest and most comprehensive sense,\u2014including not only questions of right between nations, governed by what has been appropriately called the \u2018law of nations,\u2019 but also questions arising under what is usually called \u2018private international law,\u2019 or the \u2018conflict of laws,\u2019 and concerning the rights of persons within the territory and dominion of one nation, by reason of acts, private or public, done within the dominions of another nation,\u2014is part of our law, and must be ascertained and administered by the courts of justice as often as such questions are presented in litigation between man and man, duly submitted to their determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">\u201cThe most certain guide, no doubt, for the decision of such questions is a treaty or statute of this country. But when, as is the case here, there is no written law upon the subject, the duty still rests upon the judicial tribunals of ascertaining and declaring what the law is, whenever it becomes necessary to do so, in order to determine the rights of parties to suits regularly brought before them. In doing this, the courts must obtain such aid as they can from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>judicial decisions, from the works of jurists and commentators, and from the acts and usages of civilized nations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">\u201cNo law has any effect, of its own force, beyond the limits of the sovereignty from which its authority is derived. The extent to which the law of one nation, as put in force within its territory, whether by executive order, by legislative act, or by judicial decree, shall be allowed to operate within the dominion of another nation, depends upon what our greatest jurists have been content to call \u2018the comity of nations.\u2019 Although the phrase has been often criticized, no satisfactory substitute has been suggested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">\u201c\u2018Comity,\u2019 in the legal sense, is neither a matter of absolute obligation, on the one hand, nor of mere courtesy and good will, upon the other. But it is the recognition which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of another nation, having due regard both to international duty and convenience, and to the rights of its own citizens, <em>or of other persons who are under the protection of its laws.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">\u201cA judgment affecting the status of persons, such as a decree confirming or dissolving a marriage, is recognized as valid in every country, <em>unless contrary to the policy of its own law.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">\u201cThe law upon this subject as understood in the United States at the time of their separation from the mother country was clearly set forth by Chief Justice Parsons, speaking for the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts, in 1813, and by Mr. Justice Story in his Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, published in 1833. Both those eminent jurists declared by the law of England the general rule was that foreign judgments were only prima facie evidence of the matter which they purported to decide; and that by the common law, before the American Revolution, all the courts of the several colonies and states were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>deemed foreign to each other, and consequently judgments rendered by any one of them were considered as foreign judgments, and their merits re-examinable in another colony, not only as to the jurisdiction of the court which pronounced them, but also as to the merits of the controversy, to the extent to which they were understood to be re-examinable in England....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">\u201cIt was because of that condition of the law, as between the American colonies and states, that the United States, at the very beginning of their existence as a nation, ordained that full faith and credit should be given to the judgments of one of the states of the Union in the courts of another of those states.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">\u201cBy the articles of confederation of 1777 (article 4, \u00a7 3), \u2018full faith and credit shall be given, in each of these states, to the records, acts and judicial proceedings of the courts and magistrates of every other state.\u2019 By the constitution of the United States (article 4, \u00a7 1), full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of every other state....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">\u201cThe decisions of this court have clearly recognized that judgments of a foreign [country] are prima facie evidence <em>only, </em>and that, but for these constitutional and legislative provisions, judgments of a state of the Union, when sued upon in another state, would have no greater effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">\u201cChancellor Kent ... [said]: \u2018No sovereign is obliged to execute, within his dominion ... he is at liberty, in his courts of justice, to examine into the merits of such [foreign] judgment [for the effect to be given to foreign judgments is altogether a matter of comity, in cases where it is not regulated by treaty]----\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>\u201cThe reasonable, if not the necessary, conclusion appears to us to be that judgments rendered in France, or in any other foreign country, by the laws of which our own judgments are reviewable upon the merits, are not entitled to full credit and conclusive effect when sued upon in this country, but are prima facie evidence only of the justice of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.\u201d (Brackets in original.) (Citations omitted.) (Some emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\"><em>Hilton, </em>159 U.S. at 123-28, 16 S.Ct. at 143-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">In <em>Andes v. Versant Corp., </em>878 F.2d 147, 149 (4th Cir.1989), that court reiterated the lack of applicability of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Federal constitution to judgments from foreign countries, saying \u201cThe Full Faith and Credit Clause of Article IV \u00a7 1 of the Constitution of the United States does not apply to foreign judgments.\u201d The same federal court of appeals in <em>Jaffe v. Accredited Surety and Casualty Co., Inc., </em>294 F.3d 584 (4th Cir.2002), opined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">\u201cRuth Jaffe\u2019s reliance on this argument seems to arise from her confusion as to what is at issue in her case. With respect to her claim, we must determine the enforceability of the prior Florida judgment refusing to enforce her Canadian default judgment, not the enforceability of the Canadian default judgment itself. Neither the full faith and credit statute, nor the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution, applies to judgments issued from foreign countries. Accordingly, while both federal and state courts in the United States must give \u2018full faith and credit\u2019 to any judgment of a state court empowered to enter the judgment, they need only recognize the judgment of a foreign court to the extent that this recognition comports with the principles of judicial comity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">\u201cFor this reason, a state can refuse as Florida did, to recognize a <em>foreign </em>judgment on the ground that it conflicts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>with the public policy of that state.\u201d (Citations omitted.) (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\"><em>Jaffe, </em>294 F.3d at 591-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">And <em>see, Taveras v. </em>Taveraz,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 477 F.3d 767, 781-83, (6th Cir.2007) (\u201cHowever, it is well-settled that, unlike the recognition and enforcement of judgments due to sister states, a foreign country\u2019s judgments are not subject to the Full Faith and Credit Clause.\u201d (citations omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Much earlier, Maryland had formulated the same concepts in the cases of <em>Owings v. Nicholson, </em>4 H. &amp; J. 66 (1815),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which involved a judgment in the courts of Martinique, and in <em>Gardner v. Lewis, </em>7 Gill 377 (1848), a case involving comity between states, but in which we relied on the law of comity between nations. In <em>Gardner </em>we stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">\u201cThe comity of nations, we are told, (see <em>Story on Conflict of Laws, p. </em>38,) \u2018is derived altogether from the voluntary consent of the latter,\u2019 (the State, within whose territory it is attempted to make the law of another State obligatory,) \u2018and it is inadmissible, when it is contrary to its known policy, or injurious to its interests;\u2019 and it is \u2018only in the silence of any positive rule, affirming, or denying, or restraining the operation of any foreign laws, the Courts of justice presume the tacit adoption of them, by their own government; unless they are repugnant to its policy or prejudicial to its interests.\u2019 This also, he assures us: \u2018A nation will not suffer its own subjects to evade the operation of its fundamental policy, or laws; or to commit fraud in violation of them, by any acts or contracts made with that design, in a foreign country; and it will judge for itself, how far it will adopt, and how far it will reject, any such acts or contracts.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKZ\"><em>Gardner, </em>7 Gill at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">In a case somewhat similar to the case at bar, the situs of property of a wife was in Maryland. Maryland had enacted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>law (pursuant to a constitutional mandate) that provided that the property of a wife in Maryland was not liable for the debts of the husband. The wife and the husband moved to, and became domiciled in, Illinois. That state had no comparable law. An action was brought to attach the wife\u2019s property in Maryland for the debts of the husband on the ground that the law of the parties\u2019 domicile should control. We rejected that contention in <em>Smith v. McAtee, </em>27 Md. 420 (1867), stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">\u201cAnd although we find this right of the wife to her property, protected in this State, by public policy, by statute and by decree of a Court of Equity, yet it was earnestly contended by the learned counsel for the appellee, that a creditor of the husband had a right to attach this fund in our courts of justice for the debt of the husband, as by the laws of Illinois, where the husband and a wife resided, the husband was entitled to all the personal property of the wife, and that by virtue of this law of the domicil the fund was vested in the husband. And he claimed this right to divest the wife of her property by the law of the domicil, on the ground of comity. In this case we cannot sanction such a right, for it has been decided that comity is overruled by positive law, and that it is only in the silence of any particular rule, affirming, denying or restraining the operation of foreign laws, that courts of justice presume a tacit adoption of them by their own government. It is certainly competent for any State to adopt laws to protect its own property as well as to regulate it, and \u2018no State will suffer the laws of another to interfere with her own, and in the conflict of laws, when it must often be a matter of doubt, which shall prevail, the court which decides, will prefer the laws of its own country to that of the stranger.\u2019... If therefore our legislative enactment in regard to the property of the wife and the laws of Illinois conflict, it cannot be made a question in our own courts which shall prevail. \u2018Where there is no constitutional barri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>er, we are bound to observe and enforce the statutory provisions of our own State.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\"><em>Smith, </em>27 Md. 420, 437-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Shortly after the decision in <em>Hilton v. Guyot, supra, </em>we conformed to its principles in a case where the issue was whether the laws of Delaware or Maryland would control in respect to certain personal property. Albeit in reference to comity between states, we discussed it in <em>Lowndes v. Cooch, </em>87 Md. 478, 39 A. 1045 (1898), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">\u201cThe leading inquiry, therefore, which this appeal presents is, does the law of Delaware or the law of Maryland control the disposition of the bank stock in controversy here? ... \u2018It [personal property] follows the law of the person. If he dies, it is not the law of the country in which the property is, but the law of the country of which he was a subject, that will regulate the succession'.\u2019 ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\"><em>\u201cThis doctrine, however firmly established, is nevertheless subject to proper limitation to the effect that if a foreign law directly violates some recognized principle of public policy, or some established standard of morality prevailing in the forum exercising jurisdiction, the rules of comity will not compel such forum to enforce the foreign law rather than its own, if to do so would be hurtful or detrimental to the interest and welfare of its own citizens.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-9\"><em>Lowndes, </em>87 Md. at 485-87, 39 A. at 1046. We continued to recognize that emphasized doctrine in our cases (albeit sometimes in respect to comity issues between the various states of the United States instead of between Maryland and foreign countries. The doctrine, however, is the same in both instances). <em>See Castleman v. Templeman, </em>87 Md. 546, 552, 40 A. 275, 277 (1898) (\u201c[W]e can see no reason why the receiver should not be permitted to sue here ... but through comity ... when such suit does not injuriously affect the interests of the citizens of the latter, or violate its policy or laws.\u201d); <em>Northern Aluminum Co. v. Law, </em>157 Md. 641, 646, 147 A. 715, 717 (1929) (\u201cAs to judgments of courts of foreign countries, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>is no constitutional requirement of recognition.

Matusevitch, </em>347 Md. 561, 702 A.2d 230 (1997) (a \u201ccertified question\u201d case), is perhaps the most modern and seminal of our cases on comity between Maryland and foreign countries. It did not involve issues of marital property or other domestic law issues, but involved primarily the law of defamation and the constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Telnikoff, </em>however, did restate with clarity the issues that relate to comity and their application generally. As stated above, the case involved the difference between the laws of libel of England and of Maryland. An English citizen had obtained a judgment in the courts of England based upon a libel occurring in England. He sought to have the judgment enforced in this country and Matusevitch brought an action to preclude the enforcement. We stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">\u201cTelnikoff argues that the English libel judgment is entitled to recognition under principles of \u2018comity.\u2019 Matusevitch, on the other hand, asserts that the English judgment is repugnant to the public policy of the United States and Maryland and, therefore, should be denied recognition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">\u201cThe recognition of foreign judgments is governed by principles of comity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">\u201c( ... \u2018Although more than mere courtesy and accommodation, comity does not achieve the force of an imperative or obligation. Rather, it is a nation\u2019s expression of understanding which demonstrates due regard both to the international duty and convenience and to the rights of persons protected by its own laws\u2019)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">\u201cAlthough foreign judgments are entitled to a degree of deference and respect under the doctrine of comity, courts will nonetheless deny recognition and enforcement to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>foreign judgments which are inconsistent with the public policies of the forum state----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">\u201cThe justification for the public policy exception to the recognition of foreign judgments as articulated by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <em>Laker Airways v.

When the foreign act is inherently inconsistent with the policies underlying comity, domestic recognition could tend either to legitimize the aberration or to encourage retaliation, undercutting the realization of the goals served by comity. No nation is under an unremitting obligation to enforce foreign interests which are fundamentally prejudicial to those of the domestic forum. Thus, from the earliest times, authorities have recognized that the obligation of comity expires when the strong public policies of the forum are vitiated by the foreign act.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">\u201cIn determining non-constitutional principles of law, courts often rely upon the policies and requirements reflected in constitutional provisions....

Wolff, </em>40 Md.App. 168, 389 A.2d 413 (1978), noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-11\">\u201c \u2018The full faith and credit clause ... does not apply to a divorce obtained in a foreign country. Courts of the United States are not required by federal law to give full force and effect to a judgment granted in a foreign nation.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>principle of comity, however, has several important exceptions and qualifications. A decree of divorce will not be recognized by comity where it was obtained by a procedure which denies due process of law in the real sense of the term, or was obtained by fraud, or where the divorce offends the public policy of the state in which recognition is sought....\u2019\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><em>Wolff, </em>40 Md.App. at 177-78, 389 A.2d at 418.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The Maryland Legislature declared Maryland\u2019s public policy in regard to property acquired during a marriage, stating in the preamble to Chapter 794 of the Acts of 1978, that \u201cthe property interests of the spouses should be adjusted fairly and equitably.\u201d And furthermore, from the record in the present case, it appears that under Islamic law, which, albeit with certain modifications, has been adopted as the law in Pakistan, only the husband has an independent right to <em>talaq, i.e., </em>to use <em>talaq </em>to divorce his wife.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The wife may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>only utilize <em>talaq </em>if the husband has given her that right in the contract of marriage. In the case at bar, the wife was not granted the right of <em>talaq </em>by her husband. It appears, also from the record, that the husband may utilize <em>talaq </em>with no prior notice to the wife. It is clear as well, as we point out above, that, under Pakistani law, upon a divorce there is no equitable division of marital property, i.e., property acquired by the parties during the marriage, unless the marriage \u201ccontract\u201d so provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">On November 7, 1972, the people of Maryland ratified the Equal Rights Amendment, now found as Article 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. It provides \u201cEquality of rights under the law shall not be abridged or denied because of sex.\u201d Md. Const. Declaration of Rights, art. 46. Accordingly, in the first instance, the enforceability of a foreign <em>talaq </em>divorce provision, such as that presented here, in the courts of Maryland, where only the male, i.e., husband, has an independent right to utilize <em>talaq </em>and the wife may utilize it only with the husband\u2019s permission, is contrary to Maryland\u2019s constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>tional provisions<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and thus is contrary to the \u201cpublic policy\u201d of Maryland. Moreover, if we were to recognize the use of <em>talaq, </em>controlled as it is by the husband, a wife, a resident of this State, would never be able to consummate a divorce action filed by her in which she seeks a division of marital property, because a husband who is a citizen of any country in which Islamic law, <em>adopted as the civil law, </em>prevails could go to the embassy of that country and perform <em>talaq, </em>and divorce her (without prior notice to her) long before she would have any opportunity to fully litigate, under Maryland law, the circumstances of the parties\u2019 dissolution of their marriage.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><em>Talaq </em>lacks any significant \u201cdue process\u201d for the wife, and its use moreover, directly deprives the wife of the \u201cdue process\u201d she is entitled to when she initiates divorce litigation in this State. The lack and deprivation of due process is itself contrary to this State\u2019s public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Petitioner directs the Court\u2019s attention to the practice in Pakistan of having a Council of Arbitration<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> available to the wife. That practice, however, only applies if the parties want to reconcile and it addresses only that possibility. In a situation where both parties seek divorce, as here, it has virtually no application. Its function was explained at the trial level by a letter from Muhammad Najeeb, Chairman of the Arbitration Council in the Clifton Cantonment, Karachi, Pakistan, to the attorney for the wife, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>\u201cPlease refer to your letter dated 15th Dec., 2003, on behalf of your client[ ] M st. Farah Aleem, I may inform you that the marriage was solemnized in Pakistan within the jurisdiction of this Union Council and that both your client and Mr. Aleem are Pakistani citizens and therefore this Union Council has jurisdiction in the matter. We had sent notices to your client as provided under Section 7 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961. The purpose of notices is to ascertain whether both parties want to reconcile in which case the divorce shal[l] not become final. In case both parties or any one of them does not want reconciliation, the divorce shall become final after 90 days of such notice.... Mr. Aleem had responded in writing that he does not want to reconcile but there is no intimation from your client [in][ ]spite of the fact that your client has received the notice which will be presumed that she does not want any reconciliation. <em>It may also be mentioned that junction of the Arbitration Council is only to see whether both husband and wife want to reconcile and live again as husband and wife.\u201d </em>(Bolding added.) (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Additionally, as indicated above, Maryland has enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme designed to effectuate a fair division of property acquired by the parties during the time of their marriage, just as the pension at issue in this case was acquired.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To accept <em>talaq </em>and to accept the silence of the \u201ccontract\u201d signed by the wife on the day of her marriage in Pakistan, as a waiver of her rights to marital property acquired during the marriage, is, in direct conflict with our public policy. Additionally, the Pakistani statutes proffered by petitioner as establishing that all of the property titled in his name, however and whenever acquired, is his property free of any claim by the wife arising out of the marriage, are also in direct conflict with the Maryland statutes<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> governing those same issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Judge Rodowsky, for the Court of Special Appeals, stated, as indicated earlier:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-4\">\u201cIf the Pakistani marriage contract is silent,[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>] Pakistani law does not recognize marital property. If a premarital or post-marital agreement in Maryland is silent with respect to marital property, those rights are recognized by Maryland law.... In other words, the \u2018default\u2019 under Pakistani law is that Wife has no rights to property titled in Husband\u2019s name, while the \u2018default\u2019 under Maryland law is that the wife has marital property rights in property titled in the husband\u2019s name. We hold that this conflict is so substantial that applying Pakistani law in the instant matter would be contrary to Maryland public policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><em>Aleem, </em>175 Md.App. at 681, 931 A.2d at 1134. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The <em>talaq </em>divorce of countries applying Islamic law, unless substantially modified, is contrary to the public policy of this state and we decline to give <em>talaq, </em>as it is presented in this case, any comity. The Pakistani statutes providing that property owned by the parties to a marriage, follows title upon the dissolution of the marriage unless there are agreements otherwise, conflicts with the laws of this State where, in the absence of valid agreements otherwise or in the absence of waiver, marital property is subject to fair and equitable division. Thus the Pakistani statutes are wholly in conflict with the public policy of this State as expressed in our statutes and we shall afford no comity to those Pakistani statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Additionally, a procedure that permits a man (and him only unless he agrees otherwise) to evade a divorce action begun in this State by rushing to the embassy of a country recognizing <em>talaq </em>and, without prior notice to the wife, perform \u201cI divorce thee ...\u201d three times and thus summarily terminate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>marriage and deprive his wife of marital property, confers insufficient due process to his wife. Accordingly, for this additional reason the courts of Maryland shall not recognize the <em>talaq </em>divorce performed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">We answer no to each of petitioner\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-10\">. Apparently, under Islamic law, where that Islamic law has been adopted as the secular law of a jurisdiction, such as Pakistan, a husband has a virtual automatic right to <em>talaq, </em>(i.e., to divorce his wife by acknowledging \"I divorce thee\u201d three times) but the wife only has a right to <em>talaq </em>if it is in the written marriage agreement or if he otherwise delegates that right to her. In the present case the husband did not grant the wife the right to <em>talaq. </em>While the nature of <em>talaq </em>is relevant to the issues here presented, the wife does not claim that the husband \"granted\u201d her that right and accordingly that is not a factual issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">Our holding in this case only relates to instances where Islamic law, or parts thereof such as <em>talaq, </em>is also the secular (civil) law of a country whose judgments we are urged to accept under the doctrine of comity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>In other words, we address Islamic law only to the extent it is also the civil law of a country.

The \"marital property\u201d as it would be defined under Maryland law included the husband\u2019s pension from World Bank valued at approximately one million dollars, real property valued at $850,000, personal property valued at approximately $80,000, and two or more vehicles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b436-11\">.

While the dower was deferred at the time of the contract, it appears that when Irfan Aleem attempted to divorce Farah Aleem, that a sum of $2,500 was mentioned as a \"full and final\u201d settlement. Under Islamic law as it is in the civil law of Pakistan, a man, upon marriage, can defer the payment of the \"dower\u201d <em>(mahr </em>in Urdu) but he cannot divorce the wife by <em>talaq </em>unless he then pays the <em>mahr </em>to the wife.

It is the husband\u2019s position that payment of <em>mdhr </em>of $2,500 is all that is due the wife, as opposed to the one half of almost two million dollars that she might be entitled to under Maryland law (It is unclear how the <em>mdhr </em>would affect the position of the Pakistani courts in respect to properties titled in both names. The primary property focus in the present case is the petitioner\u2019s pension\u2014which is titled only in the husband's name.).
