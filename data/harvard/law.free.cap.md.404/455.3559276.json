Did the trial Court err by admitting evidence that Respondent previously had committed a similar \u201cother crime\u201d on the same alleged victim and had been convicted for it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>2. Did the trial Court err by overruling Respondent\u2019s objection to its jury instruction that Respondent\u2019s guilty plea to the prior sexual offense could be used to prove his intent to commit rape and child abuse in the instant case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">3. Did the trial Court err by overruling Respondent\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the jury should believe the complainant because Detective Pyles had believed her?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">We shall hold that the prior conviction for a third degree sexual offense is not admissible for purposes of impeachment. Because the issue of the admission of the other acts evidence may arise on retrial, we will address it for guidance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Respondent, Christopher Overbee Westpoint, was indicted for various sexual offenses that allegedly occurred on March 7th, 8th, 11th and 16th, 2005.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The victim of the alleged sexual offenses was Westpoint\u2019s twelve-year-old daughter. The charges relating to occurrences on March 7th and 8th were third degree sexual offenses in violation of Section 3-307 of the Criminal Law Article, Maryland Code (2002),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> fourth degree sexual offenses in violation of Section 3-308, and second degree assaults in violation of Section 3-203. The offenses charged related to the incident on March 11th were a third degree sexual offense, a fourth degree sexual offense, a second degree assault and sexual abuse of a minor in violation of Section 3-602. The charges related to the incident on March 16th were second degree rape in violation of Section 3-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>304, sexual abuse of a minor, a third degree sexual offense, a fourth degree sexual offense and a second degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Prior to trial, the State filed a motion <em>in limine </em>in support of the admission of other crimes, wrongs or acts evidence pursuant to Rule 5-404(b), specifically that Westpoint had committed a similar third degree sexual offense against his daughter in November of 2001, to which he pled guilty;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the State proffered to the trial judge that it had a certified copy of the conviction. The motion was argued on the first day of the jury trial; Westpoint asserted that the other acts evidence should not be admitted because the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by its extreme and unfair prejudice. The judge reserved his decision, and after opening statements, ruled that the other crimes, wrongs or acts evidence was admissible, substantively, to prove Westpoint\u2019s intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">[THE COURT]: Okay. The State is seeking to use evidence of a prior conviction\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">[STATE]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">[THE COURT]:\u2014of the Defendant for having committed a third degree sexual offense on the same complaining witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">[STATE]: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">[THE COURT]: That earlier conviction was in 2001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqk\">[STATE]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-11\">[THE COURT]: And, normally, the evidence of other crimes cannot be used, but there is an exception, and that exception is expounded upon in the case of <em>Antonio Donnell Oesby, O-E-S-B-Y, v. State of Maryland, </em>decided January 4th, 2002, Court of Special Appeals, Moylan, found at 142 Maryland Appeals, Page 144[, 788 A.2d 662]. And it lists that there first must be a determination, a legal determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>tion by the court that the evidence qualifies for admission having fallen within one of the exceptions that are recognized as having relevance to the case at bar, and one of those exceptions is intent. Here you have intent, which is an element, and you have a prior act by the same defendant on the same individual child, so there is the intent exception as it\u2019s determined by the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">A second step in the process has to do with whether or not the evidence of the prior bad act or prior conviction is clear and convincing, and the Court finds that the evidence is more than clear and convincing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">[COUNSEL FOR WESTPOINT]: Based on what, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">[THE COURT]: Based upon the fact that he entered a plea of guilt to having committed the third degree sexual offense even though that plea of guilt was in an effort to avoid a more serious charge of second degree rape on that same child. I believe that must have been the earlier more serious count in entering a plea of guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">And the third step is the question, whether or not the probative value of the other crimes evidence outweighs its unfairly prejudicial effect. The Court believes that the other crimes evidence would outweigh the unduly prejudicial effect that it would have in this case, so I\u2019ll permit it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">At trial, Westpoint\u2019s daughter, the alleged victim, took the witness stand and testified about the incidents on March 7th and 16th, but she could not remember what, if anything, occurred on March 8th or 11th, 2005. In regard to the March 16th event, she testified regarding various of her father\u2019s actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-10\">[WESTPOINT\u2019S DAUGHTER]: My father came downstairs and tapped me on my hip with his foot, and that\u2019s when I had got off. And we went upstairs and we started playing chase. We went upstairs in my room and then he laid me on my bed and he got on top of me. That\u2019s when he pulled my pants down and got on his knee off the bed and put his finger in his mouth and put his finger on my vagina, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>and that\u2019s when he got back on top of me and he tried to force his self in me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">Then I was over there and saying, ow. And that\u2019s when my father said, did that hurt. And he turned me on my stomach and got on me and started humping me on my stomach while I was laying on my stomach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">[STATE]: Now let\u2019s go back for a second. You say your father tried to put\u2014now, were his pants on or off when he did this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">[WESTPOINT\u2019S DAUGHTER]: His pants were on. He had on shorts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">[STATE]: What were you wearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">[WESTPOINT\u2019S DAUGHTER]: I was wearing\u2014still in my pajamas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\">[STATE]: Okay. And how did you say your father put his finger in your vagina? Were you pants on? Were your pants off?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-11\">[WESTPOINT\u2019S DAUGHTER]: No. He pulled them down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-12\">[STATE]: Okay. And you said he put his finger inside your vagina?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-13\">[WESTPOINT\u2019S DAUGHTER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-14\">[STATE]: Okay. What did he do after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-15\">[WESTPOINT\u2019S DAUGHTER]: He got back on top of me and he tried to put his penis inside of me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-16\">[STATE]: Were his pants on or off at this point? [WESTPOINT\u2019S DAUGHTER]: They were on, but it was like how the boxers are made with a little hole that comes apart.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-17\">[STATE]: Okay. So you said he tried to put his penis inside?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-18\">[WESTPOINT\u2019S DAUGHTER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-19\">[STATE]: Did he put it in there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-20\">[WESTPOINT\u2019S DAUGHTER]: A little, but not with any real penetration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-21\">[STATE]: I\u2019m sorry. What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>[WESTPOINT\u2019S DAUGHTER]: Not as far as like where I lost my virginity. It wasn\u2019t all the way in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\">[STATE]: But it was a little bit in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">[WESTPOINT\u2019S DAUGHTER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">[STATE]: You said ow?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">[WESTPOINT\u2019S DAUGHTER]: Yes, a little. He look at me and said, did that hurt. And I said, yes, and then he turned me on my stomach and he was on my back and he was humping me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">[STATE]: [Westpoint\u2019s daughter], what do you mean by humping?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">[WESTPOINT\u2019S DAUGHTER]: He had his penis on my vagina moving up and down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">The State thereafter questioned the daughter regarding what had occurred in 2001:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\">[STATE]: Okay. Now, [Westpoint\u2019s daughter], I\u2019m going to ask you about an incident that occurred back in October of 2001, October, November, 2001? Do you remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUW\">[WESTPOINT\u2019S DAUGHTER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-12\">And my mom told me to go with my aunt. And I had went down to the apartment to get some clothes and my dad had just came home from work and we were in the back room. I was getting clothes and stuff. And that\u2019s when we were watching t.v. for a minute and talking and stuff and that\u2019s when we had laid down in the bed and I was\u2014he laid me on my stomach and got on top of me and started moving up and down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-13\">My pants and panties were down and his boxers\u2014well, not boxers, but his shorts and stuff, and his penis was rubbing against me and he had hurt me. So after that, I had left and I ran upstairs and told my aunt and everything and that\u2019s when she called\u2014that\u2019s when she first called the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>[STATE]: [Westpoint\u2019s daughter], now when you say that his penis was rubbing up against you, what part of your body was his penis rubbing on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">[WESTPOINT\u2019S DAUGHTER]: Like around my behind and my vagina.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">[STATE]: And, [Westpoint\u2019s daughter], that time, how did your pants and panties get off?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">[WESTPOINT\u2019S DAUGHTER]: He pulled them down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">The next day, after a motion for judgment of acquittal was granted regarding the counts involving March 8th and 11th, Westpoint testified. On cross-examination, the State sought to impeach Westpoint with his 2002 prior conviction for third degree sexual offense arising from the 2001 incident, arguing that the conviction was admissible under Rule 5-609 because it was for a crime relevant to credibility. Westpoint objected. The judge ruled that the prior conviction evidence was admissible for impeachment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\">[STATE]: Now, you said that on direct examination once you were confronted your thought was, I\u2019m, not going through this again, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-10\">[WESTPOINT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\">[STATE]: That\u2019s because you\u2019ve been through this before, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-12\">[WESTPOINT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-13\">[STATE]: In fact, you went and did this before in November of 2001?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-14\">[COUNSEL FOR WESTPOINT]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-15\">[THE COURT]: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-16\">[WESTPOINT]: Yes, I have, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-17\">[STATE]: Okay. And that was the incident [Westpoint\u2019s daughter] was testifying about yesterday when she spoke about what happened in 2001?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-18\">[COUNSEL FOR WESTPOINT]: Objection continuing, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-19\">[THE COURT]: Yes. Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>[STATE]: Those were the incidents that [Westpoint\u2019s daughter] was talking about in 2001?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">[WESTPOINT]: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">[STATE]: And those were the incidents where she claimed that you touched her and that you fondled her and, according to [Westpoint\u2019s daughter], that you humped her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aya\">[WESTPOINT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">[STATE]: In fact, Mr. Westpoint, the truth is that you were convicted of having done those things to [Westpoint\u2019s daughter] before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">[COUNSEL FOR WESTPOINT]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">[THE COURT]: Yes. Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">[STATE]: So this is not the first time that this has come up, isn\u2019t that correct, Mr. Westpoint?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-11\">[COUNSEL FOR WESTPOINT]: Continuing objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADON\">[THE COURT]: Overruled. You can answer it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3u\">[WESTPOINT]: Would you repeat the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-12\">[STATE]: You went to court in 2001 for these same types of events, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-13\">[WESTPOINT]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-14\">[COUNSEL FOR WESTPOINT]: Objection, Your Honor, to that particular question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-15\">[THE COURT]: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-16\">[STATE]: In fact, you pled guilty to having touched [West-point\u2019s daughter]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-17\">[COUNSEL FOR WESTPOINT]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKS\">[WESTPOINT]: I took an Alford plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-18\">[THE COURT]: Approach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-19\">[STATE]: The fact is, sir, you were convicted, were you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-20\">[COUNSEL FOR WESTPOINT]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4D\">[WESTPOINT]: I don\u2019t want to say I was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-21\">[THE COURT]: That\u2019s sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-22\">[COUNSEL FOR WESTPOINT]: Your Honor, may we approach, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>[THE COURT]: Yeah. Come up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\">If you\u2019re going to use a conviction there is a way that you have to go about using a conviction. You can\u2019t just say convicted either. That doesn\u2019t mean anything. You know, convicted of what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">[COUNSEL FOR WESTPOINT]: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to ask for a mistrial. Your Honor, counsel knows the proper way to attempt to use this and the fact that it\u2019s come out at this juncture, the way it\u2019s come out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">[THE COURT]: 2001 is Number 1, that\u2019s within. But the point is, you can\u2019t just say convicted. What was he convicted of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">[STATE]: Third degree sex offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">[THE COURT]: All right. Now, I have to determine whether or not the conviction was a crime of moral turpitude or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">[STATE]: She\u2019s already testified to the fact -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">[THE COURT]: \u2014or to his character. She didn\u2019t testify as to his conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-12\">[STATE]: She testified as to the facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-13\">[THE COURT]: Well, she may have, but the point is she didn\u2019t testify as to conviction. You\u2019re trying to impeach him apparently by prior conviction at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-14\">[STATE]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-15\">[THE COURT]: And I have to make an initial determination before that is allowed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-16\">[COUNSEL FOR WESTPOINT]: And that wasn\u2019t done, Your Honor. And because it wasn\u2019t done the way it should have been done, the way it has come out in front of the jury at this juncture, I\u2019m going to ask that the Court declare a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-17\">[THE COURT]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-18\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-19\">[COUNSEL FOR WESTPOINT]: 609, is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-20\">[THE COURT]: Infamous crime or other crime relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility. I\u2019m going to rule that it is a crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>that is relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility and the probative value outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice. So you may continue to ask him, but you have to be specific.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\">[STATE]: Okay. I have no problem with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">[THE COURT]: My wife is about to be convicted of speeding. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">[STATE]: I understand that, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">[COURT]: The motion for mistrial is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">The State then resumed cross-examining Westpoint, who admitted that, in 2002, he had been convicted of a third degree sexual offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">[STATE]: Okay. Mr. Westpoint, the fact is that in 2001\u2014 sorry, in 2002 actually, that you pled guilty to third degree sex offense, isn\u2019t that correct, in front of Judge Spellbring?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">[WESTPOINT]: I took a plea, an Alford plea for third degree sex offense saying that I plead guilty, but I\u2019m not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-11\">[STATE]: But the fact is that you did enter a plea which resulted in a guilty finding; isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-12\">[WESTPOINT]: Not for a guilty finding because I got tired of fighting it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-13\">[STATE]: Sir, you are aware that an Alford plea results in a conviction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-14\">[WESTPOINT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-15\">[STATE]: So the fact is that you have been convicted of third degree sex offense involving [Westpoint\u2019s daughter]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-16\">[WESTPOINT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-17\">[STATE]: So that\u2019s what you meant when you said, I\u2019m not going through this again, because you had previously been convicted in 2002\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-18\">[WESTPOINT]: No. I\u2019ve previously been\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-19\">[COUNSEL FOR WESTPOINT]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-20\">[THE COURT]: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>[STATE]: The fact is you\u2019ve been previously convicted in 2002 of having inappropriate contact with [Westpoint\u2019s daughter], the third degree sex offense; isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aek\">[WESTPOINT]: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">[STATE]: Now, you said that [Westpoint\u2019s daughter] was having problems with the discipline you were imposing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyS\">[WESTPOINT]: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">[STATE]: But isn\u2019t it possible that [Westpoint\u2019s daughter] didn\u2019t want to have any kind of relationship with you because of the contact that happened in 2001?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxF\">[WESTPOINT]: No, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">[STATE]: She was okay with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">[WESTPOINT]: She was okay with what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-9\">[STATE]: She was okay with what you were doing, what happened in 2001, everything was fine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-10\">[COUNSEL FOR WESTPOINT]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-q\">[THE COURT]: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-11\">[WESTPOINT]: Nothing happened in 2001.

[STATE]: I apologize, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-19\">But the fact is, sir, that case involved the contact [West-point\u2019s daughter] was talking about yesterday, the humping, the digital penetration. The sexual contact that [West-point\u2019s daughter] talked about yesterday, that\u2019s what that case was about, wasn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>[WESTPOINT]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">[STATE]: Oh, really.

The State also contends that the trial judge properly exercised his discretion in admitting, for substantive purposes, other crimes, wrongs or acts evidence under Rule 5-404(b) because the evidence was relevant to Westpoint\u2019s identity and intent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Conversely, Westpoint contends that his prior conviction for third degree sexual offense was not admissible for purposes of impeachment because it was not relevant to credibility, and, if relevant, should not be admitted because its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. Westpoint, in his conditional cross-petition, also argues that the trial judge erred in admitting, as substantive evidence, other acts evidence related to the crime for which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">The crux of the instant case involves the interplay, if any, between Rule 5-404(b) other crimes, wrongs or acts evidence and evidence of a prior conviction under Rule 5-609.

State, </em>311 Md. 348, 535 A.2d 445 (1988), we provided a historical review of impeachment by prior conviction in Maryland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">The General Assembly first spoke on this topic in Chapter 109 of the Acts of 1864. This statute has retained its original substance for well over 100- years and is now embodied in Maryland Code (1974, 1984 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-905 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Section 10-905, in pertinent part, provides that \u201c[e]vidence is admissible to prove the ... fact of [a witness\u2019s] conviction of an infamous crime.\u201d The legislative intent behind this statute is fairly clear. At common law, and prior to the time Maryland\u2019s impeachment statute was enacted, an individual convicted of an infamous crime was disqualified from testifying. When the General Assembly enacted Chapter 109 in 1864 it intended to remove this common law disqualification. However, rather than allow these witnesses to testify free from the taint of their prior infamous convictions, the legislature chose to make these convictions admissible for impeachment purposes. Thus, a witness convicted of an infamous crime was no longer disqualified from testifying, but his testimony was subject to impeachment by his infamous conviction. In short, \u00a7 10-905\u2019s legislative history suggests that the convictions admissible for impeachment purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>under the statute are those that were infamous, and thereby rendered a person incompetent to testify, at common law. In <em>Garitee v. Bond [, </em>102 Md. 379, 62 A. 631 (1905)], this Court set forth the crimes that the common law regarded as infamous: <em>\u201ctreason, felony, perjury, forgery </em>and those other offenses, classified generally as <em>crimen falsi.\u201d </em>Several commentators are in agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">Clearly then, the legislative purpose behind Maryland\u2019s impeachment statute requires that the crimes admissible <em>per se </em>under \u00a7 10-905 be limited to those crimes within the common law definition of \u201cinfamous.\u201d These crimes are the felonies and the <em>crimen falsi.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">&gt;:&lt; * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">The first significant Maryland case to discuss the topic was <em>Nelson v. Seiler[, </em>154 Md. 63, 139 A. 564 (1927)]. In <em>Nelson, </em>the question was whether a defendant in a civil suit arising out of an automobile accident could be impeached with his prior convictions for violations of the motor vehicle law. The appellant argued that \u201conly convictions for crimes involving moral turpitude reflect upon a witness\u2019 worthiness of belief, and evidence of lesser crimes is irrelevant.\u201d The appellant further argued that, even if the convictions admissible for impeachment purposes were not limited to those involving moral turpitude, the court must make some distinction between lesser crimes relevant to credibility and those irrelevant to credibility. This Court agreed, and made the following statement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">It is not required that the evidence (of violations to impeach a witness) be restricted to infamous crimes <em>or those involving moral turpitude </em>on the one hand, but, on the other, the purpose of the admission, to impeach credibility, must impose some limits; the convictions should be of infringements of the law that may have some tendency to impeach credibility, and not all infringements do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">This statement has been repeated countless times by Maryland appellate courts responding to the question of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>a particular crime was admissible for impeachment purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">$ $ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">While we believe it is difficult to draw distinct lines on what crimes may be used to impeach, we think the law of this state may be generally summarized as holding that to be admissible for impeachment purposes a conviction must be either a felony at common law or a <em>crimen falsi </em>and thus infamous, or a lesser crime bearing upon the witness\u2019s credibility. Stated another way, crimes; other than those that are infamous, whether misdemeanors or statutory felonies, fall into the class of lesser crimes and may or may not reflect on one\u2019s tendency to be truthful____ If the crime being offered to impeach says nothing about the likelihood of the witness\u2019s propensity to be truthful under oath, it is irrelevant on that issue and should not be admitted. If the prior conviction passes this relevancy test, then the trial court must determine if its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect. In other words, because evidence is legally admissible does not necessarily require its admission. Only if the trial judge, in the exercise of his discretion, feels that the prior conviction rationally carries probative value on the issue of truth and veracity of the -witness, should the evidence be admitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-9\"><em>Prout, </em>311 Md. at 358-63, 535 A.2d at 450-52 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">The same day we decided <em>Prout, </em>we noted in <em>Wicks v.

Giddens, </em>335 Md. 205, 213, 642 A.2d 870, 875 (1994), that Rule 1-502 \u201cessentially creates a three-part test for determining whether prior convictions may be admitted for impeachment purposes\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-12\">First, subsection (a) sets forth the \u201celigible universe\u201d for what convictions may be used to impeach a witness\u2019s credibility. This universe consists of two categories: (1) \u201cinfamous crimes\u201d and (2) \u201cother crimes relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d Infamous crimes include treason, common law felonies, and other offenses classified generally as <em>crimen falsi. </em>If a crime does not fall within one of the two categories, then it is inadmissible and the analysis ends. This threshold question of whether or not a crime bears upon credibility is a matter of law. If the crime falls within one of the two categories in the eligible universe, then the second step is for the proponent to establish that the conviction was not more than 15 years old, that it was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>reversed on appeal, and that it was not the subject of a pardon or a pending appeal. Finally, in order to admit a prior conviction for impeachment purposes, the trial court must determine that the probative value of the prior conviction outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the witness or objecting party. This third step is clearly a matter of trial court discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 213-14, 642 A.2d at 874 (citations omitted) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Rule 1-502 was rescinded effective July 1, 1994, and in its stead, Rule 5-609, which was \u201cnearly identical to former Rule 1-502,\u201d was adopted. <em>State v.

Second, if the crime falls within one of these two categories, the proponent must establish that the conviction is less than fifteen years old. Md. Rule 5-609(b). Finally, the trial court must weigh the probative value of the impeaching evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. Md. Rule 5-609(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">With respect to impeachment, we have said that impeachment with a prior conviction can be used \u201cto assist the fact finder in measuring the credibility of the defendant,\u201d <em>Ricketts v. State, </em>291 Md. 701, 703, 436 A.2d 906, 907 (1981), at the same time preventing \u201ca jury from convicting a defendant based on his past criminal record, or because the jury thinks the defendant is a bad person.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>340 Md. at 715, 668 A.2d at 13. We have, as a result, imposed limitations on the use of past convictions \u201cin an effort to discriminate between the informative use of past convictions to test credibility, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>the pretextual use of past convictions where the convictions are not probative of credibility but instead merely create a negative impression of the defendant,\u201d because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">\u201cThe danger in admitting prior convictions as evidence to impeach the defendant stems from the risk of prejudice. The jury may improperly infer that the defendant has a history of criminal activity and therefore is not entitled to a favorable verdict. Such evidence may detract from careful attention to the facts, despite instructions from the Court, influencing the jury to conclude that if the defendant is wrongfully found guilty no real harm is done. Where the crime for which the defendant is on trial is identical or similar to the crime for which he has been previously convicted the danger is greater, as the jury may conclude that because he did it before he most likely has done it again. The net effect of such evidence is often to discourage the defendant from taking the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">Thus, the role of the trial judge takes on added importance. It becomes his function to admit only those prior convictions which will assist the jury in assessing the credibility of the defendant. The trial judge must weigh the probative value of the convictions against the prejudice to the defendant in asserting his defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 715-16, 668 A.2d at 13, quoting <em>Ricketts v. State, </em>291 Md. 701, 703-04, 436 A.2d 906, 907-08 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">We have had occasion to address whether certain convictions are relevant to credibility such that they may be admissible as impeachment. <em>Ricketts, </em>291 Md. at 701, 436 A.2d at 906, involved a defendant on trial for second degree rape, second degree sexual offense and burglary, who took the stand to testify; on cross-examination, the State sought to impeach him with evidence that he had been previously convicted of indecent exposure. Addressing whether the prior conviction could be used for impeachment, we noted that the critical issue was whether the crime of indecent exposure had \u201c \u2018some tendency to show that the person charged is not to be believed under oath\u2019 \u201d; \u201c \u2018In other words, is the witness devoid of moral perception, such a person as would regard lightly the obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>gations of an oath to tell the truth\u2019?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707, 436 A.2d at 909-10. We stated that for a conviction to affect veracity, the crime itself, by its elements, must clearly identify the prior conduct of the witness that tends to show that he is unworthy of belief; indecent exposure, we concluded, did not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">The point we stress is that an indecent exposure conviction, without more, says little about the conduct for which the person was convicted. Because the offense requires only a general intent, the gamut of offenses and circumstances that fall within the ambit of the crime are so widely varied that, while one person may indeed have shown a moral depravity sufficient to impact upon his credibility, another may have committed a very minor infraction indicative of nothing more than momentary poor judgment perhaps dictated by necessity. The intent required for the crime does not require the accused to have performed a flagrant act damnable as an affront to decency and social norms but encompasses acts committed where the accused was unaware that his or her lack of apparel would be noticed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">It is this vagueness or uncertainty in the nature of the offense that makes it difficult to classify indecent exposure as infamous or something less. As we have noted, the crimes that are normally associated with the term \u201cinfamous because of their moral turpitude [are] treason, felony, perjury, forgery and those other offenses, classified generally as <em>crimen falsi.\u201d </em>They leave no doubt as to the type of conduct committed and condemned. The courts, legislature, and society have made the determination that such crimes, because they show such a lack of regard for societal norms and values, are relevant in assessing the credibility of one who has been convicted of those offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">At the very heart of our determination of this matter, however, is the kinds of conduct which give rise to this offense. We believe that whether the crime sought to be used to impeach describes with sufficient specificity the conduct reflecting on the defendant\u2019s credibility is another factor to be weighed by the trial court. If the crime is so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>ill-defined that it causes the factfinder to speculate as to what conduct is impacting on the defendant\u2019s credibility, it should be excluded. Stated differently, since the issue is always the truth of the witness, where there is no way to determine whether a crime affects the defendant\u2019s testimony simply by the name of the crime that crime should be inadmissible for purposes of impeachment. It is clear to us that the introduction of a prior conviction for indecent exposure sheds no light on what it is the defendant has done and hence it is beyond the ken of any factfinder to assess what, if any, impact such conviction has upon the defendant\u2019s veracity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">The argument arises that the defendant has the opportunity to explain the circumstances surrounding his prior conviction, allowing him to offset whatever prejudicial effect the conviction might have. This, however, is manifestly unfair and would amount to a retrial of the prior conviction before the present jury. The prejudice resulting from such a procedure clearly would outweigh whatever minute probative value the conviction had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">We hold, therefore, that, for purposes of impeachment, indecent exposure is not an infamous crime, a crime of moral turpitude, a felony, nor a crime involving dishonesty or deceit. Further, we hold, it is a lesser crime for which the proscribed conduct includes such a wide variety of behavior that the factfinder would be unable to make a reasoned judgment as to whether the offense affects the defendant\u2019s credibility; it is inadmissible for purposes of impeachment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 710-11, 713-14, 436 A.2d at 911, 913. <em>See also Lowery v.

Duckett, </em>306 Md. 503, 510 A.2d 253 (1986), we addressed whether a conviction for battery was admissible to impeach. We determined that, similar to indecent exposure, it was not, because there are various relatively innocent acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>which could give rise to a conviction for battery, and thus, the crime, by its elements, evinces nothing <em>per se </em>regarding the veracity of a witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">Like indecent exposure, then, the types of offenses which fall within the ambit of the crime of battery vary widely. A person may commit battery by kissing another without consent, touching or tapping another, jostling another out of the way, throwing water upon another, rudely seizing a person\u2019s clothes, cutting off a person\u2019s hair, throwing food at another, or participating in an unlawful fight.

We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that Westpoint\u2019s prior conviction for a third degree sexual offense, based upon his sexual contact with a victim who was under the age of 14 when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>he was more than four years older, does not, <em>per se, </em>connote that he would be more likely to lie under oath, and therefore, is not relevant to credibility. Although it could be said that an individual who is convicted of a third degree sexual offense usually acts in \u201csecrecy,\u201d that, in an of itself, is not sufficient to render the prior conviction admissible for the purpose of impeachment. <em>See Morales, </em>325 Md. at 339, 600 A.2d at 855, and <em>Lowery, </em>292 Md. at 2, 437 A.2d at 193, in which we concluded that convictions for simple possession of controlled dangerous substances, which by their nature involve secrecy, were not admissible to impeach. Therefore, Westpoint\u2019s prior conviction for a third degree sexual offense cannot be.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The State argues, however, that even if the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of the prior conviction, the error was harmless because bad acts evidence arising from the same incident was admitted. Westpoint\u2019s convictions, however, cannot stand unless, \u201cupon [our] own independent review of the record, [this Court] is able to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict.\u201d <em>Newman v.

State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976). We cannot so conclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">At trial, the prosecution and the defense presented dramatically different accounts of the incidents in issue, the relative validity of which was dependent, largely, on the credibility of Westpoint and his daughter. Westpoint\u2019s credibility was tarnished, certainly, by evidence that he had been convicted of a third degree sexual offense, as reinforced by the prosecutor, who, in her closing argument, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">So he wants you to believe that all of this is because she didn\u2019t like the fact that I was disciplining her. Come on. 2001, 2005, and the Defendant, who was convicted of having inappropriate sexual contact with his daughter, wants you now to believe that this is all this is. You can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s telling you. He\u2019s been convicted of this crime. This is not somebody who you can believe what he is telling you. He is not to be believed, ladies and gentlemen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Moreover, the fact that the other crimes, wrongs or acts evidence was admitted does not change our conclusion, because, absent the admission of his conviction, the jury could have determined that the daughter\u2019s testimony was unreliable. The prior conviction, however, could have rendered such a conclusion doubtful, because it would have bolstered the daughter\u2019s veracity. Reviewing the record before us, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt that the admission of Westpoint\u2019s prior conviction did not affect the jury\u2019s finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Other Crimes, Wrongs or Acts Evidence\u2014Rule 5-404(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">We shall, for guidance on remand, analyze the other bad acts issue raised by Westpoint, because the subject is likely to arise again.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Rule 5-404(b) governs the admission of other crimes, wrongs or acts evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">We have opined that evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is, generally, not admissible as substantive proof, <em>Borchardt v. State, </em>367 Md. 91, 133, 786 A.2d 631, 656 (2001); <em>Wynn v. State, </em>351 Md. 307, 316, 718 A.2d 588, 592 (1998); <em>State v.

Faulkner, </em>314 Md. 630, 633, 552 A.2d 896, 897 (1989), because a jury could decide to convict on the basis of an alleged criminal disposition and might infer that because the defendant has acted badly in the past that he is more likely to have committed the crime charged. <em>See also Wynn, </em>351 Md. at 317, 718 A.2d at 593; <em>Taylor, </em>347 Md. at 369, 701 A.2d at 392; <em>Straughn v. State, </em>297 Md. 329, 333, 465 A.2d 1166, 1168-69 (1983). Yet, other crimes, wrongs or acts evidence may be admissible when it has \u201cspecial relevance,\u201d i.e., when the evidence \u201c \u2018is substantially relevant to some contested issue and is not offered simply to prove criminal character.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wynn, </em>351 Md. at 316, 718 A.2d at 592; <em>Taylor, </em>347 Md. at 368, 701 A.2d at 392. If the evidence reflects notice, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident for example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>it may have greater relevance. <em>See </em>Rule 5\u2014404(b); <em>Wynn, </em>351 Md. at 316, 718 A.2d at 592-93. Other bad acts evidence also may be admitted, \u201cif the crimes are so linked together in point of time or circumstances that one cannot be fully shown without proving the other.\u201d <em>Wynn, </em>351 Md. at 316-17, 718 A.2d at 593; <em>Taylor, </em>347 Md. at 369, 701 A.2d at 392. <em>See also Bryant v. State, </em>207 Md. 565, 586, 115 A.2d 502, 511 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">There are limitations to its admissibility, however. In <em>Wynn, </em>351 Md. at 317, 718 A.2d at 593, we set forth a three-step analysis which must be undertaken prior to the admission of bad acts evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-6\">\u201c[The trial court] first determines whether the evidence fits within one or more of the <em>Ross[</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>exceptions [, essentially the exceptions now found in Rule 5-404(b)]. That is a legal determination and does not involve any exercise of discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">If one or more of the exceptions applies, the next step is to decide whether the accused\u2019s involvement in the other crimes is established by clear and convincing evidence. [The appellate court] will review this decision to determine whether the evidence was sufficient to support the trial judge\u2019s finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">If this requirement is met, the trial court proceeds to the final step. The necessity for and probative value of the \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence is to be carefully weighed against any undue prejudice likely to result from its admission. This segment of the analysis implicates the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>In other crimes evidence issues, as to whether a matter fits within an exception in the first instance, we extend no deference to a trial court\u2019s decision. Initially, courts should exclude other crimes evidence. Only if it fits within an exception will this type of evidence be admissible and, even then, the defendant\u2019s involvement must be established by clear and convincing evidence and the probative value and prejudicial effect balanced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">(citations omitted) (alterations in original). <em>See also Conyers, </em>345 Md. at 551-52, 693 A.2d at 793; <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634-35, 552 A.2d at 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">At trial, the daughter testified that Westpoint had committed acts similar to those charged in the instant case. Although Westpoint does not challenge the sufficiency of the bad acts evidence, nor whether the evidence falls within any of the exceptions in Rule 5-404(b), he argues that the trial judge erred in admitting the other bad acts evidence because their prejudicial effect outweighed their probative value, while the State asserts, conversely, that the evidence was admissible as substantive proof, under various of our cases, including <em>Wentz v.

The exception our predecessors recognized and which we apply here does not reach beyond the three requirements we have set out. It is strictly limited to the prosecution for sexual crimes in which the prior illicit sexual acts are similar to the offense for which the accused is being tried and involve the same \u25a0victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-6\"><em>Vogel, </em>315 Md. at 466, 554 A.2d at 1234. <em>See also Oesby v.

Because the trial judge\u2019s admission into evidence of West-point\u2019s prior conviction was not harmless error, we affirm the decision of the Court of Special Appeals and remand the case to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED WITH COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Dissenting opinion by MURPHY, J.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-14\">.

On the first day of the jury trial, Westpoint's daughter, the alleged victim, testified, but she could not remember what, if anything, occurred on March 8th or 11th. After the State rested, the judge granted Westpoint\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal as to the counts involving those dates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b487-11\">. All statutory references are to the Criminal Law Article, Maryland Code (2002), unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b488-12\">. The record reflects that in 2002 Westpoint entered an Alford plea, <em>see North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970), which we have defined as \"a guilty plea containing a protestation of innocence.\u201d <em>See Marshall v.

The Court of Special Appeals held, and we agree, that Westpoint did preserve his objection to the admission of the prior conviction evidence. His attorney objected to questions about his 2002 conviction for a third degree sexual offense when they were first asked, and during the subsequent bench conference, made clear that he believed Rule 5-609 governed and that the evidence of the prior conviction was inadmissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b501-13\">. <em>But see </em>Rule 5-608(b), entitled \u201cImpeachment by examination regarding witness\u2019s own prior conduct not resulting in convictions,\u201d which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-14\">The court may permit any witness to be examined regarding the witness\u2019s own prior conduct that did not result in a conviction but that the court finds probative of a character trait of untruthfulness.

Rule 5-609 was derived in part from Federal Rule 609, although the two rules differ. <em>See </em>Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a) (prior convictions of crimes involving dishonesty or false statement are <em>per se </em>admissible, while prior convictions of felonies are admissible only if the probative value outweighs the prejudicial effect). Federal Rule 609, nevertheless, imposes the same requirement that only those convictions which are probative of the witness\u2019s character trait for truthfulness are admissible for impeachment. Various federal courts, addressing similar sexual offenses, have held that the convictions are not highly probative of credibility. <em>See Christmas v. Sanders, </em>759 F.2d 1284, 1292 (7th Cir. 1985) (\"[Tjhe trial judge correctly noted that a conviction for rape was not highly probative of credibility. <em>See </em>Saltzberg, <em>supra, </em>at 373 (sex crimes \"low on the list of crimes relating to veracity\u201d)____\u201d); <em>United States v. Beahm, </em>664 F.2d 414, 419 (4th Cir.1981) (in prosecution of taking indecent liberties with children, trial court erred in admitting conviction of defendant for \"unnatural and perverted sexual practices\u201d for purpose of impeachment, because it had minimal if any bearing on the likelihood that defendant would testify truthfully); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Larsen, </em>596 F.2d 347, 348 (9th Cir. 1979) (per curiam) (\"The fact that a defendant has been convicted of child molesting bears only nominally on credibility; there was nothing in the circumstances of this case to increase the probative value of this defendant\u2019s prior convictions of this crime.\u201d); <em>United States v. Rabinowitz, </em>578 F.2d 910, 912 (2d Cir.1978) (per curiam) (in prosecution for distribution and possession with intent to distribute diazepam, judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding evidence relating to witness\u2019 alleged prior acts of sodomy on young children because that evidence\u2019s bearing on the witness\u2019 propensity to tell truth was tenuous). <em>But see United States v. Kelly, </em>510 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2007) (admission of defendant\u2019s prior conviction for attempted rape of a 12-year-old child was admitted as substantive evidence under Federal Rule 414, which permits the introduction of evidence of past child molestation offenses in child molestation prosecutions to prove propensity); <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>413 F.3d 873, 876 (8th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (concluding that probative value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>evidence of defendant\u2019s prior conviction for sexual assault outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice and was admissible under Federal Rule 413, which allows the introduction of proof of prior offenses for sexual assault as substantive evidence).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b517-9\">. In <em>Ross v. State, </em>276 Md. 664, 669-70, 350 A.2d 680, 684 (1976), we iterated the \"well recognized\u201d exceptions to the general rule excluding other bad acts evidence, that would later be listed in Rule 5-404(b): \"Thus, evidence of other crimes may be admitted when it tends to establish (1) motive, (2) intent, (3) absence of mistake, (4) a common scheme or plan embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related to each other that proof of one tends to establish the other, and (5) the identity of the person charged with the commission of a crime on trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b521-6\">. Rule 5-404(b) was derived from 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Federal Rules 413 and 414 went into effect in 1995 and are sexual propensity exceptions to the general rule of Federal Rule 404(b). <em>See </em>Federal Rule of Evidence 413(a) (\"In a criminal case in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>defendant is accused of an offense of sexual assault, evidence of the defendant\u2019s commission of another offense or offenses of sexual assault is admissible, and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.\u201d); Federal Rule of Evidence 414(a) (\"In a criminal case in which the defendant is accused of an offense of child molestation, evidence of the defendant\u2019s commission of another offense or offenses of child molestation is admissible, and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.\u201d). Obviously, a notable difference between the federal rules and ours is that the federal exceptions do not require the victim to be the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\">. Several federal courts have determined that a conviction for the prior crime does not tip the balance in favor of undue prejudice under Federal Rule 413, which allows the introduction of proof of prior offenses for sexual assault as substantive evidence, <em>see United States v. Benally, </em>500 F.3d 1085 (10th Cir.2007) (testimony by four victims regarding defendant\u2019s prior acts of sexual assault, for which he was convicted, was admissible as propensity evidence in proceedings for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>aggravated sexual abuse of a minor), as well as under Federal Rule 414, which permits the introduction of evidence of past child molestation offenses in child molestation prosecutions to prove propensity. <em>See United States v. LeMay, </em>260 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir.2001) (admission of evidence of mother of victims of defendant\u2019s prior sexual abuse, for which he had been found guilty of rape in a juvenile adjudication, was warranted as prior similar acts evidence); <em>United States v. Sumner, </em>204 F.3d 1182 (8th Cir.2000) (evidence of two prior acts of child molestation, one for which defendant was previously convicted, was admitted into evidence because probative value was not outweighed by prejudicial effect).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b523-8\">MURPHY, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AGC\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">I agree with the majority and the Court of Special Appeals that \u201ca prior conviction for a third degree sexual offense is not admissible for purposes of impeachment pursuant to Md. Rule 5-609.\u201d I also agree with the majority that evidence regarding the 2001 incident was admissible under the \u201csexual propensity\u201d exception to the general rule excluding \u201cother bad acts\u201d evidence. If the State had not been entitled to introduce evidence of the 2001 incident, I would agree that the respondent is entitled to a new trial. Because evidence of the 2001 incident <em>was </em>admissible, however, I would reinstate the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">If the respondent had been testifying in a civil case (whether as plaintiff, defendant, or non-party witness), it would have been improper to ask him whether he had been convicted of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>third degree sexual offense. It would also have been improper to ask the respondent this question if he had been testifying in a criminal case as (1) a non-party witness, or (2) the criminal defendant charged with any offenses other than sexual offenses alleged to have been committed against the very same victim of the sexual offense for which he was convicted in 2002. In the case at bar, however, the State was entitled to prove that the respondent committed the 2001 offense. Under these unique circumstances, the State was entitled to introduce evidence of the respondent\u2019s 2002 guilty plea-not merely for purposes of impeachment, but as circumstantial evidence that he committed the 2005 offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">The record shows that respondent\u2019s trial counsel argued that there were two reasons why the circuit court should deny the State\u2019s motion to introduce evidence of the 2001 offense, the first reason being \u201cthe fact that this motion [was] filed at the last moment prior to trial.\u201d Respondent\u2019s trial counsel then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">I would strongly request that the Court deny it on the basis of the fact that any possible probative value that such conviction would have is highly outweighed by the extreme prejudice and unfair prejudice that it would bring upon the Defendant in this particular case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">Obviously, once the jury hears that the Defendant has a prior conviction for a third degree sexual offense, the Defendant is charged with second degree rape in this particular case, third degree sexual offense and other related offenses, even though the Court may and likely would give limiting instructions, I don\u2019t think that the jury would be able to dispel that\u2014one, follow the Court\u2019s instruction, and two, the fact that once they hear that, they will unfairly hold it against him. That there\u2019s a propensity or an identity for illicit sexual relations with the victim in this case, they would convict him upon hearing that charge in and of itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">I don\u2019t think that the Court can in this particular case find that the State\u2019s alleged need or need for this evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect against the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The circuit court, expressly relying on the case of <em>Oesby v. State, </em>142 Md.App. 144, 788 A.2d 662 (2002), ruled that evidence of the 2001 offense was admissible because the court found that this evidence (1) fell under the \u201cintent exception\u201d to the rule excluding \u201cother crimes evidence,\u201d (2) was \u201cmore than clear and convincing,\u201d and (3) \u201cwould outweigh the unduly prejudicial effect[.]\u201d Because this Court has affirmed that ruling, respondent\u2019s present conviction should not be reversed on the ground that he was unfairly prejudiced by the cross-examination about his 2002 guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">I am persuaded that the respondent\u2019s direct examination opened the door to the cross-examination about the disposition of the charges that resulted from the 2001 incident. The record shows that, during the respondent\u2019s direct examination, he made a vague reference to \u201cnot going through this again,\u201d which insinuated that the victim\u2019s testimony about the 2001 incident was as false as her testimony about the 2005 incidents. If the State had been prohibited from questioning the respondent about this remark, the jurors may well have (1) accepted the respondent\u2019s testimony that \u201c[njothing happened in 2001,\u201d and (2) applied <em>the jalsus in uno, falsus in omnibus </em>inference to the victim\u2019s testimony about what occurred in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">It is well settled that, although a plea of guilty to a criminal charge does not conclusively establish liability in a civil action arising out of the incident that resulted in the criminal charge, such a plea constitutes an evidentiary admission that may be introduced into evidence during a subsequent civil proceeding. See <em>Crane v. Dunn, </em>382 Md. 83, 93, 854 A.2d 1180, 1186 (2004), <em>Brohawn v. Transamerica Insurance Company, </em>276 Md. 396, 403, 347 A.2d 842, 848 (1975), and <em>Campfield v. Crowther, </em>252 Md. 88, 100, 249 A.2d 168, 176 (1969). This rule should be equally applicable to the case at bar and to every other criminal case in which (1) <em>whether or not the defendant testifies, </em>the State is entitled to prove that the defendant committed a particular offense, and (2) the defendant entered a plea of guilty to having committed that particular offense. When this rule is applicable and the defendant chooses to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>testify, regardless of what occurs during the direct examination, the prosecutor should be allowed to ask the defendant (1) whether the defendant committed that offense, and (2) whether the defendant entered a plea of guilty to having done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">On the issue of whether the respondent was unfairly prejudiced by evidence of his 2002 conviction, the record shows that during the jury instruction conference, respondent\u2019s trial counsel (1) objected only to \u201cthe other crimes evidence instruction,\u201d and (2) actually requested that the circuit court deliver an \u201cimpeachment on a prior conviction\u201d instruction. The following transpired after the circuit court had begun to instruct the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">[Defense counsel]: Excuse me, Your Honor. There\u2019s a matter I need to bring to your attention prior to you proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">May we approach please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">The Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">[Defense counsel]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">Whereupon, counsel approached the bench, and the following ensued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-11\">[Defense counsel]: Based on the Court\u2019s decision to allow the State to impeach Mr. Westpoint with a prior conviction of the sex offense, I am going to object to the Court reading impeachment by prior conviction. I wanted to put that on the record before you read it. That\u2019s why I stopped you now, but I\u2019ll also make an exception to it after you read it. That\u2019s not the one-there\u2019s a different one, the one we talked about before you started reading the instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-12\">The Court: I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-13\">[Defense counsel]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-14\">The Court: It\u2019s highly unusual to interrupt the instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-15\">[Defense counsel]: I understand, Your Honor, but I didn\u2019t want to possibly waive any rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-16\">The Court: I\u2019m going to instruct as they appear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-17\">[Defense counsel]: I beg your pardon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>The Court: I\u2019m going to instruct as the instructions appear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axy\">[Defense counsel]: I understand. You asked me before we started, did I have anything to object to and I mentioned one, but I didn\u2019t mention the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">The Court: Okay. [Defense counsel]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">The jury was instructed as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">With regard to the proof of intent, you\u2019re instructed as follows: Intent is a state of mind and ordinarily cannot be proven directly because there is no way of looking into another person\u2019s mind. Therefore, a Defendant\u2019s intent may be shown by surrounding circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">In determining the Defendant\u2019s intent, you may consider the Defendant\u2019s acts and statements, as well as surrounding circumstances. Further, you may, but you\u2019re not required to infer that a person ordinarily intends the natural and probable consequences of his acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">In this case, you\u2019ve heard evidence that the Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of third degree sexual offense in 2001 which is not a charge in this case. You may consider this evidence only on the question of the Defendant\u2019s intent in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">You\u2019ve heard evidence that the Defendant has been convicted of a crime. You may consider this evidence in deciding whether the Defendant is telling the truth, but for no other purpose. You may not use the conviction as any evidence that the Defendant committed the crime charged in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">When the circuit court asked whether there were any exceptions to the jury instructions, respondent\u2019s trial counsel stated, \u201cYes, Your Honor, based on what we discussed earlier. Same ones.\u201d No exception was noted on the ground that the limiting \u201cother crimes evidence\u201d instruction was in conflict with the limiting \u201cimpeachment by conviction\u201d instruction. I am persuaded that, because of this Court\u2019s holding that evidence of the respondent\u2019s 2001 offense was \u201csubstantively\u201d admissible, the above quoted jury instructions actually gave him an advantage to which he was not entitled. I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>therefore hold that the respondent was not <em>unfairly </em>prejudiced by the evidence relating to his 2002 guilty plea, and would order that his judgment of conviction be reinstated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
