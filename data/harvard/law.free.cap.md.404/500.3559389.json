Rendelman of one count of extortion and one count of extortion by written threat. Respondent had mailed a letter to William Elmhirst wherein he accused Mr. Elmhirst of stealing $22,000.00 from him and demanded damages plus interest compounded at nine percent. Respondent also threatened to sue Mr. Elmhirst for this amount if Mr. Elmhirst did not pay Respondent a $100,000.00 \u201csettlement demand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">The Court of Special Appeals reversed Respondent\u2019s convictions on the grounds of insufficiency of the evidence. <em>See Rendelman v. State, </em>175 Md.App. 422, 927 A.2d 468 (2007). Thereafter, the State of Maryland filed a petition for writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>certiorari, to which Respondent filed an answer and conditional cross-petition. This Court granted both petitions, <em>State v. Rendelman, </em>402 Md. 37, 935 A.2d 406 (2007), to consider the following three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">1. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that the evidence presented by the State did not support Rendelman\u2019s convictions of extortion and extortion by written threat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">2. Did the trial court err in admitting into evidence redacted versions of Rendelman\u2019s threatening letters as evidence of prior bad acts relevant to establishing Rendelman\u2019s intent and demonstrating a common scheme or plan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">3. Did the trial court err in denying Rendelman\u2019s request to instruct the jury on \u201cthe use of foul language?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">As to the first question, we shall hold, as a matter of law, that threats of litigation, regardless of merit, do not constitute \u201cwrongful threats of economic injury,\u201d within the scope of Md.Code (2002), \u00a7 3-701 of the Criminal Law Article. In addition, we shall hold that threats of litigation, regardless of merit, do not constitute \u201cunlawful extortion\u201d within the meaning of Md.Code (2002, 2005 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-706 of the Criminal Law Article. Because of our resolution of question one, we need not address questions two and three.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">\n<em>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">The underlying basis for Respondent\u2019s convictions for extortion and extortion by written threat is a letter dated December 22, 2004, addressed to Mr. Elmhirst and copied to Kevin Fay, Esquire, Mr. Elmhirst\u2019s attorney. Before we set forth the contents of that letter, we shall briefly summarize the series of events leading to Respondent\u2019s writing of the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">From 1981 to 1984, Respondent was employed as the bookkeeper for Mr. Elmhirst\u2019s company, Solarquest. Respondent was primarily responsible for paying the company\u2019s bills and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>reconciling the company\u2019s accounting books. In late 1984, Mr. Fay discovered that Respondent had embezzled $246,000.00 from Solarquest. In response, Mr. Elmhirst and Mr. Fay reported the theft to the authorities, sought criminal charges against Respondent, filed a civil action for conversion against Respondent, and immediately terminated Respondent from his position with Solarquest. Soon thereafter, Respondent wrote Mr. Elmhirst a long, conciliatory letter, admitting that he had taken the money, explaining what he had done with the funds, and promising to assign the notes and mortgages purchased with the funds to Mr. Elmhirst. Sometime thereafter, Respondent began sending Mr. Elmhirst a series of crude and accusatory letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">On September 10,1986, Respondent was tried and convicted of 15 counts of theft relating to his embezzlement of Solar-quest funds. He was sentenced to 10 years\u2019 incarceration, all but 18 months suspended, and three years\u2019 supervised probation. After his conviction and until 1988, Respondent sent Mr. Elmhirst seventeen hate-filled, vulgar letters. In these letters, Respondent blamed Mr. Elmhirst for the consequences of his convictions, including his divorce from his wife and his estrangement from his children. In addition, in some letters, Respondent claimed Mr. Elmhirst owed him $20,000.00. The letters, however, stopped in March 1988 when Respondent was released from State custody and transferred into federal custody to begin serving a federal sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was released from federal custody on December 21, 2001. Respondent waited until December 22, 2004, to send Mr. Elmhirst another letter. It appears he waited until his three-year period of supervised probation was terminated before resuming his letter-writing campaign against Mr. Elmhirst.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The December 22, 2004, letter is typed and bears a letterhead with Respondent\u2019s name and an address in Sacramento, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Respondent\u2019s letter to Mr. Elmhirst reads as follows:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1R\">William K. Elmhirst, you filthy [expletives],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-4\">I\u2019ve waited 20 years to write this letter. It was December 24, 1984, almost exactly 20 years ago, when you froze my bank accounts, ruined my Christmas with my family, and started the process that would put me in prison for 17 years. You\u2019re a [expletives] piece of dog [expletive]. Thanks to you, my kids grew up without a father and my wife (or should I say my ex-wife) is a widow. [Expletives] I hate your guts. You will <em>NEVER </em>be able to give me back my lost years, return me to father my 6 and 2 year old kids, or give me back my wife. My life is ruined and it\u2019s all your doing. You made false claims against me, stole my money, and you don\u2019t give a [expletive]. The only thing you could do is give me back my money. That won\u2019t make everything right again, but it\u2019s the best you can do. It\u2019s the only thing you can do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">I was released on December 21, 2001, and I\u2019ve been on three years parole. During that time I was not allowed to contact you, I was not allowed to travel, and I couldn\u2019t change my residence. But now I am off of parole. Now there is nothing stopping me from coming back there. NOTHING!! You stole about $22,000 from me. It was actually a little more, and yes, I still have the exact amount in my records which have been sent to a third party who has kept them for me all these years. I can look it up if it becomes necessary, but for the purpose of settlement, let\u2019s just say it was $22,000. Twenty years at 9% compounded interest makes the current amount due $123,297.04. I will settle for $100,000 even. This is the amount I want. You give me back my money, and I swear, you will never see or hear from me again. I will take the money and leave this stinking [expletive] country and the United [expletive] States can kiss my [expletive] goodbye. This country <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>breaks up families, puts innocent people in prison without fair trials, and no one cares. Well, [expletive] all you people. This is the wrong country to marry in and raise a family in. My son is in the army and is in Iraq and the government will probably have him killed and I never knew him beyond the age of 6 years old. [Expletive] all of you. Give me my money and I\u2019m gone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-4\">But if you don\u2019t give me my money, I swear, I will come back there and I will knock on your front door. I will demand my money, and if you refuse, I will sue you, and I will sue you for the entire $128,297.04. I will make your remaining years of your life miserable. I will sue you, I will file liens on your property, I will have the sheriff seize your assets. Don\u2019t think the statute of limitations will help you. I remember from my legal research that the time of the statute of limitations is tolled while I am involuntarily out of the state, and I have been involuntarily out of the State of [expletive] Maryland since 1988. The statute didn\u2019t start running again until today. The way I figure, I still have another year to file on you, but I\u2019m not going to wait that long. I will give you one, maybe two months, and if I don\u2019t have my money back, I will come back. I will quit my dead end job and move out of my one room studio and I will come back. I will find you. If I have to hunt for you door to door, I will find you, and when I find you, I will sue you. How old are you now, about 76? 77? I don\u2019t even know if you\u2019re still alive, but if you are, I WILL find you. If you\u2019re dead, I will search for your heirs, and when I find them, I will demand my money from them, because they did not inherit your money. It was <em>MINE!!!! </em>I will demand my money from them, and if they refuse, I will sue them. I will sue them and get my money, and then I will leave this stinking country and never come back. [Expletives].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">I want my money sent to me at the above address. If I do not hear from you, I will return. I will come to your house and look you in the eye. Don\u2019t think this is over. Far from it. It\u2019s just starting. All these years, you got away with it because I was locked up. I lost cases because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>I could not print copies of my appeal brief, I could not research State of [expletive] Maryland issues in federal prisons on the other side of the [expletive] country, and I did not have access to my records. Well, all that changes. Now, you will never again win a case by my default. I will prosecute all my cases fully and to the end. You will not win by default. You will either give me back my money, or you will spend at least as much in legal fees trying to illegally keep it. Either way, God will not let you profit from what you did to me and my family. [Expletives]. How can you sleep at night and look yourself in the mirror in the morning? ? ? You don\u2019t care. You ruined a man\u2019s life for what was a puny $22,000 which made no difference in your lifestyle at all. You did it just for the fun of it, didn\u2019t you? ? I stole nothing from you. <em>YOU </em>are the thief. <em>YOU </em>are the menace to society. Its [sic] people like you who make society the shit that it is. You break up families and [expletives].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\">You [expletive]. All you had to do was come to my sentencing and say a few words on my behalf like Kevin P. [expletive] Fay said you would do to get me to settle the civil suit with you. If you had done it, you would never have heard from me again. But you didn\u2019t, and you cost me 20 years of my life. Now, it\u2019s not over. Now I want my money back, and if you don\u2019t give it to me, I will make you wish you had come to my sentencing like you promised. I will sue you, I will file liens on your house and Solarquest property, and I will have the sheriff seize your assets. You will pay. You will pay $100,000 or your remaining years will be spent paying legal fees and going to court when I sue you for $123,297.04.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">By the way, Merry [expletive] Christmas you [expletives].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">I\u2019m sending a copy of this letter to Kevin Fay. I may sue him too for being a [expletive] piece of [expletive].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Mr. Elmhirst never received this or subsequent letters as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>had moved to England prior to their transmittal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. Fay, however, received the copies directed to him and brought them to the attention of the law enforcement authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">On June 17, 2005, Respondent was indicted on four counts of extortion and four counts of extortion by written threat. Four of the eight counts (two counts each of extortion and extortion by written threat) concerned the letter Respondent sent to Mr. Elmhirst (and copied to Mr. Fay) on or about December 22, 2004. The other four counts concerned two letters from Respondent and received by Mr. Fay, dated February 8, 2005, and March 14, 2005. A jury trial was held on October 31 and November 1, 2005. The State called Mr. Fay and his receptionist as witnesses. Respondent offered no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">After deliberation, the jury found Respondent guilty of one count of extortion and one count of extortion by written threat relating to the letter, dated December 22, 2004, sent to Mr. Elmhirst. The jury acquitted Respondent of the six remaining counts. Respondent filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">On July 6, 2007, the intermediate appellate court reversed the convictions, holding that there was insufficient evidence to support the two convictions. <em>Rendelman, </em>175 Md.App. at 449, 927 A.2d at 484. Specifically, the court determined that to be convicted of extortion, the defendant must both intend to achieve a wrongful goal and attempt to do so by a wrongful means. <em>Id. </em>at 438, 927 A.2d at 477. The court noted that the evidence the State presented at trial was sufficient to prove that Respondent\u2019s goal, to obtain money he was not entitled to, was wrongful. <em>Id. </em>at 443, 927 A.2d at 480. The intermediate appellate court, however, concluded that the evidence presented was insufficient to prove that Respondent attempted to accomplish this goal by wrongful means. <em>Id. </em>at 444, 449, 927 A.2d at 480, 484. The court held that threats of litigation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>even if made in bad faith, are not a wrongful means under Maryland statutory language. <em>Id. </em>at 448, 927 A.2d at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"AYMd\">The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">[A] threat to bring civil litigation does not have intrinsic extortionate value. The threat is to place the extortionist\u2019s claim against the victim in the hands of a neutral third party, the civil justice system, to decide. The threat is not such as to instill fear because, if it is carried out, the extortionist no longer has the power to affect its result. Without the capacity to instill fear, the threat, in and of itself, does not have the force to leverage payment of value from the victim merely to avoid a consequence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeN\"><em>Rendelman, </em>175 Md.App. at 446, 927 A.2d at 481-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">\n<em>STATUTORY PROVISIONS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">We are called upon to determine what the Maryland General Assembly intended when it enacted two statutes. The statutory provisions with which we are concerned are \u00a7\u00a7 3\u2014 701<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 3-706<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Maryland Criminal Law Article.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Section 3-701, entitled \u201cExtortion generally,\u201d reads in its entirety:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>(a) <em>Scope of </em>section.\u2014This section does not apply to legitimate efforts by employees or their representatives to obtain certain wages, hours, or working conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">(b) <em>Obtaining, attempting or conspiring to obtain property </em>prohibited.\u2014A person may not obtain or attempt to obtain money, property, or anything of value from another person with the person\u2019s consent, if the consent is induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force or violence, or by wrongful threat of economic injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">(c) <em>Penalty\u2014Value of property $500 or </em>more.\u2014If the value of the property is $500 or more, a person who violates this section is guilty of the felony of extortion and on conviction is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 10 years or a fine not exceeding $5,000 or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">(d) <em>Penalty\u2014Value of property less than $500. </em>If the value of the property is less than $500, a person who violates this section is guilty of the misdemeanor of extortion and on conviction is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 18 months or a fine not exceeding $500 or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">(e) Limitation.\u2014A prosecution for a felony under this section shall be instituted within 5 years after the crime was committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Section 3-706, entitled \u201cExtortion by written threat,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-10\">(a) <em>Scope of </em>Section.\u2014(1) This section applies to any writing, whether or not the writing is signed, or if the writing is signed, whether or not it is signed with a fictitious name or any other mark or designation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-11\">(2) This section does not apply to a good faith reasonable notice of dishonor and warning of criminal prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>under Title 8, Subtitle 1 of this article given by a holder of an instrument to the maker of the instrument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\">(b) Prohibited.\u2014A person, with the intent to unlawfully extort money, property, or anything of value from another, may not knowingly send or deliver, or make for the purpose of being sent or delivered and part with the possession of, a writing threatening to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">(1) accuse any person of a crime or of anything that, if true, would bring the person into contempt or disrepute; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">(2) (i) cause physical injury to a person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">(ii) inflict emotional distress on a person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">(iii) cause economic damage to a person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">(iv) cause damage to the property of a person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">(c) Penalty.\u2014A person who violates this section is guilty of a felony and on conviction is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 10 years or a fine not exceeding $10,000, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">\n<em>PARTIES\u2019 CONTENTIONS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AT7\">The State</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">The State contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred when it held that the evidence presented at trial against Respondent did not support his convictions for extortion. The State maintains that the Court of Special Appeals should not have resolved the case as a matter of law and should not have \u201csubstituted its judgment for that of a properly-instructed jury.\u201d The State argues further that the intermediate appellate court erroneously adopted an \u201cinflexible per se rule,\u201d and \u201cpurports to base its decision on settled authority [when] there is by no means a consensus\u201d among other jurisdictions as to what constitutes extortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">In addition, the State contends that while there are no Maryland appellate cases which have interpreted the phrase \u201cwrongful threat of economic injury,\u201d found in \u00a7 3-701, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>clear intent of the Maryland legislature \u201cwas that the extortion laws cover the widest range of conduct, including, as implicated in the present case, threats of economic harm.\u201d The State asserts that \u201cthere is nothing in the history or text of Maryland\u2019s extortion statutes that suggests that threats of litigation, where the threats are unjustified or wrongful, may not be considered extortionate.\u201d According to the State, the statutes carve out only two types of threats that will not support a charge of extortion\u2014(1) demands to \u201cobtain certain wage, hours, or working conditions,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 3-701(a); and, (2) demands relating to bad checks, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3-706(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Further, the State argues that while the intermediate appellate court purported to rely on \u201ca clear majority of the federal courts\u201d in its holding, there is actually a split among the federal circuits as to whether bad faith threats of litigation amount to wrongful threats of economic harm. Specifically, the State cites <em>Sosa v. DIRECTV, Inc., </em>437 F.3d 923, 939-40 (9th Cir.2006), and <em>United States v. Sturm, </em>870 F.2d 769, 774 (1st Cir.1989), as examples. The State also cites a flurry of cases to argue that the issue of wrongfulness of a threat should be left to the trier of <em>fact\u2014United States v. Kattar, 840 </em>F.2d 118, 123 (1st Cir.1988); <em>Sturm, </em>870 F.2d at 774; <em>United States v. Hyde, </em>448 F.2d 815, 833 (5th Cir.1971); <em>State v. Ashley, </em>108 N.M. 343, 772 P.2d 377, 381 (1989); and, <em>State v. Roth, </em>289 N.J.Super. 152, 673 A.2d 285, 290 (App.Div.1996). The State explains: \u201cthe per se rule adopted by the Court of Special Appeals is unwarranted and creates a loophole in the law of extortion by permitting potential blackmailers to evade prosecution simply by couching their threats in the form of a threatened lawsuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Finally, the State contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred in treating Respondent\u2019s letter dated December 22, 2004, to Mr. Elmhirst as a usual and customary demand letter. According to the State, Respondent \u201chad no colorable cause of action for damages against [Mr.] Elmhirst.... The evidence before the jury showed Respondent sought to exact revenge against Mr. Elmhirst and Mr. Fay, whom Rendelman believes unfairly accused him of embezzlement years before.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>In other words, the State asks this Court to respect the jury\u2019s decision to convict Respondent for extortion: \u201cIn this case, the jury reasonably concluded that Respondent\u2019s vulgar, obnoxious, threats to sue, file liens, seize assets, and to make the remaining years of the victims\u2019 lives miserable, where the evidence showed that Respondent had no legitimate claim to anything, amounted to a wrongful threat of economic injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Respondent</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Respondent argues that the evidence presented at trial does not support his convictions for extortion by threat of economic harm. Specifically, Respondent contends that his conduct was not prohibited by the statutes under which he was convicted. He states: \u201cThe statutory language and legislative history require that threats be unlawful, or at a minimum wrongful, in order to be chargeable as extortion. Maryland cases and cases from other jurisdictions are united in holding that threats to take legal action, no matter how frivolous or unwarranted, are not wrongful or unlawful and thus cannot support an extortion conviction premised on a threat to cause economic harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Respondent contends that \u201cneither the [statutory] text nor the legislative history of Maryland extortion statutes support a conviction based on a threat to take legal action.\u201d Rather, Respondent asserts that the statutes criminalize \u201cwrongful\u201d threats made with \u201cunlawful\u201d intent. According to Respondent, \u201ca threat to resort to legal process is the antithesis of the wrongful and unlawful conduct proscribed by Maryland\u2019s extortion laws\u201d and he points out that the intermediate appellate court once generally noted that under Maryland law, \u201cthreats to institute civil proceedings are not wrongful.\u201d <em>See Bell v. Bell, 38 </em>Md.App. 10, 17, 379 A.2d 419, 423 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">To assess whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes of extortion and extortion by written threat beyond a reasonable doubt, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>tion. <em>See Harrison v. State, </em>382 Md. 477, 487-88, 855 A.2d 1220, 1226 (2004). At trial, the State essentially presented the following evidence: In late 1984, Mr. Elmhirst and Mr. Fay learned that Respondent had embezzled $246,000.00 from Solarquest, a company owned by Mr. Elmhirst, during the three years Respondent was employed by the company. On December 20, 1984, Respondent wrote Mr. Elmhirst a lengthy letter wherein he admitted taking the money and attached, as reimbursement, a check for $93,496.50. He also promised to assign to Mr. Elmhirst three notes he acquired using the embezzled money. Mr. Elmhirst immediately terminated Respondent from employment with Solarquest and filed criminal charges and a civil action for conversion against Respondent. On September 10, 1986, Respondent was convicted in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County of 15 counts of felony theft relating to his embezzlement of funds from Solarquest. Thereafter, at various times from 1985 through 2004, Respondent sent letters to Mr. Elmhirst and Mr. Fay explaining his hatred for the two men for their perceived role in his criminal convictions and subsequent incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">On or about December 22, 2004, Respondent sent Mr. Elmhirst a letter, which the State used as its basis for two of the eight criminal charges against Respondent. It appears Respondent waited until his probation terminated before writing to Mr. Elmhirst, apparently to avoid violating the terms of his probation. In the letter, Respondent blamed Mr. Elmhirst for the consequences that followed his criminal convictions. He also accused Mr. Elmhirst of stealing \u201cabout $22,000\u201d from him. The letter, however, does not specify when or how Mr. Elmhirst stole the money from Respondent. Respondent claimed that, with nine percent compounded interest upon the $22,000.00, Mr. Elmhirst owed him $123,297.04, as of the date of the letter. Respondent, however, asserted that he would \u201csettle for $100,000 even.\u201d Respondent then delineated the consequences to Mr. Elmhirst if Mr. Elmhirst chose not to meet the settlement demand: \u201cI will sue you, I will file liens on your house and Solarquest property, and I will have the sheriff seize your assets. You will pay. You will pay $100,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>or your remaining years will be spent paying legal fees and going to court when I sue you for $123,297.04.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The Court of Special Appeals concluded that Respondent\u2019s damage claim was \u201cbogus\u201d and that \u201cthere was no factual basis for any assertion he made, at any time, that Mr. Elmhirst owed Respondent money.\u201d Regardless of that characterization of the legal merits of Respondent\u2019s claims against Mr. Elmhirst, we agree with the intermediate appellate court that \u201ca threat to file suit unless a settlement is paid, even when made in bad faith, is not a \u2018wrongful\u2019 threat\u201d within the meaning of the extortion statutes. <em>Rendelman, </em>175 Md.App. at 444, 927 A.2d at 480. We assume <em>arguendo, </em>for the purposes of our discussion, that Respondent\u2019s threats were made in bad faith and without any legal merit. Nevertheless, his threat to file suit and his demand to be paid $100,000.00 do not, as a matter of law, constitute a \u201cwrongful threat of economic injury\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3-701 or an unlawful extortion of money within the meaning of \u00a7 3-706.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AgE\">Section 3-701</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">A threat to pursue a legal action unless a settlement payment is rendered is not extortion by <em>wrongful </em>threat of economic damage under \u00a7 3-701. In <em>Leppo v. State Highway Admin., </em>330 Md. 416, 422, 624 A.2d 539, 542 (1993), we restated our well-established precedent for interpreting statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">When a court is engaged in the divination of legislative \u201cintent,\u201d the key is the purpose of the legislation, determined in the light of the statute\u2019s language and context. <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 516, 525 A.2d 628 (1987). When we look at the statutory language we apply the plain meaning of the words chosen by the Legislature. <em>Scheve v. Shudder, </em>328 Md. 363, 371-372, 614 A.2d 582 (1992); <em>Revis v. Automobile Ins. Fund, </em>322 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>688, 686, 589 A.2d 483 (1991). If the statutory language itself is insufficient to lead us comfortably to conclude what the Legislature intended, we look beyond the words and examine legislative history when it is available and the context of the legislation. <em>Warfield v. State, </em>315 Md. 474, 499-500, 554 A.2d 1238 (1989).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Considering the ordinary use of the English language, we find the text of \u00a7 3-701 to be clear and unambiguous and supportive of Respondent\u2019s position. Section 3-701 explicitly prohibits an individual from obtaining or attempting to obtain anything of value (including money and property) from another individual with that individual\u2019s consent by, among other things, a <em>\u201cwrongful </em>threat of economic injury.\u201d It is without a doubt that Respondent\u2019s threat of a civil suit against Mr. Elmhirst was a threat to inflict economic injury. Respondent made it abundantly clear that if Mr. Elmhirst did not tender $100,000.00 to Respondent, Mr. Elmhirst would be, among other things, spending his \u201cremaining years ... paying legal fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The question, however, remains whether Respondent\u2019s threats can be viewed as \u201cwrongful\u201d with the meaning of \u00a7 3-701. Unfortunately, Title 7 of the Criminal Law Article does not offer a definition of the relevant terms of \u00a7 3-701. In addition, there are no reported Maryland appellate cases interpreting or applying the phrase \u201cwrongful threat of economic injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Nevertheless, we may discern the meaning of \u201cwrongful\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3-701. <em>See Kushell v. Department of Natural Resources, </em>385 Md. 563, 576-78, 870 A.2d 186, 193-94 (2005) (\u201cStatutory construction begins with the plain language of the statute, and ordinary, popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of its terminology.\u201d). In the ordinary understanding of the English language, \u201cwrongful\u201d is generally defined as \u201ccontrary to law\u201d or \u201cunlawful.\u201d <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th ed.1999). <em>See also </em>Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage (2nd ed.1995) (defining \u201cwrongful\u201d as \u201ccharacterized by unfairness or injus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>tice; contrary to law\u201d); Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary (3rd ed.2002) (defining \u201cwrongful\u201d as \u201cwrong,\u201d \u201cunjust,\u201d or \u201cunlawful\u201d). In determining whether an individual\u2019s conduct is \u201ccontrary to law\u201d or \u201cunlawful,\u201d we look to Maryland law governing the conduct. Specifically, in this case, we look to Maryland law governing an individual\u2019s pursuit of frivolous civil litigation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If, upon examining the law, we find that an individual retains a lawful right to engage in certain conduct, a threat to engage in that conduct unless a payment is made cannot constitute extortion under Maryland law. In other words, if Respondent were subject to criminal penalties for engaging in frivolous litigation, then a threat to resort to meritless legal process reasonably could be considered wrongful under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">In examining Maryland law governing the initiation and/or pursuit of civil actions, it is apparent that there are no criminal sanctions for the filing of frivolous civil actions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Because the pursuit of a civil action, regardless of merit, is not an unlawful act under Maryland law, we are constrained to hold that a threat to litigate a meritless cause of action does not constitute a \u201cwrongful\u201d act under the Maryland extortion statutes. To render a <em>threat </em>of civil action as a potential criminal offense when the actual filing of a meritless civil action is not unlawful will only serve to stifle our judicial system and overwhelm the courts with excessive litigation between feuding parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In addition, our ruling preserves our judiciary\u2019s role as the institution created specifically to redress wrongs and/or grievances and enforce rights between individuals or entities in a fair and lawful matter. Civil actions, regardless of their merit, are a \u201clawful means for people to have their private disputes, including financial disputes, decided when they are unable to decide them on their own.\u201d <em>Rendelman, </em>175 Md. App. at 444, 927 A.2d at 481. We want individuals to utilize the court system to resolve their disputes instead of employing \u201crough justice\u201d techniques, self help measures, or other forms of \u201cstreet justice.\u201d Indeed, we have enacted, within the Maryland Rules, many rules of civil procedure to govern the basic conduct of litigants and attorneys through the course of litigation to ensure our system of justice is both fair and just in procedure and result. To criminalize an individual\u2019s attempt, such as in this case, to resolve a perceived dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>would only serve to disrupt our system of justice. Indeed, we share the views expressed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\">[W]e are troubled by any use of this [ ] criminal statute to punish civil litigants. Sanctions for filing lawsuits ... lead to collateral disputes and a \u2018a piling of litigation on litigation without end.\u2019 Allowing litigants to be charged with extortion would open yet another collateral way for litigants to attack one another. The reality is that litigating parties often accuse each other of bad faith. The prospect of such civil cases ending as criminal prosecutions gives us pause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-5\"><em>United States v. Pendergrafi, </em>297 F.3d 1198, 1207 (2002) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Moreover, our decision is supported by the legislative history of \u00a7 3-7 01. That statute appears to be patterned after the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 (2000), the federal prohibition against extortion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Looking to the federal jurisdictions that have analyzed this same issue under the statutory language of the Hobbs Act, we note that a majority of the federal jurisdictions have held that a threat to file a law suit unless a settlement demand is accepted, regardless of whether the threat was made in good faith, is not a wrongful threat.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>Pendergraft, </em>297 F.3d at 1206; <em>Deck v.

We believe the analytical framework utilized by these courts is consistent with our interpretation of Maryland\u2019s statutory prohibition against extortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">For example, in <em>U.S. v. Pendergraft, </em>297 F.3d 1198 (11th Cir.2002), the defendant/physician operated an abortion clinic in Marion County, Florida, much to the displeasure of many Marion County residents. Dr. Pendelgraff sued the sheriffs department and the county after they denied his request to hire off-duty police officers to protect the clinic. Dr. Pendelgraff alleged that, in denying his request, the county and the sheriffs department violated certain laws. The county asked the doctor to voluntarily dismiss it from the case, asserting that it had not participated in the sheriffs department\u2019s decision to deny the doctor\u2019s security request. Dr. Pendelgraff refused to dismiss the county, and instead threatened to amend his complaint to allege that a county official had threatened violence against the clinic, in violation of federal law, as well as to seek actual and punitive damages. In the alternative, Dr. Pendelgraff offered to not amend the complaint if the county would tender a settlement payment. Unbeknownst to Dr. Pendelgraff, the FBI had been investigating Dr. Pendelgraffs conduct with the county and the sheriffs department, including recording telephone calls. The FBI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>recordings established conclusively that the county official had not made any threats of violence to the doctor. The doctor was then charged with, among other things, extortion under the Hobbs Act. Dr. Pendelgraff and a business associate were convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the convictions. It held that to prove extortion under the Hobbs Act, the government must establish that the defendant(s) used, or attempted to use, a wrongful means to achieve a wrongful end. The Court relied primarily on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s definition of \u201cwrongful\u201d in <em>United States v. Enmons, </em>410 U.S. 396, 93 S.Ct. 1007, 35 L.E.2d 379 (1973). The Court determined that, although the Government had established that the doctor had sought to achieve a wrongful end\u2014to receive money that he was not entitled to\u2014it did not establish that the defendants had used wrongful means. Specifically, the Court held that the means the doctor threatened to employ to receive a settlement payment\u2014that is, civil action\u2014was not wrongful and, therefore, could not constitute extortion. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0q\">A threat to litigate, by itself, is not necessarily \u201cwrongful\u201d \u25a0within the meaning of the Hobbs Act. After all, under our system, parties are encouraged to resort to courts for the redress of wrongs and the enforcement of rights. For this reason, litigants may be sanctioned for only the most frivolous of actions. These sanctions include tort actions for malicious prosecution and abuse of process, and in some cases recovery of attorney\u2019s fees, but even these remedies are heavily disfavored because they discourage the resort to courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">History has taught us that, if people take the law into their own hands, an endless cycle of violence can erupt, and we therefore encourage people to take their problems to court. We trust the courts, and their time-tested procedures, to produce reliable results, separating validity from invalidity, honesty from dishonesty. While our process is sometimes expensive, and occasionally inaccurate, we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>confidence in it. When a citizen avails himself of this process, his doing so is not inherently \u201cwrongful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">297 F.3d at 1206-07 (citations omitted). In addition, the Court also expressed hesitation to extend potential criminal sanctions to a threat of litigation made to a government entity. The Court explained: \u201cThe right of citizens to petition their government for the redress of grievances is fundamental to our constitutional structure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1207.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">We conclude that a threat of litigation, regardless of the merit of the underlying claim, is not unlawful under Maryland law and, therefore, cannot be considered \u201cwrongful\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3-701 of the Maryland Criminal Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Section 3-706</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">As the Court of Special Appeals stated in its opinion: \u201cThe elements of extortion by writing, under [\u00a7 ] 3-706, are that the defendant, 1) with the intent to unlawfully extort property, 2) knowingly send or deliver \u201ca writing threatening to\u201d reveal incriminating or disreputable information about the victim (i.e., blackmail), or to physically, emotionally, or economically injure the victim, or to harm his property.\u201d 175 Md.App. at 449, 927 A.2d at 483. In this case, it is undisputed that Respondent \u201cknowingly sent\u201d to Mr. Elmhirst a letter threatening to economically injure Mr. Elmhirst. The defendant, however, must also intend to \u201cunlawfully extort property.\u201d In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we have held that to undertake the action of extortion, the individual must employ unlawful means to achieve his desired objective. Respondent\u2019s only action was to threaten Mr. Elmhirst with civil litigation. As we have stated in this opinion, a threat of litigation is not an unlawful act that would support a conviction for the crime of extortion. Therefore, as a matter of law, the evidence cannot support the conclusion that Respondent intended to employ an unlawful means to extract $100,000.00 from Mr. Elmhirst.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Section 3-701 was substantively amended in 2007, subsequent to the charges filed in this case. <em>See </em>Chapters 340 and 341, Acts 2007 (effective October 1, 2007). In 2006, the legislature enacted Senate Bill 606, entitled \"Human Trafficking, Extortion, and Involuntary Servitude,\" which, among other things, expanded the crime of extortion to include a prohibition against obtaining (or conspiring to obtain) labor or services of another person by wrongful consent through actual or threatened destruction, concealment, removal, confiscation, or possession of any immigration or government identification document with intent to harm the immigration status. Section 3-701 now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-14\">(b) A person may not obtain or, attempt to obtain, or conspire to obtain money, property, labor, services, or anything of value from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>another person with the person\u2019s consent, if the consent is induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJm\">(1) force or violence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE4\">(2) economic injury; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZQ\">(3) destruction, concealment, removal, confiscation, or possession of any immigration or government identification document with intent to harm the immigration status of another person.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b545-6\">. Our procedure for determining whether an action is \"unlawful\u201d or \"contrary to law\u201d is supported by the test put forth by Professor Stuart P. Green of Louisiana State University Law Center in <em>Theft by Coercion: Extortion, Blackmail, and Hard Bargaining, </em>44 Washburn L.J. 553, 573 -74 (2005). Professor Green contends that \"we should understand extortion to be limited to those threats to engage in conduct that is in fact unlawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 572. In determining what is unlawful, Professor Green suggests that \"we should look to the relevant law governing the conduct threatened\u201d in order to deduce whether a threat of economic injury is unlawful. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\">. There are, however, several \u201cextraordinary\u201d civil remedies for frivolous lawsuits, including Maryland Rule 1-341 and the torts of abuse of process and malicious use of process. Maryland Rule 1-341, for instance, permits a court to award one party the costs of the proceeding(s) as well as reasonable expenses and attorney\u2019s fees if \"the court finds that the conduct of the [offending] party in maintaining or defending any proceeding was in bad faith or without substantial justification.\u201d Md. Rule 1-341 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The tort of abuse of process occurs when a party has \u201cwilfully misused criminal or civil process\u201d against another party for a purpose different than the proceeding's intended purpose and thereby caused that party damage (e.g., arrest, seizure of property, economic injury). <em>Krashes v. White, </em>275 Md. 549, 555, 341 A.2d 798, 802 (1975); <em>see also One Thousand Fleet Ltd. Partnership v.

Rather, these civil consequences require the <em>actual </em>pursuit of litigation to be applicable. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>there was no actual initiation of litigation by Respondent against Mr. Elmhirst. Respondent only threatened to sue Mr. Elmhirst if Mr. Elmhirst did not tender a $100,000.00 payment. Respondent never followed through on his . threat of civil action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b547-7\">. The Hobbs Act defines extortion as \"the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence or fear____\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b547-9\">. The State points out that there are several jurisdictions that have held that threats to initiate meritless litigation may give rise to a violation of the Hobbs Act. <em>See Sosa v. DIRECTV, </em>437 F.3d 923, 939-40 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that threats of litigation may constitute extortion if the threat induces wrongful fear in the individual receiving the threat and the asserted claims rise to the level of a sham); <em>Hall American Ctr. Assoc. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Dick, </em>726 F.Supp. 1083, 1094 (E.D.Mich.1989) (holding that a threat of litigation is extortion under the Hobbs Act provided the individual making the threat knew he or she was not entitled to obtain the damages demanded); <em>United States v. Sturm, </em>870 F.2d 769, 774 (1st Cir.1989) (noting, hypothetically, that a threat of litigation might constitute extortion under the Hobbs Act where the individual making the threat knew he or she was not entitled to the damages claimed). These cases are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>In <em>Sosa, </em>DIRECTV sent demand letters to tens of thousands of individuals it believed had accessed DIRECTV\u2019s satellite television signal illegally. In these letters, DIRECTV accused the letter recipients of violating a federal criminal statute and threatened civil litigation unless the recipients forfeited their DIRECTV equipment and paid DIRECTV an unspecified sum of money. In response, one letter recipient initiated a civil action against DIRECTV, asserting the letter constituted extortion under the Hobbs Act. The Ninth Circuit held that the letters sent by DIRECTV did not constitute extortion because the letters involved reasonably-based legal claims. While the State claims that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding suggests that \"baseless threats of litigation or threats that amount to a sham may support charges of extortion\u201d under the Hobbs Act, the court\u2019s interpretation of \"wrongful\u201d is much broader in scope than our interpretation. We read \"wrongful\u201d in the Maryland statutes to mean \"unlawful\u201d or \"contrary to law,\u201d while the Ninth Circuit\u2019s definition, although not explicitly defined in <em>Sosa, </em>clearly includes more than just \"unlawful\u201d conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\"><em>Hall American Ctr. Assoc. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Dick, supra, </em>is factually distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice. </em>First, in <em>Hall American, </em>the plaintiffs \"alleged [in their complaint] that the defendants affected or attempted to affect interstate commerce by extortion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1094. The defendants moved to dismiss and the court \u201d[v]iewing the allegations as true\u201d examined whether the plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged the predicate acts for a Hobbs Act violation. <em>Id. </em>at 1096. Finding the allegations sufficient, the court held that \"in the context of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations\u2014the defendants filing of lawsuits and notices of lis pendens as part of a scheme to extort ...\u2014suffice to state a claim under the Hobbs Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1097. Thus, the analysis in <em>Hall American </em>was merely a search for the minimum necessary allegations to support a viable civil complaint, and not, as here, a review of a criminal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Second, <em>Hall American </em>concerned lawsuits and notices of lis pendens <em>actually </em>filed \"as part of an extortionate scheme to obtain property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1097 (emphasis in the original). \"The allegations in [the] case [went] further than the simple threat to sue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plaintiffs had alleged in their complaint that the defendants filed lawsuits and notices of lis pendens as part of their scheme to extort desired property owned by the plaintiffs and interfere with the plaintiffs\u2019 other business ventures, attempted to involve the United States Attorney in the dispute, and harassed third parties that were involved with the desired property. By contrast, in the instant matter, Respondent did not actually and systematically file suits, but only threatened to file a civil action against Mr. Elmhirst. Additionally, it is doubtful that <em>Hall American </em>remains persuasive authority because in 1994, the Sixth Circuit issued its opinion in <em>Vemco, Inc. v. Camardella, </em>23 F.3d 129 (6th Cir.1994), holding that a threat of litigation, even if made in bad faith, does not constitute extortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Finally, <em>United States v. Sturm, supra, </em>is factually distinguishable and not consistent with our analysis. Sturm was convicted of attempted extortion after demanding $20,000 from a bank for the return of property (logbooks) that legally belonged to the bank. <em>Id. </em>at 769-70. Sturm never threatened litigation, but instead refused to turn over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>logbooks for a plane the bank had repossessed. <em>Id. </em>The logbooks, in conjunction with the plane, were worth approximately $45,000 to the bank. <em>Id. </em>at 770. The court vacated Sturm\u2019s conviction in part because \u201cthe trial court did not instruct the jury that in order to convict the defendant of attempted extortion, it would have to find that Sturm knew that he was not legally entitled to [the $20,000 as a fee] to help [the bank] recover the logbooks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 775. In arriving at this conclusion, the court posited a hypothetical regarding parties to a contract threatening litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 774. The hypothetical, as such, is dicta and is not, as the State argues in the present case, a test. In any event, we do not adopt the hypothetical in our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
