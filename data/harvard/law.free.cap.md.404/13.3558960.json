Clark<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (hereinafter \u201cClark\u201d or \u201cthe respondent\u201d), in 2003 was appointed the Police Commissioner of Baltimore City by the Mayor of the City of Baltimore (hereinafter \u201cMayor\u201d) and confirmed by the City Council. Prior to his confirmation, Clark and the Mayor entered into a contract, denominated \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d (MOU), \u201cto employ the services of Clark as the Police Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>missioner of Baltimore City.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The contract, which purported to be for \u201cthe remaining term of the last Commissioner until June 30, 2008,\u201d addressed the terms and conditions of Clark\u2019s employment as Police Commissioner. One term related to his removal as Commissioner. Albeit in the context of \u201cAdditional Compensation/Severance Pay,\u201d the parties acknowledged, in Section 2. A. of the MOU,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the applicability of PLL \u00a7 16-5(e) to the removal of the Commissioner and denied any intention to \u201caffect the rights of the Mayor in that respect.\u201d In another section, however, the agreement introduced and prescribed another method of removal, one not contemplated or addressed in the Code of Public Local Laws, termination without cause. Section 12. of the MOU provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">\u201cEither party may terminate this contract at any time, by giving forty-five (45) days prior written notice to the other. Notwithstanding the above sentence the provisions of Section 2B [<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] remain in force.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Clark commenced his role as Police Commissioner following the signing of the MOU. A little more than a year and a half later, on November 10, 2004, however, \u201cpursuant to Sections 12 and 13 of the Memorandum of Understanding,\u201d he was relieved of his command.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The letter providing the requisite forty-five days notice of the termination of the MOU and, thus, terminating his tenure as Police Commissioner, was delivered to Clark by the City Solicitor, and, as relevant, advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJn\">\u201cThis notice is sent on behalf of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (the \u201cCity\u201d) pursuant to Sections 12 and 13 of the Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) between you and the City dated February 19, 2003. This notice shall serve as the City\u2019s 45-day notice of termination of your employment. Thus, your employment shall terminate 45 days from today. However, as the Mayor announced this morning, you have been relieved of all official duties as of 8:30 a.m., November 10, 2004, and therefore, your further access, if any, to Police Department facilities, equipment, or documents will be subject to the specific, prior authorization of Acting or Interim Police Commissioner Hamm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Clark filed, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, a verified complaint, naming as defendants, Mayor Martin O\u2019Malley and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>which, in addition to seeking reinstatement as Police Commissioner and monetary damages, he requested declaratory and injunctive relief. After some preliminary skirmishing, consisting of the denial of injunctive relief and the denial of the petitioner\u2019s dispositive motion for summary judgment, Clark filed an amended complaint. In response, the petitioner again moved for summary judgment. Following a hearing, the Circuit Court granted summary judgment to the petitioners, concluding that the MOU was a valid and unambiguous contract, pursuant to which Clark had been lawfully terminated, upon notice properly given pursuant to paragraphs 12 and 13 thereof. The Circuit Court also issued a declaratory judgment, in which, consistently, it declared that the Mayor properly had terminated Clark, without cause, on proper notice. Clark immediately noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">The intermediate appellate court reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court. <em>Clark v. O\u2019Malley, </em>169 Md.App. 408, 901 A.2d 279 (2006). Concluding that the trial court erred in holding, as a matter of law, that the MOU was valid and enforceable, it held that the Mayor did not have the authority to remove a Police Commissioner pursuant to a contract providing for removal without cause, the Mayor\u2019s ability to remove the Police Commissioner having been limited by the General Assembly, 169 Md.App. at 439, 901 A.2d at 297, and, therefore, the removal provisions of the MOU were invalid. The Mayor and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore timely filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court, which we granted. <em>Baltimore v. Clark, </em>395 Md. 56, 909 A.2d 259 (2006).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The arguments advanced by the petitioners to challenge the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals are multi-faceted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>First, noting that the parties in fact entered into an employment relationship via contract, in which there was \u201can extensive set of ... promises that each made to the other\u201d and, particularly, that Clark was represented by counsel of his choice throughout the process, they argue that \u201cpublic policy\u201d is not a valid basis for invalidating the provisions of the contract at issue in this case. This is so, the petitioners submit, because of \u201cthe profound importance of permitting individuals to \u2018exercise broad powers to structure their own affairs by making legally enforceable promises, a concept which lies at the heart of the freedom of contract principle,\u2019 \u201d citing and quoting <em>Maryland-National Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Washington Nat\u2019l Arena, </em>282 Md. 588, 606, 386 A.2d 1216, 1229 (1978), and because \u201c\u2018Maryland courts have been hesitant to strike down voluntary bargains on public policy grounds, <em>doing so only in those cases where the challenged agreement is patently offensive to the public good, that is, where \u201cthe common sense of the entire community would ... pronounce it\u201d invalid. </em>\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Estate of Woods, Weeks &amp; Co., </em>52 Md. 520, 536, 1879 WL 4349, *8 (1879) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Next, the petitioners acknowledge that Section 16-5(e) of the Public Local Laws of Baltimore City prescribes a list of enumerated causes for which the Baltimore City Police Chief \u201cis subject to removal,\u201d but they do not concede that the section or the enumeration is dispositive. The petitioners argue, instead, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">\u201c[t]he provision does not ... prohibit the City from entering into a contract with a prospective police commissioner that contains terms of removal additional to those that it identifies. In other words, \u00a7 16-5(e), by its terms, establishes a baseline (\u2018is subject to removal\u2019). The statutory provision is not prohibitive, nor does it abolish parties\u2019 right to contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">This is particularly the case, they posit, noting the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 characterization of the pertinent contractual provision as \u201cexpanding] the Mayor\u2019s removal authority,\u201d <em>Clark, </em>169 Md.App. at 439, 901 A.2d at 297, when there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>\u201cactual conflict\u201d between the statutory and contractual provisions. The petitioners rely on <em>Stearman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>381 Md. 436, 455-57, 849 A.2d 539, 550-52 (2004) and <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>307 Md. 631, 637, 516 A.2d 586, 589 (1986), Maryland cases in which this Court refused to invalidate an exclusion that was not expressly authorized by statute, and <em>County of Giles v. Wines, </em>262 Va. 68, 546 S.E.2d 721, 723 (2001); <em>Thompson v. Adams, </em>268 F.3d 609, 612-13 (8th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The petitioners also argue that, \u201ceven if the Court were to accept Clark\u2019s interpretation of [Public Local Law, \u00a7 16\u20145(e)], the Court should be dubious of a claim that a provision of the Public Local Laws reflecting the specific concerns of antebellum and Civil War-era governance in Baltimore accurately reflects the current \u2018public policy\u2019 of the City or the State.\u201d Noting the office of a public local law is to address a matter of governance peculiarly local in nature, quoting <em>Norris v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>172 Md. 667, 681, 192 A. 531, 537-38 (1937), and that such laws, by constitutional provision, may be repealed and amended by the Mayor and City Council, Maryland Constitution, Article XI-A, \u00a7 3,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> they suggest that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the contractual provision may well be \u201ca more accurate reflection of current public policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Decrying the respondent\u2019s argument that, because the Baltimore City Police Department is a State, rather than a City, agency, the Police Commissioner may be removed only for \u201cofficial misconduct, malfeasance, inefficiency or incompetency,\u201d as amounting to anti-democratic, anti-civilian control, the petitioners finally urge that it be given \u201cespecially close scrutiny.\u201d More particularly, they submit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">\u201cIt is of course true, as the Court of Specials recognized, that the Baltimore Police Department remains an agency of state government for many state law purposes. <em>See, e.g., Clea v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>312 Md. 662[, 668, 541 A.2d 1303, 1306] (1988); <em>Baltimore Police Dept. v. Cherkes, </em>140 Md.App. 282[, 303-04, 780 A.2d 410, 422-23] (2001). But it is also true, as a matter of now long-standing practice, that the State undertakes virtually no oversight or supervision of the Police Department. This is not a criticism of the State. The disappearance of oversight by the State became an essentially unavoidable reality after (1) in 1966, the City became the agency of government responsible for appropriating money for the operation of the police department, <em>see Mayor &amp; City Council v. Silver, </em>263 Md. 439, 450-51[, 283 A.2d 788, 794] (1971); and (2) in 1976, the Mayor became responsible for appointing the Police Commissioner, <em>see Clea, </em>312 Md. at 669[, 541 A.2d at 1306]. What remained, particularly after 1976, was an institutional configuration in which only city government could effectively and meaningfully oversee the Police Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">\u201cThe deeply troubling (as well as anti-democratic) consequence of Clark\u2019s argument, if accepted by this Court, is that the Police Commissioner will not be subject to any meaningful civilian control or oversight. City government would be blocked from overseeing the Department. It would be unrealistic to expect that the State would return to fill the void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Article XI-A of the Maryland Constitution authorizes counties within Maryland and Baltimore City to elect a \u201ccharter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>board\u201d and to \u201cprepare ... a charter or form of government,\u201d through which that board is to act. Md. Const, art. XI-A, \u00a7 1. These charters, as adopted, \u201cbecome the law of said City or County, subject only to the Constitution and Public General Laws of this State, and any public local laws inconsistent with the provisions of said charter and any former charter of the City of Baltimore or County shall be ... repealed.\u201d Md. Const, art. XI-A, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The Charter of Baltimore City (\u201cCharter\u201d), most recently ratified in 1994, provides that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in the Charter, the Mayor shall have the sole power of appointment of all municipal officers, subject to confirmation by the City Council by a majority vote of its members\u201d Charter, art. IV, \u00a7 6(a). The same article also provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV\">\u201cThe Mayor shall have the power to remove at pleasure all municipal officers, except members of boards and commissions established by Charter or other law, appointed by the Mayor in the manner prescribed in this section and confirmed by the City Council; provided, however, that appointees holding office pursuant to the provisions of the Charter relating to the Civil Service may be removed from office only in accordance with such provisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Charter, art. IV, \u00a7 6(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">There is one reference to the Baltimore Police Commissioner in the Charter of Baltimore City. It occurs in Article II, which provides that the Mayor and City Council</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">\u201chave and [may] exercise within the limits of Baltimore City all the power commonly known as the Police Power to the same extent as the State has or could exercise said power within said limits; provided, however, that no ordinance of the City or act of any municipal officer shall conflict, impede, obstruct, hinder or interfere with the powers of the Police Commissioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Charter, art. II, \u00a7 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">This is reflective of the fact that the Baltimore Police Department is not an agency of the City of Baltimore and has not been for some time, <em>see </em>Acts of 1860, ch. 7, \u00a7 14; <em>Mayor &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number><em>City Council of Baltimore v. State, </em>15 Md. 376, 454-55, 1860 WL 3363, *35 (1860) (upholding legislative act that placed the Baltimore City Police Department under the control of Police Commissioners appointed by the State\u2019s General Assembly<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>), and suggests the reason therefor. <em>See Upshur v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>94 Md. 743, 756-57, 51 A. 953, 958 (1902) (noting that \u201cduring [the] period when the police force was wholly under the.control of the municipality, the city authorities failed to suppress disorder ... \u201d). <em>See also Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Silver, </em>263 Md. 439, 447, 283 A.2d 788, 792 (1971) (noting that in 1860, the General Assembly of Maryland was \u201cintent upon taking the City of Baltimore out of the business of controlling civil disorders\u201d). Pursuant to Acts of 1860, ch. 7, the Baltimore Police Department was removed completely from the control of the city government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ5\">\u201cThe police board was created, and its members, and the force enrolled by them, were made state officers; and the city was denied, in the most positive manner, any right to interfere with or control the policemen. The underlying purpose was to deprive the city of all power over the police.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak\"><em>Upshur, </em>94 Md. at 756, 51 A. at 958.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The power to remove the commissioners \u201cfor official misconduct\u201d originally resided with the General Assembly from 1867 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>until 1900. <em>Cull v. Wheltle, </em>114 Md. 58, 78, 78 A. 820, 821 (1910). If the General Assembly was not in session, the Governor was empowered to remove a commissioner convicted of any felony before a court of law, and to appoint a successor to such delinquent commissioner until the next session of the Legislature. <em>Id. </em>at 78-79, 78 A. at 821. Thereafter, by chapter 15 of the Acts of 1900, the Governor was empowered to appoint, with the advice and consent of the Senate, the three police commissioners. Amending then Article 4, \u00a7 740 of the Code of Public Local Laws, that Act also made the commissioners subject to removal by the Governor \u201cfor official misconduct or incompetency, in the manner provided by law in the case of other civil officers\u201d and entrusted to the Governor, \u201cin case of the death, resignation, removal or disqualification of any commissioner\u201d and \u201csubject to the provisions of [\u00a7 740], and of the Constitution of the state,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the appointment of their successor \u201cfor the remainder of the term so vacated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79, 78 A. at 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The Baltimore City Police Department was placed under the supervision and direction of a Police Commissioner by the Acts of 1966, ch. 203. Section 16-4 of the Code of Public Local Laws, thereby enacted by the General Assembly, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">\u201cThe affairs and operations of the department shall be supervised and directed by a commissioner of police, who shall function as the chief police and executive officer of the department, and be known as the Police Commissioner of Baltimore City.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Authority was given to the Governor for the Police Commissioner\u2019s appointment, \u00a7 16-5(a) (\u201c[t]he Police Commissioner of Baltimore shall be appointed by the Governor of Maryland for a term of six years\u201d) and removal. Section 16-5(e) (\u201cSaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Commissioner shall be subject to removal by the Governor for official misconduct, malfeasance, inefficiency or incompetency, including prolonged illness, in the manner provided by law in the case of civil officers.\u201d). Significantly, \u00a7 16\u20142(a) was unambiguous in stating that \u201c[t]he Police Department of Baltimore City is hereby constituted and established as an agency and instrumentality of the State of Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The power to appoint and remove the Baltimore City Police Commissioner was shifted, in 1976, from the Governor to the Mayor of Baltimore City. By Laws of Maryland 1976, ch. 920, \u00a7 16-5(a) of the Code of Public Local Laws was amended to provide for appointment by \u201cthe Mayor of Baltimore City, subject to confirmation by the City Council by a majority vote of its members, for a term of six years,\u201d and \u00a7 16-5(e) was amended to substitute \u201cMayor\u201d for \u201cGovernor.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>. Despite these changes, and others not here relevant,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u00a7 16-2, which designates the Baltimore Police Department as an agency of the State, remained, and still remains, unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The decisions of this Court concerning the liability of the City of Baltimore for the acts, activity and inaction of the Police Department, over which it has no power, have been consistent and unequivocal, premised on, and holding uniformly, that the Baltimore Police Department is an entity of the State, and not of the City of Baltimore. <em>Silver, </em>263 Md. at 449-50, 283 A.2d at 793-94 (noting that, by making the Police Department a state agency, with \u201ccontrol of the department ... vested in the State with immediate supervision and direction of the department under a police commissioner who is appointed by the Governor,\u201d the Legislature \u201cremoved the incongruous imposition of liability of the City for the acts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>the police department over which it had no control\u201d); <em>Green v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City, </em>181 Md. 372, 376, 30 A.2d 261, 263 (1943) (noting that \u201c[a]s the police department is an agency of the state, and not of the city, the effect of any action against it would be against the state\u201d), <em>Taxicab Company of Baltimore City v. City of Baltimore, </em>118 Md. 359, 367, 84 A. 548, 550 (1912) <em>(citing Sinclair v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>59 Md. 592, 597, 1883 WL 6071, *3 (1883), in noting that \u201c \u2018the power of the city government is confined to mere matter of regulation by proper ordinance ... the enforcement of the regulation is entirely dependent upon a separate and independent police department, over which the city has no control\u2019 \u201d). Additionally, in <em>Clea v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>312 Md. 662, 668-69, 541 A.2d 1303, 1306 (1988), this Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\">\u201cBy Ch. 367 of the Acts of 1867, the General Assembly of Maryland made the Police Department of Baltimore City a state agency; its officials and officers were designated as state officers. Since that time, this Court has consistently held that Baltimore City should not be regarded as the employer of members of the Baltimore City Police Department for purposes of tort liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">\u201cIt is true that, by Ch. 920 of the Acts of 1976, the General Assembly transferred the power to appoint the Baltimore City Police Commissioner from the Governor to the Mayor of Baltimore City. At the same time, however, the General Assembly maintained the express designation of the Baltimore City Police Department as a <em>state </em>rather than a local government agency. Furthermore, the General Assembly, and not the Baltimore City Council, has continued to be the legislative body enacting significant legislation governing the Baltimore City Police Department.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">(Internal citations and footnotes omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">As we have seen, notwithstanding the Mayor\u2019s role in appointing and removing the City\u2019s Police Commissioner, the Baltimore City Police Department is a state agency. Accordingly, the Mayor\u2019s authority in that regard is not inherent. Nor is its basis the City Charter-the power given the Mayor, by Article IV, is to appoint and then to remove, \u201cat pleasure,\u201d certain \u201cmunicipal officers,\u201d that Article quite clearly, if not explicitly, does not refer to the Baltimore City Police Commissioner. Rather, the Mayor has no more authority to remove the Police Commissioner than did the Governor, to whose authority he simply acceded. Before 1976, when that accession occurred, the Police Commissioner could have been removed by the Governor only for cause, \u201cfor official misconduct, malfeasance, inefficiency or incompetency, including prolonged illness, in the manner provided by law in the case of civil officers.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> After 1976, when the Mayor assumed the appoint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>ing and removal responsibility, removal required the same cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">For the petitioners, this does not end the inquiry. Viewing the provisions of \u00a7 16\u20145(e) of the Public Local Laws as a \u201cbaseline\u201d for, rather than a prohibition on, the Mayor\u2019s removal power, they argue that the parties could, as they did, contract for a more favorable, to the Mayor, removal provision, that the law does not \u201cprohibit the City from entering into a contract with a prospective police commissioner that contains terms of removal additional to those that it identifies.\u201d The petitioners rely, as indicated, on <em>County of Giles v. Wines, </em>262 Va. 68, 546 S.E.2d 721 (2001) and <em>Thompson v. Adams, </em>268 F.3d 609, 612-13 (8th Cir.2001)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> for the proposition, \u201cin employment eases involving analogous facts, courts in other jurisdictions have declined to hold that municipal ordinances and municipal employment manuals enumerating specific causes for which an employee may be terminated, but not stating that those causes are the \u2018only\u2019 causes for termination, preclude the municipality from terminating an employee for causes other than those enumerated, or for no cause.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>petitioners urge that the same result is appropriate in this case, notwithstanding that, here, unlike in those cases, it is a statute that is being interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">In <em>County of Giles, </em>the issue was whether sufficient evidence had been presented to support a jury finding that the plaintiff had an employment contract terminable at will. <em>Id. </em>at 721. The municipal employee plaintiff was employed, and had been for two years, as a recreation area manager, a position which he performed well and for which he received significant pay increases. When four new Board of Supervisor members were elected, he was fired, without notice and without being told the reason for the termination. <em>Id. </em>at 722. A personnel policy that he argued was applicable provided: \u201c[a]n employee may be discharged for inefficiency, insubordination, misconduct, or other just cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff claimed he had been terminated without cause, in violation of that personnel policy, which, he interpreted as requiring that termination be for \u201cjust cause.\u201d The Supreme Court of Virginia did not agree. It first pointed out that, \u201cIn Virginia, an employment relationship is presumed to be at-will, which means that the employment term extends for an indefinite period and may be terminated by the employer or employee for any reason upon reasonable notice.\u201d 546 S.E.2d at 723. Then, noting that \u201c[tjhere is simply no language in this section that limits the County\u2019s power to discharge an employee without cause,\u201d 546 S.E.2d at 724, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">\u201cThe language upon which Wines relies states that an \u2018employee may be discharged for inefficiency, insubordination, misconduct, or other just cause.\u2019 This sentence does not state that an employee <em>shall only </em>be discharged for inefficiency, insubordination, misconduct, or other just cause; nor does it state that an employee will not be discharged without just cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">546 S.E.2d at 723 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">In <em>Thompson, </em>the plaintiff was the former City street superintendent of Bull Shoals, Arkansas, and, a twenty year City employee. 268 F.3d at 611. He had been fired by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Mayor, with the support of the Council, after his wife addressed the Council with respect to various Council members\u2019 actions, which she characterized as unlawful. 268 F.3d at 610-611. Challenging his firing, the plaintiff alleged, in addition to retaliation, violation of his \u201cdue process rights under the fourteenth amendment by firing him without notice, a statement of reasons, and a pre-termination hearing, and that the post-termination hearing that he received was inadequate because of bias on the part of the mayor and the council members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611. Acknowledging that Arkansas law customarily considered employment relationships to be \u201cat will,\u201d that they do not contemplate \u201cfor cause\u201d firing, he relied on the City\u2019s employment policies and procedures manual, which, he argued, \u201cis an \u2018independent source,\u2019 ... that establishes a property interest for a city employee in his or her job.\u201d 268 F.3d at 611-612.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">The employment manual, to be sure, stated, in the \u201cemployment policies\u201d section, that the City is an \u201cat-will employer ... [and] may terminate the employment relationship at any time for any reason with the understanding that [the City] has [no] obligation to base that decision on anything but ... intent not to continue the employment relationship\u201d and that \u201c[n]o policies, comments, or writings made [in this manual] or during the employment process shall be construed in any way to waive [the] provision\u2019 regarding \u2018at-will\u2019 employment.\u201d 268 F.3d at 612. On the other hand, the manual stated that the City would give written notice of disciplinary action to be, or already, taken, that each employee is entitled to review of any disciplinary action and \u201cthat when the city intends to fire an employee, the city will provide \u2018written reasons that can be supported at a pre-termination hearing.\u2019 \u201d Id The plaintiff argued that these provisions amount to a repudiation of \u201cat will\u201d employment \u201cand thus establish the necessary property interest for him.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The court rejected this argument. Noting that \u201cunless an employment manual contains an express provision that the employer may not fire an employee except for cause, the employment relationship is \u2018at will,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c[a]n implied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>promise is not enough,\u201d 268 F.3d. at 612 (citations omitted), it held, as the petitioner points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">\u201cNeither a list of grounds for firing an employee, ... nor a description of increasingly more serious disciplinary actions to which an employee may be subject, ... nor the delineation of a process for review of disciplinary actions, ... nor a reference to a mandatory pre-termination hearing, ... is sufficient to alter an employee\u2019s \u2018at-will\u2019 status in Arkansas. In addition, the presence of language in an employment manual asserting the employer\u2019s right to fire an employee at any time is even stronger evidence that the manual creates no guarantee for employees that they will be fired only for cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">268 F.3d at 612-13. (Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The petitioners conclude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">\u201cIf a list of causes justifying removal is insufficient to trump a general presumption of at-will employment at common law, as in <em>County of Giles, </em>then such a list is certainly insufficient to trump an unambiguous contractual provision, individually negotiated by the employee, <em>and specifically providing for termination without cause. </em>Clark\u2019s case is substantially weaker, in other words, than that of the employee in <em>County of Giles.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Also urging this Court to be \u201cdubious of a claim that a provision of the Public Local Laws reflecting the specific concerns of Antebellum and Civil War-era governance in Baltimore accurately reflects the current \u2018public policy5 of the City or the State,\u201d they note that both the Mayor and the Baltimore City Council believed it to be in the City\u2019s best interest, and thus sought, to \u201cretain\u201d the right to terminate the Police Commissioner at will. The petitioners query, therefore, whether, \u201con a subject matter now within the purview of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, \u2018public policy\u2019 should not reside with the considered decision of the Mayor and City Council in 2004, and not with a statutory enactment on the same subject rooted in the specific concerns of antebellum Baltimore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>We do not agree. The removal power, as articulated in \u00a7 16\u20145(e), we hold, is not modifiable by a MOU, and, in particular, the contractual language at issue in the case <em>sub judice. </em>In that regard, we reiterate, \u201ca contract conflicting with public policy set forth in a statute is invalid to the extent of the conflict between the contract and that policy.\u201d <em>Medex v. McCabe, </em>372 Md. 28, 39, 811 A.2d 297, 304 (2002). <em>See also State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>307 Md. 631, 643, 516 A.2d 586, 592 (1986) (holding that a contractual provision that violates public policy is invalid, but only to the extent of conflict between stated public policy and contractual provision). Thus, because the provision of the MOU that states that \u201c[e]ither party may terminate this contract at any time, by giving forty-five (45) days prior written notice to the other,\u201d without need to provide cause, conflicts with \u00a7 16-5(e) of the Public Local Laws, that provision, pursuant to which the Mayor acted to terminate Clark, is unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">When this Court seeks to ascertain the meaning of a statutory or constitutional provision, it first looks to the \u201cnormal, plain meaning of the language,\u201d and, if the language is clear and unambiguous, it will not look further. <em>Bienkowski v. Brooks, </em>386 Md. 516, 536-537, 873 A.2d 1122, 1134-1135 (2005). <em>See also Comptroller v. Phillips, </em>384 Md. 583, 591, 865 A.2d 590, 594 (2005) (\u201cIf the plain language of the statute is unambiguous and is consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, we give effect to the statute as it is written.\u201d); <em>Lee v. Cline, </em>384 Md. 245, 256-257, 863 A.2d 297, 304 (2004); <em>Collins v.

Section 16-5(e) articulates the reasons for which the Police Commissioner is \u201csubject to removal by the Mayor.\u201d The reasons it enumerates, \u201cfor official misconduct, malfeasance, inefficiency or incompetency, including prolonged illness,\u201d are exclusive; \u201csubject to\u201d simply does not mean and is not the equivalent of, \u201cinter alia.\u201d Section 16-5(e) simply does not contemplate that there will be other reasons for termination, and thus does not permit the Mayor to add any, i.e. extend its reach. Similarly, therefore, adding three other reasons for removal for just cause, that of gross negligence, substance abuse, and indictment of felonies or any other crimes of moral turpitude or theft, to those already statutorily enumerated represents a further extension or expansion, of \u00a7 16-5(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>While we acknowledge the fact that the case <em>sub judice </em>and the cases on which the petitioner relies involve an employment relationship, we do not agree that the facts are \u201canalogous.\u201d At the outset, the context of this case must not be forgotten, because it is significantly important: the Police Commissioner remains an employee and agent of the State of Maryland even though the Mayor of Baltimore appoints the Police Commissioner and the City Council confirms. There is a real difference, we believe, in the situation in which that employment relationship, defined by statute, here Public Local Law \u00a7 16-2, as requiring termination for cause, is sought to be transformed into one which is terminable, contractually and without cause, simply on the basis that the statute is silent on the point and that where an employment relationship, that is, or is presumed to be, \u201cat will,\u201d is sought to be converted, on the basis of statements, including the listing of causes for termination, appearing in a personnel manual, into one requiring cause to terminate. The distinction is made even more stark when it is considered that the Public Local Law provision implicates another State statute, \u00a7 3-307 of the State Government Article, prescribing, in some detail, the procedure for the removal of a civil officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Thus, <em>County of Giles </em>and <em>Thompson </em>may well have been correctly decided, but they are not applicable, or persuasive with regard to the interpretation of \u00a7 16-5(e) of the Public Local Laws. That section does not, and did not, authorize termination for \u201cany reason.\u201d Rather, it very clearly made \u201c[t]he Police Commissioner ... subject to removal by the Mayor for official misconduct, malfeasance, inefficiency or incompetency, including prolonged illness, in the manner provided by law in the case of civil officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">To be sure, the petitioners were anxious, perhaps understandably so, to have the right to terminate the Police Commissioner without cause. That desire, however, does not determine the legality or appropriateness of their actions to terminate him. As indicated, the Baltimore City Police Department is, and has been for some time, a State agency. Although the General Assembly, in 1976, transferred the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>appointment power with regard to the head of that department from a State official, the Governor, to a City official, the Mayor, it is significant that that is as far as the General Assembly went. Thus, while the Department may be located in Baltimore City and the Mayor and City Council have an interest in what public policy should be with respect to that Department, it is the \u201cconsidered opinion\u201d of the General Assembly, reflected in the legislation that became \u00a7 16\u20145(e), not that of the City Council that is dispositive of that issue. \u201cIt is, after all, the General Assembly that sets the public policy of the State.... \u201d <em>Rausch v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>388 Md. 690, 716, 882 A.2d 801, 816 (2005). <em>See Harrison v. Montgomery County Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 442, 460, 456 A.2d 894, 903 (1983) (\u201cWe have always recognized that declaration of the public policy of Maryland is normally the function of the General Assembly\u201d); <em>Felder v. Butler, </em>292 Md. 174, 183, 438 A.2d 494, 499 (1981) (\u201cThe Court has always recognized that declaration of public policy is normally the function of the legislative branch of government\u201d); <em>Adler v. American Standard Corp., </em>291 Md. 31, 45, 432 A.2d 464, 472 (1981). It is well settled that, where the General Assembly has announced public policy, the Court will decline to enter the public policy debate, even when it is the common law that is at issue and the Court certainly has the authority to change the common law. <em>Adler v.

Adams, </em>268 F.3d 609, 612-13 (8th Cir.2001), the court in that case opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-10\">\"Defendant\u2019s manual has a section entitled 'Involuntary Termination,' and it states only that 'an employee may be discharged for cause.\u2019 ... Despite what plaintiff alleges, ... defendants\u2019 manual does not state that plaintiff may be terminated <em>only </em>for cause. The Court finds that the statement that an employee may be terminated for cause leaves open the possibility that the employee may also be terminated without cause, and thus the employment-at-will doctrine is not restricted. Defendants\u2019 manual simply does not guarantee that an employee will be discharged only for cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b64-6\">. The petitioners suggest that it is not the public policy of this State to \"disfavor\u201d civilian control of the Baltimore Police Department. With that proposition, we agree. We do not agree, however, that a rejection of the petitioners\u2019 argument \"strips the City of authority to oversee the Police Department and its Commissioner by denying the City the authority to bargain with a candidate for the position of Police Commissioner, and to set the most fundamental accountability term in any employment contract-the term that governs how the employment relationship may be terminated.\u201d We do not believe that the <em>sine qua non </em>of oversight is the ability to fire without cause. The causes enumerated simply are not so restrictive as to interfere with or prevent oversight.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
