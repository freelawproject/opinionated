The second part explains the Court\u2019s reasons for denying earlier the defendant\u2019s Motion to Strike Appearance of the crime victim\u2019s attorney in the appeal. In the third and final part of this opinion, we shall address the merits of the issues for which certiorari was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">On 10 April 1998, Sharden Busie Hoile, Petitioner/Cross-Respondent here, pled guilty in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to a charge of first degree assault of Ms. Tracy L. Palmer, a former romantic partner. Hoile was sentenced to 15 years in prison, which was suspended in favor of five years of probation. On 18 May 2001, Hoile was found to have violated that probation and therefore was ordered by the trial judge to serve the original 15 year sentence concurrently with a sentence Hoile then was serving for a separate conviction in the Circuit Court for Calvert County.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hoile filed a motion for reconsideration of sentence in the Prince George\u2019s County case.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">On 10 December 2004, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County held a hearing on Hoile\u2019s motion. The motion was granted. As a result, Hoile ostensibly was to be committed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene for substance abuse treatment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County forwarded a copy of the order imposing the altered sentence to the Circuit Court for Calvert County. The Circuit Court for Calvert County declined, however, to reconsider Hoile\u2019s sentence in its case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This result occasioned the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to hold another hearing on 8 April 2005, at Hoile\u2019s request, to consider the effect on its 10 December 2004 ruling of the refusal by the Calvert County court to alter its sentence of imprisonment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, upon reflection, again modified the sentence in its case, the present one, to time served and placed Hoile on five years of supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">On 8 December 2005, Ms. Palmer wrote a letter to the trial judge in Hoile\u2019s case in Prince George\u2019s County stating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>she had not been <em>notified</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>of the 10 December 2004 or 8 April 2005 hearings, although she previously requested such notification in writing in a letter dated 2 July 1998 to the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney who prosecuted the case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court held a hearing on 10 February 2006, where Palmer was represented by counsel, and found as a fact that the victim had not been notified properly, as required by Maryland Code (2001, 2007 Cum.Supp.), Criminal Procedure Article,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 11-104,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 11-503,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>and Maryland Rule 4-345(e)(2) and (f).2 ********<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On Palmer\u2019s motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>the trial court vacated the altered sentence imposed on 8 April 2005.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>(e) Modification Upon Motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-17\">(2) Notice to Victims. The State\u2019s Attorney shall give notice to each victim and victim\u2019s representative who has filed a Crime Victim Notification Request form pursuant to Code, Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 11-104 or who has submitted a written request to the State's Attorney to be notified of subsequent proceedings as provided under Code, Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 11-503 that states (A) that a motion to modify or reduce a sentence has been filed; (B) that the motion has been denied without a hearing or the date, time, and location of the hearing; and (C) if a hearing is to be held, that each victim or victim\u2019s representative may attend and testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-26\">(f) Open Court Hearing. The court may modify, reduce, correct, or vacate a sentence only on the record in open court, after hearing from the defendant, the State, and from each victim or victim\u2019s representative who requests an opportunity to be heard. The defendant may waive the right to be present at the hearing. No hearing shall be held on a motion to modify or reduce the sentence until the court determines that the notice requirements in subsection (e)(2) of this Rule have been satisfied. If the court grants the motion, the court ordinarily shall prepare and file or dictate into the record a statement setting forth the reasons on which the ruling is based.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>After the court vacated the reconsideration of sentence, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">Assistant State\u2019s Attorney: And may I inquire of the Court procedurally, now that the sentence has been vacated, original sentence stands. Will a new order need to be issued to the Department of Corrections so that regardless of Mr. Hoile\u2019s status in his Calvert County case, that he is\u2014 he is incarcerated under the sentence in this matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeu\">Counsel for Palmer: A new commitment order will need to be filed Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">Court: The Clerk agrees with you, and I\u2019m sure she will look into that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">In effect, the vacation of Hoile\u2019s reconsidered sentence reinstated the immediate prior sentence (the one imposed upon finding a violation of probation), at least until the trial judge were to act anew on the now resurrected motion to reconsider sentence. Before the judge could move on to revisit the merits of Hoile\u2019s Motion to Reconsider Sentence at the 10 February 2005 hearing, Hoile asked for a continuance. One was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">On 13 February 2006, a new commitment order was filed by the Clerk of the Circuit Court, committing Hoile to the Division of Correction for the remainder of the 15 year sentence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Hoile filed an immediate appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In addition, Hoile filed a motion to exclude Palmer\u2019s participation, individually or through counsel, as a party to the proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court originally denied the motion, without preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>dice, permitting Hoile to seek the same relief in his reply brief or at oral argument. Counsel for Palmer filed a brief (accepted by the intermediate appellate court) and participated in oral argument in the Court of Special Appeals as if a party. Although Hoile, in his reply brief, renewed his request to strike the appearance of Palmer\u2019s counsel, the Court of Special Appeals dismissed the appeal without acting on the motion. The intermediate appellate court, in an unreported opinion, dismissed the appeal as premature because the trial judge in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County had not acted yet on the revived motion to reconsider sentence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">On 5 December 2007, we granted Hoile\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari and the State\u2019s Cross-petition. The Petition and Cross-petition collectively raise four questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">1. Did the Court of Special Appeals err by dismissing Petitioner\u2019s appeal from an order of the trial court reimposing Petitioner\u2019s sentence of incarceration where the trial court previously had granted [Hoile\u2019s] motion for reconsideration and modified his sentence to probation but then vacated that sentence at the request of the victim who alleged she had not been notified of the reconsideration hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">2. Did the trial court illegally increase [Hoile\u2019s] sentence when it vacated his sentence of probation and reimposed a sentence of incarceration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">3. Did the trial court err in granting a motion to vacate judgment where that motion was filed by the victim, a non-party to the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">4. Is Hoile precluded from arguing that the trial court illegally increased his sentence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">On 3 January 2008, Hoile filed a Motion to Strike the Appearance of Counsel for Palmer in the proceedings before this Court. Palmer opposed the motion. The State filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>memorandum of law, the content of which we interpret as urging the Court to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d regarding the motion. On 11 March 2008, after hearing oral arguments on the motion only from Hoile and Palmer (the State declined to argue), we issued an Order denying Hoile\u2019s motion. In section II of this opinion we explain our reasons for denying the motion. Although an interlocutory ruling, the denial of the motion deserves an explanation because of the relative \u201csea change\u201d in our jurisprudence it represents regarding the status of a victim\u2019s participation in a criminal appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">II. Mfotion to Strike Appearance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">In his Motion and supporting Memorandum of Law, Hoile contended that Palmer is not a party and should not be able to participate in the case as a matter of right.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Palmer countered that she has a right to brief and argue the issues in the case as if a party, citing, among other supporting reasons, recent changes to Maryland Rule 8-111.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Maryland Rule 8-111 currently states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">DESIGNATION OF PARTIES; REFERENCES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayr\">(a) Formal Designation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">(1) No Prior Appellate Decision. When no prior appellate decision has been rendered, the party first appealing the decision of the trial court shall be designated the appellant and the adverse party shall be designated the appellee. Unless the Court orders otherwise, the parties to a subsequently filed appeal shall be designated the cross-appellant and cross-appellee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>(2) Prior Appellate Decision. In an appeal to the Court of Appeals from a decision by the Court of Special Appeals or by a circuit court exercising appellate jurisdiction, the party seeking review of the most recent decision shall be designated the petitioner and the adverse party shall be designated the respondent. Except as otherwise specifically provided or necessarily implied, the term \u201cappellant\u201d as used in the rules in this Title shall include a petitioner and the term \u201cappellee\u201d shall include a respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">(b) Alternative References. In the interest of clarity, the parties are encouraged to use the designations used in the trial court, the actual names of the parties, or descriptive terms such as \u201cemployer,\u201d \u201cinsured,\u201d \u201cseller,\u201d \u201chusband,\u201d and \u201cwife\u201d in papers filed with the Court and in oral argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\n<em>(c) Victims and Victims\u2019 Representatives. Although not a party to a criminal or juvenile proceeding, a victim of a crime or a delinquent act or a victim\u2019s representative may:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">\n<em>(1) file an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from an interlocutory or a final order under Code, Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 11-103 and Rule 8-204; or</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\"><em>(2) participate in the same manner as a party regarding the rights of the victim or victim\u2019s representative. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Section (c) was added by a Rules Order of this Court signed on 4 December 2007. The change became effective on 1 January 2008.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, this motion presents our first opportunity to construe the new portions of the rule. Palmer contends that Maryland Rule 8-lll(c)(2) permits her to participate in this appeal \u201cin the same manner as a party.\u201d Under the circumstances of this case, we must agree that Palmer has the right to brief and argue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Because this is our first application of Maryland Rule 8-111(c) since its adoption, some relevant retrospection is required. Article 47 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, the Victims\u2019 Rights Amendment,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">(a) A victim of crime shall be treated by agents of the State with dignity, respect, and sensitivity during all phases of the criminal justice process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">(b) In a case originating by indictment or information filed in a circuit court, a victim of crime shall have the right to be informed of the rights established in this Article and, upon request and if practicable, to be notified of, to attend, and to be heard at a criminal justice proceeding, as these rights are implemented and the terms \u201ccrime\u201d, \u201ccriminal justice proceeding\u201d, and \u201cvictim\u201d are specified by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">(c) Nothing in this Article permits any civil cause of action for monetary damages for violation of any of its provisions or authorizes a victim of crime to take any action to stay a criminal justice proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Article 47 represents \u201cthe strong public policy that victims should have more rights and should be informed of the proceedings, that they should be treated fairly, and in certain cases, that they should be heard.\u201d <em>Lopez-Sanchez v. State, </em>388 Md. 214, 229, 879 A.2d 695, 704 (2005), <em>superceded by statute on other grounds by </em>Chapter 260 of the Acts of 2006. Article 47 and related legislation have created a class of specific, but narrow, rights for victims with regard to certain aspects of the criminal proceedings against the perpetrators of the crimes committed against victims or their property. For example, \u00a7 11-104 provides the statutory scheme by which a victim may elect to be notified of the proceedings in the relevant criminal case. Section 11-102 grants victims the right to attend any proceeding in which the right to attend is granted to the defendant. Section 11-302 defines victims\u2019 rights to be present at trial. Sections 11-402 and 11-403 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>elaborate victims\u2019 rights to be heard regarding pre-sentence investigative reports and at sentencing hearings, respectively. Section 11-404 defines victims\u2019 rights to address juries in death penalty proceedings. Section 11-503 grants victims the right to be notified of post-conviction appeals and other proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Section 11-103 provides that a victim may file an action for leave to appeal an interlocutory or final order that \u201cdenies or fails to consider\u201d a right granted to him or her by certain statutory provisions. The application for leave to appeal, however, does not stay other proceedings in a criminal case, unless all parties consent.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u00a7 11\u2014103(c); Article 47 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">These rights, however, are limited in application and context. In the present case, for example, Palmer is not a party to the litigation. \u00a7 11\u2014103(b); Maryland Rule 8-lll(c). There are only two parties, the State of Maryland and Hoile. <em>See Lopez-Sanchez, </em>388 Md. at 226 879 A.2d at 702 (\u201cThe victim is not a party to the proceeding ... although vested with statutory and constitutional rights.... \u201d); <em>Surland v. State, </em>392 Md. 17, 23 n. 1, 895 A.2d 1034, 1037 n. 1 (2006). As such, there are some important differences between the rights of parties and those of non-parties enjoying limited rights regarding participation in criminal litigation. Although a victim may \u201cfile an application for leave to appeal,\u201d he or she does not have a right to appeal as a party does. Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 12-301. A non-party\u2019s right to participate in the litigation is limited to \u201cdecisions affecting the party\u2019s direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>and substantial interests.\u201d <em>Lopez-Sanchez, </em>388 Md. at 227, 879 A.2d at 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The limits of victims\u2019 rights have been defined further in Maryland easelaw. In <em>Cianos v. State, </em>338 Md. 406, 659 A.2d 291 (1995), we held that victims who erroneously were denied a right to speak at the defendant\u2019s sentencing were not entitled to maintain an appeal. In so holding, we noted that the statute enabling victims to speak at sentencing had \u201cno teeth\u201d because victims could not seek invalidation of the sentence. <em>Cianos, </em>338 Md. at 412, 659 A.2d at 294 (quoting <em>Lodowski v. State, </em>302 Md. 691, 747, 490 A.2d 1228, 1256-57 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">We re-affirmed that proposition in <em>Lopez-Sanchez, </em>388 Md. 214, 879 A.2d 695. In <em>Lopez-Sanchez, </em>a victim of a violent crime committed by a juvenile sought to appeal an inadequate restitution amount awarded in the disposition of the juvenile court proceeding. We held that if \u201cthe prosecutor or the trial court does not follow the law with respect to a victim\u2019s rights in a juvenile proceeding, the Legislature has not given to the victim the general right to appeal that decision.\u201d <em>Lopez-Sanchez, </em>388 Md. at 230, 879 A.2d at 704. In response to our holding in <em>Lopez-Sanchez, </em>the General Assembly enacted Chapter 260 of the Acts of 2006, which amended \u00a7 11-103 to extend victims\u2019 rights to file an application for leave to appeal to orders arising from a juvenile proceeding, including disposition hearings under Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 3-8A-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">After the Legislature amended \u00a7 11-103, our Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure (\u201cRules Committee\u201d) proposed changes ostensibly to conform the relevant rules to the new legislation. The Rules Committee proposed amending Maryland Rule 8-111 to \u201cextend[ ] the right to file an application for leave to appeal to a victim of a [juvenile] delinquent.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> 158th Report of the Standing Committee on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Practice and Procedure, 26 September 2007, <em>available at </em>http: //www.eourts.state.md.us/rules/reports/158thReport.pdf. We adopted the proposed rule changes by a Rules Order dated 4 December 2007. The new subsection (c) of Maryland Rule 8-111 became effective on 1 January 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">\u201cTo interpret rules of procedure, we use the same canons and principles of construction used to interpret statutes.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Lennon v. Strazzella, </em>331 Md. 270, 274, 627 A.2d 1055, 1057 (1993). \u201cWe thus look to the plain meaning of the language employed in these rules and construe that language without forced or subtle interpretations designed to limit or extend its scope.\u201d <em>Lee v. State, </em>332 Md. 654, 658-59, 632 A.2d 1183, 1185 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Subsection (c) of the Rule goes beyond merely ensuring that victims of crimes committed by juveniles are granted the same rights as other crime victims. Subsection (c)(1) alone conforms and carries out the provisions of \u00a7 11-103.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Section ll-103(b) refers to twelve specific statutory rights granted to victims. If any of those specific statutory rights are violated, the victim may seek leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">In the present case, however, subsection (c)(1) of Rule 8-111 is not what concerns us. Instead, subsection (c)(2) is implicated. Subsection (c)(2) of Maryland Rule 8-111 permits a victim to \u201cparticipate in the same manner as a party regarding the rights of the victim.... \u201d This subsection stands as the analog to subsection (c)(1). The two subsections address different contexts: if a victim is aggrieved by an adverse trial court action affecting one or more of the twelve statutory rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>referred to in \u00a7 ll-103(b), subsection (c)(1) applies, and the victim may seek leave to appeal under \u00a7 11\u2014103(b); if a victim is content with the implicated trial court action, but a party appeals, the victim may \u201cparticipate in the same manner as a party\u201d in that appeal, but only with regard to the victim\u2019s rights. Victims\u2019 rights under subsection (c)(2) extend only as far as, and are subject to, the same limitations as victims\u2019 rights under subsection (c)(1) and \u00a7 ll-103(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Our interpretation of subsection (c) of the Rule is supported by the employment in it of the disjunctive connector \u201cor\u201d between (c)(1) and (c)(2). \u201cThe word \u2018or\u2019 is a disjunctive conjunction which serves to establish a relationship of contrast or opposition.\u201d <em>Walker v. Lindsey, </em>65 Md.App. 402, 407, 500 A.2d 1061, 1064 (1985). Accordingly, subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2) must have been intended to be independent and mutually exclusive provisions applying in the different contexts explicated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Our construction of Maryland Rule 8-111(c) in this fashion avoids potentially anomalous results. If the level of appellate participation afforded victims under subsection (c)(2) were less than the level of participation potentially afforded under subsection (c)(1), crime victims would be unable in the former to protect their potentially more meritorious claims. A victim seeking to \u201cparticipate in the same manner as a party\u201d under subsection (c)(2) in a party\u2019s appeal at least has benefited from a ruling or judgment of the trial court. That ruling, favorable to the victim, could be the subject of an appeal as of right by a party. By contrast, subsection (c)(1) applies where the victim\u2019s rights are affected by an unfavorable ruling below and seeks leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">As noted above, the amendments to Maryland Rule 8-111 go beyond merely carrying out the changes indicated in Chapter 260 of the Acts of 2006. The addition of subsection (c)(2) has the effect of changing further the landscape of a victim\u2019s role in appellate criminal proceedings.

Merits of the Present Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">A. The Granting of the Motion to Vacate Reconsideration of Sentence is an Appealable Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The Court of Special Appeals dismissed Hoile\u2019s appeal as premature, holding that the vacation of Hoile\u2019s altered sentence of time served and five years probation was not an appealable final judgment. It is a long-standing principle of our appellate jurisprudence that generally, \u201can appeal in a criminal ease is premature until after final judgment.\u201d <em>Dail v. Price, </em>184 Md. 140, 143, 40 A.2d 334, 336 (1944); Maryland Code (1977, 2006 Repl.Vol.), Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Article \u00a7 12-301. \u201cBecause of the difficulty in determining whether an issue before an appellate court arises from a final judgment, this Court has formulated a definition: The judgment must be so final as to determine and conclude rights involved, or deny the appellant means of further prosecuting or defending his rights and interests in the subject matter of the proceeding____\u201d <em>Sigma Reproductive Health Ctr. v. State, </em>297 Md. 660, 665, 467 A.2d 483, 485 (1983) (internal quotation omitted). In a basic sense, \u201ca final judgment consists of a verdict [in a criminal case] and either the pronouncement of sentence or the suspension of its imposition or execution.\u201d <em>Lewis v. State, </em>289 Md. 1, 4, 421 A.2d 974 (1980). \u201cUsually, a criminal case is complete and disposed of when sentence has been pronounced and, generally, sentence is the punishment to be inflicted on the convicted person in the form of imprisonment or fine or both.\u201d <em>Langworthy v. State, </em>284 Md. 588, 596-97, 399 A.2d 578, 583 (1979) (footnote and citation omitted), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Treece v. State, </em>313 Md. 665, 547 A.2d 1054 (1988). \u201cWhen sentence is pronounced or imposed, there is a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\u201d <em>State v.

The State urges that the original sentence of 15 years incarceration was not reimposed on Hoile, rather, it simply was \u201cresurrected,\u201d \u201crevived,\u201d \u201csprung back,\u201d or \u201creverted\u201d by virtue of the court\u2019s vacation of the altered sentence of time served and five years\u2019 probation. The State\u2019s argument ignores the procedure required to \u201crevive\u201d Hoile\u2019s original sentence and our caselaw which takes a broader view of what constitutes the imposition of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>In <em>McDonald v. State, </em>314 Md. 271, 550 A.2d 696 (1988), we rejected the argument that an original sentence was \u201crevived\u201d when reimposed on a defendant. McDonald was convicted of solicitation and was sentenced to a six-month suspended sentence with supervised probation for one year. Later, the trial court found that McDonald violated her probation and reimposed the six-month sentence. The trial court denied McDonald\u2019s Rule 4-345 motion for reconsideration of sentence because more than 90 days elapsed since the original imposition of sentence. We held that the reinstating of a suspended sentence following the parole violation constituted an imposition of sentence. We noted that \u201c[wjhether the hearing judge reimposes the original sentence or imposes a new sentence, the effect under Rule 4-345[ ] remains the same.... \u201d <em>McDonald, </em>314 Md. at 285, 550 A.2d at 702. We expressly adopted the reasoning of the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Coley v. State, </em>74 Md.App. 151, 156, 536 A.2d 1166, 1169 (1988), where the intermediate appellate court stated that \u201cif an order revoking a defendant\u2019s probation returns the hearing judge to the original sentencing status, then any sentence so imposed must have the effect of an original sentence.\u201d The Court of Appeals concluded that \u201c[t]he 90-day period runs from the time <em>any </em>sentence is imposed or reimposed upon revocation of probation----\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>314 Md. at 285, 550 A.2d at 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">In <em>Greco, </em>347 Md. 423, 701 A.2d 419, we addressed whether a reduction in sentence as a result of a defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration was an \u201cimposition of sentence.\u201d Greco was convicted in 1984 of first degree murder and first degree rape. <em>Greco, </em>347 Md. at 426, 701 A.2d at 420. He was sentenced to consecutive terms of life imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>The defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of sentence, which was held <em>sub curia </em>by the trial court until 1992. <em>Id. </em>In 1992, the trial court modified Greco\u2019s sentence to concurrent life terms of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>Shortly thereafter, Greco filed another motion for reconsideration of sentence under Maryland Rule 4-345. <em>Id. </em>The trial court ruled that it was divested of jurisdiction to hear Greco\u2019s new motion for reconsideration of sentence because more than 90 days had passed since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>original imposition of sentence in 1984. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals held that, by reducing Greco\u2019s sentence in 1992, the trial court had imposed a new sentence, thus resetting the 90-day clock. <em>Greco, </em>347 Md. at 432 701 A.2d at 423. Therefore, we also held that Greco was entitled to be heard on his new motion for reconsideration of sentence. <em>Id. Greco </em>stands for the proposition that the <em>granting </em>of a motion for modification of sentence constitutes the imposition of a new sentence. <em>Accord State v. Green, </em>367 Md. 61, 83-84, 785 A.2d 1275, 1288 (2001) (\u201c[0]ur cases make clear that when a trial court grants a motion to revise a criminal sentence, it resurrects the penalty portion of a judgment, thus, the new sentence represents the actual disposition of the case and the modified sentence becomes the appealable order.\u201d). The State offers no persuasive argument as to why the <em>vacation </em>of the grant of an identical motion does not also constitute an imposition of a new sentence. <em>See Green, </em>367 Md. at 83-84, 785 A.2d at 1288 (rejecting an argument described as \u201cexceedingly technical\u201d and holding that when a trial court revises sentence \u201cthe new sentence represents the actual disposition of the case and the modified sentence becomes the appealable order\u201d); <em>Webster, </em>359 Md. at 477, 754 A.2d at 1010 (finding an appealable judgment where \u201cthe collateral motion ... was granted, and resulted in the imposition of a new sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The State\u2019s reasoning, were it to be adopted, could lead to potentially anomalous results. If the State had opposed Hoile\u2019s initially successful motion for reconsideration of sentence on the grounds that it was a violation of either the Maryland Code or the Maryland Rules, the State clearly would have the right to appeal. Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 12-302(c)(2); <em>Green, </em>367 Md. at 84, 785 A.2d at 1288 (2001); <em>Webster, </em>359 Md. at 477, 754 A.2d at 1010. The State, instead, offered no opposition to Hoile\u2019s motion and allowed its time for appeal from the grant thereof to expire. The State then supported Palmer\u2019s motion to vacate reconsideration of sentence after the time expired for the State\u2019s appeal from the decision on the motion. <em>See State v. Wilkins, </em>393 Md. 269, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>273, 900 A.2d 765, 768 (2006) (\u201cIn other words, a motion to correct an illegal sentence is not an alternative method of obtaining belated appellate review of the proceedings that led to the imposition of judgment and sentence in a criminal case.\u201d). In essence, the State joined in a motion seeking to reverse a decision of the Circuit Court for which the State\u2019s time to appeal had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Hoile also points out that if the Circuit Court were to deny his resurrected pending motion for modification of sentence, he would have no opportunity to appeal. The State\u2019s brief is conspicuously silent in response to this argument. There is much caselaw holding that the denial of a motion to modify a sentence, unless tainted by illegality, fraud, or duress, is not appealable. <em>See, e.g., Costello v. State, </em>237 Md. 464, 469-70, 206 A.2d 812, 815 (1965) (holding that where the defendant alleged a violation of the \u201cconstitutional right to due process of law,\u201d the defendant would be permitted to appeal a denial of a motion to modify sentence as an \u201cexception to the general principle\u201d); <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>125 Md.App. 428, 442, 725 A.2d 635, 642 (1999) (\u201cAs a general rule, \u2018[a] motion to modify or reduce a sentence is directed to the sound discretion of the trial court and is not appealable.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>State v. Strickland, </em>42 Md.App. 357, 359, 400 A.2d 451, 452 (1979))). This clear principle, however, might be seen as called into question recently by dicta<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> in <em>Fuller v. State, </em>397 Md. 372, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>918 A.2d 453 (2007) <em>(Fuller </em>II). For the purpose of clarity, we explain that a denial of Hoile\u2019s pending motion for modification of sentence would have been unappealable.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The proper perspective from which to analyze <em>Fuller II </em>begins with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion in that case, <em>Fuller v. State, </em>169 Md.App. 303, 900 A.2d 311 (2006) <em>(Fuller I). </em>The Court of Special Appeals in <em>Fuller I </em>surveyed prior reported cases and noted its synthesized \u201cconclusion that this Court does not have jurisdiction to review the ruling at issue is entirely consistent with the well settled rule (never modified by the General Assembly) that, unless the circuit court erroneously concludes that it does not have jurisdiction to consider the defendant\u2019s motion for modification, no direct appeal lies from the circuit court\u2019s denial of a motion for modification or reduction of a sentence that the defendant concedes to be a <em>legal </em>sentence.\u201d <em>Fuller I, </em>169 Md.App. at 309-310, 900 A.2d at 315 (footnotes omitted). We affirmed the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, but our reasoning on this issue appeared to differ. In support of its assertion that no appeal lies from the refusal to modify a legal sentence, except where it declines to exercise jurisdiction, the Court of Special Appeals relied on <em>Costello. Fuller I, </em>169 Md.App. at 310 n. 6, 900 A.2d at 315 n. 6. We, however, disagreed with that reliance, noting that \u201c[w]e disagree with the State\u2019s rationale relying upon <em>Costello ... </em>that a decision left to the discretion of the trial court judge is not reviewable on appeal, because that justification was obviated in <em>Merritt [v. State], </em>367 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>17, 785 A.2d 756, in which we examined the appealability of the denial of a motion for a new trial.\u201d <em>Fuller II, </em>397 Md. at 388, 918 A.2d at 462. Then, quoting contrasting dicta in <em>Greco, </em>347 Md. at 423, 701 A.2d at 419, the Court in <em>Fuller II </em>stated that \u201c \u2018[i]f the motion is denied, the defendant is <em>fin</em>ished-he or she may not file another motion for reconsideration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fuller II, </em>397 Md. at 389, 918 A.2d at 463 (quoting <em>Greco, </em>347 Md. at 423, 701 A.2d at 419). This undeveloped dicta could be read to call into question the clearly articulated earlier rule prohibiting appeal of a discretionary denial of a timely motion for modification of sentence under Maryland Rule 4-345(e) and its predecessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The language in <em>Fuller II, </em>as construed here, should not be read as retreating from the Court\u2019s earlier expressed views on this point. In discussing the appealability of the denial of a motion to correct an illegal sentence under Maryland Rule 4-345(a), Judge Eldridge fairly described earlier Maryland jurisprudence on the issue as a \u201cplethora of inconsistent opinions,\u201d a \u201csaga,\u201d and \u201czigzagging.\u201d <em>State v. Kanaras, </em>357 Md. 170, 180, 742 A.2d 508, 514 (1999). <em>Kanaras, </em>in overruling at least five prior reported cases and affirming several others, brought needed clarity by holding that the denial of a motion to correct an illegal sentence is appealable. <em>Kanaras </em>is just as notable for what it did not overrule as what it did. <em>Kanaras, </em>expressly overruled <em>Valentine v. State, </em>305 Md. 108, 501 A.2d 847 (1985); <em>Harris v. State, </em>241 Md. 596, 217 A.2d 307 (1966); <em>Burley v. State, </em>239 Md. 342, 211 A.2d 714 (1965); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>227 Md. 99, 175 A.2d 775 (1961); and <em>Brady v. State, </em>222 Md. 442, 160 A.2d 912 (1960). <em>Kanaras, </em>however, did not overrule <em>Costello, </em>though discussing it extensively. The Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Fuller II </em>correctly recognized <em>Kanaras </em>as \u201creconciling\u201d <em>Costello </em>while overruling <em>Wilson, </em>the case upon which <em>Costello </em>relies largely. <em>Fuller II, </em>397 Md. at 384, 918 A.2d at 460. The holding of <em>Costello </em>has not been challenged, either by <em>Fuller, Kanaras, </em>or any other case. Thus, the distinction between motions to correct a sentence based upon an error of law and motions to reconsider sentence that are entirely committed to a court\u2019s discretion remains good law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Therefore, a denial of Hoile\u2019s pending motion for modification of sentence would not be appealable.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Finally, the State\u2019s argument fails as a practical matter. As a result of the 5 April 2005 hearing, Hoile was under a sentence of five years of probation. Following the 10 February 2006 hearing, the Circuit Court signed a new commitment order, committing Hoile to the Division of Correction for the remainder of a 15 year period of incarceration. The filing of a new commitment order is not a mere formality.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In <em>Sayre, </em>314 Md. at 565, 552 A.2d at 556, <em>superceded, by Rule change on other grounds as stated in Greco, </em>347 Md. at 433 n. 4, 701 A.2d at 423 n. 4, the question considered was when was a sentence deemed to be imposed on a defendant following a conviction. The Court of Appeals held that the sentence was imposed when it was announced from the bench and the trial court \u201cindicates that the particular case before it is terminated,\u201d even if the trial judge suffered a \u201cslip of the tongue\u201d and announced the wrong sentence. <em>Sayre, </em>314 Md. at 565, 552 A.2d at 556. No commitment order or transfer of the defendant to the executive branch was necessary for the sentence to be deemed imposed. The new commitment order in the present case provides far greater indicia of finality than that of an oral indication from the bench that the proceedings before the court are closed. In fact, the dissent in <em>Sayre </em>argued that the Court should have held that a sentence was imposed when the commitment order was filed. <em>See Sayre, </em>314 Md. at 568, 552 A.2d at 557 (Rodowsky, J., dissenting) (\u201c \u2018The oral utterance is an act of judgment, but it is not an entirely unalterable one. Other events, as for example entry of the order of commitment, are required to give it absolute finality.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Rowley v. Welch, </em>114 F.2d 499, 503 (D.C.Cir.1940))). The Majority in <em>Sayre </em>rejected that argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>ment, holding instead that finality attached to the judgment <em>prior </em>to the filing of a new commitment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">The new order in the present case altered the sentence that Hoile was then serving. <em>See Webster, </em>359 Md. at 477, 754 A.2d at 1010 (agreeing with the State in that case that the sentence modification at issue was an appealable judgment because \u201cthe action of the trial court served to alter the sentence previously imposed upon the petitioner\u201d); <em>Abeokuto v. State, </em>391 Md. 289, 351, 893 A.2d 1018, 1054 (2006) (\u201cIn the present case, the trial court initially imposed the sentence for extortion to begin on 24 December 2002 and then purported in subsequent papers to change it to consecutive with the death sentence, which effected an increase (albeit potentially a metaphysical one) in the sentence. This was not permitted.\u201d). The new sentence represents a sentence imposed on Hoile, and as such, is appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">We also conclude that the new sentence imposed in February 2006 amounted to an increase in sentence over the sentence imposed in April 2005. This requires little explanation. Prior to 10 February 2006, Hoile was sentenced to probation. Currently, Hoile stands sentenced to the remainder of 15 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">B. The Trial Court Impermissibly Increased Hoile\u2019s Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Having determined that the 10 February 2006 hearing resulted in an increased sentence imposed on Hoile, we must determine whether the increase in that sentence was legal. Hoile presents three arguments for why it was not. First, Hoile contends that the factual findings made by the Circuit Court are insufficient to find that the sentence imposed at the April 2005 hearing violated Maryland Rule 4-345(e) and (f) and thus, was not an \u201cillegal\u201d sentence. Hoile, curiously, first argues that the facts as found by the Circuit Court are not sufficient to hold that the April 2005 proceeding violated Rule 4-345(e) and (f). Because we do not address the argument here, it is not necessary to recount it in detail. Essentially, Hoile contends that because the Circuit Court failed to make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>specific finding that the State failed to take adequate steps to notify Palmer of the proceeding, the Circuit Court could not deem the April 2005 sentence illegal. If we were to address this argument and agree with Hoile, we likely would remand the case to the Circuit Court for such a factual determination. Instead, we hold that the Circuit Court illegally increased Hoile\u2019s sentence by granting the motion to vacate sentence, and shall reverse ultimately the Circuit Court. Second, Hoile contends that even if the Circuit Court failed to comply with Maryland Rule 4-345(e) and (f), the failure to notify the victim does not render the sentence of five years probation \u201cillegal.\u201d Finally, he contends in his reply brief that a court may not increase a defendant\u2019s sentence unless the original sentence is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Here, the Victim and the State part ways with their responsive arguments. The State concedes that the \u201cmodified sentence was not \u2018illegal\u2019.... \u201d Instead, the State contends that the failure to notify the Victim of the proceedings constitutes an \u201cirregularity,\u201d over which the Circuit Court retains revisory power under Maryland Rule 4-345(b). By contrast, Ms. Palmer maintains that the sentence imposed at the April 2005 hearing was \u201cillegal\u201d and may be corrected by the Circuit Court pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-345(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">1. Illegal Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Maryland Rule 4-345(a) states that a \u201ccourt may correct an illegal sentence at any time.\u201d The correction of an illegal sentence may result in an increase over the erroneous sentence previously imposed on the defendant. <em>State v. Griswold, </em>374 Md. 184, 821 A.2d 430 (2003) (holding that the trial court illegally reduced convictions on motion for reconsideration and reinstating convictions which effectively increased sentence); <em>State v. Hannah, </em>307 Md. 390, 403, 514 A.2d 16, 22 (1986) (vacating, on the State\u2019s appeal, the sentence of probation before judgment and ordering trial court to impose mandatory minimum of five years in prison); <em>State ex rel. Sonner v. Shearin, </em>272 Md. 502, 526, 325 A.2d 573, 586 (1974) (\u201cUpon the remand the trial judge shall delete the improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>suspension of sentence so that the handgun violation -will be for the mandatory term of five years.\u201d); <em>Mateen v. Galley, </em>146 Md.App. 623, 649, 807 A.2d 708, 723 (2002) (holding that an illegal sentence \u201cmay be corrected by the imposition of a legal sentence, even though the corrected sentence is longer than the original illegal sentence\u201d), <em>reversed on other grounds, Mateen v. Saar, </em>376 Md. 385, 829 A.2d 1007 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">An illegal sentence is a sentence \u201cnot permitted by law.\u201d <em>Walczak v. State, </em>302 Md. 422, 427, 488 A.2d 949, 951 (1985). An illegal sentence properly is corrected only \u201cwhere there is some illegality in the sentence itself or where no sentence should have been imposed.\u201d <em>Evans v. State, </em>382 Md. 248, 278, 855 A.2d 291, 309 (2004). Language in <em>Evans </em>stating that a sentence is illegal \u201cwhere no sentence should have been imposed\u201d is inapplicable to the context of the present case. The language in <em>Evans </em>does not make a sentence illegal merely because a required procedure was not followed prior to the court imposing the sentence. <em>Evans </em>cites three cases for the premise that a sentence is illegal if it is imposed \u201cwhere no sentence should have been imposed.\u201d In all three cases, no sentence should have been imposed at <em>any </em>proceeding in the case. <em>See Ridgeway v. State, </em>369 Md. 165, 171, 797 A.2d 1287, 1290 (2002) (no sentence should have been imposed on the defendant for certain assault charges because the defendant was acquitted of those charges); <em>Holmes v. State, </em>362 Md. 190, 195-96, 763 A.2d 737, 740 (2000) (sentence of probation with home detention as a condition of probation was illegal because the trial court lacked statutory authority to impose such a condition); <em>Moosavi v. State, </em>355 Md. 651, 662, 736 A.2d 285, 291 (1999) (sentence was illegal because the defendant was convicted under an inapplicable statute). By contrast, the State and Palmer do not contend that the Circuit Court would be without authority to impose a sentence of probation at a hearing which fully complied with the requirements of Maryland Rule 4-345(e) and (f). Instead, they argue that the particular proceeding at which the sentence of probation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>imposed on Hoile was deficient. Thus, the rule as stated in <em>Evans </em>is of no help to the State or Palmer.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">A sentence is not illegal where the illegality \u201cdid not inhere in [the defendant\u2019s] sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kanaras, </em>357 Md. at 185, 742 A.2d at 517).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">\u201cThe notion of an \u2018illegal sentence\u2019 within the contemplation of the <em>Walczak </em>decision deals with substantive law, not procedural law. It has obvious reference to a sentence which is beyond the statutorily granted power of the judge to impose. It does not remotely suggest that a sentence, proper on its face, becomes an \u2018illegal sentence\u2019 because of some arguable procedural flaw in the sentencing procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-7\"><em>Wilkins, </em>393 Md. at 273, 900 A.2d at 768 (quoting <em>Corcoran v. State, </em>67 Md.App. 252, 255 507 A.2d 200, 202 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Although \u201cthere are significant differences between the current Maryland rule [4-345] and its federal counterpart [35(b)],\u201d <em>Greco, </em>347 Md. at 434, 701 A.2d at 424, we have found federal precedent helpful in applying some aspects of the rule. In <em>Wilkins, </em>393 Md. at 275, 900 A.2d at 769, and <em>Randall Book Corp. v. State, </em>316 Md. 315, 321-22, 558 A.2d 715, 719 (1989), we discussed approvingly the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hill v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 424, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962), in our analysis of what constitutes an illegal sentence. In <em>Hill, </em>the trial judge did not afford the defendant an opportunity to allocute prior to sentencing, in violation of the Federal Rules. On a later appeal, the defendant argued that the sentence imposed by the trial court was an illegal sentence. The Supreme Court disagreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">But, as the Rule\u2019s language and history make clear, the narrow function of Rule 35 is to permit correction at any time of an illegal sentence, not to re-examine errors occurring at the trial or other proceedings prior to the imposition of sentence. The sentence in this case was not illegal. The punishment meted out was not in excess of that prescribed by the relevant statutes, multiple terms were not imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>for the same offense, nor were the terms of the sentence itself legally or constitutionally invalid in any other respect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-5\"><em>Hill, </em>368 U.S. 424, 430, 82 S.Ct. 468, 472, 7 L.Ed.2d 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">As noted above, <em>Hill </em>has been discussed with approval in several reported Maryland appellate decisions. Although both are given rights at a sentencing proceeding, the law currently recognizes that a criminal defendant has a greater cognizable interest in the sentencing proceeding than does the victim of the crime.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> If it is not an illegal sentence where the criminal defendant is sentenced and not afforded the required opportunity to speak on his own behalf, it is less able to be maintained that an illegal sentence results where the victim is denied the opportunity to speak.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Palmer and the State do not allege that the sentence of probation imposed at the April 2005 hearing exceeded any statutorily prescribed limits or violated any substantive criminal law. The sentence is not illegal on its face, and accordingly, the sentence is not illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">2. Irregularity</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">The State argues that, although the April 2005 sentence is not illegal, the proceeding was marred by an \u201cirregularity.\u201d The State correctly points out that the \u201ccourt has revisory power over a sentence in case of fraud, mistake, or irregularity.\u201d Maryland Rule 4-345(b). The State\u2019s argument, however, suffers from a fundamental flaw. At least on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>the facts in the present case,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> a court may not increase a sentence under Maryland Rule 4\u2014345(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">\u201cIn the context of judgments, it is well settled that an \u2018irregularity\u2019 is \u2018the doing or not doing of that, in the conduct of a suit at law, which, conformable to the practice of the court, ought or ought not to be done.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gantt v. State, </em>99 Md.App. 100, 104, 635 A.2d 97, 99 (1994) (quoting <em>Autobahn Motors, Inc. v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt., </em>321 Md. 558, 562, 583 A.2d 731, 733 (1991)). \u201c[Ijrregularity, in the contemplation of the Rule, usually means irregularity of process or procedure ... and not an error, which in legal parlance, generally connotes a departure from truth or accuracy of which a defendant had notice and could have challenged.\u201d <em>Autobahn Motors, </em>321 Md. 558, 562-63, 583 A.2d 731, 733 (citing <em>Weitz v. MacKenzie, </em>273 Md. 628, 631, 331 A.2d 291, 293 (1975)). We assume, for the sake of argument, that the failure of the State to notify Palmer (as found by the trial judge) and the failure of the trial court to inquire into notification in the first instance, constitutes an \u201cirregularity\u201d within the meaning of Rule 4-345(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">As we noted earlier, \u201c[t]o interpret rules of procedure, we use the same canons and principles of construction used to interpret statutes.\u201d <em>Strazzella, </em>331 Md. at 274, 627 A.2d at 1057. \u2018We thus look to the plain meaning of the language employed in these rules and construe that language without forced or subtle interpretations designed to limit or extend its scope.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>332 Md. at 658-59, 632 A.2d at 1185. \u201cGenerally, it is only when the words of the rule are ambiguous that we must look toward other sources to glean the intent of the rule.\u201d <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. 85, 94, 646 A.2d 1012, 1016 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Maryland Rule 4\u2014845(b) states that \u201c[t]he court has revisory power over a sentence in case of fraud, mistake, or irregularity.\u201d While the statement of the Rule seems simple enough, there is ambiguity in determining the scope of the court\u2019s \u201crevisory power\u201d under this subsection. Maryland Rule 4-345(a), which permits a court to increase a sentence to correct an illegal sentence, does not use the term \u201crevisory power,\u201d utilizing instead the term \u201ccorrect.\u201d By contrast, Maryland Rule 4-345(e) uses the term \u201crevisory power,\u201d but lists the prohibition on increasing a sentence as an exception to that \u201crevisory power.\u201d Thus, we turn to the \u201clegislative history\u201d of the Rule to determine the remedial scope of the \u201crevisory power\u201d in Maryland Rule 4-345(b).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\">Prior to 11 May 2004, Maryland Rule 4-345(b) stated: Modification or Reduction\u2014Time For. The court has revisory power and control over a sentence upon a motion filed within 90 days after its imposition (1) in the District Court, if an appeal has not been perfected, and (2) in a circuit court, whether or not an appeal has been filed. Thereafter, the court has revisory power and control over the sentence in case of fraud, mistake, or irregularity, or as provided in section (e) [desertion and nonsupport cases] of this Rule. The court may not increase a sentence after the sentence has been imposed, except that it may correct an evident mistake in the announcement of a sentence if the correction is made on the record before the defendant leaves the courtroom following the sentencing proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">For the purposes relevant to our discussion here, current 4-345(b) and 4-345(e) were combined into one section. The Rule prior to 11 May 2004 made clear that a trial court could not increase a defendant\u2019s sentence unless the increase was to correct a \u201cmistake in the announcement of sentence\u201d before the defendant exited the courtroom. The Rules Committee Letter Report<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and Reporter\u2019s Note accompanying the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>posed rule change discussed the rationale of several of the proposed changes to Maryland Rule 4-345. Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, Letter Report, Rule 4-345, 17 February 2004 <em>available at </em>http://www.courts. state.md.us/rules/reports/courtletter-revisorypower.pdf. The removal of the prohibition of a court increasing a sentence was not among the changes discussed. <em>Id. </em>The Reporter\u2019s Note concluded, \u201cOther changes ... are stylistic only.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, it is clear that the penultimate drafters of the new Rule did not intend to eliminate the prohibition on increasing a sentence because of fraud, mistake, or irregularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The distinction between Maryland Rule 4-345(a), under which a court may increase a sentence, and (b), under which a court may not, is highlighted by <em>Ridgeway v. State, </em>369 Md. 165, 797 A.2d 1287 (2002), a case decided before the 2004 amendments to Maryland Rule 4-345. The Court of Appeals framed the issue in <em>Ridgeway </em>as \u201c[t]he dispute in this case, and the decisional issue before this Court, is whether the trial judge\u2019s correction of the petitioner\u2019s sentence was pursuant to subsection (a) or [then] subsection (b) of Rule 4-345.\u201d <em>Ridgeway, </em>369 Md. at 170, 797 A.2d at 1289. The Court noted that the distinction between the two subsections was important because \u201can illegal sentence may be corrected at any time, while correcting a mistake in a sentencing order that results in an increased sentence may only occur before the defendant leaves the courtroom following the sentencing proceedings.\u201d <em>Ridgeway, </em>369 Md. at 170, 797 A.2d at 1290 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Our conclusion is also supported by Judge Wilner\u2019s analysis of the Rule in his concurrence, in <em>Lopez-Sanchez. </em>Judge Wilner noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">[e]xcept when sentence review is sought by the defendant under [Criminal Procedure Article] \u00a7\u00a7 8-101 through 8-109, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>or an appeal is taken by the State under [Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article] \u00a7 12-302 to correct the failure of a court to impose a sentence mandated by law, the sentence may not be increased after it is imposed. <em>The revisory power of the court extends only to modifications that are clarifying in nature or that do not adversely affect the defendant. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><em>Lopez-Sanchez, </em>388 Md. at 248, 879 A.2d at 715 (Wilner, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">3. Limitations of Victims\u2019 Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Palmer argues that, were our judgment to direct reversal of the Circuit Court, the effect would be to deny her any possible remedy for a clear violation of her right to be notified of, and be heard at, the sentencing proceeding. She largely is correct. Many victims\u2019 rights seem effective only when exercised prior to sentencing and entering of a final judgment against or in favor of the defendant. Such a limitation is implied in Article 47\u2019s express prohibition on a court permitting a victim to \u201cstay a criminal justice proceeding.\u201d <em>See also </em>\u00a7 11\u2014103(c). If a victim is not authorized to take an action to stay the entering of a judgment in a criminal case, the victim similarly is powerless to have that judgment reopened or vacated. It would be somewhat anomalous if the victim had the power to have a judgment vacated (essentially, undone) where the victim did not have the power to stay the entering of that same judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">In <em>Lodowski v. </em>State, 302 Md. 691, 747, 490 A.2d 1228, 1256-57 (1985), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>475 U.S. 1078, 106 S.Ct. 1452, 89 L.Ed.2d 711 (1986), and again in <em>Cianos, </em>338 Md. at 411-12, 659 A.2d at 294, we briefly discussed the legislative history of a proposal to permit a victim to seek invalidation of a defendant\u2019s sentence based on a violation of the victim\u2019s rights.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">\u201cProvisions invalidating the sentence clearly worried the legislators. A memorandum, evidently prepared by staff of the House Judiciary Committee, stated, \u2018[t]he major prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>tical problem of both bills ... is the possibility of placing the defendant in jeopardy a second time during the sentencing hearing.\u2019 ... The memorandum concluded that, \u2018House Bill 70 would be acceptable, however, if [the] lines [invalidating the sentence] were deleted. The statute would have no teeth after such a deletion but it would provide the personal input toward which the statute is aimed.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgV\"><em>Cianos, </em>338 Md. at 411-12, 659 A.2d at 294 (quoting <em>Lodowski, </em>302 Md. at 747, 490 A.2d at 1256-57). The Legislature has addressed some of the limitations on victims\u2019 rights, such as expanding a victim\u2019s right to apply to appeal, following <em>Lopez-Sanchez. </em>The Legislature, however, in the 23 years since <em>Lodowski </em>and 13 years since <em>Cianos, </em>has not given much substance to the illusory nature of the enforcement of victims\u2019 rights. \u201cThe General Assembly is presumed to be aware of this Court\u2019s interpretation of its enactments and, if such interpretation is not legislatively overturned, to have acquiesced in that interpretation.\u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>292 Md. 201, 210, 438 A.2d 1301, 1305 (1981). Although a victim now has more opportunity to participate in an appeal, there remains no effective tangible remedy for a victim to seek to \u201cundo\u201d what already has been done in a criminal case. The rights, to seek invalidation of an otherwise legal sentence. The victims\u2019 rights provisions in Maryland law still lack adult teeth. Thus, the victim is left largely with extra-judicial remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Although the Legislature responded to the specific issue decided in <em>Lopez-Sanchez, </em>Judge Wilner\u2019s description of the lack of remedies afforded victims of crime who have been denied their statutory rights remains largely apt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">Although disciplinary proceedings conceivably may be brought against a judge who wilfully violates clear statutory rights, there seems to be no efficient remedy for a victim ... if a judge, whether in good or bad faith, denies the victim the rights the Legislature has conferred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMEY\"><em>Lopez-Sanchez v.

The analysis in <em>Fuller II </em>of the right to appeal a court\u2019s discretionary denial of motion to reconsider sentence is entirely dicta. The issue in <em>Fuller II </em>was whether a defendant who moved to be committed to drug and alcohol treatment and was denied such relief could appeal the court\u2019s order. Fuller attempted to analogize his efforts to be committed to treatment to a variety of other motions, including motions for modification of sentence under Maryland Rules 4-345(a) (illegal sentence) and 4-345(e) (modification in the discretion of the court). <em>Fuller II, </em>397 Md. at 387, 918 A.2d at 462. The Court in <em>Fuller II </em>ultimately concluded that \u201c[t]he denial of a Section 8-507 [of the Health-General Article] petition for commitment, however, is not analogous to the denial of a motion for modification. Unlike a motion for modification, a petition for commitment does not affect the length of a sentence, only where a portion of it is to be served.\u201d <em>Fuller II, </em>397 Md. at 389, 918 A.2d at 463. Thus, the dicta in <em>Fuller II </em>was only included for purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>of comparison and was of little actual value in determining the ultimate outcome in that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b644-7\">. Although the following discussion itself may seem like unnecessary dicta, it is, in fact, integral to the outcome of the present case. A non-party to his case, Palmer, filed and prosecuted a successful motion to vacate after the time for the State\u2019s opportunity for appeal expired, resulting in a dramatic increase in Hoile\u2019s previously prevailing sentence. It would be contrary to the interests of justice to preclude Hoile from appellate review entirely under these circumstances. It would be unfair to hold that Hoile must wait for the trial court to rule on his pending motion for modification of sentence, only to have denial of that motion be unappealable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b646-7\">. Hoile\u2019s motion in the present case is one that is addressed to the trial court\u2019s discretion. Hoile alleges no error of law that might infect the sentence imposed on violation of probation. The support for his motion consists of his enrollment in Narcotics Anonymous, good behavior while in prison, securing a position as a maintenance worker, and obtaining his G.E.D.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b651-10\">. A criminal defendant may appeal as a matter of right from a final judgment, but a victim must seek \"leave to appeal.\u201d Maryland Rule 8-111(c); \u00a7 11-103. In addition, a criminal defendant is a party to the criminal case. The victim is not. Maryland Rule 8-111(c); \u00a7 11-103. As a party to the case, the criminal defendant has a greater interest in the outcome of the proceeding. This should not be understood, however, to mean that either the courts or the law are unmindful of the natural human feelings of a victim of a crime, and society in general, in hoping and expecting that justice is done, deterrence furthered, retribution meted out, and society protected from the defendant\u2019s further criminal deeds were he or she not restrained by incarceration or other restraint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b652-7\">. We reserve for future consideration the issue of whether a court properly may increase a defendant\u2019s sentence under Maryland Rule 4-345(b) where the defendant is to blame for the fraud, mistake, or irregularity. Maryland Rules 4\u2014345(e) and (f) do not obligate the defendant to ensure that the notice provisions of the rule are followed. That obligation falls on the trial court and the State.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b653-6\">.

Not all of Palmer's concerns are beyond the Circuit Court\u2019s authority to remedy. Palmer complains that the April 2005 sentence of probation does not have a \"no contact order\u201d as a term of probation. Judging from the facts of the present case and what we know about the Calvert County case, a \"no contact order\u201d may be justified. Maryland Rule 4-346(b) permits a court, <em>sua sponte, </em>to \"modify ... any condition of probation\u201d or \u201cimpose additional conditions.\u201d A condition of probation prohibiting a defendant from contacting the victim of a crime is not an illegal increase in sentence when added after the sentence of probation had originally been imposed. Then Judge Bell, writing for the Court of Special Appeals, addressed the issue in <em>Argabright v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 706, 548 A.2d 149 (1988). In <em>Argabright, </em>the trial court, upon request of the probation supervisor, modified a year old probation order to \"require that appellant have no contact with the victim except through legal channels.\u201d <em>Argabright, </em>76 Md.App. at 707, 548 A.2d at 150. The Court of Special Appeals held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">The clear and unambiguous language of the Rule explicitly authorizes the court, \"after giving the defendant an opportunity to be heard,\u201d to \"impose additional conditions.\u201d That is precisely what occurred in this case.
