Lamdin, be suspended for a period of thirty days without pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Respondent was appointed as an Associate Judge of the District Court of Maryland in October, 2002. This is his first disciplinary action and there have been no other disciplinary charges filed against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">I. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The Commission filed charges against respondent stemming from citizen complaints based upon public comments he made in the courtroom. The Commission charged respondent with violation of Canons 1,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2A, 3B(4), 3B(5), 6A and 6B of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct. Md. Rule 16-813.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Canon 1, Integrity and Independence of the Judiciary, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-9\">\u201cAn independent and honorable judiciary is indispensable to justice in our society. A judge shall observe high standards of conduct so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary will be preserved. The provisions of this Code are to be construed and applied to further that objective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqg\">Canon 2, Avoidance of Impropriety and the Appearance of Impropriety, in pertinent part, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-10\">\u201cA. A judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety. A judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the impartiality and integrity of the judiciary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGp\">Canon 3, Performance of Judicial Duties, reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-11\">\u201cA. GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES. A judge shall perform the duties of judicial office diligently, impartially, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>and without having or manifesting bias or prejudice, including bias or prejudice based on age, disability, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">B. ADJUDICATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">(4) A judge shall be dignified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">(5) A judge shall be courteous to and patient with jurors, lawyers, litigants, witnesses, and others with whom the judge deals in an official capacity and shall require similar conduct of lawyers and of court officials, staff, and others subject to the judge\u2019s direction and control.\u201d (emphasis retained).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Canon 6, Compliance, states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">\u201cA. COURTS. This Code applies to each judge of the Court of Appeals, the Court of Special Appeals, a circuit court, the District Court, or an orphans\u2019 court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-10\">B. CONSTRUCTION. Violation of any of the Canons by a judge may be regarded as conduct prejudicial to the proper administration of justice \"within the meaning of Maryland Rule 16\u2014803(j), as to the Commission on Judicial Disabilities.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">The Commission held a hearing on June 18, 2007. On that day, respondent and special investigative counsel submitted to the Commission a stipulated verdict sheet, indicating that respondent admitted that his conduct violated all the charges. Respondent and special investigative counsel filed stipulated proposed findings and proposed sanction, urging that \u201cthe Commission find by clear and convincing evidence that Judge Lamdin has committed sanctionable conduct[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] and issue a Public Reprimand____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>At the Commission hearing, respondent appeared with counsel and the Commission was represented by special investigative counsel. Directed towards mitigation and sanction, respondent testified before the Commission, filed letters from friends, professional associates and colleagues attesting to his good character and intentions and change of attitude, and a letter he wrote personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The Commission filed an opinion, setting forth findings of fact, conclusions of law and a recommended sanction, finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that respondent violated the Canons of Judicial Conduct, as charged, and thereby committed sanctionable conduct as defined by Maryland Rule 16-803(j). The Commission rejected the parties stipulation for a reprimand and instead recommended that respondent complete a consecutive thirty (30) working day suspension without pay within 90 days of the date of the decision of the Court of Appeals. Neither party excepted to the Commission\u2019s opinion. Upon receipt of the Commission\u2019s Opinion, this Court set the matter for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">As we have indicated, respondent did not except to the Commission\u2019s findings or conclusions. Instead, he filed a \u201cWaiver of Hearing and Submittal\u201d with this Court, arguing that the Commission\u2019s recommendation was extraordinary and might result in unintended consequences, such as a reduction of benefits. Respondent argued, in addition, that his efforts at remediation warranted the imposition of a lesser sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">This Court issued an Order scheduling a hearing for respondent to show cause why the Court should not impose the sanction recommended by the Commission or any other sanction permitted by law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Respondent filed a memorandum in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>response to the Order, arguing that he had shown remorse and had embarked upon a course of corrective conduct, that he had been subject to \u201cunflattering\u201d portrayals by the news media and the public record of the Commission, that a suspension would increase the burden on other District Court judges, and that the Commission\u2019s consideration of his perceived demeanor at the hearing was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">Pursuant to Article IV, \u00a7 4B(b) of the Maryland Constitution, a judge of any court of this State may be disciplined for an established violation of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The object of the Canons and the accompanying commentary is to set out, for the judiciary and the public, basic standards for the conduct of all judges and to provide guidance in establishing and maintaining high standards of judicial and personal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Upon our independent review, this Court must determine whether the charges against the respondent are supported by clear and convincing evidence and which, if any, Canons of the Code adopted by this Court have been violated. <em>See In re Diener and Broccolino, </em>268 Md. 659, 670, 304 A.2d 587, 594 (1973). If a violation is found, this Court must then determine what discipline, if any, is appropriate under the circumstances. The decision of this Court shall be evidenced by an Order of the Court, certified under seal and shall be accompanied by a written opinion. Md. Rule 16\u2014809(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">II. Factual Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The findings of the Commission have not been challenged before this Court. Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the factual determinations set forth in the Commission\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law are well supported by the record and have been proven by clear and convincing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>evidence. The Commission Opinion set forth the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-4\">\u201cFINDINGS OF FACT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">\u201cA. Judge Lamdin was, at all times applicable to the allegations contained in the Charges, a judge of the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore County, District 08. Therefore, the Respondent was and still is a judicial officer whose conduct was and is subject to the provisions of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct and Maryland Rules 16-803 through 16-810.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">\u201cB. In the Stipulations of Fact, set forth in Joint Exhibit 1, Tab 2 (\u2018Stipulations of Fact and Violation\u2019), Judge Lamdin expressly admitted that he made each of the comments attributed to him and that those comments violated specific Canons of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct, all as set forth in the Charges filed on November 30, 2006, in reference to the following cases: complaint filed by Ronald Jacobson; <em>State v. Owens, </em># DG 10900; <em>State v. Marsalak, </em># DG 16992; <em>State v. McClaughlin, </em># C 00240823; <em>State v. Kalp, </em># C 00239407; <em>State v. Nunyez, </em># DG 10669; <em>State v.

The following is a listing of those statements and Charges admitted by Judge Lamdin in the Stipulations of Fact and Violation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">\u201c1. As to the complaint filed by Ronald Jacobson, Judge Lamdin admitted that during the course of his opening remarks for the afternoon docket, he made the following comment to the audience regarding a woman leaving the courtroom with her baby who was crying:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-9\">\u2018If she only knew how much I hate kids, she would not have brought that kid in here today.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>\u201cJudge Lamdin further admitted that such comment by him violated Canons 1, 2A, 3A, 3B(4), 3B(5), 6A and 6B of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">\u201c2. As to <em>State v. Owens, </em># DG 10900, Judge Lamdin admitted that he asked the defendant, Hunter Coleman Owens, from Pennsylvania:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">\u2018What\u2019s the big rush to get back to Pennsylvania? It\u2019s an ugly state.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">\u201cJudge Lamdin further admitted that such comments by him violated Canons 1, 2A, 3A, 3B(4), 3B(5), 6A and 6B of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">\u201c3. As to <em>State v. Marsalak, </em># DG 16922, Judge Lam-din admitted that, during the course of the case in which defendant entered a not guilty agreed statement of facts to driving while suspended, he asked the defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9J\">\u2018Would you like some cheese with that whine because I\u2019ve heard about all that I wish to hear.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">\u201cJudge Lamdin further admitted that such comments by him violated Canons 1, 2A, 3A, 3B(4), 3B(5), 6A and 6B of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">\u201c4. As to <em>State v. McClaughlin, </em># C 00240823, Judge Lamdin admitted, upon being informed by the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney that the defendant had been asked to remain in the hallway with her baby until her case was called, that he stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-11\">\u2018Well, you know, I got in trouble because I told some lady we confiscate cell phones and we put the cell phones in plastic bags and send them down to Annapolis. I suggested maybe we ought to do the same thing with children except poke holes in the bag. She filed a complaint against me for that so that\u2019s why they keep all of the children out of my courtroom now ... We ordered some plastic bags about five foot tall but they haven\u2019t been\u2014they haven\u2019t come in yet.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-12\">\u201cJudge Lamdin further admitted that such comments by him violated Canons 1, 2A, 3A, 3B(4), 3B(5), 6A and 6B of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>\u201c5.

These problems have existed for you for now\u2014now for 14 years. You must be the slowest study known to man. If you haven\u2019t been able to figure out with all of your alcohol related offenses and now your drug arrest that you need to do something to help yourself, come on. Do you think I just came in on the watermelon track today? ... At Division of Correction they\u2019ll spank him and probably release him in four months.

As to <em>State v. Nunyez, </em># DG 10669, Judge Lamdin admitted that during the hearing he responded to the defendant\u2019s request for mercy by stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">T don\u2019t have any mercy. You haven\u2019t heard about me? I am a merciless SOB. You haven\u2019t heard that? I thought everybody knew that.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-9\">\u201cJudge Lamdin further admitted that such comments by him violated Canons 1, 2A, 3B(4), 3B(5), 6A and 6B of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-10\">\u201c7. As to <em>State v. Jennings, </em># DF 98262, Judge Lam-din admitted that, angry with the defendant\u2019s attitude, he sent the defendant to lockup and when the case was recalled later in the day, Judge Lamdin asked the defendant\u2019s attorney:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-11\">\u2018Did he get his head out of where he had it inserted earlier today, Mr. Chase?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-12\">\u201cJudge Lamdin further admitted that such comments by him violated Canons 1, 2A, 3B(4), 3B(5), 6A and 6B of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>\u201c8. As to <em>State v. Crook, </em># C 00289557, Judge Lam-din, in a case in which defendant entered a guilty plea to possession of paraphernalia and driving without a license, admitted that he made the following comments during the case:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\">\u2018Why did you drive so poorly? Smoke a little weed before you got behind the wheel? ... Smoke a little crack before you got behind the wheel? ... Well, you\u2019ve got the appropriate last name.... All right crack head, Crook.... You\u2019ve got your money all tied up in the next shipment that\u2019s coming in? Never mind....

So am I doing the tax-payers justice by locking this stupid ass up for additional time or am I just punishing the taxpayers? But is he one of the biggest dumb asses I\u2019ve ever seen?

The comments made by Judge Lamdin set forth in the Stipulations of Fact and Violation were undignified, discourteous, and disparaging.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-24\">\u201c2. During his sworn testimony at the Hearing, Judge Lamdin admitted that his stipulated comments were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>\u2018wrong,\u2019 but never indicated any appreciation of exactly what was \u2018wrong\u2019 about those comments. Judge Lamdin did not acknowledge that his comments were, in fact, undignified, discourteous, and disparaging. Judge Lam-din expressed no remorse for his comments; instead, he attempted to justify his comments through explanations and excuses. In response to questions from members of the Commission, Judge Lamdin was generally defensive, sometimes evasive, and, on at least one occasion, arrogant and hostile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">\u201c3. Examples of the aforementioned findings are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">\u201ca. In reference to Judge Lamdin\u2019s stipulated comments in <em>State v.

Crook, </em># C 00239557 (Paragraph 1.C.8, supra), Judge Shuger asked Judge Lamdin (1) how he thought a litigant would have felt if those comments were made to him or her by a judge during a hearing, and (2) how he would have felt if he had been addressed by a judge in that manner. Initially, Judge Lamdin did not respond to Judge Shuger\u2019s questions. Instead, Judge Lamdin defended his comment in <em>Jennings, </em>concluding: \u2018And I think the comment fit the situation quite frankly at the time regarding Mr. Jennings.\u2019 When pressed further for an answer by Judge Shuger, Judge Lamdin responded: \u2018Well, in the Jenning\u2019s (sic) case I certainly would have thought I had it coming. Because to be that unconcerned about your fellow man, that leaves something to be desired. Or fellow woman, in this case.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">\u201cRegarding <em>Crook, </em>Judge Lamdin stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">\u2018And in Mr. Crook\u2019s case I was trying to get on a level with him so that he could understand what we were talking about. That he had a problem he hadn\u2019t addressed, because it was getting worse instead of better. His life was spiraling out of control and without some kind of treatment, without approaching his life in a different direction, there were going to be additional victims, additional problems.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>\u2018And so if someone was trying to shock me back into reality and get me out of the situation I found myself in, I don\u2019t know that I would necessarily be offended.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFL2\">\u201cFinally, Judge Lamdin identified one of the reasons for his comments in both cases as \u2018at times it was my way of handling people one on one.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-5\">\u201cIn his responses to Judge Shuger\u2019s questions, Judge Lamdin gave no indication that he understood that his comments were undignified, discourteous, and disparaging. He offered no expression of remorse. Judge Lam-din attempted to justify his use of vulgarity, insults, and sarcasm as somehow being a way to communicate with defendants such as Mr. Jennings and Mr. Crook.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">\u201cb. In reference to Judge Lamdin\u2019s stipulated comments in <em>State v. Nunyez </em># DG 10669 (Paragraph 1.C.6, supra) and <em>State v. McClaughlin, </em># C 00240828 (Paragraph 1.C.4, <em>supra), </em>Judge Lamdin defended his comments as an attempt at humor. In <em>Nunyez, </em>Judge Lam-din claimed that his comments were taken \u2018out of context,\u2019 while in <em>McClaughlin </em>he admitted that his attempt at humor was \u2018a mistake on my part.\u2019 Judge Lamdin, however, never expressed remorse, nor did he acknowledge that his disparaging comments about children in <em>McClaughlin </em>might lead the public to believe that he was biased or prejudiced against children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-7\">\u201cc. In reference to Judge Lamdin\u2019s stipulated comments in <em>State v. Jones, </em># C 00241933 (Paragraph 1.C.9, supra), Judge Lamdin testified to the following explanation for his comments:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">\u2018I was speaking directly to this gentleman whose situation was such that I had to speak to him directly in terms that he could understand, because I think in that particular case, he couldn\u2019t understand why I wasn\u2019t going to give him probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-9\">* * %</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-10\">\u2018He asked me to explain to him my reasoning behind the sentence, and my best way that I could get down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>and get to him in terms he could understand, and I think if I\u2019m not mistaken, this was the last case on the docket that day. There was no one else in the courtroom but he, and I, and his public defender, was the way I couched it to him, that he was confused, his thinking was confused in not accepting the four month sentence, as opposed to four year\u2019s worth of probation because I felt sure that he would violate it. And I broke it down in terms he could understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">So my mistake in this case was trying to talk to this gentleman in terms he could surely understand so there would be no mistake about it, the reasoning for my sentence.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">\u201cJudge Lamdin, however, did not admit to any \u2018mistake\u2019 in the use of profanity, vulgarity, and insults. Again, he expressed no remorse for his comments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">\u201cd. Commissioner Hinton asked Judge Lamdin directly what, if anything, in his comments in <em>Jones </em>or in any of his stipulated comments, did he find to be \u2018offensive or upsetting or disparaging.\u2019 Judge Lamdin avoided answering the question by stating: T certainly wouldn\u2019t use the language that I used in that fashion again.\u2019 He then admitted that what he had said was \u2018wrong\u2019 and had taken the necessary efforts \u2018to change myself.\u2019 Again, Judge Lamdin did not specify what was \u2018wrong\u2019 about his comments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-8\">\u201ce. In response to questions from the Commission Chair, Judge Lamdin finally agreed that, in making statements to defendants in open court, the use of profanity, vulgarity, and name-calling was inappropriate. The following colloquy then ensued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-9\">\u2018JUDGE WOODWARD: And those are the things that you are not doing now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-10\">\u2018JUDGE LAMDIN: What I am doing now that I didn\u2019t do before, I\u2019m taking them back in chambers to talk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>\u2018JUDGE GREENBERG: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t hear what you said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-4\">\u2018JUDGE LAMDIN: I\u2019m taking them back in chambers, back with their lawyer and the prosecutor and talk to them one on one, usually with a treatment advisor. \u2018And I\u2019ve done that with representatives of (INAUDIBLE) and I find that to be much more effective. Because I can find out where their true desire is and whether they really want treatment or help, or they\u2019re a lost cause. And if they\u2019re a lost cause there\u2019s not much time to be wasted on talking to them.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">\u201cIt is unclear to the Commission exactly what Judge Lamdin meant by his last response. Did he intend to continue using profanity, vulgarity, and name-calling, only now \u2018back in chambers,\u2019 or did he simply want a setting more conducive to finding out whether he could help a particular defendant? The Commission truly hopes that it is the latter. Nevertheless, Judge Lamdin\u2019s answer is disturbing to the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">\u201cf. Commissioner Shelton asked Judge Lamdin several questions concerning Judge Lamdin\u2019s stipulated comments about the Circuit Court in <em>State v. Santos, </em># C 00238632 (Paragraph 1.C.10, <em>supra), State v. Stockley </em># C 00237477 (Paragraph l.C.ll, <em>supra), </em>and <em>State v. Spirako, </em># C <em>00222486 </em>(Paragraph 1.C.12, <em>supra). </em>Judge Lamdin was arrogant and hostile in answering the questions posed by Commissioner Shelton. This characterization can best be exemplified by setting forth the transcript of the exchange between Judge Lamdin and Commissioner Shelton:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">\u2018MR. SHELTON: Well, did you really want the public to think that the Circuit Court judges drink in the afternoon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">\u2018JUDGE LAMDIN: Well, once again, I\u2019m not going to try to defend what I said. I\u2019ve already admitted I was wrong. <em>But I don\u2019t know how long since you\u2019ve been in Baltimore County Circuit Court, Mr. Shelton. </em>If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>you go up in there in the afternoon, there\u2019s hardly any activity going on. That\u2019s the fact. A lot of judges sitting around there with nothing to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">\u2018MR. SHELTON: Well, let me ask a different question, your Honor, if someone appeared before you today after your meeting with these judges, would you tell them that the Circuit Court judges drink cocktails in the afternoon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">\u2018JUDGE LAMDIN: I beg your pardon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">\u2018MR. SHELTON: Would you tell today a person that appeared before you that the Circuit Court judges are spending the afternoon drinking cocktails?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">\u2018JUDGE LAMDIN: No, of course not. But after it\u2019s out there and you said it, you can either admit that you were wrong, you can\u2019t bottle it back up. You can learn from your mistake, you can change, or you can stand steadfast and do nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">\u2018MR. SHELTON: <em>Just one final question on page </em>seven\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-10\">\u2018JUDGE LAMDIN: <em>Are you suggesting it would have been better to do nothing?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-11\">\u2018MR. SHELTON: <em>I\u2019m not making any suggestions, your Honor. I was just asking.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-12\">\u2018JUDGE LAMDIN: <em>Well, was there some other way that you think would have been more appropriate for me to deal with it other than consult with three people I respect and get their opinions? \u2019 </em>(Emphasis added).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-13\">Instead of the proposed public reprimand, the Commission recommended unanimously that Judge Lamdin be suspended without pay for 30 days. The Commission noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av4\">\u201cJudge Lamdin\u2019s sworn testimony and demeanor at the Hearing, in which he failed to indicate an appreciation of the inappropriate nature of his comments, responded in a defensive, evasive, and arrogant manner, and expressed no remorse for his conduct, calls into question Judge Lamdin\u2019s basic understanding of the seriousness of his violations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>the Code of Judicial Conduct, as well as his capacity to comply with the Code in the future. The Commission is mindful of the efforts made by Judge Lamdin to correct his behavior ... Nevertheless, the Commission is concerned that, without the imposition of appropriate discipline, the apparent change in Judge Lamdin\u2019s behavior will be only temporary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">We have independently reviewed the record and find that the Commission\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law are supported by clear and convincing evidence. We agree with the Commission and Respondent\u2019s stipulation that Respondent violated Canons 1, 2A, 3A, 3B(4), 3B(5), 6A and 6B of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Canon 3 provides that a judge must perform judicial duties with dignity, courtesy, and patience, as well as without manifestation of bias or prejudice towards any group. We need not repeat here all the conduct set out by the Commission in the findings of fact and conclusions of law, and to which respondent has admitted. Respondent\u2019s inappropriate demeanor and comments were exhibited in a pattern of behavior over a period of time and in many cases. His conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice, manifested bias towards many groups, and lacked dignity, courtesy, and patience. It is patently obvious that use of vulgarity in the courtroom impairs the integrity of the Judiciary and is conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. Criticism of judicial colleagues, particularly from the bench in the courtroom, hardly leads to trust and confidence by the public in the Judiciary. A judge\u2019s lack of courtesy to defendants creates the appearance of impropriety. At the Commission hearing, respondent remarked that his comments had been taken \u201cout of context\u201d and that his comments were made in an attempt to relieve the defendant\u2019s nervousness at appearing in court. Even if the comments were delivered in a joking manner, it is difficult to imagine a context in which such remarks would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>appropriate or consistent with behavior that promotes public confidence in the impartiality and integrity of the Judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">The Florida Supreme Court considered the conduct of a judge charged with \u201coverbearing and dictatorial\u201d courtroom conduct. In determining that the judge\u2019s conduct violated Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct, the Florida Supreme Court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-5\">\u201cThe public can have little confidence in the impartiality of a decision when the litigant is cut short in the presentation of her case and the decision maker\u2019s demeanor bears all the indicia of prejudice and a closed mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">We take this opportunity to remind ourselves as judges that tyranny is nothing more than ill-used power.... A litigant, already nervous, emotionally charged, and perhaps fearful, not only risks losing the case but also contempt and a jail sentence by responding to a judge\u2019s rudeness in kind. The disparity in power between a judge and a litigant requires that a judge treat a litigant with courtesy, patience, and understanding. Conduct reminiscent of the playground bully of our childhood is improper and unnecessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-7\"><em>In re Eastmoore, </em>504 So.2d 756, 757-58 (Fla.1987). The inherent imbalance of power between a judge and a defendant mandates that defendants be treated with utmost professional courtesy and explains why certain attempts at humor, grounded in derision of a defendant, may not only fall flat, but also contribute to the erosion of the public perception of the Judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Use of vulgar and profane language erodes the public trust and confidence in the Judiciary. The language used by respondent was unacceptable for a judge in a judicial proceeding. Respondent\u2019s explanation before the Commission was that he \u201chad to speak to him directly in terms that he could understand, because I think in that particular case, he couldn\u2019t understand why I wasn\u2019t going to give him probation.... \u201d No matter how frustrated or stressed a judge may be, a judge should not use vulgar or offensive language in the courtroom or in the performance of judicial duties. Such use of profanity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>undermines the public perception of the Judiciary. An effort to connect with a defendant through the use of profanity does nothing but communicate \u201cthe message to the Defendant that it is permissible for the Court to say things that if said by the Defendant would be punishable.\u201d <em>In re Sadofski, </em>98 N.J. 434, 487 A.2d 700, 705 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Trust and confidence in the judicial system is undermined when a judge disparages and undermines fellow members of the judicial system. Respondent made comments repeatedly that denigrated his fellow judges. He disparaged the Division of Corrections, insinuating that a defendant might receive inappropriate leniency if sent there. Respondent\u2019s comments undermined the judicial system repeatedly. We agree with the Commission that respondent\u2019s repeated, inappropriate, statements and behavior in the courtroom constituted conduct prejudicial to the proper administration of justice, and violated Canons 1, 2A, 3A, 3B(4), 3B(5), 6A and 6B of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">IV. Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Art. IV, \u00a7 4(b) of the Maryland Constitution provides that the Court of Appeals, \u201cupon a finding of misconduct while in office, or of persistent failure to perform the duties of the office, or of conduct prejudicial to the proper administration of justice, may remove the judge from office or may censure or otherwise discipline the judge.\u201d The Commission recommended that respondent be suspended from office, without pay, for a period of thirty consecutive work days. While the Commission\u2019s recommendation is entitled to great weight, it is incumbent upon this Court to make an independent assessment of the appropriate sanction. <em>In re Diener and Broccolino, </em>268 Md. at 683, 304 A.2d at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">It is the constitutional responsibility of this Court to fashion judicial discipline in a manner that preserves the integrity and independence of the Judiciary and reaffirms, maintains and restores public confidence in the administration of justice. Any sanction must be designed to discourage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>others from engaging in similar conduct and to assure the public that the Judiciary will not condone judicial misconduct. Judicial discipline is not to punish. The goal of the canons of judicial conduct \u201cis to hold the office of judge above suspicion of abuse of power.\u201d <em>In re Welch, </em>283 Md. 68, 72, 388 A.2d 535, 537 (1978). Judicial discipline is \u201cnot for purposes of vengeance or retribution, but to instruct the public and all judges, ourselves included, of the importance of the function performed by judges in a free society.\u201d <em>In re White, </em>264 Neb. 740, 651 N.W.2d 551, 566 (2002). As we have stated repeatedly, both in judicial discipline matters, as well as attorney discipline matters, our considerations are \u201cthe maintenance of the honor and dignity of the judiciary and the proper administration of justice rather than the punishment of the individual.\u201d <em>In re Turney, </em>311 Md. 246, 257, 533 A.2d 916, 922 (1987); <em>see also In re Diener and Broccolino, </em>268 Md. at 670, 304 A.2d at 594 (1973); <em>c.f Attorney Grievance v. Harris, </em>403 Md. 142, 166, 939 A.2d 732, 746 (2008). The sanction must inform the public that we recognize that there has been judicial misconduct, must be sufficient to deter the offending judge from repeating the conduct in the future, and must be sufficient to deter others from engaging in similar conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">We turn to the Commission\u2019s recommended sanction of a thirty-day suspension without pay. Respondent characterized the Commission\u2019s recommended sanction as \u201can extraordinary circumstance that may have significant unintended consequences\u201d and that the Commission was motivated improperly by personal dislike of him, based on respondent\u2019s demeanor at the Commission hearing. As an appropriate sanction, respondent suggests a reprimand and a surrender of fifteen days vacation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the alternative, he suggests that if this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>imposes a suspension without pay, because of collateral effects on benefits, this Court should order respondent to surrender his net paycheck to the Comptroller of the Treasury, Maryland Volunteer Lawyers Service or any other organization deemed appropriate by this Court. As mitigation, respondent pointed to his time on the bench, no prior disciplinary action against him, his efforts to reform his behavior (including seeking out mentors), letters written on his behalf attesting to his changed behavior, the bad publicity and humiliation he has suffered as a result of negative media coverage, the potentially increased burden on the District Court system if he were suspended, and his repeated expressions of remorse for his past actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Respondent asks this Court to consider as a mitigating factor the media exposure of his actions and the additional burdens on fellow District Court judges that would result from his suspension. We do not find this argument persuasive. The media exposure mentioned by respondent, including news articles in The City Paper and The Baltimore Sun, worsen public perception of the Judiciary. <em>See, e.g., In re: Lee, </em>933 So.2d 736, 749 (La.2006) (weighing extensive media coverage of a judge\u2019s failure to file timely expense reports as an aggravating factor).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Respondent did make efforts to mitigate his behavior by seeking guidance from his colleagues and undergoing voluntary monitoring when the Judicial Disabilities Commission charges were brought to his attention. Despite these efforts, respondent appeared to the Commission as defensive, arrogant, hostile, and evasive. The Commission found that respondent\u2019s explanations of his behavior reflected a failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>demonstrate \u201can appreciation of the inappropriate nature\u201d of the sanctionable conduct he had committed. The Commission was in the best position to evaluate respondent\u2019s demeanor and we do not find their observations to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">After a careful, independent review of the entire record, we conclude that the sanction recommended by the Commission is appropriate and respondent should be suspended for thirty consecutive work days, without pay. Weighing respondent\u2019s conduct, his attempts at mitigation, and his behavior at the Commission hearing, considering the findings and conclusions of the Commission, and taking into account the serious nature of respondent\u2019s conduct, we determine that neither a reprimand nor removal from office are warranted. We conclude that the appropriate discipline in this matter is the sanction recommended by the Commission, that of a consecutive, thirty working-day, suspension without pay is the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Several of our sister states have imposed a sanction of suspension without pay. The Supreme Court of Michigan imposed a suspension without pay for one year in a disciplinary matter where the judge had made repeated injudicious, offensive and profane comments from the bench, including comments that were disparaging of the judicial system. <em>In re Bennett, </em>403 Mich. 178, 267 N.W.2d 914, 918-20 (1978). The Supreme Court of Arizona suspended a judge without pay for the balance of his term because the judge had used racial epithets and other vulgarities from the bench. <em>In re Goodfarb, </em>179 Ariz. 400, 880 P.2d 620, 623 (1994). The Supreme Court of Ohio suspended a judge for six months without pay because of false and disparaging remarks he made about the decision of an appellate court in a custody case during a taped interview for a television broadcast, remarks he made about an administrative judge\u2019s handling of juvenile matters in a newspaper article, and disparaging remarks about a juvenile administrative judge and the director of community services. <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Ferreri, 85 </em>Ohio St.3d 649, 710 N.E.2d 1107, 1108-10 (1999). <em>See also Lee, </em>933 So.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>751 (finding a judge\u2019s accounting irregularities and delay in issuing opinions warranted a suspension for 120 days without pay); <em>In re Empson, </em>252 Neb. 433, 562 N.W.2d 817, 822-33 (1997) (finding a judge\u2019s offensive and unwelcome contact with female staff, dissemination of religious materials inside the courthouse to jurors and contact with witnesses against him prior to disciplinary proceedings warranted six month suspension without pay); <em>In re Kneifl, </em>217 Neb. 472, 351 N.W.2d 693, 696 (1984) (finding a judge\u2019s arrest for drunk driving and his contact with the county\u2019s attorney on behalf of a friend arrested for drunk driving warranted suspension without pay for three months).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">\n<em>FOR THE REASONS SET FORTH, HEREIN, JUDGE BRUCE S.

Accordingly, we do not consider whether Canon 1 is a rule of conduct under which a judge may be disciplined, or is instead one which sets out the ultimate objective of preservation of the integrity and independence of the judiciary. <em>See In re Schenck, </em>318 Or. 402, 870 P.2d 185, 214 (1994) (Unis, J. dissenting). Moreover, the Commission found that respondent violated other canons as charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b663-12\">. Maryland Rule 16\u2014803(j) defines \u201csanctionable conduct\u201d as follows: \" 'Sanctionable conduct\u2019 means misconduct while in office, the persistent failure by a judge to perform the duties of the judge\u2019s office, or conduct prejudicial to the proper administration of justice.

Md. Rule 16-809(e) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-10\">\"Disposition.

Respondent did not and does not challenge the authority of this Court to impose a thirty day suspension without pay. At the show cause hearing before this Court, respondent's counsel was asked as to his view with respect to the constitutionality of the Commission\u2019s recommendation, and in particular, the recommendation that the sanction be thirty days without pay, as well as this Court\u2019s authority to impose that sanction. Respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>dent's counsel forthrightly responded that this Court <em>has </em>the authority to impose suspension without pay. He stated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">\"I believe it does because I was fully aware of the constitutional provision and researched it and you\u2019ll notice I didn\u2019t raise it and do not raise it now....
