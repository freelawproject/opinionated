The second issue we address is whether, regardless of any error by the trial court in instructing the jury as to the elements of first degree rape, Appellee\u2019s, Maouloud Baby\u2019s, convictions for first degree and third degree sexual offense, based on his conduct as principal in the second degree to the criminal, sexual conduct of his friend, should be reversed. Additionally, we have been asked to determine whether it is error for a trial court to fail to conduct an inquiry into the reliability and validity of expert testimony on \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d under the standard articulated in <em>Reed v. State, </em>283 Md. 374, 391 A.2d 364 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In Part I of this Court\u2019s opinion, joined by Judges Harrell, Greene and Cathell, we conclude that the trial court did err by failing to more specifically instruct the jury on post-penetration withdrawal of consent, and that the crime of first degree rape includes post-penetration vaginal intercourse accomplished through force or threat of force and without the consent of the victim, even if the victim consented to the initial penetration. In a concurrence, Judge Raker, joined by Chief Judge Bell and Judge Wilner, explains why they join only in the judgment on this issue. In Part II, joined by Chief Judge Bell and Judges Greene and Cathell, we determine that the convictions for first degree and third degree sexual offense should be reversed. A dissent by Judge Raker, joined by Judges Harrell and Wilner, reveals why they are unable to subscribe to Part II of the Court\u2019s opinion. Additionally, this Court is unanimous in suggesting, for guidance at the new trial, that \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d evidence should first be subjected to <em>Frye-Reed </em>analysis, were an appropriate objection interposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">In December 2003, Appellee, Maouloud Baby, was indicted for first degree rape,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> first degree sexual offense,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>first degree sexual offense,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> conspiracy to commit first degree rape, and third degree sexual offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Baby was initially tried in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County in 2004, but a mistrial was declared because of a hung jury. Baby was retried on December 13-17 and 20-21, 2004 before a jury on two counts of first degree rape, one count of attempted first degree rape, one count of first degree sexual assault, one count of attempted first degree sexual offense, one count of conspiracy to commit first degree rape, and two counts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>third degree sexual offense. He was convicted of one count of first degree rape, one count of first degree sexual offense, and two counts of third degree sexual offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">At trial, the complaining witness (\u201cJ.L.\u201d)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> testified that on the night of December 13, 2003, she and her best friend, Lacey, went to Best Buy and purchased CDs and then drove in J.L.\u2019s car to the McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Montgomery Village. Inside the McDonald\u2019s, they encountered some of Lacey\u2019s brother\u2019s friends, including Baby and Mike. J.L. recognized Baby from high school but did not otherwise know him.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">J.L. further testified that she and Lacey left the McDonald\u2019s, went outside, and entered J.L.\u2019s car, at which time Mike asked J.L. if she could give him and Baby a ride to a party. J.L. agreed, and allowed Baby, Mike, and an unidentified \u201cHispanic boy,\u201d to ride in the back seat of the car. On the way to the party, Baby instructed J.L. to stop at a gas station, which she did, where Baby and the Hispanic boy got out of the car. Although Baby returned to the car approximately one minute later, the Hispanic boy did not return.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">J.L. said that the remaining four continued to drive to the party, which took approximately ten to fifteen minutes. Baby and Mike decided not to attend the party. J.L. stated that she drove back to the McDonald\u2019s, planning to drop Baby and Mike off there. During the trip back to the restaurant, Baby told J.L. to turn into a residential development and directed her to a parking spot. All four alighted from the vehicle and walked towards a clearing between two end townhouses. Baby and Mike smoked marijuana and engaged J.L. and Lacey in conversation. Baby and Mike discussed getting a hotel room, noting that J.L. and Lacey were both 18 and old enough to do so. Neither J.L. nor Lacey expressed interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>J.L. further testified that, after the four returned to the McDonald\u2019s, Lacey left the group, but Baby and Mike stated that they did not want to leave the car. Lacey gave J.L. her cell phone, which she placed on the passenger seat. J.L. agreed to drive Baby and Mike to a residential neighborhood. Upon their arrival, she parked her car, whereupon Baby and Mike asked J.L. to sit between them in the back seat so they could talk. J.L. climbed into the back seat and sat between the two. She removed her jacket because she was warm. Baby then put his hand between her legs and Mike tried to put J.L.\u2019s hand down his pants. Baby told J.L. to \u201cflash him\u201d and Mike told her to \u201cjust lick it.\u201d When J.L. did not comply with their requests, Baby began to fondle her breast with his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">J.L. also testified that she told Baby and Mike that they had to return to the McDonald\u2019s, but they asked to stay ten more minutes. J.L. then \u201csomehow ended up on [her] back,\u201d at which point Baby attempted to remove her pants and Mike tried to place his penis in her mouth. J.L. told them to stop, but Baby and Mike moved her around so that her body was against Baby. Baby then held her arms as Mike attempted to have intercourse, briefly inserting his penis mistakenly into her rectum. Mike again unsuccessfully attempted intercourse, and Baby inserted his fingers into J.L.\u2019s vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">J.L. further testified that Baby then got out of the car. Mike inserted his fingers and then his penis into J.L.\u2019s vagina. Mike then left the automobile and Baby got into the car. J.L. testified that Baby told her \u201cit\u2019s my turn now.\u201d According to J.L., the following then transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">Q. [ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And what else did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">A. He, after that we sat there for a couple seconds and he was like so are you going to let me hit it and I didn\u2019t really say anything and he was like I don\u2019t want to rape you. Q. And what did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">A.... [W]ell first of all they told me that ... I wouldn\u2019t be able to leave until I was done ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Q. They had told you that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">A. Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">Q. They had told you that you would not be able to leave? A. Yes, earlier. They were just, they were like you can leave as soon as we\u2019re done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">Q. And by that you assumed what or that you understood that to mean what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">A. That as soon as I finished whatever they told me to do, I could leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">Q. So when [Baby] said I don\u2019t want to rape you, did you respond?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-10\">A. Yes. I said that as long as he stops when I tell him to, then</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-11\">Q. Now, that he could?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-13\">Q. Now, [J.L.], at the time that [Baby] got back in the car, how were you feeling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-14\">A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-15\">Q. Did you feel like you had a choice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-16\">A. Not really. I don\u2019t know. Something just clicked off and I just did whatever they said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-17\">Q. Were you tired?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-18\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-19\">Q. Did you want to go home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-20\">A. I just wanted to go home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-21\">Q. Now when you told [Baby] if I say stop, something like that, you have to stop. What did he do after you spoke those words?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-22\">A. Well he got on top of me and he tried to put it in and it hurt. So I said stop and that\u2019s when he kept pushing it in and I was pushing his knees to get off me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-23\">Q. You were on your back and he was on top of you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-24\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-25\">Q. Did he stop pushing his penis into your vagina?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>A. Not right away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">Q. About how long did he continue to push his penis into your vagina?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">A. About five or so seconds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">Q. And then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">A. And that\u2019s when he just got off me and that\u2019s when Mike got in the car and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">Q. Let me stop you for a minute. When he was, he put himself in you and you said, ow, it hurts, stop\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-11\">Q.\u2014did he stop?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-12\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-13\">Q. How many times did you tell him to stop?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-14\">A. I, well I yelled stop, that it hurt, and I was pushing him off me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-15\">Q. And he didn\u2019t stop\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-16\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-17\">Q.\u2014until at some point he did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-18\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-19\">J.L. also stated that Mike, without her permission, then drove the car to a neighborhood across the street from the McDonald\u2019s. During the drive, Baby asked J.L. to \u201cjack him off\u201d and she declined. She did give Baby her phone number when he requested it. Baby returned Lacey\u2019s cell phone to J.L., which he or Mike had taken from her previously, and J.L. used it to call Lacey. The two women spoke briefly. Mike parked the car across from the McDonald\u2019s and hugged J.L. before he and Baby departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-20\">J.L. then drove to the McDonald\u2019s to pick up Lacey. They then drove to Shoppers Food Warehouse, where they met J.L.\u2019s mother to shop for groceries. After the grocery shopping, J.L. and Lacey proceeded to Lacey\u2019s home where J.L. told Lacey\u2019s mother what had occurred. The police were called, whereupon J.L. went to the hospital to be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Baby also testified at trial and his testimony was similar to that of J.L., except his recollection of the events that occurred in J.L.\u2019s car after they had dropped off Lacey at the McDonald\u2019s:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">[BABY\u2019S COUNSEL]: Before you got out of the car, did you touch [J.L.] in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">A. No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">Q. Hold her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">Q. Grab her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-11\">Q. Did you take your penis out before you got out of the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-12\">A. No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-13\">Q. Did you see [Mike\u2019s] penis before you got out of the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-14\">A. No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-15\">Q. Did you have any contact with [J.L.] prior to getting out of the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-16\">A. No contact prior to getting out of the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-17\">Q. What happened after you sat there for that amount of time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-18\">A. After I sat, Mike got out of the car and, while I was walking towards the car, he told me that, he said in quote that he \u201cjust hit that,\u201d which means he just had sex with her. So, then I got in the car, and right when I sat down in the car, she was sitting on the driver\u2019s side of the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9a\">Q. What did that mean to you when Mike said he \u201cjust hit that\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-19\">A. He just had sex with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-20\">Q. Which side did he get out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-21\">A. He got out of the driver\u2019s side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-22\">Q. And what side did you get in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-23\">A. I was in the, I got in from the driver\u2019s side, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-24\">Q. When she was sitting there, was she dressed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>A. She didn\u2019t have nothing on but her shirt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">Q. How did she appear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">A. She appeared normal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">Q. Was she crying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">A. No, she wasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">Q. When you got in the car, what, if anything, did you say or do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-10\">A. I asked her if she was going to let me have sex -with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-11\">Q. What exactly did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-12\">A. I said, \u201cAre you going to let me hit that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-13\">Q. And what does that mean to you, \u201cCan I hit that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-14\">A. Have sex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-15\">Q. What, if anything, did she say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-16\">A. She said yes, as long as I stop when she says to. And then I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to rape you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-17\">Q. Did you feel that was permission?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-18\">A. Yeah, I thought that that was permission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-19\">Q. Why did you say \u201cI don\u2019t want to rape you\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-20\">A. Just to, because she said, \u201cStop when I say to,\u201d just to tell her that. It\u2019s kind of like to confirm the permission. Q. So, after she said \u201cStop when I say stop,\u201d what did you do, if anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-21\">A. That\u2019s when I took off the condom, I mean, I took the condom out of my pocket and I ripped it open, I put on the condom, put the condom, threw the condom, like, on the floor, on her door, and she picked it up and told me to throw it out the window.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-22\">Q. She gave it back to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-23\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-24\">Q. Where was it? On the floor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-25\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-26\">Q. Where did she pick it up from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-27\">A. She picked it up right from the floor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Q. Front seat or back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\">A. In the backseat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">Q. How did you open it? Do you remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">A. I don\u2019t remember how I opened it. I just tore it open.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIJ\">Q. What did you do with it when she gave it back to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac\">A. I threw it out the window.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">Q. Was the window open, or did you have to roll it down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP6\">A. No, I think it was open.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">Q. Had you previously closed it or opened it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">A. No. I didn\u2019t touch the window the whole night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">Q. When you were putting on your condom, where was she, what position was she in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-11\">A. She was, first she was sitting in the car when we was talking, and then she was still sitting when I put on the condom. But then after, when I was trying to go in there, she was like laying down in the car in the backseat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-12\">Q. What did you do physically?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-13\">A. I placed myself in between her legs and then I tried to put it in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-14\">Q. What were you wearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-15\">A. I was wearing a black T-shirt, blue jeans, and black sneakers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-16\">Q. Did you take your pants all the way off?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-17\">A. No, I don\u2019t think so. I think I just zipped my pants down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-18\">Q. Describe the black shirt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-19\">A. Oh, it was a tall T-shirt and it was big. It was, I think it was a 3X, and it was black.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-20\">Q. What do you mean a tall T-shirt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-21\">A. It was a shirt that runs long.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-22\">Q. What did you do with your penis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-23\">A. I tried to put it in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-24\">Q. Do you know where it was touching or what happened to it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>A. No. After I tried to put it in once, it wouldn\u2019t go in, and I tried a couple more times and it wouldn\u2019t go in. I didn\u2019t feel nothing there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">Q. What happened? What did she say or do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">A. And then she sat up. She was like, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to go in,\u201d and that\u2019s when, after she sat up and said \u201cIt\u2019s not going to go in,\u201d that\u2019s when I took off the condom and I put it in my pocket and then knocked on the window for Michael to come in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">Q. Who said, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to go in?\u201d You or her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">A. She did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">Q. When she sat up, what did that mean to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-10\">A. That meant stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-11\">Q. Did she say \u201cStop\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-12\">A. No, she didn\u2019t. She just sat up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-13\">Q. And you took that to mean stop?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-14\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-15\">Q. When she sat up, did you try to put it in again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-16\">A. No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-17\">Testifying on behalf of the State was Dr. Ann Burgess, a Professor of Nursing at Boston College, who holds a master\u2019s of science degree in psychiatric nursing from the University of Maryland and a doctor of nursing science degree from Boston University. Dr. Burgess\u2019 testimony was offered as an expert on the subject of \u201crape trauma syndrome,\u201d to which Baby\u2019s attorney objected, having filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude Dr. Burgess\u2019 testimony. At trial, the State presented Dr. Burgess with behaviors such as offering \u201cminimal, physical resistance\u201d in response to the assailant\u2019s actions, not immediately telling the first person the victim saw about the rape \u201ceven if that person might be their best friend,\u201d and engaging in routine behavior such as \u201cgoing to a supermarket and shopping\u201d shortly after the rape and asked if these behaviors were consistent with \u201crape trauma syndrome.\u201d Dr. Burgess testified that such behaviors were consistent with \u201crape trauma syndrome,\u201d as were other actions, such as not calling 911 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>immediately and giving one\u2019s telephone number to the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The trial court instructed the jury on the elements of first degree rape, using language substantively similar to that in the pattern jury instructions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After the jurors began deliberation, they initially submitted two notes which related to the duration of their discussion. A short time later, the jury submitted a third note which was read into the record: \u201cIf a female consents to sex initially and, during the course of the sex act to which she consented, for whatever reason, she changes her mind and the man continues until climax, does the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>result constitute rape?\u201d Baby\u2019s attorney argued that the court should respond to the note in the negative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">[BABY\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... To me, the clear answer, the unequivocal answer to this questions is no. Why? Because they ask, \u201cIf a female consents to sex initially and, during the course of the sex act to which she consented\u2014\u201d That means that the woman consented to the penetration. She consented to the penis going into her vagina.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">The State argued that any slight intrusion into the vagina is rape. Here, this woman in the note consented to sex and allowed a penis to go into her vagina. This is during the sex act.

This is the same question in simpler form or at least a variation of the same question.\u201d The court then instructed the jury, \u201cThis is a question that you as a jury must decide. I have given the legal definition of rape which includes the definition of consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">On December 21, 2004, the jury found Baby guilty \u201c[a]s to Count I, First Degree Rape (Being aided and abetted by [Mike] in the act of vaginal penetration),\u201d guilty \u201c[a]s to Count II, First Degree Sexual Assault (Aiding and abetting [Mike] in the act of anal penetration),\u201d guilty \u201c[a]s to Count V, Third Degree Sexual Offense (touched vagina),\u201d and guilty \u201c[a]s to Count VI, Third Degree Sexual Offense (touched breast).\u201d The jury found Baby not guilty of one count of first degree rape, of one count of attempted first degree sexual offense, and of one count of conspiracy to commit first degree rape. On February 17, 2005, Baby was sentenced to fifteen years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>imprisonment, with all but five years suspended, and five years probation upon release.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Baby noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. He argued that the circuit court erred in refusing his request to instruct the jury that it should return a verdict of not guilty of rape if it was persuaded that the complaining witness consented to sexual intercourse, but withdrew her consent after penetration; that the circuit court erred by denying Baby\u2019s request to remove a juror who indicated that he had read a newspaper article about the case; and that the circuit court erred in denying Baby\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude Dr. Burgess\u2019 testimony concerning \u201crape trauma syndrome.\u201d In a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed Baby\u2019s convictions, holding that the trial court erred in refusing to answer the questions submitted to the jury regarding whether a sex act initially consented to by the complaining witness can constitute rape if she withdraws consent after penetration has occurred. The intermediate appellate court also held, based upon its interpretation of the English common law that informed the statutory definition of rape, and consistent with language in <em>Battle v. State, </em>287 Md. 675, 684, 414 A.2d 1266, 1270 (1980),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that if a woman \u201cconsents [to sexual intercourse] prior to penetration and withdraws the consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>following penetration, there is no rape.\u201d <em>Baby v. State, </em>172 Md.App. 588, 617, 916 A.2d 410, 427 (2007). Additionally, the Court of Special Appeals decided that the trial court did not err when it allowed Dr. Burgess to testify as an expert witness on the subject of \u201crape trauma syndrome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 682, 916 A.2d at 435-36. The intermediate appellate court also determined that the trial court had properly exercised its discretion in waiting until the jury began deliberations to excuse a juror who had read a newspaper article about the case, but who had not shared what he read with any of the other jurors. <em>Id. </em>at 628, 916 A.2d at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Thereafter, the State filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari, raising the following two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">1. If a woman initially consents to vaginal intercourse, withdraws consent after penetration, and then is forced to continue intercourse against her will, is she a victim of rape?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">2. Regardless whether the trial court erred in its answers to the jury\u2019s questions, did the Court of Special Appeals err in reversing Baby\u2019s convictions for first degree sexual offense and third degree sexual offense, which were unrelated to the subject matter of the jury\u2019s questions?[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Baby filed a Conditional Cross-Petition for Writ of Certiorari, presenting this Court with the following additional two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">1. Did the trial court err by denying Respondent\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude, and his objection to, the testimony of Ann Burgess, who was offered by the State as an expert witness on \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d and related matters?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">2. Did the trial court err by refusing to remove a juror from the jury at the point when the juror admitted having read a newspaper article about Respondent\u2019s case?[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>We granted the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, as well as the Conditional Cross-Petition. <em>State v. Baby, </em>399 Md. 33, 922 A.2d 573 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The State contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding that the circuit court abused its discretion in refusing to directly address the two jury questions asking whether an individual could be guilty of rape if the complaining witness initially consented to intercourse, but withdrew her consent after penetration. The State primarily argues that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Battle, </em>287 Md. at 675, 414 A.2d at 1266, should not have been relied upon by the Court of Special Appeals to draw its conclusion that post-penetration withdrawal of consent, coupled with continuation of intercourse through force or threat of force, is not sufficient to constitute the elements required for a finding of rape. The State contends that the relevant language in <em>Battle, </em>that \u201c[o]n the other hand, ordinarily if [a woman] consents prior to penetration and withdraws the consent following penetration, there is no rape\u201d was dicta and therefore should not have been granted precedential value. Alternatively, the State argues that if we hold that the language in <em>Battle </em>is not dicta, or otherwise determine that the common law continues to define Maryland\u2019s modern rape law, and likewise find that the common law of rape does not criminalize continuation of sexual intercourse through force or threat of force after the victim has withdrawn her consent, then that aspect of the common law should be rejected as it is based on an obsolete view of the crime of rape, is inconsistent with existing Maryland law, and has been rejected by a majority of States that have considered the issue. The State additionally argues that the instructions provided by the court and used by the jurors accurately reflected Maryland law. The State also argues that, regardless of whether the trial court committed error in its answers to the jury\u2019s questions, the Court of Special Appeals was mistaken in reversing Baby\u2019s convictions for first degree and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>third degree sexual offense, as they were unrelated to the subject matter of the jury\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">In response to the State\u2019s contentions, Baby argues that the language in <em>Battle </em>was not dicta and was properly relied upon by the Court of Special Appeals. Baby further contends that the language in <em>Battle </em>was consistent with the English and American common law and the common law definitions of the basic elements of rape continue to govern prosecutions for rape. Baby additionally argues that the rule expressed in <em>Battle </em>is adequate and does not need to be changed, that the rule proposed by the State would be defective, and that if this Court were to adopt a new rule it should not apply retrospectively to the instant case. Baby also contends that, even if we were to find that a rule on post-penetration different than that articulated in <em>Battle </em>was applicable at Baby\u2019s trial, the trial court still committed error in its reference to the pattern instructions, which was not an adequate response to address the jury\u2019s confusion about the significance of post-penetration withdrawal of consent. Baby responds to the State\u2019s contention that the Court of Special Appeals should not have reversed the charges for first and third degree sexual offense by arguing that the intermediate appellate court could not have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial court\u2019s error in no way influenced the jury\u2019s verdicts. Baby additionally argues that the Court of Special Appeals correctly suggested that the jury could have been seeking clarification about the withdrawal of consent on all the counts for which it later convicted Baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Baby contends in his cross-petition that the circuit court erred in admitting the testimony of Dr. Burgess as an expert on \u201crape trauma syndrome.\u201d Baby argues that the reliability of rape trauma evidence has not been established and that the trial court should have conducted a hearing to determine whether the testimony met the <em>Frye-Reed </em>test for general acceptance in the scientific community. Baby additionally argues that Dr. Burgess failed to clearly define the nature and limits of \u201crape trauma syndrome,\u201d that she did not have an adequate basis for her opinions, and that she improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>rendered an opinion that J.L. had been raped. Lastly, Baby argues that the trial court erred in allowing the use of the term \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d as the phrase is prejudicial because it implies that the symptoms could only have been produced by rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In response to Baby\u2019s contentions, the State argues that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in allowing Dr. Burgess\u2019 testimony to show lack of consent and explain behavior that might appear inconsistent with being a victim of rape. The State contends that Dr. Burgess was highly qualified to testify as an expert witness on both \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d and post-traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d). The State additionally argues that Dr. Burgess did not express any opinion about J.L., that the testimony was not admitted to prove that a rape occurred, and that Dr. Burgess\u2019 testimony about \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d and PTSD removed the prejudicial effect of the former term. The State also contends that Baby\u2019s argument that \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d is not accepted as valid by the scientific community was not preserved as it was not previously raised in his motion <em>in limine </em>or objections at trial, nor in his briefs before the Court of Special Appeals or Cross-Petition for Writ of Certiorari before this Court. The State additionally argues that this Court has recognized the evidentiary value of \u201crape trauma syndrome,\u201d citing to our language in <em>Hutton v. State, </em>339 Md. 480, 504, 663 A.2d 1289, 1301 (1995) that \u201c[ejxpert testimony describing PTSD or rape trauma syndrome may be admissible, however, when ... offered, for example, to show lack of consent or to explain behavior that might be viewed as inconsistent with the happening of the event.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Because of a divergence of views regarding the issues presented in this case, we clarify our holdings as follows. In Part I, we conclude that the crime of first degree rape includes post-penetration vaginal intercourse accomplished through force or threat of force and without the consent of the victim, even if the victim consented to the initial penetration, such that our pronouncement in <em>Battle </em>was dicta. Thus, we hold that Baby\u2019s rape conviction should be reversed because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>the trial court erred by failing to more specifically instruct the jury on post-penetration withdrawal of consent by referring the jury to previously provided instructions on the elements of first degree rape, without further clarification. In Part II, we hold that Baby\u2019s convictions for first degree and third degree sexual offense, based on his conduct as principal in the second degree to the criminal, sexual conduct of his friend, Mike, should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Additionally, for guidance at the new trial, we suggest that \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d evidence should first be subjected to <em>Fryer-Reed </em>analysis, were an appropriate objection interposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">I. The Rape Conviction and the Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">In this case, the Court of Special Appeals held that if a woman \u201cconsents [to sexual intercourse] prior to penetration and withdraws the consent following penetration, there is no rape.\u201d <em>Baby, </em>172 Md.App. at 617, 916 A.2d at 427. In so concluding, the intermediate appellate court relied on what it characterized as a holding in <em>Battle, </em>287 Md. at 675, 414 A.2d at 1266, and determined that it was a correct statement of the common law of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">In <em>Battle, </em>the victim met John Battle when she parked her car at a service station near the Pimlico Race Track. When she returned to her car after visiting the Track, she discovered that Battle, who was in charge of parking, had washed her car. Upon learning that she did not have any money to pay him, Battle suggested that she \u201cdrive [him] past home\u201d and told her where he lived. <em>Id. </em>at 677, 414 A.2d at 1267 (alteration in original). She informed him that she did not have enough gas to do so, and he provided her with a couple of dollars with which to purchase fuel. She testified that on the way to his home they discussed a radio that he wanted to sell, and she accepted his invitation to examine the radio and determine if she wanted to purchase it.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Upon reaching his home, she accompanied Battle upstairs to his room to look at the radio. She testified that once they were upstairs he struck her and ordered her to remove her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>clothing. She responded \u201cYou got to be kidding,\u201d but he pulled a screwdriver from his pocket and put it against her head and again ordered her take off her clothes. <em>Id. </em>She testified that \u201che said he would kill me because he killed one time and he said he would kill again.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In fear for her safety, she took off her clothes, got in bed with him, and had vaginal intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">While she and Battle were having intercourse, a persistent knocking was heard at the downstairs door. The victim testified that when Battle went to answer the door, she went to a room across the hall from his bedroom and attempted to summon help. She stated that \u201cI was getting ready to get out of the window on the roof and he came in and caught me and pulled me back in and hit me.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678, 414 A.2d at 1267. Battle then dragged her back into bed and disrobed himself and her. There was again the sound of someone at the door; when Battle answered the door, the victim was able to attract the attention of some nearby children who summoned the police to rescue her.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Conversely, Battle testified that the victim asked him to have sexual intercourse with her. He said that he found her disrobed in his bedroom but denied that any sexual contact occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">After a period of deliberation, the jury addressed a written question to the trial judge, asking: \u201cWhen a <em>possible </em>sexual consensual relationship becomes non-consensual for some reason, during the course of the action\u2014can the act then be considered rape?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678, 414 A.2d at 1268 (emphasis in original). Because the trial judge was not certain that she understood the question, she inquired of the jury whether the question asked was \u201cwhere the original act of sex is by consent whether is it then possible the circumstances could change because of the victim\u2019s lack of consent after the original situation began as a consensual one,\u201d and the jury replied that that was what was meant. <em>Id. </em>The trial judge then told them, \u201cI will answer your question by saying, \u2018Yes, that it is possible for a situation to start out as consensual and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>then become a non-consensual one in the course of the event/ \u201d <em>id., </em>and continued with language taken from <em>Hazel v. State, </em>221 Md. 464, 469, 157 A.2d 922, 925 (1960), in which this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">With respect to the presence or absence of the element of consent, it is true, of course, that however reluctantly given, consent to the act at any time prior to penetration deprives the subsequent intercourse of its criminal character. There is, however, a wide difference between consent and submission to the act. Consent may involve submission, but submission does not necessarily imply consent. Furthermore, submission to a compelling force, or as a result of being put in fear, is not consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The trial judge then added, \u201cIt is not altogether clear as to what degree of resistance is necessary to establish the absence of consent; that is a question that you ... would have to determine on the basis of the evidence that you have heard during the course of trial.\u201d <em>Battle, </em>287 Md. at 679, 414 A.2d at 1268. She also provided additional instructions related to fear and resistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">When counsel were asked whether they had any objection to the court\u2019s instructions, defense counsel stated that he thought that in the jury\u2019s question, \u201cduring the course of the action\u201d referred specifically to intercourse and that once intercourse has commenced one cannot withdraw consent \u201cand start screaming rape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 679-80, 414 A.2d at 1268. The State suggested that the term also could have referred to the \u201cwhole chain of events, from the time the victim got to the parking lot\u201d or to a time after the parties \u201cgot in the bedroom or maybe after they had sex.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 680, 414 A.2d at 1268.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">In determining whether the trial court correctly responded to the jury\u2019s instruction, this Court began by stating that Maryland\u2019s statutory definition of rape<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was an outgrowth of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>the common law definition of rape interpreted in <em>Hazel. </em>We then engaged in a review of the history of rape in American common law. From our review, we concluded that \u201cconsent subsequent to the act of intercourse will not prevent its being rape.\u201d <em>Battle, </em>287 Md. at 681, 414 A.2d at 1269.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">We then turned to the question of \u201cthe effect of a withdrawal of consent prior to penetration,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 683, 414 A.2d at 1270, and considered various holdings in cases of our sister States, including those in <em>Wright v. State, </em>23 Tenn. (4 Hum.) 194, 198 (1843) (holding that the lower court\u2019s jury instruction that it \u201cis of no difference if the person abused consented through fear, or that she was a common prostitute, or that she assented after the fact, or that she was taken first with her own consent, if she were afterwards forced against her will\u201d was \u201ccorrect in every particular, and fully sustained by authority\u201d); <em>State v. Auld, </em>2 N.J. 426, 67 A.2d 175, 180 (1949) (holding that the trial court did not commit error by not instructing the jury that consent may not be -withdrawn during the act of intercourse); and <em>State v. Allen, </em>163 Kan. 374, 183 P.2d 458, 460 (1947) (holding that rape could still be found when a woman changed her mind about consenting to intercourse and the appellant resorted to force). We concluded that, \u201c[gjiven the fact that consent must precede penetration, it follows in our view that although a woman may have consented to a sexual encounter, even to intercourse, if that consent is withdrawn prior to the act of penetration, then it cannot be said that she has consented to sexual intercourse.\u201d <em>Battle, </em>287 Md. at 684, 414 A.2d at 1270. We then continued: \u201cOn the other hand, <em>ordinarily if </em>she consents prior to penetration and withdraws the consent following penetration, there is no rape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">We held that \u201cthe combination of the ambiguous [jury] question, ambiguously clarified by the trial judge, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>answer create sufficient confusion in this case to warrant reversal and a remand for a new trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 685, A.2d at 1271. Based upon our holding in <em>Midgett v. State, </em>216 Md. 26, 139 A.2d 209 (1958), we concluded that the trial court\u2019s response to the jury question was injurious because the absence of clear definitions of the terms \u201csituation\u201d and \u201cevent\u201d made it impossible to tell whether the court was discussing pre- or post-penetration withdrawal of consent, rendering the response confusing and not instructive. <em>Battle, </em>287 Md. at 684-85, 414 A.2d at 1270-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The State urges us to find the language in <em>Battle </em>that, \u201cordinarily, if she consents prior to penetration and withdraws the consent following penetration, there is no rape\u201d to be dicta and thus not precedential on the question of whether the continuation of intercourse with the use of force or threat of force after post-penetration \"withdrawal of consent constitutes rape. The State also notes that some of our sister States have themselves characterized the <em>Battle </em>language as dicta. <em>See State v. Siering, </em>35 Conn.App. 173, 644 A.2d 958, 963 n. 8 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>231 Conn. 914, 648 A.2d 158 (1994) (noting that the language in <em>Battle </em>\u201cis arguably dicta and thus will not be addressed here\u201d); <em>State v. Robinson, </em>496 A.2d 1067, 1070 (Me.1985) (stating that only one North Carolina case addressed the subject of post-penetration withdrawal of consent, even though <em>Battle </em>had been decided by that time). Baby, conversely, argues that the language was in fact part of the holding in <em>Battle, </em>a position Baby argues with which the Court of Special Appeals appears to have acquiesced in its statement that, the \u201cin-depth analysis engaged in by the Court of Appeals in <em>Battle </em>negates any notion that the pronouncement that prior consent vitiates the criminal character of the post penetration sexual act was inadvertent or mere dicta,\u201d <em>Baby, </em>172 Md.App. at 615, 916 A.2d at 425, although the Court of Special Appeals did recognize that \u201c[wjhether the statement at issue in <em>Battle </em>is <em>dicta, </em>however, is not the relevant question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616, 916 A.2d at 425-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In <em>Carstairs v. Cochran, </em>95 Md. 488, 499, 52 A. 601, 601 (1902), this Court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>It may be difficult to frame a concise definition of an \u201cobiter dictum\u201d ... and some courts incline to the rule that the most deliberate expression of opinion, upon a question distinctly raised in the record, and fully argued by counsel, may nevertheless be regarded as a dictum, unless essential to the actual disposition made of the case. But as Bouvier well says: \u201cIt is difficult to see why, in a philosophic point of view, the opinion of the court is not as persuasive on all the points which were so involved in the cause that it was the duty of counsel to argue them, and which were deliberately passed on by the court, as if the decision had hung upon but one point;\u201d and in Maryland the rule is in accord with this view.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In <em>Schmidt v. Prince George\u2019s Hospital, </em>366 Md. 535, 551, 784 A.2d 1112, 1121 (2001), Judge Glenn Harrell, writing for the Court, iterated that: \u201cWhen a question of law is raised properly by the issues in a case and the Court supplies a deliberate expression of its opinion upon that question, such opinion is not to be regarded as <em>obiter dictum, </em>although the final judgment in the case may be rooted in another point also raised by the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Our statement in <em>Battle, </em>287 Md. at 684, 414 A.2d at 1270, that \u201cordinarily, if she consents prior to penetration and withdraws the consent following penetration, there is no rape,\u201d is properly characterized as <em>obiter dictum </em>and will not be afforded precedential weight. It was not made on a point that was argued by counsel and deliberately addressed by this Court, but rather was a collateral statement. Most important is the fact that our decision in <em>Battle </em>was not dependent upon this statement; the holding would indeed be unaffected were that language to be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Additionally, the sentence in issue appears to be tacked on as an articulation of the converse of the Court\u2019s previous statement, although one should note, a converse which is predicated by the term \u201cordinarily.\u201d That the converse is not subjected to any analysis as to its application provides further support for the proposition that it is merely <em>obiter dictum, </em>and not part of our holding in <em>Battle.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>The sole issue before us in <em>Battle </em>was whether withdrawal of consent before penetration, followed by vaginal intercourse accomplished through force or threat of force, constituted rape. In addressing this issue, we relied upon 19th century commentaries and an analysis of the decisions of courts in our sister States to bulwark our conclusion. The Court of Special Appeals in this case, in turn, in addressing the issue of post-penetration withdrawal of consent, appropriately looked to the common law for guidance.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The intermediate appellate court relied on the <em>Battle </em>analysis, and it is this reliance on our historical analysis in <em>Battle </em>as applicable to the present case, with which we disagree. It is proverbially mixing apples and oranges, because the analysis in <em>Battle </em>only addressed the withdrawal of consent before penetration and was not extensive enough to be applicable to the issue of post-penetration withdrawal of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The gravamen of the distinction between our analysis in <em>Battle </em>and that of the Court of Special Appeals in this case lies in the historical importance that the intermediate appellate court placed on the notions of virginity, the harm of deflowering a virgin, and the importance of penetration to the crime of rape. Pivotal to this analysis is the Court of Special Appeals reliance on a Florida Law Review article, Ricki Lewis Tannen, <em>Setting the Agenda for the 1990s: The Historical Foundations of Gender Bias in the Law: A Context for Reconstruction, </em>42 Fla.L.Rev. 163 (1990), for the statement that the English common law was based upon the \u201ccultural mores\u201d of the laws of the Old Testament and the Middle Assyrian Laws of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Mesopotamia \u201cwhich undergird[ed] the notion that the crime of rape was complete upon penetration\u201d and which characterized the rape of a virgin as \u201can illegal trespass upon the father\u2019s property.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Baby, </em>172 Md.App. at 616 n. 6, 916 A.2d at 426 n. 6. The Court of Special Appeals stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYD\">it was the act of penetration that was the essence of the crime of rape; after this initial infringement upon the responsible male\u2019s interest in a woman\u2019s sexual and reproductive functions, any further injury was considered to be less consequential. The damage\u2014viewed from the perspective of the husband\u2019s or father\u2019s interest in the reproductive functions of the victim\u2014was done. It was this view that the moment of penetration was the point in time, after which a woman could never be \u201cre-flowered,\u201d that gave rise to the principle that, if a woman consents prior to penetration and withdraws consent following penetration, there is no rape. Maryland adheres to this tenet, having adopted the common law, which remains the law of the Land until and unless changed by the State\u2019s highest court or by statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 617, 916 A.2d at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">While it certainly may be the case that the common law\u2019s focus on penetration was somehow originally related to the \u201cde-flowering\u201d of virgins, a search of early English case law and scholarship reveals that by the time Maryland expressly adopted \u201cthe rules of the common law of England\u201d in 1639,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the English law of rape had evolved beyond the understanding of rape as merely a trespass upon a man\u2019s property. Before Maryland adopted the English common law, penetration could no longer be said to represent the completion of the harm caused by rape, although it was still focused on as sufficient evidence for the required element of vaginal intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In saying thus, we begin with Bracton\u2019s 13th century treatise <em>On the Laws and Customs of England.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In the second volume of his work, Bracton discusses the Pleas of the Crown, including an appeal called \u201cthe rape of virgins.\u201d 2 Bracton, <em>On the Laws and Customs of England </em>414 (George E. Woodbine ed., Samuel E. Thorne trans., 1997). Bracton defines the appeal as \u201ca crime imputed by a woman to the man by whom she says she has been forcibly ravished against the king\u2019s peace.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He noted that in \u201cancient times[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] the practice was as follows: If a man meets a woman or comes across her somewhere, whether she is alone or has companions, he is to let her go in peace; ... if he lies with her, he incurs the loss of his life and his members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418. Addressing the law of his own time, he described the punishment of the rape of a virgin as \u201cthe loss of members, that there be member for member, for when a virgin is defiled she loses her member and therefore let her defiler be punished in the pants in which he offended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414. He goes on to clarify that, although the crime of rape was not limited to the defilement of virgins, the most severe punishment was reserved for a violation of a virgin:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Punishment of this kind does not follow in the case of every woman, though she is forcibly ravished, but some other severe punishment does follow, according as she is married or a widow living a respectable life, a nun or matron, a recognized concubine or a prostitute plying her trade without discrimination of person, all of whom the king must protect for the preservation of his peace, though a like punishment will not be imposed for each.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 415 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">From Bracton\u2019s commentary, we find that as early as the time of Henry III, English law had gone beyond the ancient focus on virgins as property of their fathers or husbands to recognize that any woman, regardless of whether a virgin, could be a victim of rape, although the punishment for the crime would vary. <em>See id. </em>While at the time of Bracton\u2019s writing the name of the offense still reflected its origin in the protection of a woman\u2019s chastity, some form of punishment was available to any woman \u201cforcibly ravished,\u201d even if she be \u201ca recognized concubine or a prostitute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Further evidence that the English common law criminalized the rape of any woman, regardless of whether she was a \u201cdeflowered\u201d virgin, is found in the writings of Sir Matthew Hale. In his <em>The History of the Pleas of the Crown, </em>Hale reviews the history of rape in the English law and traces the transformation of the punishment for rape:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">Rape was anciently a felony, as appears by the laws of <em>Adlestane </em>mentioned by <em>Bracton, </em>and was punished by loss of life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">But in process of time that punishment seemed too hard; but the truth is, a severe punishment succeeded in the place thereof, <em>viz. </em>castration and the loss of eyes, as appears by Bracton (who wrote in the time of Henry III.)____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-11\">This kind of punishment it seems continued till 3 E[dward] 1. and then by the statute of Westminister] 1. it was enacted, \u201cThat none ravish or take with force a damsel within age with her consent nor against her consent, nor no dame, damsel of age, nor any other woman against her will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>... and the party convict shall suffer two years imprisonment, and be ransomed at the king\u2019s pleasure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\">But by the statute of Westminister] 2. the offense of rape is made felony, \u201cIf a man ravish a married woman, dame, or damsel, where she neither assented before nor after, <em>Eyt judgment de vy &amp; member; </em>if she assent after, yet the king shall have the suit.\u201d[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">1 Matthew Hale, <em>The History of the Pleas of the Crown </em>626-27 (Sollom Emlyn ed., 1847) (citations omitted) (footnotes omitted). By the time that rape was made a statutory offense late in 13th century England, then, the reference to virginity was removed as well as discussion of any status of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Hale himself defines rape as \u201cthe carnal knowledge of any woman above the age of ten years against her will, and of a woman-child under the age of ten years with or against her will,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 627, 629, and cites as illustrative <em>Lord Audley\u2019s Case, </em>123 Eng. Rep. 1140 (1631). Also known as the Earl of Castlehaven, Lord Audley was charged with rape for prostituting his wife to another man against her will. Hale stated that not only was the assailant guilty of rape, but \u201cthe husband, being present, aiding and assisting, is also guilty as a principal in rape.... [I]n this case the wife may be a witness against her husband, and accordingly she was admitted, and [her husband] and [her assailant, Lord North] were both executed. 8 <em>Car. </em>1. <em>Casus comiiis Castlehaven.\u201d </em>1 Hale, <em>The History of the Pleas of the Crown </em>at 628-29. That a husband could be found guilty of rape for allowing another man to take his wife against her will refutes the analysis that the English common law of rape was still tied to the Middle Eastern laws surrounding virginity and trespass against the property of men.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Sir William Blackstone, writing in 1769, also notes in his <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England </em>the contrast between the civil law and the English common law on the subject of rape.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Discussing the civil law\u2019s prohibition against a prostitute \u201cor common harlot\u201d being the victim of rape, and referencing Bracton, Blackstone states that \u201cthe law of England does not judge so hardly of offenders, as to cut off all opportunity of retreat even from common strumpets, and to treat them as never capable of amendment. It therefore holds it to be felony to force even a concubine or harlot; because the woman may have forsaken that unlawful course of life.\u201d 4 William Blackstone, <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England </em>213 (1769). Again, the reference to \u201crecovering\u201d prostitutes, capable of being the victims of rape, confirms that the English had progressed to a consideration of rape focusing on the harm done to the woman, any woman, rather than on a trespass on a man\u2019s interest in the virginity of his daughter or wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Hale and Blackstone wrote before the time of American independence, and Bracton\u2019s writings and Lord Audley\u2019s Case occurred before the founding of Maryland, so that Maryland\u2019s common law of rape reflected the offense as explored in their writings, rather than on the ancient conception. Our research leads us to conclude that the English common law of rape adopted by Maryland in the 17th century no longer reflected the ancient view that the harm done through rape was fully accomplished upon penetration, which itself continued to be considered a required element. <em>See </em>1 Hale, <em>History of the Common Law of England </em>628 (\u201cTo make a rape there must be an actual penetration____\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>After the Revolution, in the American States there is a paucity of cases addressing the issue of withdrawal of consent. Withdrawal of consent arises infrequently in early American case law, and never directly presents the issue of post-penetration withdrawal of consent. In <em>Wright v. State, </em>23 Tenn. (4 Hum.) at 195, for example, the Supreme Court of Tennessee held that is was not error for the trial court to instruct the jury to find the defendant guilty of rape \u201cif the person abused, consented through fear, or that she was a common prostitute, or that she assented after the fact, or that she was taken at first with her own consent, if she was afterwards forced against her will.\u201d <em>See also Dawkins v. State, </em>58 Ala. 376, 378 (1877) (noting that under common law, the \u201cconsent of the woman, yielded at any time before the act of penetration was complete, relieved the offense of its felonious character\u201d); <em>State v. Shields, </em>45 Conn. 256, 259 (1877) (holding there was no error in jury instruction that the jury \u201cmust be satisfied that there was no consent during any part of the act\u201d); <em>Commonwealth v. McDonald, </em>110 Mass. 405, 405-06 (1872) (same); <em>People v. Marrs, </em>125 Mich. 376, 84 N.W. 284, 286 (1900) (\u201cConsent, or failure to use the proper resistance, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>any time before the act of intercourse has actually occurred, precludes conviction for rape.\u201d); <em>Bailey v. Commonwealth, </em>82 Va. 107, 111 (1886) (noting that if the victim \u201cconsent[s] before the act, it will not be rape\u201d); <em>State v. Niles, </em>47 Vt. 82, 84 (1874) (holding there was no error in trial court\u2019s instruction that \u201cif the respondent commenced and entered upon sexual intercourse with her consent, but she then withdrew her consent, and the respondent forcibly continued the intercourse after he had knowledge of her dissent, it would be rape\u201d); <em>State v. Hartigan, </em>32 Vt. 607, 611 (1860) (holding that consent after the assault did not excuse the rape).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In only two of the early American cases is there any support for Baby\u2019s view, and the language in both is arguably dicta. In <em>State v. McCaffrey, </em>63 Iowa 479, 19 N.W. 331 (Iowa 1884), the Supreme Court of Iowa considered whether there was sufficient evidence of lack of consent for the defendant to have been convicted of rape where he had vaginal intercourse with his 11 year old sister-in-law after she had allowed him to \u201ctake improper liberty with her person\u201d in the past and \u201creadily accepted his invitation to lie on the bed with him and allowed him to raise her dress and unbutton her drawers,\u201d but the victim testified \u201cthat afterwards she screamed and made resistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331. In concluding that there was sufficient evidence of lack of consent, the Court stated that \u201c[wjhether she [screamed] before he had effected penetration is not entirely clear, but we think that there was evidence tending to show that she did\u201d and we \u201cthink that the jury might have believed that the pain preceded penetration, and that if the screams and resistance followed immediately upon the pain, they preceded penetration also.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331-32. While this language suggests that the victim\u2019s withdrawal of consent must have preceded penetration in order to be sufficient, such a rule is not explicitly stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">In <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>100 Mo. 382, 12 S.W. 376 (1889), the Supreme Court of Missouri also considered whether there was sufficient evidence for a trier of fact to convict for the rape of a woman \u201cof a weak mind,\u201d who may have been \u201cdazed\u201d at the time of the rape. <em>Id. </em>at 378. In concluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>that there was sufficient evidence to find that victim had not consented at the time of the rape, the Court noted that it \u201cis doubtless true, as a proposition of law, that if consent is given after the assault, and before the act is completed by penetration, it will not be rape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 378-79. Like the language in <em>McCaffrey, </em>this statement suggests that consent had to be withdrawn before penetration in order for the defendant to be convicted of rape. Such a rule is not explicitly stated, however, and the Court\u2019s decision focused on the victim\u2019s state of mind, not the precise point at which consent was withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">In more recent years, the courts in many of our sister States have directly considered whether withdrawal of consent after penetration can constitute rape. Of these, only one court has held that it does not, the Supreme Court of North Carolina in <em>State v. Way, </em>297 N.C. 293, 254 S.E.2d 760 (1979). In <em>Way, </em>the Court was asked to decide whether the trial court erred in answering the jury\u2019s question \u201cwhether consent can be withdrawn\u201d by instructing that \u201cconsent initially given could be withdrawn and if the intercourse continued through use of force or threat of force and that the act at that point was no longer consensual this would constitute the crime of rape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 761. The Court determined that the instruction was erroneous, holding that if \u201cthe actual penetration is accomplished with the woman\u2019s consent, the accused is not guilty of rape,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 762, without any further analysis or citation of authority. Because of this lack of analysis, we do not find the <em>Way </em>decision to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In <em>State v. Robinson, </em>496 A.2d at 1067, the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine was called upon to decide whether the trial judge had provided the jury with an incorrect jury instruction. During its deliberations, the jury sent the following question to the judge: \u201cConcerning the law\u2014if two people began consenting to an act, then one person says no and the other continues\u2014is that rape?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1069. The trial court responded by instructing the jury, \u201cif a couple consensually engages in sexual intercourse and one or the other changes his or her mind, and communicates the revocation or change of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>mind of the consent, and the other partner continues the sexual intercourse by compulsion of the party who changes his or her mind, then it would be rape. The critical element there is the <em>continuation under compulsion.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis in original). On appeal, the Court found no error in the trial court\u2019s instructions. Noting its disagreement with the North Carolina Court in the <em>Way </em>opinion, which it characterized as avoiding \u201cany relevant analysis,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1070, the <em>Robinson </em>Court stated that \u201cthe controlling provision of the Maine Criminal Code[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>] as well as common sense, establishes the correctness of [the trial court\u2019s] instruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1069. In accordance with the emphasis given \u201ccompulsion\u201d in Maine\u2019s statutory definition of rape, which in its statute is conflated with lack of consent, the Court further stated that \u201c[w]e emphasize that the ongoing intercourse, initiated we here assume with the prosecutrix\u2019s consent, did not become rape merely because she revoked her consent. It became rape if and when the prosecutrix thereafter submitted to the defendant\u2019s sexual assault only because [of force or the threat of force].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">In <em>State v. Bunyard, </em>31 Kan.App.2d 853, 75 P.3d 750 (2003), the Kansas intermediate appellate court considered whether there was sufficient evidence of rape when the victim was a willing participant up until the time of initial penetration and did not withdraw consent until post-penetration. The Kansas statute was very similar to Maryland\u2019s current rape statute, as it defined rape as \u201c(1) Sexual intercourse with a person who does not consent to the sexual intercourse, under any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>following circumstances: (A) When the victim is overcome by force or fear----\u201d Kansas Statutes Annotated Section 21-3502 (1996, 2002 Supp.). Responding to the appellant\u2019s contention that the moment of penetration is the crucial point at which to determine the presence or absence of consent, the court concluded that nowhere in its statutory definition of rape or sexual intercourse was it stated that intercourse ended with penetration, but rather that penetration \u201cmerely establishes a minimum amount of contact necessary to prove the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756. The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">A participant in sexual intercourse may withdraw consent after penetration has occurred. The continuation of sexual intercourse after consent has been withdrawn, and in the presence of force or fear, is rape.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-8\"><em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals of Kansas, therefore, found that there was sufficient evidence to find the defendant guilty of rape. The Supreme Court of Kansas reversed on other grounds, but agreed that the Kansas statute \u201cproscribes <em>all </em>nonconsensual sexual intercourse that is accomplished by force or fear, not just the initial penetration.\u201d <em>State v. Bunyard, </em>281 Kan. 392, 133 P.3d 14, 28 (2006) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">In <em>State v. Siering, </em>644 A.2d at 958, the intermediate appellate court of Connecticut also addressed whether the trial court\u2019s response to a jury question constituted error. The jury\u2019s question in that case was \u201cif a person agrees to sexual intercourse then changes her mind, withdraws her consent, but is compelled to continue intercourse by use of force, does this constitute sexual assault?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 961. The trial court responded that \u201cif there exists consensual intercourse and the alleged victim changes her mind and communicates the revocation or change of mind of consent and the other person continues the sexual intercourse by compelling the victim through the use of force then it would be sexual assault in the first degree.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The court rejected the defendant\u2019s argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>ment that \u201cif there is consent at the moment of penetration, the subsequent withdrawal of consent .and continuation of intercourse accompanied by force cannot convert consensual intercourse into sexual assault.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">As with Maryland\u2019s definition of rape, Connecticut\u2019s definition of sexual assault in the first degree was originally derived from the English common law, and a statutory definition, based on the common law, was codified in the 1970s. In considering the propriety of the trial court\u2019s answer to the jury question, the court noted that the Connecticut statute did not suggest that \u201c \u2018intercourse is complete\u2019 upon penetration; rather, it provides that \u2018penetration, however slight, [is sufficient] to complete ... intercourse,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 962 (alteration in original) (ellipses in original), quoting <em>State v. Mackor, </em>11 Conn.App. 316, 527 A.2d 710, 713 (1987), and stated that it did</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5h\">not construe [its definition of intercourse] to mean that only the initial penetration constitutes intercourse. The defendant\u2019s argument would mean that the act that commences intercourse is also the act that simultaneously concludes intercourse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">It is axiomatic that statutes are not to be interpreted to arrive at bizarre or absurd results. The defendant\u2019s construction of the statute would mean that if intercourse is continued by force after the victim withdrew consent, it would not constitute sexual assault unless the victim, upon revoking consent and struggling against the defendant, succeeds in momentarily displacing the male organ, followed by an act of repenetration by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">The absurdity of this construction is demonstrated not only by the difficulty involved in the close evidentiary determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>tion required but also because it protects from prosecution a defendant whose physical force is so great or so overwhelming that there is no possibility of the victim\u2019s causing even momentary displacement of the male organ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 962-63, 527 A.2d 710 (citations omitted). We agree with the Connecticut appellate court that concluding that the act of penetration ends the act of sexual intercourse would lead to absurd results not contemplated by the drafters of our rape statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">We find the analyses conducted by the Maine Court in <em>Robinson, </em>the Kansas court in <em>Bunyard, </em>and the Connecticut court in <em>Siering </em>to be persuasive.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We conclude, utilizing a similar framework, that our own rape statute punishes the act of penetration, which persists after the withdrawal of consent. Nor has our analysis of the English law of rape at the time of the Revolution yielded any commentary or case law that would support the interpretation that initial penetration completes the act of intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Based upon the foregoing analysis, we hold that a woman may withdraw consent for vaginal intercourse after penetration has occurred and that, after consent has been withdrawn, the continuation of vaginal intercourse by force or the threat of force may constitute rape. We iterate that force or the threat of force is, however, an essential element of the crime of rape as we first emphasized in <em>Hazel, </em>221 Md. at 469, 157 A.2d at 925:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">Force is an essential element of the crime and to justify a conviction, the evidence must warrant a conclusion either that the victim resisted and her resistance was overcome by force or that she was prevented from resisting by threats to her safety. But no particular amount of force, either actual or constructive, is required to constitute rape. Necessarily that fact must depend on the prevailing circumstances---[Fjorce may exist without violence. If the acts and threats of the defendant were reasonably calculated to create in the mind of the victim\u2014having regard to the circumstances in which she was placed\u2014a real apprehension, due to fear, of imminent bodily harm, serious enough to impair or overcome her will to resist, then such acts and threats are the equivalent of force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-8\"><em>See also State v. Rusk, </em>289 Md. 230, 244, 424 A.2d 720, 727 (1981) (holding that \u201cthe victim\u2019s fear be reasonably grounded in order to obviate the need for either proof of actual force on the part of the assailant or physical resistance on the part of the victim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">We, nevertheless, agree with the Court of Special Appeals that, in responding to the jury\u2019s questions, the trial court should have directly addressed the jurors\u2019 confusion on the effect of withdrawal of consent during intercourse, rather than simply referring the jurors to previously provided instructions on the elements of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">The State urges us to find that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion when she responded as she did to the jury\u2019s questions regarding post-penetration withdrawal of consent and argues that the trial court\u2019s reaffirmation of the previous<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>ly provided instructions, substantively similar to the pattern instruction on the elements of rape, was sufficient to address the jury\u2019s questions, so long as we hold that withdrawal of consent post-penetration constitutes rape. The State cites <em>Battle </em>for the premise that a court\u2019s decision to reinstruct the jury is an abuse of discretion only if it that instruction is ambiguous, misleading, or confusing, 287 Md. at 685, 414 A.2d at 1271, as well as referring to the reasoning in <em>Robinson, Siering, </em>and other decisions of our sister States, in which no error was found in trial courts\u2019 jury instructions under similar circumstances. Also citing <em>Brogden v. State, </em>384 Md. 631, 648, 866 A.2d 129, 139 (2005), the State alternatively argues that the trial judge had no duty to reply to one of the jury\u2019s questions because it referenced details such as ejaculation (\u201cclimax\u201d) that were not related to either the State or Baby\u2019s theories of the case, and so the questions had nothing to do with the case as it was presented. The State alternatively argues that, if we do determine that the trial court erred in response to the jury questions, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as it had no effect on jury\u2019s verdicts on any of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Baby argues that the trial court committed error by not providing the jury with the law it needed to decide the case, citing <em>Lovell v. State, </em>347 Md. 623, 702 A.2d 261 (1997), for the proposition that the trial court has a duty to provide specific instruction on the law when a jury\u2019s questions indicate that it needs the information in order to reach a firm verdict. Baby argues that because the jury repeatedly asked for clarification on the effect of post-penetration withdrawal of consent, the trial court committed error by failing to directly address that issue and instead referring the jury to the pattern instructions. Citing <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976), Baby argues that the failure of the trial court to specifically address the jury\u2019s questions was not harmless error as it cannot be asserted, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the jury\u2019s verdict on the first degree rape charge was not affected by the lack of clarification on the issue of post-penetration withdrawal of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>During deliberations, the jury submitted to the trial court a note which asked, \u201cIf a female consents to sex initially and, during the course of the sex act to which she consented, for whatever reason, she changes her mind and the man continues until climax, does the result constitute rape?\u201d While Baby\u2019s attorney argued that the court should respond to the note in the negative, the court found the question as phrased to be confusing and ambiguous, as it was unclear what was specifically meant by \u201cduring the course of the sex act,\u201d and viewed the note as potentially presenting a question of fact, rather than law. The judge, therefore, replied, \u201cI am unable to answer this question as posed. Please reread the instructions as to each element and apply the law to the facts as you find them.\u201d The following morning, the jury submitted another note which read, \u201cIf at any time the woman says stop is that rape?\u201d Baby\u2019s counsel requested that the court provide the jury with \u201cthe exact answer that you gave to the note last night.\u201d The court, characterizing the second question as a more simple variation of the first, instructed the jury, \u201cThis is a question that you as a jury must decide. I have given the legal definition of rape which includes the definition of consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The definition which the trial judge had given was that, \u201cRape is unlawful vaginal intercourse with a female by force or threat of force and without her consent.\u201d The trial court also had supplied the jury with the descriptions of \u201cvaginal intercourse,\u201d \u201cforce,\u201d and \u201cconsent\u201d which were taken from the pattern jury instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">Vaginal intercourse means the penetration of the penis into the vagina. The slightest penetration is sufficient. An emission of semen is not required. The amount of force necessary depends upon the circumstances. No particular amount of force is required, but it must be sufficient to overcome the resistance of the victim. You must be satisfied that the victim either resisted and that this resistance was overcome by force or threat of force or that the victim was prevented from resisting by force or threat of force. She must have resisted to the extent of her ability at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>time unless her resistance or will to resist was overcome by force or fear that was reasonable under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">Finally, consent means actually agreeing to the act of intercourse rather than merely submitting as a result of force or threat of force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-6\"><em>See </em>Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction, Section 4:29.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">In <em>Lovell, </em>347 Md. at 623, 702 A.2d at 261, we held that a trial court must respond to a question from a deliberating jury in a way that clarifies the confusion evidenced by the query when the question involves an issue central to the case. We concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in a capital case when it refused to provide further guidance on the term \u201cyouthful age\u201d when youthful age was a statutory mitigating circumstance. <em>Id. </em>at 660, 702 A.2d at 279. In reaching our holding, we cited <em>Bollenbach v. United States, </em>326 U.S. 607, 612-13, 66 S.Ct. 402, 405, 90 L.Ed. 350, 354 (1946), in which Justice Frankfurter, writing for the Court, stated that when \u201ca jury makes explicit its difficulties a trial judge should clear them away with concrete accuracy,\u201d as well as to <em>Price v. Glosson Motor Lines, Inc., </em>509 F.2d 1033, 1037 (4th Cir.1975), for the proposition that when \u201ca jury makes a specific difficulty known ... and when the difficulty involved is an issue ... central to the case ... helpful response is mandatory.\u201d <em>Lovell, </em>347 Md. at 658-59, 702 A.2d at 278-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The question before us, then, is whether the jury\u2019s questions made explicit its difficulty with an issue central to the case such that the trial court was required to respond to the questions in a manner that directly addressed the difficulty. In both questions, the jurors inquired about the effect of a woman withdrawing consent during vaginal intercourse. The jury\u2019s questions relating to the timing of withdrawal of consent certainly touched upon an issue central to its ability to determine whether Baby had committed the crime of first degree rape. Referring the jury to the legal definition of rape that the court had previously provided was not sufficient to address either of the jury\u2019s questions as the definition makes no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>reference to the issue of post-penetration withdrawal of consent which was central to the jury\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The State\u2019s reference to <em>Brogden, </em>384 Md. at 631, 866 A.2d at 129, is misplaced because the jury\u2019s questions directly touched upon the State\u2019s argument that the necessary element of absence of consent could be ascertained from the evidence. In <em>Brogden, </em>we were asked to decide whether it was error for the trial court to reply to jury questions by explaining a defense to the charge of wearing, carrying or transporting a handgun, where that defense was never proffered by the defendant. The jury questions at issue in <em>Brogden </em>were: \u201cIs having a gun a crime?\u201d and \u201cDoes the State have the burden to prove that he did not have a license ... ?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635, 866 A.2d at 131. In responding to the second question, the court instructed the jury that \u201cyou may wear, or carry, or transport a handgun, if you have a license, in accordance with the terms of the license.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 639, 866 A.2d at 133. We concluded that, while a trial court has discretion in giving supplemental instructions to the jury, \u201cit is only within the ambit of the trial judge\u2019s discretion in the first instance if the supplemental instruction actually relates to an issue presented at trial,\u201d and that the trial court therefore erred in giving the instruction as it was never argued that the defendant did or did not have a gun license. <em>Id. </em>at 640-41, 866 A.2d at 134-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The State argues that jury\u2019s reference to \u201cclimax\u201d in its first jury instruction makes its question analogous to the question in <em>Brogden, </em>such that the trial court was not required to specifically address the content of the question as the issue of ejaculation was not argued at trial. The jury\u2019s reference to \u201cclimax,\u201d however, while inapposite, did not negate the relevancy of their query, because the parties and the trial judge surmised that the question was not about climax or ejaculation, but about post-penetration withdrawal of consent. Additionally, the jury\u2019s second question made no reference to ejaculation or any other extraneous details, simply asking, \u201cIf at any time the woman says stop is that rape?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>We cannot determine that the trial court\u2019s error in not reinstructing on post-penetration withdrawal of consent is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, as required by <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976). In <em>Dorsey, </em>this Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">when an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of\u2014whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWt\"><em>Id. </em>We cannot say that it is beyond any reasonable doubt that a response that more directly addressed this issue would have yielded a guilty verdict on the first degree rape count.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">II. The First Degree and Third Degree Sexual Offenses</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The State also argues that, regardless of whether we remand for a new trial on the counts of rape, we should not reverse Baby\u2019s convictions for first and third degree sexual offense as they were unrelated to the subject matter of the jury\u2019s questions. Baby, conversely, contends that the failure of the trial court to specifically address the jury\u2019s questions was not harmless error as it cannot be asserted, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the jury\u2019s verdicts on the first and third degree sexual offense charges were not affected by the lack of clarification on the issue of post-penetration withdrawal of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Like the Court of Special Appeals, we do not find the State\u2019s argument persuasive that the jury\u2019s questions only represented doubt as to the effect of withdrawal of consent in relation to intercourse. It is true that the jury\u2019s instructions specifically mentioned consent \u201cto sex\u201d and \u201crape,\u201d and did not specifically mention the actions for which Baby was convicted on the sexual offense charges, specifically aiding and abetting Mike in an act of anal penetration and touching J.L.\u2019s breast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>and vagina without her consent. Lack of consent is an element common to both rape and first and third degree sexual offenses, however.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Any clarification which the jury received on the element of consent would have been applicable to its understanding of the first and third degree sexual offense counts, as well as the rape charges. A further instruction on the effect of post-penetration withdrawal of consent may have conceivably affected the jury\u2019s verdict on the charge of rape, so it may have altered the verdicts on the sexual offense charges. Applying the <em>Dorsey </em>standard, we cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial court\u2019s error in not clarifying the effect of post-penetration withdrawal of consent was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The Testimony of Dr. Ann Burgess as an Expert on \u201cRape Trauma Syndrome\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Although we need not address the issue of whether Baby preserved his objection to the admission of the testimony of Dr. Ann Burgess as an expert on \u201crape trauma syndrome,\u201d for the guidance of the circuit court on remand, should Dr. Burgess be recalled during a new trial, we shall address Baby\u2019s contention that Dr. Burgess\u2019 expert testimony on \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d should have been subjected to a <em>Fryer-Reed </em>hearing prior to its admission, assuming the interposition of an appropriate objection. Baby argues a number of reasons why Dr. Burgess\u2019 testimony on \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d should not have been admitted into evidence, in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>eluding that the term \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d was prejudicial and that she improperly rendered an opinion that J.L. had been raped; we only address, however, Baby\u2019s argument that the testimony was inadmissible because the reliability of \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d was not subjected to scrutiny under the <em>Frye-Reed </em>standard. Baby argues that because \u201c[n]o appellate court in Maryland has approved the introduction of \u2018rape trauma syndrome\u2019 evidence in a criminal trial for any purpose,\u201d such evidence must first be submitted to a <em>Frye-Reed </em>inquiry to determine general acceptance in the scientific community before a trial court can consider allowing expert testimony based upon this scientific theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Dr. Burgess was asked to testify about post-traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) and \u201crape trauma syndrome.\u201d As Dr. Burgess testified, \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d is a term that she and a colleague developed in 1974 to describe the \u201cresponse patterns\u201d they observed in women who had been raped. Dr. Burgess described how many of the general public\u2019s perceptions concerning rape are incongruous with the behaviors she and her colleagues have observed in the victims of sexual assault. In response to questions from the State, Dr. Burgess also stated whether she thought that certain actions such as offering \u201cminimal, physical resistance\u201d against her attacker, not immediately reporting the rape to the first person she saw \u201ceven if that person might be their best friend,\u201d and engaging in everyday activities within a short time after the rape such as \u201cgoing to a supermarket and shopping,\u201d would be consistent with the behavior of a victim of rape, such behaviors as those explicated in J.L.\u2019s testimony. The State offered Dr. Burgess as an expert witness in order to explain how the perceived aberrant behavior of victims of sexual assault can be explained as a result of \u201crape trauma syndrome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In <em>Reed, </em>283 Md. at 374, 391 A.2d at 364, this Court was asked to rule on the admissibility of voice identification testimony based on the analysis of spectrograms, otherwise known as \u201cvoiceprints.\u201d In concluding that \u201cvoiceprint\u201d analysis was inadmissible in Maryland courts as evidence of voice identifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>tion, we adopted the test for establishing the reliability of scientific methodology articulated in <em>Frye v. United States, </em>293 F. 1013, 1014 (D.C.Cir.1923). We characterized the <em>Frye </em>standard as requiring that \u201cbefore a scientific opinion will be received as evidence at trial, the basis of that opinion must be shown to be generally accepted as reliable within the expert\u2019s particular scientific field. Thus, according to the <em>Frye </em>standard, if a new scientific technique\u2019s validity is in controversy in the relevant scientific community, ... then expert testimony based upon its validity cannot be admitted into evidence.\u201d <em>Reed, </em>283 Md. at 381, 391 A.2d at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\"><em>Reed </em>set forth <em>Frye </em>as a \u201clegal standard which governs the trial judge\u2019s determination of a threshold issue,\u201d stating that \u201cif a technique does not meet the <em>Frye </em>standard, a trial judge will have no occasion to reach [the] further issues\u201d of whether the expert testimony \u201cwill be helpful to the jury [and whether] ... the expert is properly qualified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 391 A.2d at 372. <em>See also Clemons v.

Rather, our analysis in <em>Hutton </em>supports the proposition that \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d represents a scientific theory or methodology whose reliability must be established under <em>Frye-Reed </em>before opinions based upon it can be admitted into evidence, <em>see id. </em>at 493-97, 663 A.2d at 1295-96, as also reflected in the decisions of courts in our sister States that have addressed \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d and its umbrella syndrome, PTSD.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>We have reaffirmed the importance of <em>Frye-Reed </em>analysis in determining the validity and reliability of a wide variety of scientific methodologies and conclusions, including various syndromes.

We held that while the <em>Frye-Reed </em>test was not applicable to the eyewitness identification evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to admit the expert testimony as its decision was also based on an alternate ground. In our analysis of the applicability of the <em>Frye-Reed </em>standard in <em>Bloodsworth, </em>we noted with approval the similarity between the catalog of types of evidence which we stated would be subjected to <em>Frye </em>analysis in <em>Reed </em>and a list of scientific devices or processes to which California courts had applied <em>Frye </em>analysis, as provided by the California court in <em>People v.

I agree that the trial court erred in not answering the jury\u2019s note with respect to the effect of a woman\u2019s withdrawal of initial consent post-penetration on the elements of rape. In my view, however, <em>Battle v. State, </em>287 Md. 675, 414 A.2d 1266 (1980), controlled the trial court\u2019s response, and the court should have told the jury that if a woman consents prior to penetration and withdraws the consent following penetration, there is no rape. Nonetheless, I would expressly overrule that aspect of <em>Battle </em>and hold, prospectively only, \u201cthat post-penetration withdrawal of consent negates initial consent for the purposes of sexual offense crimes and, when coupled with the other elements, may constitute the crime of rape.\u201d <em>See State v. Baby, </em>404 Md. 220, 271-72, 946 A.2d 463, 493 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">I disagree with the judgment of the majority reversing petitioner\u2019s convictions for sexual offenses in the first and third degree. I would hold that the error in the failure to clarify the elements of rape has no bearing whatsoever on the sexual offenses committed by Mike and in which petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>had been convicted as a principal in the second degree. Therefore, I would affirm those two convictions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">The majority holds that a woman may withdraw consent for vaginal intercourse after penetration has occurred and that, after consent has been withdrawn, the continuation of vaginal intercourse by force or the threat of force may constitute rape. <em>Baby, </em>404 Md. at 260, 946 A.2d at 486. I agree with that conclusion. Because the trial court did not directly address the jurors\u2019 confusion on the effect of withdrawal of consent during the elements of rape, the Court reverses petitioner\u2019s convictions. The Court reverses not only for rape, but for the other convictions for first degree and third degree sexual conduct. <em>Baby, </em>404 Md. at 260, 946 A.2d at 487.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The majority reasons that \u201cthe jury\u2019s questions relating to the timing of withdrawal of consent certainly touched upon an issue central to its ability to determine whether Baby had committed the crime of first degree rape.\u201d <em>Baby, </em>404 Md. at 263, 946 A.2d at 488-89. The jury was obviously struggling with the legal definition of rape and particularly the issue of post-penetration withdrawal of consent, and I agree that the trial court should have supplemented its instructions to aid the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">I part company with the majority view as to whether the language in <em>Battle </em>was a holding or <em>dicta. </em>If it was <em>dicta, </em>as the majority states, then on remand, petitioner may be retried and the jury should be instructed that a woman\u2019s withdrawal of consent, post-penetration, could be rape. If the language in <em>Battle </em>was a holding of this Court, then if petitioner is retried, the jury should be instructed to the contrary and consistent with the <em>Battle </em>language, because that was the law when the acts in question occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">As to any effect of the court\u2019s error as to the rape instruction on the other sexual offense convictions, the majority holds that those offenses could have been infected by the trial court\u2019s failure to clarify the instruction and reverses, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>\u201cIt is true that the jury\u2019s instructions specifically mentioned consent \u2018to sex\u2019 and \u2018rape,\u2019 and did not specifically mention the actions for which Baby was convicted on the sexual offense charges, specifically aiding and abetting Mike in an act of anal penetration and touching J.L.\u2019s breast and vagina without her consent. Lack of consent is an element common to both rape and first and third degree sexual offenses, however. Any clarification which the jury received on the element of consent would have been applicable to its understanding of the first and third degree sexual offense counts, as well as the rape charges. A further instruction on the effect of post-penetration withdrawal of consent may have conceivably affected the jury\u2019s verdict on the charge of rape, so it may have altered the verdicts on the sexual offense charges. Applying the <em>Dorsey </em>standard, we cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial court\u2019s error in not clarifying the effect of post-penetration withdrawal of consent was harmless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><em>Baby, </em>404 Md. at 265-66, 946 A.2d at 490. While I agree with the majority that post-penetration withdrawal of consent could be rape, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the instruction on rape had an effect on the sexual offense convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">I. The Rape Conviction and the Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The rape conviction should be reversed and remanded to the Circuit Court. As the Court of Special Appeals stated, \u201c[t]he jury, in the discharge of its responsibilities to apply the law to the facts as it found them to be, was entitled to a proper response to its inquiries.\u201d <em>Baby v. State, </em>172 Md.App. 588, 607, 916 A.2d 410, 421 (2007). Whether the <em>Battle </em>language was <em>dicta </em>or holding then becomes highly significant at any retrial of petitioner. In my view, the statement at issue from <em>Battle </em>was a holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Battle: <em>Dicta </em>or Holding</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">The majority holds that the statement, \u201cOn the other hand, ordinarily if she consents prior to penetration and withdraws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>the consent following penetration, there is no rape,\u201d found in <em>Battle v. State, </em>287 Md. 675, 684, 414 A.2d 1266, 1270 (1980), is <em>dicta. </em>Whether the statement is <em>dicta </em>or a holding is not merely an academic exercise, but instead, has real significance in the event there is a retrial of this case, for several reasons. If this Court is not now stating new law or changing the law of rape in Maryland, (and the <em>Battle </em>language was dicta), at any retrial, the court should instruct the jury that post-penetration withdrawal of consent may constitute rape. If the Court is announcing a new rule of law, (and the <em>Battle </em>language was a holding and not dicta), the jury should be instructed that if a woman actually consents to sexual intercourse prior to penetration and withdraws the consent following penetration, there is no rape. This new rule of law may be applied prospectively only. <em>Walker v. State, </em>343 Md. 629, 637-40, 684 A.2d 429, 432-33 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The <em>dicta </em>/holding argument was presented to the Court of Special Appeals. It seems to me that the Court of Special Appeals found the <em>Battle </em>language to be binding on the Circuit Court, and hence, a holding. The intermediate appellate court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">\u201cAlthough <em>Siering[</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark>], as does the State, denominated the language at issue in <em>Battle </em>as \u2018arguably\u2019 <em>dicta, Bunyard[</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>refers to it as \u2018the holding of <em>Battle.\u2019 </em>As noted, whether the <em>Battle </em>pronouncement is dicta is immaterial to the trial court\u2019s obligation to inform the jury of the current status of Maryland law. It is currently a statement of Maryland law, that has neither been overruled nor commented upon negatively. Whether it should be revisited in light of the weight of authority to the contrary is a matter for the Maryland legislature or the Court of Appeals. Under <em>Battle, </em>no rape occurred if the jury found that the prosecutrix withdrew her prior consent after penetration. The trial judge was obliged to answer the jury\u2019s questions and it should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>advised that, under Maryland law, the answer is \u2018no\u2019 to the question, \u2018If a female consents to sex initially and, during the course of the sex act to which she consented, for whatever reason, she changes her mind and the ... man continues until climax, does the result constitute rape?\u2019 The holding in <em>Battle, </em>of course, would not have been a bar to a conviction for common law assault for any continuation of the sexual act against the complainant\u2019s will after the withdrawal of consent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><em>Baby v. State, </em>172 Md.App. at 620-621, 916 A.2d at 429 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Admittedly, it is not always easy to distinguish between <em>dicta </em>and a holding. The distinction between a holding and <em>dicta, </em>while difficult to define, is also difficult to apply. <em>See, e.g., </em>Richard A.

PA. L. REV. at 2000. <em>See also Krupnick v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., </em>28 Cal.App.4th 185, 34 Cal.Rptr.2d 39, 47 (1994) (equating <em>ratio decidendi </em>to holding of a case). This test is often known as the logical necessity test, and is drawn from Black\u2019s Law Dictionary definition. <em>See, e.g., Vogel v. State, </em>315 Md. 458, 466, 554 A.2d 1231, 1234 (1989); <em>Schmidt v. Prince George\u2019s Hospital, </em>366 Md. 535, 551, 784 A.2d 1112, 1121 (2001). On the other hand, some scholars and judges have proposed other definitions of <em>dicta. </em>An alternate definition has been proposed by Professors Michael Abramowicz and Maxwell Sterns, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">\u201cA holding consists of those propositions along the chosen decisional path or paths of reasoning that (1) are actually decided, (2) are based upon the facts of the case, and (3) lead to the judgment. If not a holding, a proposition stated in a case counts as dicta.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Michael Abramowicz &amp; Maxwell Stearns, <em>Defining Dicta, </em>57 Stan. L.Rev. 953, 961 (2005). Discussing the concept of <em>dicta </em>versus a holding, Judge Alex Kozinski stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APL\">\u201cOf course, not every statement of law in every opinion is binding on later panels. Where it is clear that a statement is made casually and without analysis, where the statement is uttered in passing without due consideration of the alternatives, or where it is merely a prelude to another legal issue that commands the panel\u2019s full attention, it may be appropriate to revisit the issue in a later case. However, any such reconsideration should be done cautiously and rarely\u2014only where the later panel is convinced that the earlier panel did not make a deliberate decision to adopt the rule of law it announced. Where, on the other hand, it is clear that a majority of the panel has focused on the legal issue presented by the case before it and made a deliberate decision to resolve the issue, that ruling becomes the law of the circuit and can only be overturned by an en banc court or by the Supreme Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number><em>United States v. Johnson, </em>256 F.3d 895, 915-16 (9th Cir.2001) (footnote omitted). Another view of the dicta/holding distinction is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">\u201cCourts and commentators sometimes assert that a statement is <em>dictum </em>if it was not essential to the outcome of the case. This formulation focuses on the facts and the outcome in the precedent case, and asks which facts were material to the decision. According to this view, elaborations of legal principle that are broader than the narrowest proposition that could have decided the case given its particular facts are considered <em>dicta. </em>Although frequently deployed in practice, this formulation of the distinction between holdings and <em>dicta </em>has serious potential for judicial manipulation to serve instrumentalist ends, and often results in a patchwork of precedent that provides little guidance to lower courts and potential litigants. The competing explanation of the distinction between holdings and <em>dicta </em>focuses on the rationale of the precedent case. Under this definition, courts are bound by statements that form part of the rationale of the decision in the precedent case, even if, when viewed from a <em>post hoc </em>perspective, they were not technically essential to the result. Although this formulation of the distinction between holdings and dicta raises definitional problems of its own\u2014specifically, there is no neat way to determine the \u2018rationale\u2019 of the precedent decision\u2014it is more consistent with the rule of law and a greater obstacle to judicial instrumentalism.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Peter J. Smith, <em>The Marshall Court and the Originalist\u2019s Dilemma, </em>90 Minn. L.Rev. 612, 638-39 (2006) (footnotes omitted). Finally, commentators and courts have distinguished between obiter <em>dicta </em>and judicial <em>dicta </em>(sometimes referred to as considered <em>dicta), </em>noting as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">\u201cThe line between <em>dicta </em>and holding is further clouded by the presence of a middle ground, labeled \u2018judicial <em>dicta.\u2019 </em>Judicial <em>dictum </em>is generally defined as \u2018an opinion by a court on a question that is directly involved, briefed, and argued by counsel, and even passed on by the court, but that is not essential to the decision.\u2019 Statements of judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>dicta </em>are technically <em>\u2018dicta </em>\u2019 because they are not necessary to the holding of a case. They do not, however, implicate to the same degree as ordinary dicta the concern of \u2018full consideration,\u2019 which is one of the rationales for treating dicta and holdings differently. Unlike ordinary <em>dicta, </em>judicial <em>dicta </em>is, by definition, well-reasoned and stated only after the court has investigated an issue with care. Accordingly, courts afford judicial <em>dicta </em>greater deference than ordinary <em>dicta, </em>treating judicial <em>dicta </em>almost like holdings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWe\">David Coale &amp; Wendy Couture, <em>Loud Rules, </em>34 Pepp. L.Rev. 715, 727-28 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The idea that the distinction between holding and <em>dicta </em>is not easily discerned is not a new concept. Indeed, in <em>Carstairs v. Cochran, </em>95 Md. 488, 52 A. 601 (1902), our predecessors opined on the subject, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">\u201cWe cannot agree that the expression of opinion referred to was an <em>obiter dictum. </em>All the constitutional objections which are here urged, were urged in that case by the late Judge Fisher with all the ability and force for which he was so justly distinguished, and the ruling upon the prayers, which there constituted the single exception, required the consideration by the Court of all those objections. <em>It 'may be difficult to frame a concise definition of an obiter dictum applicable to every such expression of opinion, </em>and some Courts incline to the rule that the most deliberate expression of opinion, upon a question distinctly raised in the record, and fully argued by counsel, may nevertheless be regarded as a <em>dictum, </em>unless essential to the actual disposition made of the case. But as Bouvier well says: \u2018It is difficult to see why, in a philosophic point of view, the opinion of the Court is not as persuasive on all the points which were so involved in the cause that it was the duty of counsel to argue them, and which were deliberately passed on by the Court, as if the decision had hung upon but one point;\u2019 and in Maryland the rule is in accord with this view. In <em>Alexander v. Worthington, </em>5 Md. 489, it is said: \u2018All that is necessary in Maryland to render the decision of the Court of Appeals authoritative on any point decided, is to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>that there was an application of the judicial mind to the precise question adjudged;\u2019 and in <em>Michael v. Morey, </em>26 Md. 261, it was said that a decision there cited, could not be said to be <em>obiter dictum, </em>\u2018as the question was directly involved in the issues of law raised by the demurrer to the bill, and the mind of the Court was directly drawn to, and distinctly expressed upon the subject.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 499, 52 A. at 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">I do not believe that the language at issue in <em>Battle </em>was obiter <em>dicta </em>or judicial <em>dicta </em>but instead believe that it was part of the <em>ratio decidendi </em>of the case and therefore a holding. The <em>Battle </em>statement was hardly the expression of a court on a collateral question or a mere illustration originating with the author of the opinion. The question was directly involved in the issues raised in the case. The statement was hardly a \u201cby the way\u201d statement, incidental to the question in the case. The <em>Battle </em>jury sought to determine when, in point of time, a withdrawal of consent would sustain a conviction for rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Significantly, a review of the briefs filed in the <em>Battle </em>case indicate that this issue was raised and argued in the brief of the appellant. The record reflects that appellant\u2019s counsel objected to the court\u2019s jury instruction, arguing \u201cthat the instruction was wrong because it incorrectly told the jury that consent could be withdrawn during the sex act thus converting consensual intercourse to rape.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 6, <em>Battle v. State, </em>287 Md. 675, 414 A.2d 1266 (1980) (No. 159). Appellant then argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">\u201cThe jury may have been unsure about whether consent could be withdrawn while sexual intercourse (penetration) was taking place. The answer to that would have been \u2018no.\u2019 <em>Hazel v. State, </em>221 Md. 464, 469, 157 A.2d 922 (1960).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">The trial court should have instructed the jury in the language of <em>Battle.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>II. The First Degree and Third Degree Sexual Offenses</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Baby\u2019s convictions for first degree and third degree sexual offense, based on his conduct as a principal in the second degree to the criminal, sexual conduct of his friend, Mike, should be affirmed. These charges and convictions were unrelated in any manner to the question posed by the jury. The sexual offense charges arise from separate and discrete acts, that of aiding and abetting Mike in an act of anal penetration and the touching of J.L.\u2019s breasts and vagina without her consent, which are entirely unrelated to the issue of post-penetration withdrawal of consent during the separate act of sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Even though lack of consent is an element to the rape and sexual offenses, there was absolutely no evidence that the victim consented to Mike\u2019s acts of first degree and third degree sexual offense, offenses in which the jury found petitioner to be a principal in the second degree. The majority\u2019s statement that \u201c[a] further instruction on the effect of post-penetration withdrawal of consent may have conceivably affected the jury\u2019s verdict on the charge of rape, <em>so it may it have altered the verdicts on the sexual offense charges </em>\u201d is a bald conclusion, with no reasoning or facts to support it. <em>Baby, </em>404 Md. at 266, 946 A.2d at 490. A plain reading of the jury question makes it crystal clear that the question related only to the rape charges against Baby. As the Court of Special Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">\u201cThe plain meaning of the jury\u2019s words, \u2018during the sex act,\u2019 leads one ineluctably to conclude that the reference was to the act of intercourse.... [I]f there had been initially any cause for confusion, it certainly should have been cleared up when the jury submitted the second note the following morning: \u2018If at any time, the woman says stop, is that rape?\u2019.... A fair interpretation of the jury\u2019s question is that it was an inquiry as to the legal effect of a withdrawal of consent <em>subsequent to </em>penetration, and prior to climax.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avl\"><em>Baby, </em>172 Md.App. at 605-06, 916 A.2d at 420. Moreover, the absence of <em>any </em>evidence of the victim consenting to Mike\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>acts makes the Court\u2019s <em>ipse dixit </em>conclusion is too great a leap. The first degree and third degree sexual offense convictions should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Judge WILNER authorizes me to state that he agrees with and joins this concurring and dissenting opinion.
