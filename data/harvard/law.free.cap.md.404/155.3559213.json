Ishola\u2019s conviction was the result of his use of false identification, in which he apparently assumed two fictitious identities. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed Ishola\u2019s conviction, noting that the term \u201canother\u201d was not ambiguous, and meant any identity other than one\u2019s own, including fictitious identities. Ishola filed a petition for writ of certiorari in this Court, which we granted, to determine the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-12\">1. Does the language contained in Md.Code, Crim. Law \u00a7 8--301(c), which requires that one \u201cknowingly and willfully assume the identity of another,\u201d encompass the possibility of prosecution for the assumption of a fictitious identity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>2. If not, is the evidence sufficient to find [Ishola] guilty of assuming the identity of another, where the State failed to present any evidence that the identities assumed were actual, real people?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">We answer both questions in the negative. We shall hold that the term \u201cidentity of another,\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 8-301 (c), is ambiguous. As a result of the principle of strict construction, we resolve the ambiguity against the State and in favor of Ishola. Furthermore, this result is consistent with the legislative history of \u00a7 8-301. Upon our examination of the stated purpose of the statute, its structure, and a subsequent proposed amendment to the statute, we are persuaded that the Legislature did not intend to include the assumption of fictitious identities among the prohibited acts. For these reasons we hold that there was insufficient evidence to support Ishola\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">On March 19, 2003, Kazeem Adeshina Ishola visited a branch of Branch, Banking &amp; Trust (\u201cBB &amp; T\u201d) located in Elkridge, Maryland, and attempted to open a bank account. As identification, he presented a Florida driver\u2019s license with the name \u201cChristopher J. Pitera.\u201d A bank employee noted that the license did not match the sample Florida driver\u2019s license in the bank\u2019s identification guide, and as a result, refused to open an account for Ishola. Recognizing Ishola as a current customer at the bank, the bank employee then reviewed the signature card Ishola signed when he opened his current bank account. At the time that he opened that account, Ishola had provided the bank with a New Jersey driver\u2019s license bearing the name \u201cJames P. McNicolas.\u201d The bank\u2019s operations manager notified several other branches of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Among the branches notified was the BB &amp; T branch located in Columbia, Maryland. Later the same day, Ishola entered the Columbia BB &amp; T branch in a second attempt to open a bank account using false identification. The Columbia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>branch, having been notified of Ishola\u2019s attempt to use false identification at the Elkridge branch, notified the police. Officer Green, of the Howard County Police, responded to the scene, and obtained from Ishola what appeared to be a Florida driver\u2019s license bearing the name \u201cChristopher J. Pitera.\u201d Officer Green then placed Ishola under arrest for \u201cproviding fraudulent information to obtain goods and services.\u201d While investigating the case, Officer Green was unable to identify any individuals named either Christopher Pitera or James McNicolas.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">During the jury deliberations, the jury foreman sent a note to the judge and asked the court to define \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201canother.\u201d After arguments and objections by Ishola, the court answered the questions by stating: \u201c \u2018Fraudulent intent\u2019 is proven if the State establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant obtained or attempted to obtain a benefit, credit, good, service, or other thing of value by means of unlawful misrepresentation, false statement, or impersonation.\u201d The court defined \u201canother\u201d for the jury as \u201cother than the accused.\u201d The jury then sent back a second note, asking whether \u201cother\u201d meant \u201csomeone\u201d other than the accused. In response, the court stated, \u201c[y]ou must determine what \u2018[a] person may not knowingly and willfully assume the identity of another\u2019 means.\u201d Thereafter, the jury found Ishola guilty of two counts of assuming the identity of another, pursuant to \u00a7 8-301 (c). On July 18, 2005, the trial court sentenced Ishola to two consecutive one-year sentences. Ishola noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">On June 29, 2007, the Court of Special Appeals issued its reported opinion affirming Ishola\u2019s conviction. <em>Ishola v. State, </em>175 Md.App. 201, 210, 927 A.2d 15, 20 (2007). In doing so, the intermediate appellate court reasoned that the plain meaning of \u00a7 8-301 was not ambiguous. <em>Id. </em>at 208, 927 A.2d at 18-19. The court concluded that even fictitious identities were included within the definition of the term \u201canother;\u201d therefore, the State was not required to prove the existence of a person whose identity was stolen. <em>Id. </em>at 210, 927 A.2d at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Ishola filed a petition for writ of certiorari in this Court, which we granted. <em>Ishola v. State, </em>401 Md. 172, 931 A.2d 1095 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">We are asked, in the case at bar, to interpret the meaning of \u00a7 8-301(c), which provides that \u201c[a] person may not knowingly and willfully assume the identity of another\u201d for certain purposes. The word \u201canother\u201d is not defined in the statute. Our primary purpose, in interpreting a statute, is always \u201cto discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Mandel, </em>402 Md. 109, 128, 935 A.2d 671, 682 (2007) (internal quotation omitted). In order to ascertain the intent of the Legislature, we begin with the plain language of the statute, and if that language is clear and unambiguous, we look no further than the text of the statute. <em>Taylor, </em>402 Md. at 128-29, 935 A.2d at 682.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">Section 8-301(c) provides as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">(c) <em>Same\u2014Assuming identity of </em>another.\u2014A person may not knowingly and willfully assume the identity of another:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">(1) to avoid identification, apprehension, or prosecution for a crime; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-11\">(2) with fraudulent intent to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-12\">(i) get a benefit, credit, good, service, or other thing of value; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-13\">(ii) avoid the payment of debt or other legal obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">The parties dispute the meaning of the word \u201canother,\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 8-301(c). Ishola argues that \u201canother\u201d refers to another person; hence, because the State failed to prove the existence of any actual victim, Ishola contends that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. The State asserts that \u201canother\u201d means any identity other than Ishola\u2019s own, including a fictitious identity. As such, the State argues that there is sufficient evidence to sustain Ishola\u2019s conviction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>despite its failure to prove the existence of the people whose identities were actually stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">In order to ascertain the intent of the Legislature based on the plain language of the statute, we begin with the dictionary definition of the word \u201canother.\u201d Although \u201c[d]ictionary definitions are not dispositive as to the meaning of statutory terms,\u201d they \u201cprovide a useful starting point for discerning what the legislature could have meant in using a particular term.\u201d <em>Stachowski v. Sysco Food Servs. of Baltimore, Inc., </em>402 Md. 506, 525-26, 937 A.2d 195, 206 (2007). In 1999, at the time that the words \u201cidentity of another\u201d were codified, Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary defined \u201canother\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">1: an additional one of the same kind: one more</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj\">2: one that is different from the first or present one</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2x\">3: one of a group of unspecified or indefinite things &lt;in one way or\u2014 &gt;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 48 (10th ed.1999). Unfortunately, this definition does not resolve whether the word \u201canother\u201d refers to another person, or any identity, including that of a fictitious person. With regard to statutory interpretation, this Court has said that, where \u201cthe language is subject to more than one [reasonable] interpretation, it is ambiguous, and we resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, and statutory purpose.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>402 Md. at 129, 935 A.2d at 683. Because we determine that the term \u201canother,\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 8-301 (c), is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, it is ambiguous. The two possible reasonable interpretations of the word \u201canother\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 8-301 (c) are either the identity of another actual person or any identity other than one\u2019s own, including a fictitious identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Having determined that \u00a7 8-301(c) is ambiguous, we must \u201cresolve any ambiguity in light of the legislative history, caselaw, and statutory purpose.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Kelly, </em>397 Md. 399, 420, 918 A.2d 470, 482 (2007). We also look to \u201cthe statute\u2019s structure, including the title, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>how the statute relates to other laws.\u201d <em>Stouffer v. Pearson, </em>390 Md. 36, 46, 887 A.2d 623, 629 (2005). The ultimate goal, in looking to these sources, is to discern and effectuate the Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the statute. <em>Taylor, </em>402 Md. at 128-29, 935 A.2d at 682-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We begin our analysis with the fundamental principle that penal statutes are to be strictly construed. <em>Boffen v. State, </em>372 Md. 724, 735, 816 A.2d 88, 94 (2003). We interpret penal statutes narrowly so that \u201ccourts will not extend the punishment to cases not plainly within the language used.\u201d <em>Tapscott v. State, </em>343 Md. 650, 654, 684 A.2d 439, 441 (1996) (quoting <em>State v. Archer, </em>73 Md. 44, 57, 20 A. 172, 172 (1890)). This Court has explained the rationale behind this fundamental rule of construction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">The rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly, is, perhaps, not much less old than construction itself. It is founded on the tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals; and on the plain principle that the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department.... To determine that a case is within the intention of a statute, its language must authorize us to say so. It would be dangerous, indeed, to carry the principle, that a case which is within the reason or mischief of a statute, is within its provisions, so far as to punish a crime not enumerated in the statute, because of its equal atrocity or- of kindred character, with those which are enumerated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-7\"><em>Farris v. State, </em>351 Md. 24, 36, 716 A.2d 237, 243-44 (1998) (quoting <em>U.S. v. Wiltberger, </em>18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76, 95-96, 5 L.Ed. 37, 42 (1820)), <em>superseded by statute, </em>1999 Md. Laws, Chap. 422, <em>as recognized in Boffen v. State, </em>372 Md. 724, 742-43, 816 A.2d 88, 98 (2003). According to the principle of strict construction, we therefore conclude that fictitious persons are not included within the meaning of \u201canother\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 8-301(c). If the Legislature had intended to include fictitious persons within the meaning of \u201canother,\u201d it could have done so explicitly.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>The Legislature has, in fact, explicitly used the term \u201cfictitious person\u201d in several other statutes. Md.Code (1975, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-404(b) of the Commercial Law Article deals with instances in which the person identified as payee of an instrument is a fictitious person.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a statute similar to the statute at issue, the Legislature has defined shoplifting in part as \u201c[ojbtaining or attempting to obtain possession of any merchandise by charging that merchandise to another person without the authority of that person or by charging that merchandise to a <em>fictitious person.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Md.Code (1973, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-1301(g) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Article. (Emphasis added.) In that statute, the Legislature explicitly included both charging merchandise to another person without authority and charging the merchandise to a fictitious person. The General Assembly\u2019s explicit inclusion of fictitious person in this statute, and its exclusion of fictitious person in the \u00a7 8-301(c) leads us to conclude that the Legislature did not intend to include fictitious person within the meaning of \u201canother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We are also persuaded by the language of a similar Ala- \u2022 bama statute. Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-8-194(a) (1975) is a good example of a Legislature\u2019s intent to expand the meaning of \u201cfalse identity\u201d to expressly include the term \u201cfictitious person.\u201d It provides: \u201cA person commits the crime of obstructing justice using a false identity if he or she uses identification documents or identifying information of <em>another person or a fictitious person </em>to avoid summons, arrest, prosecution, or to impede a criminal investigation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Alabama statute is an identity fraud statute, much like \u00a7 8-301(c). Unlike the Maryland law, however, the Alabama law specifically prohibits the use of both the identity of another person and the use of a fictitious identity. It is the Maryland General Assembly\u2019s omission of the term \u201cfictitious person\u201d that further persuades us that the Legislature did not prohibit the use of a fictitious person\u2019s identity within the meaning of \u00a7 8-301(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">In addition, our interpretation of \u00a7 8-301(c) is consistent with the statute\u2019s legislative history. The relevant language of \u00a7 8-301(c) was enacted, originally, in 1999 and initially codified as part of Article 27, Section 231. 1999 Md. Laws, Chap. 331. At the time, the Legislature\u2019s stated purpose was, <em>inter alia, </em>to prohibit \u201ccertain persons from using an individual\u2019s personal identifying information without the consent of that individual for certain purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>By referencing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>individual who fails to consent to his or her identity being used, the Legislature indicated its intent to prohibit the use of the identity of an actual person, since a fictitious person could never give consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Furthermore, the structure of \u00a7 8-301 as a whole is instructive on the matter. Section 8\u2014301(b)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, which immediately precedes \u00a7 8-301(c), prohibits an individual from possessing or obtaining \u201cany personal identifying information of an individual, without the consent of the individual.\u201d Again, by referencing the consent of the individual whose identity is at issue, the Legislature must have intended the identity to be that of an actual person. Although \u00a7 8-301(b) and \u00a7 8-301(c) define separate crimes, the structure of \u00a7 8-301 indicates that the Legislature intended to prohibit, in \u00a7 8-301 (c), the use of the same information it prohibited obtaining or possessing in \u00a7 8-301(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Further proof of this intent is found in the Bill Analysis of Senate Bill 244, the bill that added \u00a7 8-301 to the Code, which notes that the bill prohibits a person from: \u201c[ojbtaining or aiding another person in obtaining personal identifying information of another individual without the consent of that individual or individual\u2019s agent and sell, transfer, or otherwise use <em>that information </em>to obtain or attempt to obtain any benefit, credit, goods, services, or other things of value.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This summary of the bill describes both \u00a7 8-301(b) and \u00a7 8~301(c), and notes that the information that an individual is prohibited from obtaining in \u00a7 8-301(b) is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>same information he or she is prohibited from using in \u00a7 8-301(c). Because \u00a7 8-301(b) prohibits obtaining or possessing identifying information of an actual individual, we do not believe the Legislature intended to include the identity of fictitious persons in \u00a7 8-301(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Section 8-301 was amended in 2002.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 2002 Md. Laws, Chap. 509. The legislature proposed, through House Bill 358, to add the words \u201cor create a false identity\u201d to \u00a7 8-301(c). This proposed amendment would have prohibited the creation of a false identity, in addition to the use of the identity of another. Had this proposed amendment passed, the amended statute arguably would have covered Ishola\u2019s conduct in this case; the proposed amendment, however, was ultimately rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The dissent notes that \u201c[t]he purpose of the identity theft statute is, clearly, to protect the people of Maryland from identity theft.\u201d We agree with this general proposition. The people to be protected by this statute, however, are those whose identities are stolen. Although the dissent concludes that the people to be protected include \u201cthose business people or entrepreneurs who are harmed,\u201d it overlooks that merchants and the like are protected by the general fraud statutes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, we do not believe the Legislature intended to expand the field of victims beyond those whose identities have been stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>According to the dissent, our interpretation of \u00a7 8-301(c) allows a perpetrator to \u201cescape prosecution by assuming a fictitious identity\u201d instead of an actual identity, and the dissent claims that this is an illogical result. In our view, the Legislature intended \u00a7 8-301(c) to apply only when the defendant assumes the identity of another person. Merely because this section does not apply to this factual pattern does not mean that a perpetrator will escape prosecution, or that our conclusion is unreasonable. Our interpretation means that we have not expanded the statute beyond its intended purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Because we hold that the term \u201canother,\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 8-301(e), is ambiguous, the rule of strict construction requires that we resolve that ambiguity against the State and in favor of Ishola. Furthermore, we believe this result is consistent with the legislative intent. The stated purpose of the legislation, the structure of the statute, and the subsequent attempted amendment all indicate that the General Assembly intended not to include the use of a fictitious identity among the prohibited acts in \u00a7 8-301(c). For these reasons, we conclude that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain Ishola\u2019s convictions under \u00a7 8-301(c). In order to convict Ishola, under \u00a7 8-301(c), the State would have had to prove that Ishola used the identities of another person or persons. This means that the evidence would have had to show that Ishola assumed the identity of some person or persons who actually existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

Pitera\u201d and \u201cJames P. Nicholas,\u201d in attempts to open bank accounts with Branch, Banking &amp; Trust (\u201cBB &amp; T\u201d) on two occasions; during their investigation, the police were unable to locate persons named \u201cChristopher J. Pitera\u201d and \u201cJames P. Nicholas.\u201d Ishola appealed to the Court of Special Appeals contending that there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions because the State had not proven that Ishola had assumed the identities of actual real people. The Court of Special Appeals, in a reported opinion, affirmed the conviction and held that the term \u201cidentity of another\u201d in Section 8-301(c) was unambiguous and meant an identity other than one\u2019s own, including fictitious identities. <em>Ishola v. State, </em>175 Md.App. 201, 927 A.2d 15 (2007). The majority reverses; I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Section 8-301 (c) of the Criminal Law Article states that under certain circumstances an individual may not knowingly and willfully assume the \u201cidentity of another\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">(c) <em>Same\u2014Assuming identity of </em>another.\u2014A person may not knowingly and willfully assume the identity of another:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">(1) to avoid identification, apprehension, or prosecution for a crime; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-12\">(2) with fraudulent intent to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-13\">(i) get a benefit, credit, good, service, or other thing of value; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-15\">(ii) avoid the payment of debt or other legal obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-16\">The gravamen of the instant case is the phrase \u201cidentity of another,\u201d in subsection (c). The majority concludes that the phrase \u201cidentity of another\u201d is ambiguous and interprets the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>statute to prohibit only assuming an identity of an actual individual. This is an error.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Because we interpret statutory language according to its plain, natural and ordinary meaning, <em>see Rush v. State, </em>403 Md. 68, 97, 939 A.2d 689, 706 (2008); <em>Cain v. State, </em>386 Md. 320, 328, 872 A.2d 681, 685 (2005); <em>Khalifa v. State, </em>382 Md. 400, 429, 855 A.2d 1175, 1191-92 (2004); <em>Graves v. State, </em>364 Md. 329, 346, 772 A.2d 1225, 1235 (2001), \u201cidentity of another,\u201d within subsection (c), does not connote only identities of actual individuals, as revealed in the ordinary definition of \u201canother,\u201d being \u201cone that is different from the first or present one.\u201d <em>See </em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s College Dictionary 51 (11th ed.2003); Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary 47 (1999) (defining \u201canother\u201d as \u201c[o]ne more\u201d and \u201c[distinctly different from the first\u201d); The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 85 (2nd ed.1987) (defining \u201canother\u201d as \u201can additional one\u201d and \u201ca different one\u201d). Ishola clearly assumed an identity \u201cdifferent from\u201d his own, when he twice attempted to, and on a different occasion did, open a bank account at BB &amp; T.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">What, however, the majority does is substitute the language \u201cidentity of another actual real individual\u201d for \u201cidentity of another.\u201d If the General Assembly intended to exclude assuming the identity of a fictitious person, it would have done so with a direct and explicit reference to such an distinction, rather than focusing on whether the identity is different than one\u2019s own.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The import of the majority\u2019s opinion is that only those who assume the identity of an actual individual could be prosecuted; a perpetrator could escape prosecution by assuming a fictitious identity, or at least the name of a person who cannot be located. The General Assembly could not have reasonably intended such an illogical result. <em>See Allen v. State, </em>402 Md. 59, 76, 935 A.2d 421, 431 (2007) (\u201cWe shall not hew to a plain language approach that beggars common sense.\u201d); <em>Rush, </em>403 Md. at 97, 939 A.2d at 706 (\u201cFurther, whenever possible, an interpretation should be given to the statutory provisions which does not lead to unreasonable or illogical conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>quences.\u201d); <em>Miles v. State, </em>365 Md. 488, 539, 781 A.2d 787, 817 (2001) (rejecting interpretation of statute as argued because it was \u201c \u2018unreasonable, illogical, inconsistent with common sense, and absurd\u2019 \u201d); <em>Gray v. State, </em>221 Md. 286, 289, 157 A.2d 261, 263 (1960) (rejecting construction of statute because it would \u201ccause the statute to be so unreasonable as to cast serious doubt upon its validity\u201d). The majority, nevertheless, opines that its conclusion is supported by the structure of Section 8-301, which also includes subsection (b), prohibiting in certain circumstances possessing or obtaining \u201cpersonal identifying information of an individual, without the consent of the individual.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The two separate statutory subsections define different crimes: subsection (b) prohibits an individual from <em>possessing, obtaining, or helping another to possess or obtain </em>an individual\u2019s personal identifying information without that individual\u2019s consent, while subsection (c) bars an individual from <em>assuming </em>the identity of another. Additionally, the majority\u2019s reliance on legislative history is misplaced. The majority cites to two pieces of legislative history: first, Chapter 331 of the Maryland Laws of 1999, stating that the purpose of the identity theft statute is \u201cto prohibit \u2018certain persons from using an individual\u2019s personal identifying information without the consent of that individual for certain purposes,\u2019 \u201d and second, the Bill Analysis of Senate Bill (244), providing that the identity theft bill prohibits an individual from \u201c[o]btaining or aiding another person in obtaining personal identifying information of another individual without the consent of that individual or individual\u2019s agent and sell, transfer, or otherwise use <em>that information </em>to obtain or attempt to obtain any benefit, credit, goods, services, or other things of value.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>404 Md. at 164-66, 945 A.2d at 1278-79 (emphasis in original). This legislative history, however, does not address the assumption of a false identity for fraudulent purposes as prohibited in Section 8-301(c), the subsection at issue in this case, but rather, speaks only to the conduct criminalized under Section 8-301(b). The only mention of subsection (c) in the legislative history of the statute includes cursory notes that the statute also \u201cprohibit[s] a person from assuming the identity of another for certain purposes under certain circumstances.\u201d 1999 Maryland Laws, Chapter 331. <em>See also </em>Department of Legislative Services, Revised Fiscal Note, House Bill 334 (1999) (\u201cThe bill also prohibits a person from knowingly and willfully assuming the identity of another with specified fraudulent intent or to avoid prosecution of a crime.\u201d); Department of Legislative Services, Revised Fiscal Note, Senate Bill 244 (1999) (same).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">The purpose of the identity theft statute is, clearly, to protect the people of Maryland from identity theft. <em>See </em>Honorable Carol S. Petzold, House Judiciary Committee, Memorandum in Support of House Bill 334 (1999), February 25, 1999 (bill sponsor stating that the bill \u201cis the result of an effort involving various government agencies and citizens focused on creating a clear and concise law that will protect the people of Maryland\u201d). The people, to be protected, however, are not only those individuals whose identities are assumed, but also those business people or entrepreneurs who are harmed also by the use of the assumed identity. <em>See </em>Bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Analysis of Senate Bill 244 (1999) (\u201cAdditionally, the victims of the current counterfeiting, forgery, and theft crimes are usually banks or other financial institutions or retail establishments.\u201d). By interpreting the statute as it does, the majority fails to honor the statute\u2019s entire legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The evidence in the present case clearly is sufficient to convict Ishola of identity theft. Ishola twice attempted to use an identity that was not his own, \u201cChristopher J. Pitera,\u201d to open bank accounts. Ishola, according to the evidence perused, had previously opened an account with Branch, Banking &amp; Trust under yet another identity not his own, that of \u201cJames P. Nicholas.\u201d Viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to the State, I believe that a rational fact-finder could find each element of Section 8-301(c) to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, I would affirm Ishola\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Judge HARRELL authorizes me to state that he joins in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-5\">. Section 8-301(b) of the Criminal Law Article, Maryland Code (2002, 2007 Supp.), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">(b) <em>Prohibited\u2014Obtaining personal identifying information without </em>consent.\u2014A person may not knowingly, willfully, and with fraudulent intent possess, obtain, or help another to possess or obtain any personal identifying information of an individual, without the consent of the individual, in order to use, sell, or transfer the information to get a benefit, credit, good, service, or other thing of value in the name of the individual.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b199-5\">. The majority also draws support from other sections of the Code using the term \"fictitious person,\u201d a statute from Alabama and the rule of lenity, the principle that \"[Criminal statutes must be strictly construed in favor of the defendant to prevent courts from extending punishment to cases not plainly within the language of the statute,\u201d <em>Moore v.

However, because the statutory language is unambiguous, there is no need to address these other statutory provisions, nor to consider the rule of lenity. <em>See .Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 261-62, 647 A.2d 1204, 1207 (1994), in which we noted that the rule of lenity \"is a maxim of statutory construction which serves only as an aid for resolving an ambiguity and it may not be used to create an ambiguity where none exists\u201d and that \"[wjhen the statute is unambiguous, the rule of lenity \u2018simply has no application.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
