Coloma was sentenced twice in separate federal proceedings on different charges, and he asserts that, because those charges were related, the second court\u2019s intention to have his sentences run \u201cconcurrently\u201d should be construed under the Guidelines to require the Bureau of Prisons to subtract time served from the 188 months imposed as his second sentence. Because the second sentence already accounted for any overlap due to separate prosecutions arising from the same crime, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-20\">Coloma currently is serving a 188-month sentence for conspiracy to import a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963. This sentence is the result of a second prosecution for a second drug importation conspiracy. In his petition, Coloma alleged that the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) deprived him of precustodial credits when he was in custody for a federal offense awaiting sentencing for a second federal offense, but his petition was broadly construed. The issue on appeal is whether the three years between the two cases should be deducted from his second sentence by the BOP, because the court in the second federal case ordered his sentence to run concurrently to the sentence then being served for his first conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-21\">The district court denied the petition for habeas corpus. Coloma asserts on appeal that the sentencing hearing and plea agreement for his second federal sentence indicate that the district court intended that his second federal sentence, imposed in the Southern District of Georgia in 1994, would run fully concurrent with his first federal sentence, imposed in the Southern District of Florida in 1991, and that the order sentencing him to serve his sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>concurrently must have been made pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">The dispute on appeal concerns the years Coloma served in federal prison from 1991 to 1994. There is no dispute that during the years after 1994 the time passed concurrently for both the first and second sentences.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Coloma\u2019s first sentence was for conspiracy to import marijuana, and his second sentence was for conspiracy to import cocaine. Both sentences were imposed pursuant to conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963. Coloma argues that, because the dates of the conspiracies overlap, because the same players were involved, and, because the drugs were coming from the same country, the crimes were essentially the same criminal enterprise and that he should be sentenced once. Coloma insists that this argument is grounded in an appeal of the BOP\u2019s construction of his sentence and not a challenge to the sentence itself. We analyze Coloma\u2019s argument in the sections that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-6\">\u201cIn reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a habeas corpus petition, we review questions of law de novo and the court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Little v. Holder, </em>396 F.3d 1319, 1321 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cA petitioner has the burden of establishing his right to federal habeas relief.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Romine v. Head, </em>253 F.3d 1349, 1357 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-7\">At the second sentencing hearing, the district court said, \u201cThe term of imprisonment imposed by this judgment shall run concurrently with the term of imprisonment that was ordered pursuant to the judgment in the Southern District of Florida case.\u201d Rl-9, App.A at 28. We must first determine the meaning of the word concurrent. Whatever else the word means with regard to the second sentence, however, it does not mean that the two sentences \u201chav[e] the same starting date because a federal sentence cannot commence prior to the date it is pronounced, even if made concurrent with a sentence already being served.\u201d <em>United States v. Flores, </em>616 F.2d 840, 841 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-12\">A sentencing court may allow \u201cterms of imprisonment imposed at different times ... to run concurrently.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). The court should consider the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when making this determination. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3584(b). However, a \u201cterm of imprisonment commences on the date the defendant is received in custody ... at the official detention facility at which the sentence is to be served.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3585. Thus, the district court\u2019s instruction that the sentence was to run concurrently to Coloma\u2019s previous sentence was statutorily permissible, and his second sentence began when he returned to a federal detention facility following sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-13\">Coloma argues that the district court order, when properly understood, actually intended his second sentence to have run concurrently from the beginning of his first sentence. We have already observed that this is not what \u201cconcurrent\u201d means. However, the Sentencing Guidelines do provide a mechanism for a second sentencing court to take account of a prosecution that is relevant<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to a previous conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>\u201cto mit\u00edgate the possibility that the fortuity of two separate prosecutions will grossly increase a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>Witte v. United States, </em>515 U.S. 389, 405, 115 S.Ct. 2199, 2208-09, 132 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995). Coloma\u2019s argument, therefore, asks us to examine how the Guidelines affected his sentence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Guidelines envision a defendant prosecuted in \u201ctwo ... federal jurisdictions[ ] for the same criminal conduct or for different criminal transactions that were part of the same course of conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 cmt. n.2. Accordingly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1309-5\">[i]f ... the undischarged term of imprisonment resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense, the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the undischarged term of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5G1.3(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">This accounting occurs when a sentencing court \u201cadjust[s the sentence] for any term of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into account in determining the sentence for the instant offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 cmt. n.2. \u201cFor clarity, the court should note on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the sentence imposed is not a departure from the guidelines because the defendant has been credited for guideline purposes under \u00a7 5G1.3(b) with [time] served.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, when the court pronounces sentence, that sentence is the \u201cappropriate total punishment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1309-11\">If there were any doubt that this total sentence is not retroactive to the beginning of the first sentence, that doubt is eliminated by the example in the application notes. There, a prisoner had served six months in state court when he was prosecuted for a related crime in federal court. The federal court determined that a sentence of thirteen months was appropriate under the Guidelines and determined that \u00a7 5G1.3(b) applied. The prisoner was then sentenced to seven months, which sentence was to run concurrent to the remaining state sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 cmt. n.2. It is clear from the example that the prisoner owed seven more months starting from the date of the second sentencing. This reading of the guideline keeps it consistent with the statute, which says that service of the sentence commences when the defendant arrives in prison. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585. For these reasons, our pre-Guidelines observation in <em>Flores </em>remains the law: \u201c[A] federal sentence cannot commence prior to the date it is pronounced.\u201d 616 F.2d at 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-12\">In this case, we presume that the district court properly applied the Guidelines, including \u00a7 5G1.3, when calculating Coloma\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That is, we conclude that, to the extent the district court believed that Coloma\u2019s two prosecutions arose from the same course of criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>conduct as Coloma insists on appeal that they did, the court properly applied \u00a7 5G1.3(b) to deduct from the second sentence the proper amount of time to account for that already served under the first sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 emt. n.2. Thus, to the extent that the district court believed \u00a7 5G1.3(b) applied, the 188-month sentence pronounced by the court was the total sentence and would only have been greater but for the court\u2019s decision to subtract time to mitigate the danger arising from sentencing in separate prosecutions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For these reasons, the BOP\u2019s construction of Coloma\u2019s 188-month sentence was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">Coloma has appealed the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Because of the procedural posture of the case, we must presume that the sentence was correctly calculated, and Coloma\u2019s 188-month sentence, therefore, accounted for any relevant criminal conduct. We</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-6\">AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1308-8\">. \"Multiple terms of imprisonment ordered to run consecutively or concurrently [are] treated for administrative purposes as a single, aggregate term of imprisonment.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1308-9\">. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), governs this appeal because Coloma\u2019s motion was filed after the AEDPA\u2019s enactment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1308-15\">.See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3; <em>see also United States v. Bidwell, </em>393 F.3d 1206, 1209-11 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1309-8\">. As a procedural matter, Coloma admits that we may not reexamine the district court's sentence because he elected relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 and not 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Thus, we may not review whether the 188-month sentence was the proper one under the Sentencing Guidelines. Even if Coloma had requested that we review his sentence under the liberal pleading doctrine afforded to <em>pro se </em>petitioners by treating his \u00a7 2241 petition as a \u00a7 2255 petition, we would still not be able to review his sentence, because such petition would be untimely. <em>See Kaufmann v. United States, </em>282 F.3d 1336, 1337 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1309-14\">. We presume this because Coloma is not challenging his sentence. <em>See supra </em>note 4. The necessity of this assumption is heightened by Coloma's choice not to introduce evidence into the record regarding the sentencing calculations produced in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1310-8\">. The language in \u00a7 5G 1.3(b) is mandatory, but the Third Circuit has held that the language \"makes clear that 'concurrently' in subsection (b) means fully or retroactively concurrently, not simply concurrently with the remainder of the defendant\u2019s undischarged sentence.\u201d <em>Ruggiano v. Reish, </em>307 F.3d 121, 128 (3d Cir.2002). Coloma argues this interpretation means that his 188-month sentence should be considered as having started in 1991. As we have explained, \u00a7 5G1.3(b) requires a court to take into account time served for related crimes and to determine the appropriate prospective \u2014 -not retrospective \u2014 sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
