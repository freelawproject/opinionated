The appellant raises the following issues for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">1. Did the trial court err in finding that the appellant\u2019s incarceration was tantamount to a disability thus rendering him incapable of providing adequate care for his son?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">2. Did the trial court err in holding that the Department of Social Services was relieved of its statutory obligation to provide the appellant with the appropriate services?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">Perceiving no error, we shall affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">In November of 1991, Kevon T. was born to the appellant and Jacqueline T.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appellant and Jacqueline apparently met while both were incarcerated at the Lorton Correctional Facility and working in the garment shop. Although Kevon was conceived while his parents were incarcerated, Jacqueline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>was released prior to giving birth to Kevon. The appellant, however, is serving a sentence of twenty years to life for a drug-related first degree murder. He has been incarcerated since 1974. The appellant is currently 44 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Because of the appellant\u2019s continuous incarceration, he earned an insignificant sum of money working within the correctional facility. Shortly after Kevon\u2019s birth, the appellant sent Jacqueline approximately $140 per month for child care. He later learned, however, that Jacqueline was apparently using the money to buy drugs rather than to care for Kevon. The appellant then lost his job within the facility and stopped sending Jacqueline money. At the time of trial, the appellant earned approximately $21 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">While incarcerated, the appellant has participated in a concerned fathers\u2019 group, has graduated from a drug program, and has been involved in stress and anger management programs. Between September of 1995 and January of 1997, the appellant had attempted to contact his son through the Prince George\u2019s County Department of Social Services (hereinafter \u201cDSS\u201d). For example, the appellant requested the telephone number of Kevon\u2019s foster family, and he was provided with the phone number. The appellant called twice. The appellant also requested visitation with Kevon. Beginning in February of 1998, Kevon met with the appellant in the facility, where the appellant talked to Kevon and bought him a soda. Kevon did not recognize the appellant. Kevon was brought to the correctional facility on three additional occasions in 1998 to meet with the appellant. Marsha Goldfine, a social worker for the DSS, testified at trial that despite Kevon\u2019s visits with the appellant, Kevon did not seem to be becoming more familiar with his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">In March of 1997, the DSS filed a petition in the circuit court for guardianship with right to consent to the long-term care of Kevon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Beginning on October 19,1998, a hearing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>held in the circuit court with regard to the termination of the appellant\u2019s parental rights. At the conclusion of the three-day hearing, the trial court granted the DSS\u2019s petition for guardianship and accordingly terminated the appellant\u2019s parental rights with respect to Kevon. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 95195062/CAD, </em>116 Md.App. 443, 696 A.2d 1102 (1997), we discussed the appropriate focus in cases involving the termination of parental rights. We there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">In decisions regarding the termination of parental rights, the best interest of the child has long been the guiding standard. Indeed, the child\u2019s welfare is of \u201c \u2018transcendent importance.\u2019\u201d Termination of parental rights, however, implicates the fundamental constitutional right to raise one\u2019s own child. Because the right \u201cis so fundamental ... it may not be taken away unless clearly justified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">116 Md.App. at 453-54, 696 A.2d 1102 (citations omitted). We further noted that \u201cthe State bears the heavy burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that termination of a parent\u2019s rights serves the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454, 696 A.2d 1102. Additionally,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">[i]n reviewing the evidence presented below to determine whether the trial court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGI\">our function * * * is not to determine whether, on the evidence, we might have reached a different conclusion. Rather, it is to decide only whether there was sufficient evidence \u2014 by a clear and convincing standard \u2014 to support the * * * determination that it would be in the best interest of [the child] to terminate the rights of [the natural parent]. In making this decision, we must assume the truth of all of the evidence, and of the favorable inferences fairly deducible therefrom, tending to support the factual conclusion of the trial court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-9\"><em>In re Adoption No. 09598, </em>77 Md.App. 511, 518, 551 A.2d 143 (1989). Moreover, in a case involving termination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>parental rights, \u201cthe greatest respect must be accorded the opportunity [the trial court] had to see and hear the witnesses and to observe their appearance and demeanor.\u201d... Where the best interest of the child is of primary importance, \u201cthe trial court\u2019s determination is accorded great deference, unless it is arbitrary or clearly wrong.\u201d <em>Scott [v. Dept, of Social </em>Services,] 76 Md.App. [357], 382-83 [545 A.2d 81] [1988],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-5\"><em>In re Adoption/Guardianship Nos. 2152A, 2153A 21514A </em>100 Md.App. 262, 269-70, 641 A.2d 889 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Long-Term Incarceration as a Factor</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">When determining whether the termination of parental rights is proper, a trial court is obligated to consider the multitude of factors enumerated in Md.Code Ann., Fam. Law \u00a7 5-313.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A court is additionally obligated to make \u201cexpress findings of fact with regard to each statutory factor before a decision granting a petition to terminate parental rights may be sustained.\u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 95195062/CAD, </em>116 Md.App. at 460, 696 A.2d 1102. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>there is no dispute that the trial judge expressly set forth his decision for terminating the appellant\u2019s parental rights and the factors on which he based his decision. On this appeal we are concerned only with the adequacy of Judge Woods\u2019s consideration of the factor described in \u00a7 5-313(d)(l)(i), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">(d) <em>Considerations following juvenile adjudication. </em>(1) In determining whether it is in the best interest of the child to terminate a natural parent\u2019s rights as to the child in a case involving a child who has been adjudicated to be a child in need of assistance, a neglected child, an abused child, or a dependant child, the court shall consider the factors in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>subsection (c) of this section and whether any of the following continuing or serious conditions or acts exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">(i) the natural parent has a disability that renders the natural parent consistently unable to care for the immediate and ongoing physical or psychological needs of the child for long periods of time[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">A definition of the term \u201cdisability\u201d can be found in Md.Code Ann., Fam. Law \u00a7 5-301(c). That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">(c) <em>Disability. </em>\u2014 \u201cDisability\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">(1) a mental disorder, as defined in \u00a7 10-101 of the Health-General Article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">(2) mental retardation, as defined in \u00a7 7-101 of the Health-General Article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">(3) alcohol dependence, as defined in \u00a7 8-101 of the Health-General Article; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">(4) drug dependence, as defined in \u00a7 8-101 of the Health-General Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">In the instant case, the trial court, when terminating the appellant\u2019s parental rights with respect to Kevon, explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-12\">You would like to say, Mr. L., we\u2019d like to do something for you. Had he testified that I am getting out of prison tomorrow, I have got a job, I am going to do whatever I can do, I want to take my child back and start anew, I would have seriously considered that. The problem is Mr. L. has been sentenced from 20 to life. Twenty years has passed. We know he\u2019s not coming up for [parole for] a couple of years, two or three years before he is reconsidered with no guarantees. For whatever reason, he\u2019s not going to get out of jail, and the possibility exists that he could be in jail for the rest of his natural life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-13\">... <em>And while I don\u2019t find that jail in and of itself, based upon the ease law </em>even though I find no case really on all fours, <em>is a disability, </em>I find that it is in the best interest of the child, considering all of the factors in reference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>father, that he cannot give the child and has not in the past given the child the adequate food, clothing, shelter, and education or any other care or control necessary for the child\u2019s physical mental or emotional ties, but it says even if the parent is physically and financially able, he\u2019s not physically, he\u2019s not financially able, but emotionally I guess he is able____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\">\n<em>I really would say to the Court of Special Appeals if this case goes up, this is just an exception to jail not being a disability because of the factual nature of the case itself.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aog\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The appellant maintains that despite case law to the contrary, the trial court erroneously determined that the appellant\u2019s incarceration was, in fact, a disability under \u00a7 5-313(d)(1)(i). In support of his position, the appellant relies on our decision in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship Nos. CAA9210852 and CAA92-10853, </em>103 Md.App. 1, 651 A.2d 891 (1994) (hereinafter <em>\u201cAdoption CAA92 </em>\u201d), and he concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">[A] \u201cdisability\u201d means a physical or mental illness or addiction. The record here does not reflect that the appellant father has any such condition. Accordingly, the court erred in concluding that he suffers from a disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">In <em>Adoption CAA92, </em>we addressed for the first time whether a parent\u2019s incarceration could constitute a \u201cdisability\u201d within the meaning of Md.Code Ann., Fam. Law \u00a7 5-301(c). Specifically, William F., the father of twin sons, had been convicted of drug distribution and sentenced to two years probation along with a requirement that he complete a nine-month drug treatment program. At the time of the hearing before the circuit court on the issue of the twins\u2019 guardianship, William F. was still incarcerated and was awaiting the commencement of his drug treatment program, which was scheduled to being approximately two weeks after the hearing. 103 Md.App. at 8-9, 651 A.2d 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">The trial court concluded that William F.\u2019s incarceration was, in fact, a disability, because he was \u201cunable to care for the immediate and ongoing needs of the children,\u201d as required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>by \u00a7 5 \u2014 313(d)(l)(i). William F. appealed and challenged the termination of his parental rights on the basis that the trial court erred in finding that his incarceration constituted a \u201cdisability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Judge Alpert, writing for our Court in <em>Adoption CAA92, </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">The question of whether a parent\u2019s incarceration constitutes a \u201cdisability\u201d is an issue of first impression in this state. We agree with the appellant that the court erred when it found that William\u2019s imprisonment was a \u201cdisability,\u201d for several reasons. First, the term \u201cdisability\u201d is defined in section 5-301(c) and is expressly limited to mental disorders, mental retardation, chronic alcoholism, and drug addiction. Md.Code Ann., Fam. Law \u00a7 5-301(C). Even assuming the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d was not so limited, this Court has refused to expand by judicial fiat the definition of this term to include other impediments to a parent\u2019s ability to care for his or her child. In <em>In re Adoption No. 2428, </em>81 Md.App. 133, 138, 567 A.2d 139 (1989), for example, we held that a mother\u2019s minority did not constitute a disability on the basis that it was not included in the statutory definition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\"><em>Moreover, William\u2019s incarceration was temporary, and not permanent or long-term in nature as section (d)(l)(i) contemplates. </em>At the time of trial, William had been incarcerated for approximately nine months. Within a week or two after trial, however, he was scheduled to begin a nine-month drug rehabilitation program. According to William, he would be allowed to visit his sons during this program. <em>Following the completion of the program, William would be free, </em>subject to the terms of his probation. Thus, the trial court erred not only in finding that William\u2019s incarceration constituted a \u201cdisability,\u201d but also in holding that his imprisonment rendered him \u201cconsistently unable\u201d to provide for the children\u2019s needs \u201cfor long periods of time.\u201d <em>The incarceration of a parent does not per se constitute a disability </em>under 5 \u2014 313(d)(l)(i) and justify the termination of his or her parental rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>103 Md.App. at 29-30, 651 A.2d 891 (footnote omitted; emphasis supplied). Thus, our Court concluded that under the facts before us in <em>Adoption CAA92, </em>William F.\u2019s incarceration did not constitute either a literal \u201cdisability\u201d within the contemplation of \u00a7 5-301(c) or a dispositive circumstance otherwise justifying the termination of parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">We agree entirely with the appellant\u2019s assertions that his incarceration does not literally qualify as a disability under the statutory definition found in \u00a7 5-301(c) of the Family Law Article. Despite the appellant\u2019s assertion to the contrary, Judge Woods never found that it was. He simply found, in considering the totality of the circumstances, that the long-term incarceration of the biological father with an indefinite termination date was a significant factor in assessing the best interests of the child. Our holding in this case does not expand the statutory definition so as to' include incarceration within the meaning of \u201cdisability.\u201d As we said in <em>Adoption CAA92, </em>\u201c[t]he incarceration of a parent does not per se constitute a disability.\u201d 103 Md.App. at 30, 651 A.2d 891 (emphasis supplied). We reaffirm that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Given the appropriate set of factual circumstances, however, incarceration may indeed, under the facts of a particular case, be a critical factor in permitting the termination of parental rights, because the incarcerated parent cannot provide for the long-term care of the child. Under such circumstances, the best interests of the child may warrant the termination of parental rights. \u201c[T]he controlling factor, or guiding principle, in adoption and custody cases is not the natural parent\u2019s interest in raising the child but rather what best serves the interests of the child.\u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. A91-71A, </em>334 Md. 538, 561, 640 A.2d 1085 (1994). Therefore, \u201cin all cases where the interests of a child are in jeopardy the paramount consideration is what will best promote the child\u2019s welfare, a consideration of \u2018transcendent importance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. See also In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 8598, </em>347 Md. 295, 323, 701 A.2d 110 (1997) (\u201c[T]he \u2018golden rule\u2019 has always been the best interest of the child.\u201d). Given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>the appellant\u2019s situation and all of the surrounding circumstances, Judge Woods was acting in the best interests of Kevon T. in terminating the parental rights of the appellant. We cannot hold that he was clearly erroneous in finding that it was not in the best interests of Kevon T. to have his status placed in suspended animation until 2001 or even beyond waiting for the appellant\u2019s potential for parole to be realized, an occurrence that the trial court noted may never come to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The facts in this case, moreover, are sufficiently distinguishable from those in <em>Adoption CAA92 </em>to warrant the conclusion that the appellant\u2019s incarceration did in this case justify termination where there it did not. In <em>Adoption CAA92, </em>William F.\u2019s incarceration was characterized as \u201ctemporary\u201d and \u201cnot permanent or long-term in nature.\u201d 103 Md.App. at 29, 651 A.2d 891. In <em>Adoption CAA92, </em>William F. was to be \u201cfree\u201d following the completion of a nine-month drug rehabilitation program. <em>Id. </em>In this case, the appellant testified on cross-examination regarding his status of incarceration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">Q: What are you incarcerated for, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">A: First degree murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">Q: And what is your actual sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">A: Twenty to life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">Q: And when was the last hearing, the last parole, the last time you met with the Parole Board?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">A: March, when I got the 2001 date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-11\">Q: March of 1998?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-12\">A: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-13\">Q: Okay. And they denied you parole on that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-14\">A: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-15\">Q: And they gave you a new date of March of 2001?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-16\">A: 2001.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-17\">Unlike the situation before the Court in <em>Adoption CAA92 </em>where an affirmative release date had been established for William F., the appellant is not scheduled even for parole consideration again until 2001, and there is no guarantee that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>the appellant will at that time, in fact, be paroled. As the trial court noted, a distinct possibility exits that the appellant will remain incarcerated for the rest of his natural life.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Regardless of the appellant\u2019s assertions that the trial court specifically determined that the incarceration was a \u201cdisability,\u201d we do not find that to have been the case. The trial judge in his opinion said: \u201c[WJhile I don\u2019t find that jail in and of itself ... is a disability,\u201d it was nevertheless in the best interest of the child to terminate the appellant\u2019s parental rights. The trial court accordingly based its decision to terminate the appellant\u2019s parental rights on what was in the best interest of Kevon, and we are not persuaded that the lower court\u2019s decision in that regard was \u201carbitrary or clearly wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Obligation of DSS to Provide Services to Appellant</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">During the course of the three-day hearing regarding the termination of the appellant\u2019s parental rights, counsel for the DSS conceded that no services had been offered to the appellant and that no service agreements were presented to him for consideration. The appellant now claims that the trial court erred in terminating his parental rights when the requisite services had not been offered to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Md.Code Ann., Fam. Law \u00a7 5-524, titled \u201cChild welfare services,\u201d lists the general obligations of the DSS to the child and parent in such cases. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">The Administration shall provide child welfare services to a child and the child\u2019s parent or guardian:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">(1) to assist in preventing the necessity of placing the child outside of the child\u2019s home;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-10\">(2) to reunite the child with the child\u2019s parent or guardian after the child has been placed in foster care; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-11\">(3) if the child has been placed in foster care and cannot return to the child\u2019s parent or guardian, to develop and implement an alternative permanent plan for the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">Returning to \u00a7 5-313, subsection (c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-13\">(c) <em>Required considerations. </em>\u2014 In determining whether it is in the best interest of the child to terminate a natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>parent\u2019s right as to the child in any case, except the case of an abandoned child, the court shall give:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\">(2) consideration to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">(i) the timeliness, nature, and extent of services offered by the child placement agency to facilitate reunion of the child with the natural parent[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Subsection (d)(3) also provides that a court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">... may waive the child placement agency\u2019s obligation under subsection (c) of this section if the court, after appropriate evaluation of efforts made and services rendered, finds by clear and convincing evidence that the waiver of those obligations is in the best interest of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">The trial court, when analyzing the statutory criteria of \u00a7 5-313, explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\"><em>[T]he Department wants me to waive all of their requirements of what they shall do for reunification by clear and convincing evidence. I do waive them ... </em>The unusualness of the circumstances with the record, here\u2019s a man I guess in everyone\u2019s reason, I didn\u2019t realize they mixed prisoners. Here\u2019s a man that conceived a child while in jail, and had been in jail for some time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">(Emphasis supplied). Accordingly, the trial court waived any obligation of the DSS to provide services to the appellant under \u00a7 5-313(d)(3) due to the \u201cunusual\u201d circumstances presented by the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">In <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. 99, 642 A.2d 201 (1994) (hereinafter <em>\u201cAdoption 10941 </em>\u201d), the Court of Appeals held that reunification services need not be offered by the DSS under every conceivable set of circumstances. The Court there explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-12\">[Wjhere ... attempts at reunification would obviously be futile, the Department need not go through the motions in offering services doomed to failure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>335 Md. at 117, 642 A.2d 201. In that case, the Court specifically determined that the DSS was not obligated to provide reunification services to the mother, Sandra L., because her persistent and ongoing psychiatric problems had rendered her permanently unfit to raise her son, Ivan. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">Most importantly, Sandra\u2019s problems are persistent and ongoing. They do not represent a temporary crisis or an unfortunate string of bad luck ... Although we sincerely hope that Sandra one day finds mental and emotional stability, we cannot leave Ivan in legal limbo waiting for an event that likely will never happen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">335 Md. at 119, 642 A.2d 201. The Court then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">Since no amount of reunification services by the Department would likely result in reunification of Ivan and his parents, the Department need not meet its obligations under F.L. \u00a7 5-524 in order for the circuit court to terminate the natural parents\u2019 rights under F.L. \u00a7 5-313.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\"><em>Id.; See also Adoption CAA92, supra, </em>103 Md.App. at 19-20, 651 A.2d 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">The appellant attempts to distinguish <em>Adoption 10941 </em>from his own situation because, unlike in <em>Adoption 10941, </em>\u201cthe appellant father is not ill, mentally or otherwise.\u201d The appellant reads <em>Adoption 10941 </em>too narrowly. Granted, no allegation was made that the appellant suffers from a mental or psychological illness like Sandra L. Very much like Sandra L., however, the appellant\u2019s condition of incarceration is \u201cpersistent and ongoing\u201d and it is not a \u201ctemporary crisis\u201d likely to dissipate in the near future. We reiterate what the trial court recognized: there is a possibility that the appellant will remain incarcerated for the rest of his life. The appellant can offer no definite information regarding his potential for parole other than that \u201c[h]e may be paroled at some point in the relatively near future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">We, therefore, reach the same conclusion that the Court of Appeals did in <em>Adoption 10941: </em>we will not put Kevon\u2019s welfare in \u201clegal limbo\u201d while waiting for the scant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>possibility that the appellant will be released in the near future. The trial court accordingly properly found that under \u00a7 5 \u2014 313(d)(3), the DSS was relieved of any obligation to provide the appellant with services for reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-14\">. The trial court terminated parental rights with respect to both the appellant and Jacqueline T. Jacqueline T., however, has not appealed that ruling and this appeal concerns only the termination of parental rights with respect to the appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b270-7\">. The petition filed by the DSS also concerned the guardianship of Donte T., a son bom to Jacqueline T. and another inmate. Donte T., however, is not involved in the instant appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b272-9\">. The trial court appropriately relied on the 1997 version of \u00a7 5-313 when making its analysis of the statutory factors. Because the sections relevant to this appeal have subsequently been reenacted without significant change, we quote the 1999 volume of the Family Law Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
