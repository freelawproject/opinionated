Jacob (Bill) is the sole remainderman of two trusts established under the last will and testament of his father, John B. Jacob (John). Appellant sued Michael W. Davis, the surviving trustee of those trusts, and Davis\u2019s law firm, Ahlstrom <em>&amp; </em>Davis, P.A., appellees, alleging numerous violations of appellees\u2019 fiduciary duties as trustees, and seeking an accounting, other equitable relief, and damages. The complaint included the following counts: 1) breach of fiduciary duty; 2) declaratory relief; 3) injunctive relief; 4) breach of contract; 5) tortious breach of covenants of good faith and fair dealing; 6) negligence; 7) trover and conversion; and 8) an accounting and establishment of a constructive or resulting trust. Ruling on a motion made by appellees at the end of appellant\u2019s case, the trial court entered judgment pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-519 in favor of appellees on all eight counts. This appeal was timely filed from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">John died on January 22, 1994, leaving an estate valued at $853,164, and a will that created two trusts known as the Marital Trust, and the Family Trust, respectively (collectively, \u201cthe Trusts\u201d). John\u2019s surviving wife, Harriett Bell Jacob (Harriett) was the income beneficiary of the Trusts, and appellant was the remainder beneficiary. Harriett, appellant\u2019s stepmother, had the right to make certain withdrawals of principal from the Family Trust, limited in amount and timing, and Davis, as independent trustee, had the authority to make discretionary distributions of principal from the Trusts to Harriett \u201cas, in the sole and absolute discretion of [Davis], are' necessary, desirable or appropriate for the health, education and support of [Harriett] in [her] accustomed manner of living.\u201d The will directed that \u201cin exercising such discretion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>the Trustee may take into account other financial resources of the beneficiaries under consideration.\u201d Harriett, was prohibited from participating in the discretionary decision to distribute principal to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">John bequeathed his residuary estate to the Marital and Family Trusts. The size of each trust was determined by a formula, which directed that the Family Trust receive an amount equal to the maximum amount that could pass free of federal estate taxes by utilizing the credit against estate and gift taxes (\u201cunified credit\u201d) available to John, and the Marital Trust receive the remainder. Application of this formula resulted in zero federal estate tax payable by John\u2019s estate, because his available tax credit allowed $600,000 to pass to the Family Trust free of tax. Further, there were no taxes payable with respect to the assets passing to the Marital Trust, because the trust qualified for the federal estate tax marital deduction (\u201cmarital deduction\u201d), and thus any tax was deferred until the death of Harriett.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Appellee Davis and Harriett were designated as personal representatives of John\u2019s estate. The personal representatives were required to make an election on his federal estate tax return identifying what portion of the Marital Trust they elected to qualify for the marital deduction. Although all assets passing to the Marital Trust <em>could </em>so qualify, an election was required to effectuate the marital deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The personal representatives were required to show on the estate\u2019s Administration Account filed with the Orphans\u2019 Court the exact amount passing to the Marital Trust.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The First and Final Administration Account for John\u2019s estate, filed November 7, 1994, showed that $80,223 was to be distributed to the Marital Trust. This was consistent with the $80,476 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>elected by the personal representatives to qualify for the marital deduction on John\u2019s federal estate tax return.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In fact, however, no assets were distributed to the Marital Trust, and this trust never was funded. John\u2019s entire residuary estate was distributed by appellee Davis and Harriett, personal representatives, to the Family Trust. The 'discrepancy between 1) the amount designated as passing to the Marital Trust on the distribution account for John\u2019s estate ($80,476), which is consistent with the federal estate tax return, and 2) the actual amount distributed (zero), is one subject of appellant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Another subject of appellant\u2019s complaint is the refusal of appellee Davis to provide appellant with an accounting for the Trusts. Appellant first requested an accounting in May of 1996, by letter to a paralegal at Ahlstrom &amp; Davis, P.A., who assisted Davis in estate and trust matters. Responding in a May 28, 1996 letter (May 28 letter), Davis told appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALK\">Your letter raised an interesting point regarding my duties to you under the Trust Agreement for the aforesaid Trust. As you know, I am a co-Trustee with your stepmother, Harriett Bell Jacob, of this Trust. Pursuant to the provisions of the Trust, the Trustee is to render an annual account to the \u201ccurrent income beneficiaries\u201d of the Trust. At present, your stepmother is the only income beneficiary. Thus, I as Trustee, have no obligation to provide to you an accounting for the Trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">If you wish, I will forward a copy of your letter to [the paralegal] to your stepmother for the purpose of obtaining her approval to give you an accounting for the Trust. Since she and I are co-Trustees, and since she is the sole income beneficiary, if I were to provide such an accounting to you without obtaining her consent first, I would be breaching my fiduciary obligations to her. Please let me know if you wish for me to do this____ Your stepmother is very active in the administration of this Trust, and, in fact, makes all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>decisions regarding any distributions from the Trust. My only role at this point is to facilitate her administration and to provide to her any counsel that she may wish regarding the Trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">After receiving this letter, appellant called Harriett to request her permission for an accounting, but she declined. Harriett died in January 1997, leaving an estate valued at approximately $1,500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">On April 17, 1997, almost a year after his first request, appellant again requested by letter an accounting of the Trusts, this time through his attorneys, Christopher Wheeler and Gene C. Lange (collectively, \u2018Wheeler\u201d)- In the letter Wheeler asked that the accountings \u201ccover all assets, property, receipts, expenditures, distributions, trustee and other commissions, attorneys\u2019 and other professional fees, and any and all payments or transfers to and from the two trusts and [Harriett\u2019s] Estate.\u201d The letter also requested all \u201cbooks, records, tax returns, court filings or other information\u201d concerning these items. Wheeler requested that the information be furnished by April 25, 1997. In response to this letter, Davis wrote to Wheeler on April 18,1997, and said, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4s\">[P]lease be advised that the John B. Jacob Marital Trust was never established since the total assets that were available from the Estate of John B. Jacob to be distributed to his Testamentary Trust did not exceed $600,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Davis enclosed in his letter copies of the following documents: 1) inventory and distribution account for John\u2019s estate; 2) statements from the brokerage firm of Ferris, Baker Watts for the Family Trust; 3) the check register for the Family Trust checking account; 4) 1995 and 1996 balance sheets, prepared by the accountant for the Family Trust; 5) 1995 and 1996 \u201cgeneral ledgers,\u201d prepared by the accountant, showing income and other deposits received, disbursements, plus sales of stocks; 6) income tax returns for 1995 and 1996 filed by the Family Trust; 7) a summary of profits and losses for 1995 and 1996 showing $143,543 in total distributions to Harriett over the two-year period; and 8) John\u2019s will and First and Final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Accounting for John\u2019s Estate. Davis also provided a two-page document, unsigned, titled \u201cJohn Jacob Family Trust, Recap of Transactions.\u201d Pertinent portions of this recap are reproduced below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">\n<em>JOHN B. JACOB FAMILY TRUST</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ac-dedup-0\">RECAP OF TRANSACTIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">1. <em>JAN. \u201895</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">2 taxable GNMA/FNMA bonds (35,000/ea.) transferred to Harriett\u2019s individual account, as well as 6,000 in cash This transfer was to satisfy the following: $30,000 specific bequest under Mr. Jacob\u2019s Will, the family allowance of $5,000, and all income and interest earned by the Estate during the time of administration</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">2. <em>MAR. \u201895</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-10\">400 shares of Pfizer, 100 shares of United Technology transferred to Harriett as reimbursement for living expenses she paid out-of-pocket during the course of Estate administration ($28,997 rent to Vantage House, $12,830 other living expenses and medical expenses paid on behalf of Mr. Jacob)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-11\">3. <em>APR. \u201895</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-12\">Balt.

Trust income thru May was approx. $9,290. $4,000 was transferred directly from FBW, and the remainder was taken in stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-15\">5. <em>DEC. \u201895</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4hv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>$10,000 check requested from FBW to put cash into First National Trust checking for expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\">6. <em>DEC. \u201895</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">5% of the value of the Trust to go to Harriett pursuant to her 5/5 powers \u2014 she elected to take the $20,000 Md. 1st Ser. 6.5% bond and the $10,000 P.G.

The other checks were as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-11\">1. Ahlstrom &amp; Davis, P.A. 12/95 \u2014 $1,931.40 (fees)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-12\">2.

IRS 1/97 \u2014 $327.73 (taxes due on \u201994 return)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-16\">The recap summarizes distributions to Harriett, but often does not designate whether they were principal or income. For example, Harriett\u2019s monthly expenses at Vantage House were paid in March 1995 from the Family Trust, but not designated as either principal or income. In addition to the Vantage House payments, stocks, bonds, and cash with an approximate value of $143,000<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were transferred to her during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>the two-year period. According to the Family Trust checkbook, payments to Vantage House totaled $49,572.67. These distributions to Harriett or for her benefit substantially exceeded the Family Trust income during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">With respect to the other information requested by Wheeler, Davis said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">With such short notice, the above is the best that we can do to comply with your request that we provide you information by April 25, 1997. From these documents, you should be able to understand the relationship between the Estate of John B. Jacob, the John B. Jacob Family Trust, and Harriett Bell Jacob. I think you will find that there were no distributions from the Trust that did not comply with both the intent and the provisions of the Last Will and Testament of John B. Jacob.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Davis did not provide any further information to explain the discrepancy in accounting regarding the Marital Trust funding. Nor did he provide information as to how the expenses of the trust, such as trustees\u2019 commissions and accountant fees, were allocated between the income beneficiary and the re-mainderman. Further, no information was provided to show how in kind distributions of stock to Harriett were valued, <em>e.g., </em>at inventory value or fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Davis did offer to meet with appellant and counsel and the accountant for the estate to discuss their concerns. On May 5, 1997, Wheeler replied that \u201ca meeting would probably be beneficial, but [we] would prefer that we have a little longer to digest the information you provided.\u201d In that letter Wheeler also said: \u2018We have noted an omission in the documents you provided. As a result we hereby request a complete accounting of (including all documents related to) the transfer of assets owned by John B. Jacob at his death, to the Family Trust, for the period October, 1994, through January, 1995.\u201d Wheeler also requested the federal estate tax return for John\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Davis responded to Wheeler\u2019s letter on May 7, and enclosed the Ferris, Baker Watts statements for the period requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>and the federal estate tax return. With respect to the statements, appellee Davis commented: \u201c[pjlease note that there may be discrepancies between these statements and the accounting that was filed in the Orphan\u2019s Court.... The Accounting does not provide a means to show changes in the prices of the equities during the time from when the estate is opened until the time the estate is closed.\u201d He also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD6\">Please advise Mr. Jacob that we are currently in a position to wind up his father\u2019s trust and make the final distributions as required under [his father\u2019s] Last Will and Testament. Until any potential claims that Mr. Jacob wants to make are resolved, however, we cannot wind up the trust. We await Mr. Jacob\u2019s pleasure with regard to the timing of this process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">On May 23, 1997, Wheeler again wrote to Davis, and requested that he \u201cexplain the justification for the removal of\u2019 five stocks and seven bonds from the trust, as well as other specific items, suggesting that these items \u201ccould only be removed from the Family Trust pursuant to the terms and intent of the Family Trust established by Mr. Jacob.\u201d The record does not reflect Davis\u2019s response to this letter. Bill testified that he never received any explanation or accounting from Davis regarding the trust principal that was distributed to Harriett. Appellees took the position at trial and on appeal that they had no obligation to account to Bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Although the letters refer to several telephone conversations between counsel, there is no indication that the parties ever had a meeting. Appellant filed suit on July-3, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">We must determine the validity of the trial court\u2019s entry of judgment on all eight counts of the complaint in favor of appellees at the end of appellant\u2019s case. Our major focus in this opinion will be on Counts I, II, and III, all of which rest on the equitable claim that appellees violated their fiduciary duties as trustees. We vacate the judgment entered on these counts, and remand the case to the circuit court for further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>proceedings on these counts. We affirm the lower court\u2019s judgment on Counts IV through VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Count I \u2014 Breach of Fiduciary Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Appellant alleged several breaches of fiduciary duty by appellees,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and included repetitive allegations in his complaint. We have distilled the alleged breaches into three separate categories, and discuss each separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Entitlement to Accounting</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Appellant complains that appellees never provided a full accounting of the Trusts created under John\u2019s will. Appellees contend that they had no obligation to provide an accounting to appellant either during the lifetime of Harriett or after her death. Alternatively, they claim that the documents they provided to appellant in April 1997, after her death, were a sufficient accounting of the Trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">Appellees rely on section 10.02 of John\u2019s will, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">My Trustee shall be excused from filing any account with any court; however, my Trustee shall render an annual (or more frequent) account and may, at any other time, including at the time of the death, resignation, or removal of any Trustee, render an intermediate account of my Trustee\u2019s administration to such of the then current income beneficiaries who are of sound mind and not minors at the time of such accounting. The written approval of such accounting by all of such income beneficiaries shall bind all persons then having or thereafter acquiring or claiming any interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>in any trust, and shall be a complete discharge to my Trustee with respect to all matters set forth in the account as fully and to the same extent as though the account had been judicially settled in an action or proceeding in which all persons having, acquiring, or claiming any interest were duly made parties and were duly represented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The trial court held that under the terms of the Trusts and applicable law, the trustees had no obligation to account to a remainderman such as appellant during the lifetime of the income beneficiary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court seemingly agreed with appellant that an accounting was due after death, but found that the documents provided by appellees after Harriett\u2019s death sufficed. Specifically, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">[T]he Ferris, Baker Watt statements certainly show with respect to the stock portfolio [of] which much of this estate was comprised, indicates the transactions that took place, and also shows at the end [sic] of the taxable income. So there certainly is a reference as to what income was derived in a particular year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">We do not agree with appellees\u2019 view that appellant is not entitled to request and obtain an accounting of the Trusts. The leading authorities on trusts are unequivocal in their articulation of the right of the remainder beneficiary to an accounting during the lifetime of the income beneficiary and after his or her death. Austin W. Scott and William F. Fratcher, <em>The Law of Trusts, </em>(Vol. IIA 4th ed.1987) \u00a7 172 explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">A trustee is under a duty to the beneficiaries of the trust to keep clear and accurate accounts. His accounts should show what he has received and what he has expended. They should show what gains have accrued and what losses have been incurred on changes of investments. If the trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>is created for beneficiaries in succession, the accounts should show what receipts and what expenditures are allocated to principal and what are allocated to income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">If the trustee fails to keep proper accounts, all doubts will be resolved against him and not in his favor ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">Not only must the trustee keep accounts, but he must render an accounting when called on to do so at reasonable times by the beneficiaries. Where there are several beneficiaries, any one of them can compel an accounting by the trustee. The fact that a beneficiary has only a future interest ... does not preclude him from compelling the trustee to account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">George Bogert, <em>The Law of Trusts and Trustees, </em>(Rev.2d ed.1983) \u00a7 961 takes a similar view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">[T]he beneficiary is entitled to demand of the trustee all information about the trust and its execution for which he has any reasonable use____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">If the beneficiary asks for relevant information about the terms of the trust, its present status, past acts of management, the intent of the trustee as to future administration, or other incidents of the administration of the trust, and these requests are made at a reasonable time and place and not merely vexatiously, it is the duty of the trustee to give the beneficiary the information for which he has asked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">Both Scott, <em>supra, </em>and Bogert, <em>supra, </em>cite numerous cases in support of the rule that a remainder beneficiary is entitled to an accounting. Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 172 at 454; Bogert, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 172, comment (b) states the rule in like terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-13\">The beneficiary may by a proper proceeding compel the trustee to render to the proper court an account of the administration of the trust.... The trustee may be compelled [to] account not only by a beneficiary presently entitled to the payment of income or principal, but also by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>beneficiary who will be or may be entitled to receive income or principal in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Maryland law is consistent with the law of other states. The Court of Appeals liberally construed the class of those beneficiaries who have a right to an accounting in the case of <em>In Re Clarke\u2019s Will, </em>198 Md. 266, 81 A.2d 640 (1951). There, a remainder beneficiary sought an accounting and declaratory relief and alleged that the trustee planned to sell a farm that was a trust asset and apply the proceeds for the benefit of her husband, an income beneficiary of the trust. The Court held that the contingent remainderman had standing to seek an accounting, and explained: \u201cIf the petitioner has any interest at all he is entitled to invoke the court\u2019s protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273, 81 A.2d 640; <em>see also Baer v. Kahn, </em>131 Md. 17, 101 A. 596 (1917).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">In <em>Shipley v. Crouse, </em>279 Md. 613, 370 A.2d 97 (1977), the Court of Appeals articulated the general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">While ... in the ordinary case, beneficiaries are entitled to receive \u2018complete and accurate information as to the administration of the trust\u2019 and \u2018to know what the trust property is and how the Trustee has dealt with it,\u2019 this is not absolute, if the trustee renders periodic reports showing collection of income and disbursements, if the trustee is acting in good faith and is not abusing his discretionary powers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 625, 370 A.2d 97 (citations omitted). The <em>Shipley </em>Court did not indicate that the rights of the plaintiffs, who were remaindermen, were more restricted because they had no immediate possessory interest. The statement of the rule in <em>Shipley, </em>however, was <em>dictum, </em>because the plaintiffs did not obtain the disclosures they desired. The Court held that a trustee\u2019s duty to account did not require that the trustee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>disclose the specifics of delicate negotiations with a potential buyer regarding the sale of a business owned by the trust, especially when remaindermen had previously expressed their agreement that the business be sold. <em>Id. </em>at 625-26, 370 A.2d 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Appellees argue that section 10.2 of the will relieves them from any obligation to account to a remainder beneficiary. This section allows the trustee to provide an accounting at any time, and provides that if such accounting is approved in writing by the then income beneficiaries, then the trustee is discharged with respect to the matters covered by the account. Appellees would have us apply this section to modify the common law obligation of a trustee to account.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">To our knowledge, no Maryland appellate decision has addressed the extent to which a decedent or testator may limit the common law duty of a trustee to account in a court of equity. Nor do we find any statute or rule, addressing this point. Bogert, <em>swpra, </em>asserts that a trust beneficiary has a right to an accounting, notwithstanding language in the trust purporting to limit its obligation to account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">A [testator] who attempts to create a trust without any accountability in the trustee is contradicting himself. A trust necessarily grants rights to the beneficiary that are enforceable in equity. If the trustee cannot be called to account, the beneficiary cannot force the trustee to any particular line of conduct with regard to the trust property or sue for breach of trust. The trustee may do as he likes with the property, and the beneficiary is without remedy. If the court finds that the settlor really intended a trust, it would seem that accountability in chancery or other court must inevitably follow as an incident. Without an account the beneficiary must be in the dark as to whether there has been a breach of trust and so is prevented as a practical matter from holding the trustee liable for a breach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Bogert, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 973 at 467. In the present case we need not decide this interesting issue because we do not interpret section 10.02 in light of the will as a whole, to limit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>trustees\u2019 obligation to account under the present circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">When interpreting a will, we must gather the intention of the testator from the language of the entire will. <em>See LeRoy v. Kirk, </em>262 Md. 276, 280, 277 A.2d 611 (1971). Further, we must construe the provisions of a will to be consistent, rather than to be in conflict. <em>See Veditz v. Athey, </em>239 Md. 435, 448, 212 A.2d 115 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">When section 10.02 is considered in light of section 10.08, the former cannot reasonably be construed to deny appellant an accounting based on Harriett\u2019s consent to some prior accounting. Section 10.08 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">Notwithstanding any other provision hereunder, no Trustee hereunder shall have a vote or otherwise participate in any decision regarding whether, and to what extent, any discretionary payment of principal or interest shall be made or allocated to or for such Trustee\u2019s personal benefit or to or for the benefit of any person for whose support such Trustee may be legally obligated. Any such decision shall be made by the co-Trustee then serving, or if there is no such co-Trustee, then the Trustee shall appoint a co-Trustee to make such decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Clearly, if Harriett cannot participate in a decision to distribute principal to her, then her consent to such distribution cannot be considered binding upon a remainderman whose interest is adversely effected. <em>Cf. Madden v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>27 Md.App. 17, 339 A.2d 340 (1975) (any laches which could have been chargeable to income beneficiary regarding misconduct of trustee cannot be binding upon the remaindermen). Since appellant\u2019s claim for accounting is based upon his contention that principal amounts were improperly distributed to Harriett, section 10.02 of the will does not bar his suit. <em>See also </em>discussion in Section IB of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Nor do we interpret the provision in section 10.02 of the will that the trustees \u201cshall be excused from filing any account with any court\u201d to mean that the testator intended to remove the jurisdiction of a court of equity to require an accounting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>upon the reasonable request of a beneficiary. <em>See Salter v. Salter, </em>209 Ga. 90, 70 S.E.2d 453, 458 (1952). <em>See also </em>Bogert, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Appellees suggested at oral argument that appellant was not entitled to an accounting in this proceeding because a court can only require an accounting if it assumes jurisdiction over the trust, and appellant did not follow the procedure under Maryland Rule 10-501 to request that the court do so. We do not agree that a petition for assumption of jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 10-501 is required in order that a court order an accounting, and find <em>Baer, supra, </em>instructive. In <em>Baer </em>the Court held that the trustee\u2019s mere refusal to account did not justify his removal, but that if an accounting were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">necessary in order to ascertain whether the trustee is executing the trust fairly and without abuse of the discretionary power reposed in him, a Court of Equity, upon being applied to, should order such information to be given; but until that is done and it is found that the trustee is not administering the trust in good faith, or is abusing the discretionary power granted him under the will, the Court should not against his wishes, assume supervisory jurisdiction of the trustee\u2019s discretionary powers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-7\"><em>Baer, </em>131 Md. at 29, 101 A. 596. What we glean from <em>Baer </em>is that seeking and obtaining an accounting will sometimes precede a request for a court to assume jurisdiction over a trust, and the results of the accounting may be the \u201creason for seeking the assumption of jurisdiction by the court ...\u201d required under Rule 10-501. Thus, we hold that appellant was not required to petition pursuant to Rule 10-501 in order to obtain an accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">In sum, we hold that appellant was entitled to an accounting during the life of Harriett and at her death, notwithstanding the language in section 10.02 of John\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">The Information Furnished by the Trustees</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">The trial court found that the documents provided by appellees in April 1997, were sufficient to meet any obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>to account because they provided the recap, brokerage statements from the firms holding the estate\u2019s securities, and a list of payments and receipts for the two-year period of the Family Trust. We do not agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that this information sufficed, because appellees still failed to provide certain critical information. This information is separated by category and discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">l.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Allocations of Expenses and Receipts Between Income and Principal</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">One of appellant\u2019s complaints about the information furnished by appellees is that there was no allocation of receipts and expenses to either trust income or trust principal as required under Md.Code (1974, 1991 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 14-201 <em>et seq. </em>of the Estates and Trusts Article (\u201cPrincipal and Income Act\u201d). Appellant\u2019s expert witness testified that, based on the records provided, it appeared that the trustees had made no allocation; and therefore, the burden of all expenses was borne by the remainder interest. Section 14-202 of the Principal and Income Act provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">(a) A trust shall be administered with due regard to the respective interests of income beneficiaries and remainder-men. A trust is so administered with respect to the allocation of receipts and expenditures if a receipt is credited or an expenditure is charged to income or principal or partly to each:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">(1) In accordance with the terms of the trust instrument, notwithstanding contrary provisions of this subtitle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">(2) In the absence of any contrary terms of the trust instrument, in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle; ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-11\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 14-202. The remaining sections of the Principal and Income Act set forth detailed rules as to how a trustee should allocate receipts and expenses between the income beneficiary and the remaindermen.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>The parties have not directed us to, nor have we found, any clause in John\u2019s will that would make the Principal and Income Act inapplicable. Further, a trustee\u2019s obligation to make allocations between income beneficiaries and remainder-men is an obligation well recognized in common law. <em>See Berlage v. Boyd, </em>206 Md. 521, 532,112 A.2d 461 (1955); Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 172 at 452, and cases collected therein (\u201cIf the trust is created for beneficiaries in succession, the accounts should show what receipts and what expenditures are allocated to principal and what are allocated to income.\u201d); Bogert, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 970 at 377-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The documents that appear in the record do not make any allocations of receipts or expenses to principal or income. Incpme tax returns do not suffice for this purpose because federal law regarding what is taxable income, and what expenses are deductible from income, differs from determination of income and principal under the Principal and Income Act. Calvin H. Cobb, III, a lawyer specializing in estate and trust law, testified that he had reviewed all of the documents furnished by appellees, and was unable, based on that information, to reconstruct an accounting that made allocations between income and principal. Mr. Cobb testified that he \u201ctried to recreate based on this information a proper accounting that would allocate income and principal [but there was] information that didn\u2019t reconcile____\u201d He observed that \u201cit appears that rather than distributing net income to [Harriett], there was no effort to charge expense to income. They instead distributed gross income to [Harriett].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">A major theme advanced by appellees in defense is that appellant, in presentation of his case, was unable to demonstrate precisely where and how the trustees failed to follow their obligations under applicable law or John\u2019s will. \u201c[T]he burden of proof on the issue of breach of trust is not initially on the fiduciary----\u201d <em>Goldman v. Rubin, </em>292 Md. 693, 713, 441 A.2d 713 (1982). The burden, however, shifts to the trustee once the beneficiary has introduced a certain quantum of proof: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>absence of instructions, a Maryland statute governs. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 1991 RepLVol.), \u00a7 11-107(2) of the Estates and Trusts Article (\u201cE <em>&amp; </em>T\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>[T]he person who challenges the conduct of a trustee, must first allege that the trustee has a duty and has been derelict in the performance of this duty, and offer evidence in support of this allegation. Then, and not until then, does the trustee have the burden of rebutting the allegation. In the absence of such proof, there is no duty on the trustee to prove a negative: <em>ie., </em>that he has not been derelict in the performance of his duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lopez v. Lopez, </em>250 Md. 491, 501, 243 A.2d 588 (1968)); <em>see also Md. Nat\u2019l Bank v. Cummins, </em>322 Md. 570, 581-82, 588 A.2d 1205 (1991); <em>Wood v. Honeyman, </em>178 Or. 484, 169 P.2d 131, 162 (1946); Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 172 at 452 (\u201cIf the trustee fails to keep proper accounts, all doubts will be resolved against him and not in his favor.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">We have reviewed all of the documents provided by appel-lees to appellant in response to appellant\u2019s request for an accounting. Based on our review, in conjunction with the testimony of Mr. Cobb, we conclude that appellant met his initial burden to show that appellees breached their fiduciary duties by failing to make any allocations between principal and income. Accordingly, it was incumbent upon appellees to come forward and explain this apparent failure. Without such explanation, the trial court should not have granted the motion for judgment on Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">u.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Failure to Account for Non-Funding of Marital Trust: Marital Trust Bequest of $80,223 Pursuant To Formula In Will</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">Another deficiency asserted by appellant regarding the information furnished by appellees relates to the Marital Trust. The documents initially provided to appellant showed a $80,223 distribution to the Marital Trust from the estate, but nothing about a Marital Trust thereafter. After a second request by appellant\u2019s counsel, appellees advised counsel that this trust \u201cwas never established since the total assets that were available ... to be distributed from [John\u2019s estate] did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>not exceed $600,000.\u201d No explanation was then offered regarding the discrepancy between appellees\u2019 non-funding of the Martial Trust and the $80,223 distribution shown on both the estate\u2019s administration account and John\u2019s federal estate tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The assets held in John\u2019s estate may well have decreased in value between the date of John\u2019s death and the date assets were distributed from his estate. If such occurs, however, the personal representative must follow the funding formula set forth in the will to determine how the decrease is allocated between the Trusts. We explain below.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The size of the bequests to the Marital Trust and the Family Trust is determined by formula.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The formula is tied to the amount of assets that can pass free of tax to a decedent\u2019s heirs under federal estate tax law by application of an individual\u2019s \u201cunified credit.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 2001 (1998). Expressed in non-technical terms, the federal tax law allows an individual to pass to his or her heirs, free of tax, assets totaling no more than $600,000 in value. For purposes of the federal estate tax, the value of each asset is determined as of the date of the decedent\u2019s death. When the values of the assets change during estate administration, at the time of distribution, the personal representative must look to the will for instructions regarding how to value those assets. In the</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>John\u2019s will did provide such instruction \u2014 section 7.02 requires the assets distributed to the Marital Trust</p>\n<blockquote id=\"axl-dedup-0\">shall be selected in such manner that the cash and other property distributed will have an aggregate fair market value fairly representative of the distributee\u2019s proportionate share of the appreciation or depreciation in the value to the date or dates of distribution of all property then available for distribution. Any property assigned or conveyed in kind to satisfy the aforegoing bequest shall be valued for that purpose at the value thereof as finally determined for Federal Estate Tax purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">John\u2019s personal representatives held the responsibility to determine how to allocate the residuary estate between the Marital Trust and the Family Trust. Under the funding formula set forth in section 7.02, if the estate assets decrease in value, the Marital Trust would be diminished on a pro rata basis with the Family Trust and would absorb no more than its pro rata share of such decrease. In light of this mandatory directive we do not see how the Marital Trust could be legitimately \u201cwiped out\u201d by a decrease in overall value, when the Family Trust bequest remained intact.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The discrepancy regarding the funding of the Marital Trust is not explained by appellees\u2019 assertion that the \u201ctotal assets that were available ... to be distributed ... did not exceed $600,000.\u201d Proof of the discrepancy was sufficient to place the burden on the trustees to offer a better explanation and accounting with regard to this issue. Accordingly, it was error for the trial court to enter judgment in favor of appel-lees in appellant\u2019s suit for such accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Appellees suggest that the discrepancy regarding funding of the Marital Trust is only of theoretical concern because appellant is the remainderman under both the Marital and Family Trusts. We do not agree with this analysis because the terms of John\u2019s will differ with respect to principal distributions authorized to be made from each of the Trusts. Under section 8.03 of John\u2019s will, Harriett could withdraw annually the \u201cgreater of (a) Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) or (b) Five Percent (5%) of the value of the principal of the Family Trust.\u201d By contrast, she had no right of withdrawal from the Marital Trust.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, if the Family Trust were funded with assets that properly belonged to the Marital Trust, then the five percent of the trust subject to Harriett\u2019s withdrawal right became correspondingly larger. The record suggests that Harriett exercised this right in full. Thus, it appears that some assets that should have remained in trust for Bill were, in fact, distributed to Harriett.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The trial court rested its decision on the Marital Trust issue in part upon the following language in John\u2019s will:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">[The trustee] shall have the power to make any election required to be made to qualify the Marital Trust for the federal estate and/or gift tax marital deduction. If the federal estate tax laws applicable to my estate permit a partial election to be made or permit such an election with respect to a specific portion of the Marital Trust, my Trustee may in its discretion make such election with respect to less than all the Marital Trust, and such portion shall be treated for all purposes as a specific portion of [the Marital] Trust and as a separate Trust share. My Trustee shall not be liable for any decision made in good faith and with reasonable diligence with respect to such election.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The discretion accorded the trustees by this section to make a \u201cpartial election\u201d allows the trustees to \u201cqualify the Marital Trust for the federal estate tax marital deduction.\u201d Such partial election will have an impact on the amount of the Marital Trust that qualifies for the marital deduction, but it does not cause any portion of the Marital Trust to be merged with the Family Trust. As the clause indicates, if a partial election is made, the portion elected to so qualify, \u201cshall be treated for all purposes as a specific portion of this Trust and as a separate Trust share.\u201d The trustees\u2019 power to create two separate trusts which together comprise the Marital Trust is not equivalent to the power to transfer assets from the Marital Trust to the Family Trust. Harriett\u2019s power to withdraw principal extends only to the Family Trust, and does not extend to the Marital Trust, even if divided.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Appellees also suggest that because Harriett bequeathed her estate to trusts for the benefit of Bill\u2019s children, appellant\u2019s concern about the size of the Trusts is only theoretical. Regardless of any emotional appeal that this contention may have, it has no legal merit in its own right.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To the extent that assets were improperly distributed to Harriett, and passed to trusts under her will, Bill is denied the right to those assets, even- though his children receive an interest as trust beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Although we have expressed our disagreement with appel-lees\u2019 explanation, offered in their April 18, 1997 letter to appellant, for why the Marital Trust was not funded, we do not now hold that John\u2019s estate was distributed improperly. We think that such decision must be reserved until appellees provide a full accounting of how they applied the formula in the will to distribute assets to the Marital Trust and Family Trust, respectively. We do hold that, in the absence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>better explanation, the trial court should not have granted the motion for judgment on Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Whether Appellees Improperly Delegated Discretion Regarding Distribution of Principal to Co-trustee Harriett</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Appellant alleges that appellees also breached their fiduciary duties by improperly delegating to Harriett the authority to make discretionary distributions to herself for her \u201chealth, education and support\u201d pursuant to section 8.04 of John\u2019s will. Appellant further contends that, to the extent the appellees actually exercised any discretion, they improperly failed to consider Harriett\u2019s financial circumstances before making principal distributions from the Family Trust. They point out that, at her death, Harriett had assets of approximately $1,500,000, and that she clearly had sufficient assets and income to cover her needs without principal distributions. Appellees respond that the distributions were justified under the will, and not subject to challenge by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">The will, indeed, does call for quite liberal distributions at the discretion of the trustees. Section 8.04 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">In addition to any distribution of income or principal or both otherwise provided for herein, my Trustee may pay over to my wife such amounts of the principal of the Family Trust as, in the sole and absolute discretion of my Trustee, are necessary, desirable or appropriate for the health, education and support of my spouse in my spouse\u2019s accustomed manner of living. In exercising such discretion, the Trustee may take into account other financial resources of the beneficiaries under consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">As indicated previously, the will also restricts Harriett from any participation in the decision to distribute principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">The discretion accorded in the will to make principal distributions to Harriett was lodged in appellees alone. It is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>fundamental principle of trust law that a trustee may not delegate discretionary duties. Professor Scott explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\">Where there are several trustees it is the duty of each of them, unless it is otherwise provided by the terms of the trust, to participate in the administration of the trust. A trustee is under a duty not to delegate to third persons the doing of acts that he can reasonably be required personally to perform. Similarly, a trustee cannot properly delegate the doing of such acts to his co-trustees. It is improper for one of the trustees to leave to the others the control over the administration of the trusts. A trustee who remains inactive is guilty of a breach of trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 184 at 560-61. Maryland decisions are in accord with Scott\u2019s statement of the rule. <em>See Waesche v. Rizzuto, 224 </em>Md. 578, 587, 168 A.2d 871 (1961); <em>Caldwell v. Graham, </em>115 Md. 122, 128, 80 A. 839 (1911) (\u201cwhere one trustee delegates to another important duties of the trust, and under such circumstances funds have been wasted, he is liable to account to th[e] parties injured.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">When a discretionary power is lodged in a trustee, the courts are loathe to interfere with the exercise of that discretion. This reluctance disappears, however, when the trustee has delegated the power or failed to exercise its discretion. As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Waesche:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afr\">A court of equity will not interfere in the exercise of the discretionary power conferred on the trustees provided that this power was honestly and reasonably exercised. However, it must appear that the trustees acted in good faith, having a proper regard to the wishes of the testator and to the nature and character of the trust reposed in them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9M\"><em>Waesche, 224 </em>Md. at 587, 168 A.2d 871 (emphasis added). When a trustee is given discretion to invade the principal and make principal distributions to an income beneficiary, the trustee\u2019s failure to exercise its judgment regarding that discretion will constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>See Bregel v. Julier, </em>253 Md. 103, 109, 251 A.2d 891 (1969); <em>see also </em>Bogert, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 812 at 248 and n.83.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Appellant alleged that appellees did not exercise their power to distribute principal to Harriett, and introduced the May 28 letter to support that allegation. In that letter, appellee Davis plainly asserted that \u201c[y]our stepmother is very active in the administration of this Trust and, in fact, makes all decisions regarding any distributions from the Trust. My only role at this point is to facilitate her administration and to provide to her any counsel that she may wish regarding the Trust.\u201d (Emphasis added). This letter is highly significant because it constitutes an admission by appellee Davis that he was not participating in the decision whether to make principal distributions from the Family Trust, when, under the will, he was the <em>only </em>one authorized to make this decision. Surprisingly, appellees appeared to express their approval of Harriett\u2019s controlling discretionary distributions to herself, even though the will explicitly prohibits her from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">In granting appellees\u2019 motion for judgment, the trial court expressed its general conclusion with respect to principal distributions, stating: \u201cBased upon what I\u2019ve indicated so far I do not find that any transfer of any stock or other assets to [Harriett] as a result of either invasions of principal which were reasonable, necessary or desirable, or an exercise of her [8.03 rights under John\u2019s will] were improper in any respect.\u201d With regard to the discretionary distributions of principal, we hold that the trial court made an error of law in reaching this conclusion. <em>See Bregel, </em>253 Md. at 109, 251 A.2d 891; <em>Berlage, </em>206 Md. at 532, 112 A.2d 461; <em>Caldwell, </em>115 Md. at 128, 80 A. 839. We perceive that the court misapplied the burden of proof in this suit by a beneficiary against the trustees. The letter from appellee Davis suffices to meet appellant\u2019s burden to introduce evidence that appellees breached their fiduciary duty by improperly delegating their discretion to Harriett. <em>See id. </em>After introduction of this letter, the burden shifted to appellees to demonstrate that the statement in the letter did not accurately reflect how decisions regarding discretionary principal distributions were reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Appellant also complains that Harriett was allowed to choose which assets she would remove from the Family Trust, both pursuant to the discretionary distributions, and pursuant to her power to withdraw five percent of the trust annually. John\u2019s will provided that Harriett has the right to \u201cwithdraw from the principal ... amounts that do not exceed [five percent] of the value of the principal of the Family Trust.\u201d Her right to withdraw was expressed in terms of \u201camounts,\u201d and there was no intention expressed in the will that she would hold the power to withdraw specific assets. Applying the terms of the will, we conclude that it was the responsibility of appellees, not Harriett, to decide what assets would be distributed to Harriett under either type of principal distribution. Thus, a delegation of the responsibility from appellees to Harriett would constitute a breach of their fiduciary obligation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Alternate Grounds Relied on by Trial Court: Exculpatory Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Appellant requested compensatory damages as part of the relief sought under Count I. The trial court found no liability on the part of appellees, concluding that there was no \u201cevidence that there was a breach of fiduciary duty on the part of [appellees]... [T]he actions which were taken in this case were in accordance with the provisions of the Will and the trust agreement [and] ... Maryland law.\u201d The court went on to say that it \u201c certainly [did] not find, based upon the language of the agreement itself that there was any evidence that even came close to any gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud or any other improper actions.\u201d We perceive that the court, in making this latter finding was applying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>exculpatory, language contained in section 10.06 of the will as an alternate ground for its holding. The will provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">All decisions made in good faith and with reasonable diligence by my Trustee shall be conclusive and binding on all persons having or acquiring any interest in any trust under this Will. No Trustee shall be responsible or liable for the manner in which any discretion is exercised pursuant hereto, or for the act or omission of any other Trustee, or, unless his or her conduct amounts to fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence, for any act or omission of his or her own.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The exculpatory clause does not rule out liability for \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d or \u201cgross negligence.\u201d Thus, we examine the allegations of Count I to determine whether any of these actions could, if proven, constitute willful misconduct or gross negligence. Gross negligence is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">\u2018An intentional failure to perform a manifest duty in reckless disregard of the consequences as affecting the life or property of another, and also implies a thoughtless disregard of the consequences without the exertion of any effort to avoid them. Stated conversely, a wrongdoer is guilty of gross negligence or acts wantonly and willfully only when he inflicts injury intentionally or is so utterly indifferent to the rights of others that he acts as if such rights did not exist.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-8\"><em>Marriott, Corp. v. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co., </em>124 Md. App. 463, 723 A.2d 454 (1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>354 Md. 113, 729 A.2d 405 (1999) (quoting <em>Romanesk v. Rose, </em>248 Md. 420, 423, 237 A.2d 12 (1968) (in turn, quoting 4 DeWitt C. Blashfield, <em>Cyclopedia of Automobile Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 2771 (1946 ed.))); <em>see also Liscombe v. Potomac Edison Co., </em>303 Md. 619, 635, 495 A.2d 838 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Although appellees violated their fiduciary duty in refusing to give appellant an accounting during Harriett\u2019s lifetime, we do not consider this alone to be evidence of gross negligence or willful conduct. There was no evidence to suggest that appellees recognized an obligation to account, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>during Harriett\u2019s lifetime or after her death, and intentionally disregarded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">We cannot reach the same conclusion at this point with regard to the alleged improper delegation of discretionary power, or alleged improper failure to fund the Marital Trust. With respect to each of these items, the will provides explicit instructions. It expressly states that Harriett shall not make decisions regarding discretionary distributions of principal to her. Further, the formula for correctly funding the Marital and Family Trusts is clearly set forth in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">With clear instructions in the will, it would appear that appellees either did not read the will, or read the provisions in the will, but intentionally deviated from them. With respect to the latter, at least, a determination of gross negligence would be for the trier of fact. \u201cOrdinarily, unless the facts are so clear as to permit a conclusion as a matter of law, it is for the trier of fact to determine whether a defendant\u2019s negligent conduct amounts to gross negligence.\u201d <em>Artis v. Cyphers, </em>100 Md.App. 633, 652, 642 A.2d 298, <em>aff'd, </em>336 Md. 561, 649 A.2d 838 (1994); <em>see also Romanesk, </em>248 Md. at 423, 237 A.2d 12; <em>Feibelman v. Worthen Nat'l Bank, N.A., </em>20 F.3d 835, 837 (8th Cir.1994) (trustee acted with reckless disregard for rights of remaindermen with regard to distributions of principal to income beneficiary).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Although the trial court decided as a matter of fact that there was no gross negligence that would render inapplicable the exculpatory clause, on remand this decision must be reconsidered in light of our discussion in Section I.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Summary Regarding Count I</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In sum, we conclude that appellant produced sufficient evidence to meet his initial burden to show a specific breach of duty by appellees regarding their failure to account, their failure to fund the Marital Trust, and improper delegation of their discretionary power to distribute principal and to select assets to satisfy Harriett\u2019s right of withdrawal. Therefore, the trial court erred in granting judgment against appellant at the end of his case. Rather, the trial court should have required appellees to present their case and rebut or explain the evidence presented by appellant. We remand for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The Trial Court\u2019s Order that Appellees\u2019 Attorneys\u2019 Fees Be Paid From the Family Trust</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">The trial court ordered that appellees\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees relating to their defense of this litigation, totaling $141,866.66, be paid from the remaining principal of the Family Trust. Of this amount, $31,502.60 represented fees attributable to time spent by appellees in defense of this suit. Appellant challenges the validity of this award in light of the evidence that appellees violated their fiduciary obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">The general rule is that a trustee is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees paid from the trust if it successfully defends an action brought by the beneficiary. <em>See Sokol v. Nattans, </em>26 Md.App. 65, 91-93, 337 A.2d 460, <em>cert. denied, </em>275 Md. 755 (1975); <em>Saulsbury v. Denton Nat\u2019l Bank, 25 </em>Md.App. 669, 672-73, 335 A.2d 199, <em>cert. denied, </em>275 Md. 755 (1975). In this case, after determination of the issues on remand, the trial court may find that appellees\u2019 defense was successful in part, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>and unsuccessful in part. In such event, the court should allocate to the Trusts only that portion or percentage of the fees it considers, in its discretion, to be fairly attributable to the successful aspects of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Other Counts A.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Counts II and III</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Counts II and III request declaratory and injunctive relief based on the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty discussed with respect to Count I. Appellant requested, in these counts, an accounting, and the establishment of a constructive trust with respect to the assets of the Family Trust that were improperly distributed to Harnett. Whether a constructive trust should be established will depend upon the outcome on remand of the issues discussed previously, and it would be premature for us to decide the issue now. Appellant also requests in Count III that the court remove appellees as trustees. As discussed earlier, it appears appellees failed to perform their fiduciary duty by refusing to account, and may have committed other violations. If, on remand, it is judicially determined that appellees have violated a fiduciary duty, then the court must consider whether removal is an appropriate remedy.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See </em>E &amp; T \u00a7 15 \u2014 112(a) (2) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">Counts IV, V, VI, and VII</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\"> In Counts IV, V, VI, and VII appellant alleges that the same actions and omissions underlying appellees\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>alleged breach of fiduciary duties also constituted a breach of contract (IV), a tortious breach of the covenants of good faith and fair dealing arising out of contract (V), negligence (VI), and trover and conversion (VII). Appellees argue that the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Kann v. Kann, </em>344 Md. 689, 690 A.2d 509 (1997), makes clear that a beneficiary\u2019s claims against a trustee are exclusively equitable in nature, and therefore none of these causes of action are viable. We agree with appellees. <em>See id. </em>at 703, 690 A.2d 509. The equitable nature of a beneficiary\u2019s claims, however, does not preclude the beneficiary from recovering compensatory damages against a trustee under proper circumstances.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See Cummins, </em>322 Md. at 602, 588 A.2d 1205; <em>Caldwell, </em>115 Md. at 124, 80 A. 839; <em>Zimmerman v. Frailey, </em>70 Md. 561, 568, 17 A. 560 (1889); <em>see also </em>Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 172 at 452-54 and \u00a7 205 at 207-09; Bogert, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 541 at 169. In this case, if any damages are awarded in the proceedings on remand, they could only be awarded under Count I. We affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to grant judgment in favor of appellees on Counts IV, V, VI, and VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Count VIII \u2014 Accounting and Equitable Lien/Constructive or Resulting Trust</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Count VIII requests' an accounting and the establishment of an equitable lien or constructive trust \u201con the assets of defendants in such amount[s] as may be due and rightfully belonging to plaintiff.\u201d As we previously discussed, the trial court should have required a complete accounting by appel-lees. To the extent, however, that Count VIII requests that the court establish a lien or trust on the personal assets of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>appellees, rather than the assets included in Harriett\u2019s estate or the assets in the Family Trust, there is no allegation or evidence which supports such claim. Thus, other than the request for the accounting, the trial court was correct in entering judgment on Count VIII in favor of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID THREE-FOURTHS BY APPELLEES AND ONE-FOURTH BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-8\">. Under Federal Estate Tax Law, if the personal representatives did not elect to qualify the full Marital Trust for the marital deduction, taxes generated by the unqualified assets would be owed at John\u2019s death. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 2056(b)(7) (1998). Such \"partial election\u201d would not, however, diminish the amount of the assets that should pass to the Marital Trust pursuant to the directions in John\u2019s will.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b464-9\">. The minor discrepancy between these two figures is not material nor the subject of any dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b467-17\">. This figure does not include the amounts distributed to satisfy a $30,000 bequest to her in John\u2019s will or her $5,000 Family Allowance accorded Harriett by law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b470-13\">. John named both appellee Davis and his law firm, Ahlstrom &amp; Davis, P.A., a professional corporation, to serve as co-trustees with his wife. By referring to the appellees collectively as trustees, we do not intend to express any opinion on whether a professional corporation can serve as a trustee, an issue not raised in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b471-9\">. The court also relied on the testimony of appellees\u2019 expert, Calvin H. Cobb, III, interpreting that testimony to mean that no accounting was required. Mr. Cobb did agree that the will did not require an accounting to a remainder beneficiary. He did not, however, agree that no accounting was required under applicable law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b473-9\">. The Federal District Court for the District of Maryland stated in <em>dicta </em>in <em>Davidson v. Blaustein, </em>247 F.Supp. 225, 228 (D.Md.1965), that a remainder beneficiary is not entitled to an accounting until its interest becomes possessory. In our view, this decision represents an unduly restrictive view of a beneficiary\u2019s right to an accounting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\">. SECTION 7. <em>Marital Bequest.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">7.01. If my wife, Harriett Bell Jacob, survives me by at least thirty (30) days, I give to my Trustee such amount, if any, which, when added to the total value of all interests in property passing or which shall have already passed at the time of my death to my wife (under other provisions of this Will, or outside of this Will, by operation of law, or otherwise) for which a marital deduction is allowable under the federal estate tax laws in effect at the time of my death, shall be equal to the maximum allowable marital deduction, reduced by any amount necessary to increase my taxable estate (for federal estate tax purposes) to the largest amount that can pass free of federal estate tax after taking into account all allowable credits, including, without limitation, the unified credit and the credit for state death taxes; provided, however, that any state death tax credit shall be utilized only to the extent that it does not require any increase in state death taxes payable.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b481-8\">. Appellant\u2019s expert witness in the area of trust administration also addressed this issue when he opined that appellees committed a serious breach of fiduciary duty when they elected to qualify the Marital Trust for the federal estate tax deduction, and then failed to fund the Marital Trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\">. Both of the Trusts provided that the independent trustee \"shall pay over to my spouse amounts of the principal of the [Trust], as, in the sole and absolute discretion of my Trustee, are necessary, desirable or appropriate for the health, education and support of my spouse in my spouse\u2019s accustomed manner of living.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b483-7\">. Our opinion on this point does not take into account the potential effect of Bill\u2019s decision not to make a claim against Harriett's estate to recover assets wrongfully distributed to Harriett. Such issue may arise in proceedings in the circuit court upon remand of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b487-10\">. In a trust involving primarily publicly traded stocks, with readily ascertainable values, as the Marital Trust is, any damage to the remain-dermen arising from such a breach appears quite speculative. In this regard, we note that a trustee \"is not subject to a surcharge for a breach of trust that results in no loss.\" Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 205 at 239.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b489-7\">. In <em>Feibelman, </em>unlike the present case, the will required the trustee to determine that the income of the income beneficiary was insufficient to maintain her previous standard of living before principal distributions could be made. The case is instructive, nonetheless, regarding the type of conduct that could be considered to surpass the mere negligence standard. <em>See Feibelman, </em>20 F.3d at 837.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b489-8\">. The exculpatory language, moreover, applies only to the remedy of damages against appellees. As Professor Scott explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Although an exculpatory clause may relieve the trustee from liability for damages, there may be other remedies available to the beneficiary, for example, removal of the trustee, enjoining the trustee from committing an improper act, or denial or reduction of the trustee\u2019s compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">Scott, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 542 at 216.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b491-12\">. Regarding the issue of removal, the trial court should consider appellees' refusal to distribute the Family Trust assets to appellant in a timely manner after Harriett\u2019s death because appellant requested an accounting. This refusal may be a factor justifying removal or other relief, in light of our determination that appellant was correct in his request for an accounting, and the trial court's determination on remand regarding any other breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b492-8\">. We do not read the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Kann </em>as intending to modify the rule regarding recovery of compensatory damages in an equitable proceeding against a trustee. <em>Kann </em>holds, <em>inter alia, </em>that because a claim by a beneficiary against a trustee must be brought in equity, the plaintiff has no right to a jury trial and cannot recover tort damages. <em>See Kann, </em>344 Md. at 703, 690 A.2d 509.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
