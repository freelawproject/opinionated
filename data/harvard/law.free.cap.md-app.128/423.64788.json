CEI conducts live harness racing at Rose-croft Raceway. The Maryland Jockey Club of Baltimore City, Inc. (MJC), and the Laurel Racing Association, Inc. (Laurel), owners of Laurel and Pimlico racetracks, opposed CEI\u2019s re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>quest. After a contested hearing, the MRC denied CEI\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">CEI then sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. After considering written memoran-da and oral argument, the hearing judge filed an opinion and order vacating the decision of the MRC and remanded the case to the MRC \u201cfor further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">On appeal, Laurel and the MJC present us with the following questions:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">1. Should CEI\u2019s request to directly import simulcasts of out-of-state thoroughbred racing for betting at its harness track have been denied as a matter of law as unauthorized by the Maryland Horse Racing Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">2. Assuming CEI\u2019s request was not contrary to the Maryland Horse Racing Act, did the Commission nevertheless act within the permissible range of its discretion when it denied CEI\u2019s request?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">We shall answer Laurel and the MJC\u2019s first question in the negative, their second in the affirmative, and reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">CEI is the licensed owner of Rosecroft Raceway, located in Oxon Hill, Maryland. Since 1993, with the MRC\u2019s approval, CEI has imported simulcast signals from out-of-state thoroughbred racetracks pursuant to a Facilities Use Agreement with CEI and other racetracks. After importing these signals, CEI then simulcast thoroughbred races to other Maryland racetracks and off-track betting facilities. When CEI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>withdrew from the Facilities Use Agreement, it filed a petition with the MRC requesting permission to simulcast out-of-state thoroughbred races, pursuant to Md.Code (1992, 1998 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 ll-804(b) of the Business Regulation Article (BR). As we said, Laurel and the MJC opposed this request on the ground that BR \u00a7 ll-804(b) does not authorize cross-breed simulcasting.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">The MRC referred CEI\u2019s question to the Office of the Attorney General, which concluded that \u00a7 ll-804(b)\u2019s plain language permits cross-breed simulcasting, although that may not have been the intent of the General Assembly. As the Attorney General\u2019s Office said in its opinion, under \u201cthe governing principles of statutory construction,\u201d that is, the \u201cplain meaning rule\u201d, the \u201crelevant statutory text ... authorizes interstate cross breed simulcasting, if the Racing Commission approves it.\u201d 82 Opinions of the Attorney General -(1997) (No. 97-022). After a contested hearing, however, the MRC concluded that CEI\u2019s request was not in the best interest of racing, and denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">CEI then sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. In an Opinion and Order dated 17 September 1998, the circuit court concluded that \u201cthe reasons the Commission has advanced for denying Rosecroft its request are unsupported by competent, material and substantive evidence and therefore [the decision was] arbitrary and capricious,\u201d and remanded the case to the MRC \u201cfor further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Laurel and the MJC contend that CEI\u2019s request should have been rejected as a matter of law because, although \u00a7 11-804 is not ambiguous, the statutory scheme makes clear that it was not the intent of the General Assembly to permit cross-breed simulcasting. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">As the Court of Appeals has said, \u201cwhen there is n\u00f3 ambiguity or obscurity in the language of the statute, there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>no need to look elsewhere to ascertain the intent of the legislative body.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523, 636 A.2d 448 (1994). Thus, \u201cwhere statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity and expresses a definite and sensible meaning, courts are not at liberty to disregard the natural import of words with a view towards making the statute express an intention which is different from its plain meaning.\u201d <em>Fikar v. Montgomery County, </em>333 Md. 430, 434-35, 635 A.2d 977 (1994) (citations omitted). Moreover, \u201c[c]are must be taken to avoid construing a statute by forced or subtle interpretations.\u201d <em>Houston v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>109 Md.App. 177, 184, 674 A.2d 87 (1996), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>346 Md. 503, 697 A.2d 851 (1997).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\">The Court of Appeals observed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">If the words used are of doubtful or ambiguous meaning, their signification may be enlarged or restricted as may be necessary to make them conform to the intention of the Legislature, <em>if the intention is clearly and certainly ascertained by the process of construction.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-6\"><em>Pressman v. Barnes, </em>209 Md. 544, 558-59, 121 A.2d 816 (1956) (citations omitted) (emphasis added). With this in mind, we now turn to the matter before us.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">BR \u00a7 11-804. Betting on Oub-of-State races, provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">(b) if the Commission approves, a licensee may contract to hold pari-mutuel betting on a race that is held at an out-of-state track where betting on racing is lawful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">And, BR \u00a7 11-101(h) defines a licensee as \u201ca person who has been awarded racing days for the current calendar year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">Laurel and the MJC maintain that the General Assembly did not intend to allow cross-breed simulcasting, pointing to the statutes keeping the two industries separate. Laurel and the MJC argue that implicit in this statutory scheme is the intent of the General Assembly to protect one industry from the other. Thus, in Laurel and the MJC\u2019s view, \u00a7 ll-804(b) does not authorize cross-breed simulcasting.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">We remind Laurel and the MJC, however, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>A statute shall be construed according to the ordinary and natural import of the language used without resorting to subtle and forced interpretations for the purpose of limiting or extending its operation. That is, we must confine ourselves to the statute as written.... Thus, if there is no ambiguity or obscurity in the language of a statute, there is usually no need look elsewhere to ascertain the intent of the legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><em>Wheeler v. State, </em>281 Md. 598, 596, 380 A.2d 1052 (1977) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In the case at hand, \u00a7 ll-804(b) provides \u201cif the Commission approves, a <em>licensee </em>may contract to hold pari-mutuel betting on a race that is held at an out-of-state track.... \u201d This language is clear and unambiguous. Thus, a resort to its legislative history is not necessary. Section ll-804(b) authorizes cross-breed simulcasting.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Nevertheless, Laurel and the MJC cite <em>Emmet v. Rickert, </em>90 Md.App. 93, 97, 599 A.2d 1236 (1992), arguing that \u201cwhen the literal words of a statute result in a construction clearly not contemplated by the General Assembly, the literal meaning should not be adopted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97, 599 A.2d 1236 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">In <em>Emmet </em>we had to determine whether \u201cThe Motor Vehicle Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d) is statutorily required to suspend the driver\u2019s license ... if properly requested to do so by a judgment creditor ... when the cause of action giving rise to the judgment involves not a motor vehicle accident but ... improper repair of a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Emmet </em>at 94-95, 599 A.2d 1236. In <em>Emmet, </em>however, a reference to the legislative history and statutory context of \u00a7 17-201 provided clear evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent, but here it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Laurel and the MJC appear not to recognize that the only principle to be gleaned from the statutory scheme governing Maryland horse racing is that it was the intent of the General Assembly that some statutes apply only to the thoroughbred industry, see BR Chapter 11, subtitle 5, some only to the harness industry, see BR Chapter 11, subtitle 6, and some to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>both, see BR Chapter 11, subtitle 8. Contrary to Laurel and the MJC\u2019s view, this does not indicate that it was the intent of the General Assembly not to authorize simulcasting of crossbreed races.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Moreover, Laurel and the MJC appear to overlook that the enactment of \u00a7 11 \u2014 804(b) in 1992 to codify Art. 78(B), \u00a7 31, resulted in a dramatic expansion of out-of-state simulcasting. As noted both by the circuit court and the Attorney General, codification of Art. 78(B), \u00a7 31 eliminated reference to \u201cthoroughbred\u201d races and races of \u201cnational and local significance.\u201d Both the Attorney General and the circuit court recognized that such elimination implicitly expanded the scope of out-of-state simulcasting.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Finally, in support of their position, Laurel and the MJC cite <em>Farmers &amp; Merchants National Bank v. Schlossberg, </em>306 Md. 48, 56, 507 A.2d 172, 176 (1986). In <em>Schlossberg, </em>the Court of Appeals said, \u201c[b]ecause the General Assembly is presumed to have intended that all of its enactments operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law, statutes will be interpreted, whenever reasonably possible, to avoid repeal by implication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 507 A.2d 172. This language is of no use to Laurel and the MJC. Were we to consider the statutory scheme as urged, we would presume that the General Assembly was aware of the statutory scheme governing Maryland racing, and consider \u00a7 ll-804(b)\u2019s context. If so, we would presume that the General Assembly was aware of the statutes separately governing Maryland racing, but here, chose not to keep the industries separate. As such, Laurel and the MJC\u2019s contention fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Appellants, MJC, Laurel, and the MRC ask us to consider the propriety of the circuit court having vacated the decision of the MRC and remand of the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">As the Court of Appeals has said previously, \u201c[T]he reviewing court ... must review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to the agency, since decisions of administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>agencies are prima facie correct....\u201d <em>Board of Education v. Paynter, </em>303 Md. 22, 35-36, 491 A.2d 1186 (1985). <em>See also Maryland State Police v. Lindsey, </em>318 Md. 325, 333, 568 A.2d 29 (1990). \u201cA reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency from which the appeal is taken.\u201d <em>Bul-luck v. Pelham Wood Apartments, </em>283 Md. 505, 513, 390 A.2d 1119 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">In reviewing the decision of an administrative agency, we apply the substantial evidence test, see Md.Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 10-222(h) of the State Government Article, and ask whether the agency\u2019s decision is supported by competent, material and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted. The Court of Appeals has defined substantial evidence as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Supervisor of Assessments v. Group Health Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>308 Md. 151, 159, 517 A.2d 1076 (1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Accordingly, we may not substitute our judgment for that of the agency. In other words, the substantial evidence test requires us to exercise \u201crestrained and disciplined judicial judgment so as not to interfere with the agency\u2019s factual conclusions.\u201d <em>State Insurance Comm\u2019r v. Nat\u2019l Bureau, </em>248 Md. 292, 309-10, 236 A.2d 282 (1967). Moreover, we have stated that it is \u201c \u2018the province of the agency to resolve conflicting evidence, [and] where inconsistent inferences from the same evidence can be drawn, it is for the agency to draw the inference.\u2019 \u201d <em>St. Leonard Shores Joint Venture v. Supervisor of Assessments of Calvert County, </em>307 Md. 441, 447, 514 A.2d 1215 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">This standard applies to the MRC as well. As the Court of Appeals has noted, the MRC is an agency vested with virtual plenary authority to regulate Maryland horse racing. <em>See Lussier v. Maryland Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>343 Md. 681, 698, 684 A.2d 804 (1996). This is clear under the MRC\u2019s enabling statute, \u00a7 11-209, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">General powers of Commission.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>(a) Besides its other powers under this title, the Commission has the powers necessary or proper to carry out fully all the purposes of this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\">(b) The jurisdiction, supervision, powers, and duties of the Commission extend to each person who holds racing for a purse, reward, or stake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">With these principles in mind, we now turn to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">A careful examination of the record reveals that there was substantial credible evidence to support the decision of the MRC. The MRC reviewed Maryland horse racing\u2019s economic conditions and specifically noted that each of the industries depend on revenue received from wagers placed on races conducted at Maryland\u2019s racetracks. There was evidence that, between January 1996 and October 1997, a significant number of Maryland wagers were made on out-of-state simulcast races, and concluded that to allow CEI unfettered discretion to simulcast out-of-state thoroughbred races would significantly reduce revenues for the thoroughbred industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Furthermore, the General Assembly has enacted statutes that mandate take-out percentages for both industries. <em>See </em>BR \u00a7\u00a7 11-515, 11-525, 11-615, 11-617. About 50% of the take-out received by thoroughbred racetracks must be allocated to thoroughbred tracks, and 50% to the horsemen and breeders. On the other hand, the take-out of harness racetracks is allocated entirely to harness racing. As the MRC pointed out in denying CEI\u2019s request, \u201cto <em>approve </em>the application of the harness tracks to import out-of-state thoroughbred races and retain the proceeds therefrom (to be allocated among harness\u2019 interests), it would constitute a significant reduction in revenues to the thoroughbred industry in Maryland; and if the Commission were to <em>disapprove </em>the applications, the harness tracks would be denied such revenues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Finally, BR \u00a7 11-519 requires the thoroughbred industry to operate and maintain the Bowie Race Course Training Center. A reduction in revenue would also reduce revenue available to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>maintain the facility to the detriment of the thoroughbred industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">In addition to considering the economic effect of cross-breed simulcasting on Maryland\u2019s thoroughbred industry, the MRC looked to the history of each industry, and concluded that ordinarily the two industries are not in competition with one another. In fact, the General Assembly has enacted statutes to reduce such competition. <em>See, e.g., </em>BR \u00a7 11-504.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Furthermore, in-state cross-breed simulcasting is permitted only on approval by the sending track, its horsemen, and breeders. <em>See </em>BR \u00a7 11-811. Thus, granting CEI\u2019s request would result in unintended competition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Of course, CEI believes its request should have been granted because there was no evidence that doing so would result in economic problems for Maryland\u2019s thoroughbred racing industry. CEI also believes that \u201cimplicitly [demanding] that [CEI] waive its statutory rights or otherwise compensate Laurel/Pimlico for the right to use its own race track, as permitted by law\u201d constitutes impermissible rule making. CEI is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">As we have said previously, there was substantial evidence that CEI\u2019s request would adversely affect Maryland\u2019s thoroughbred racing industry. Further, CEI appears to believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>its request was the only issue to be addressed by the MRC. According to CEI, because there was no evidence in support of Laurel and the MJC\u2019s position, it was entitled to have its request granted. As we have said, the MRC is vested with virtual plenary authority by BR \u00a7 11-209 to regulate horse racing in Maryland. Hence, CEI was not entitled to have its request granted, because the MRC was vested with broad authority either to grant or to deny CEI\u2019s request, consistent with what was considered by the MRC to be in the best interests of the Maryland racing industry. In sum, as the MRC\u2019s decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-11\">. We have adopted the questions presented in Laurel and the MJC\u2019s brief. The MRC raises the following question in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-12\">Did the Maryland Racing Commission properly exercise its discretion in deciding that it would not be in the best interests of the Maryland horse racing industry as a whole to grant the request of a racing association, Licensed by the commission to conduct harness racing, to independently conduct betting on thoroughbred races simulcast from out-of-state?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b456-7\">. BR\u00a7 11-504 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">Restrictions on racing times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">(a) A licensee may not hold racing after 6:15 p.m. unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">(1) circumstances beyond the control of the licensee cause a delay;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-11\">(2) the racing day is of national prominence; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-12\">(3) the racing consists of betting on races held at an out-of-state track, and the racing is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-13\">(i) authorized under \u00a7 11-804 of this title; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-14\">(ii) approved by the harness track licensee whose track is closest to the licensee\u2019s track, the group that represents a majority of the owners and trainers who race horses at that harness track, and the group that represents a majority of the harness breeders in this State....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b456-15\">. Although we rejected Laurel and the MJC\u2019s notion that the statutory scheme requires the industries to be considered separately, this does not preclude the MRC, which has expertise in this field, from considering the impact on competition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
