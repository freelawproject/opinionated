Rudy, Inc. (the \u201cemployer\u201d or \u201cRudy\u201d), appeal the December 1, 1998, order of the Circuit Court for Harford County remanding this case to a DLLR Hearing Examiner \u201cfor the purposes of taking additional evidence and testimony.\u201d The Department and the employer each noted a timely appeal to this Court and present the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-13\">Did the circuit court err in remanding this case for a \u201csupplemental hearing\u201d to allow the appellee to present additional evidence, when the appellee was on notice that his only absolute opportunity to present evidence was before the DLLR Hearing Examiner, and the appellee had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>legitimate justification for his failure to present the evidence in the first hearing?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">We answer \u201cyes\u201d and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Woodie began working as a truck driver for Rudy, a trucking company based in Frederick, Maryland, on July 13, 1997. . On February 5, 1998, without giving his employer any notice, Woodie quit. While en route to a customer\u2019s site, Woodie telephoned the employer\u2019s dispatcher and said that he was abandoning the truck and leaving the keys on one of the wheels of the tractor. He left the truck sitting on the road with the payload still in it and did not report back to work with Rudy after that incident. Woodie applied for insurance benefits on February 11,1998, after leaving his job with Rudy.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">On March 6, 1998, a DLLR Claims Examiner made an initial determination that the claimant voluntarily quit, but with good cause, and awarded benefits accordingly. Rudy appealed that determination, and the Department scheduled an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">At the evidentiary hearing before a DLLR hearing examiner, Woodie, appearing <em>pro se, </em>testified that he was forced to quit because he was being overworked. He alleged that the number of hours that he was required to work violated the federal regulations governing truck drivers. When questioned, however, the appellee was unable to direct the Hearing Examiner to any specific provision that the employer had violated. Rather, the appellee\u2019s only exhibit consisted of driving logs, which he claimed supported his contention that his hours were excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Rudy\u2019s vice-president testified that the company does not allow its truck drivers to work beyond the guidelines prescribed in the Federal Motor Carrier\u2019s Safety Regulations Handbook, codified at 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.3, and that the company closely monitors the drivers\u2019 schedules. To ensure compliance with the regulations, the company hired a safety consultant whose sole task it is to oversee the drivers\u2019 hours. Rudy\u2019s vice-president stated that the employer\u2019s records showed that the appellee\u2019s hours never exceeded 70 within an eight-day period, and added that, on at least one occasion, the appellee did not use his allotted time off, but instead pushed himself to make a delivery much earlier than his schedule required.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">The Hearing Examiner found that \u201c[t]he preponderance of the credible evidence produced at the hearing failed to satisfactorily demonstrate that ... the employer permitted or required the claimant to work an excess of hours,\u201d and that, therefore, the claimant failed to show good cause or valid circumstances for his resignation and reversed the Claims Examiner. The DLLR thus denied unemployment benefits to appellee, on the ground that he voluntarily quit his employment without good cause or valid circumstances. Md.Code, (1991 RepLVol., 1998 Supp.), Lab. &amp; Empl. Art., \u00a7 8-1001. The Board affirmed that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Woodie then retained counsel and filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Harford County. In addition to the memorandum required by Md. Rule 7-207, he also submitted an \u201cApplication of Petitioner for Leave to Offer Additional Evidence.\u201d Woodie purportedly based his motion on Md. Rule 7-208(c) and \u00a7 10-222(f) of the State Government Article (the Administrative Procedure Act). In it, he requested that the circuit court allow him to offer an assortment of evidence that he failed to present at the administrative hearing. The court addressed the appellee\u2019s motion to present additional evidence. Woodie\u2019s motion stated, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">Mr. Woodie would like this Court to see trip information concerning all his destinations, which would show the routes and driving times for each trip----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Mr. Woodie would also like to present record evidence for Rudy\u2019s which would show, for the six month period prior to Mr. Woodie\u2019s quitting, the number of trips made by Rudy\u2019s drivers and the number of different drivers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\">Mr. Woodie also contends that [another] driver, Tom Marley, would support Mr. Woodie\u2019s contention that Rudy was operating with minimal drivers....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The motion stated that \u201c[t]he reasons that this evidence was not offered before the Hearing Examiner are, it is proffered, because Mr. Woodie did not know how to go about doing it.\u201d The motion did not proffer, however, that Woodie had attempted to secure the witness Marley or to gather the documents he sought to present.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The court initially noted that it did not have the authority to hear evidence itself, but then stated that it did have the authority \u201cto remand it to the Board and Hearing Officer to take additional testimony.\u201d Counsel for the appellee supported the court\u2019s position and, during argument on the motion, cited \u00a7 10-222(f) of the State Government Article as the statute that authorizes a remand for additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Appellant contended that the circuit court\u2019s sole function in a judicial review proceeding is to review the record for substantial evidence and that it had no authority to remand for additional evidence. Nevertheless, the court remanded the case for a \u201csupplemental hearing to allow [the Board] to take additional testimony to supplement the issues that are currently before the Board.... \u201d Further, the Administrative Procedure Act, by its own express terms, does not pertain to unemployment insurance (UI) proceedings. The appellants also argued that Woodie was properly notified that the eviden-tiary hearing before the DLLR Hearing Examiner was the parties\u2019 final opportunity to present evidence and that Woodie had no legitimate justification for his failure to present evidence in that forum. Counsel for the employer pointed out that the scheduling notice sent to both parties prior to the evidentiary hearing contained the following statement under the heading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>NOTE TO PARTIES: \u201cThis hearing is the last step at which either the claimant or the employer has the absolute right to present evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">In addition, the reverse side of the notice advised the parties that they \u201cshould arrange for all necessary witnesses to attend the hearing, and for all necessary documents to be presented at the hearing,\u201d and instructed the parties on the procedures for subpoenaing witnesses and documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Nevertheless, the court remanded for a \u201csupplemental hearing.\u201d The court cited \u201cinherent fairness\u201d and the fact that \u201ca layman is always sort of at a disadvantage understanding the procedures and understanding the law\u201d as its reasons for remanding the case. The court added that \u201cit\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a good deal of information that he does have to present and possibly he didn\u2019t know what was going to be said by the Employer because he didn\u2019t understand what he needed, what the legal standard was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">By remanding Woodie\u2019s case to the Department, the circuit court exceeded its authority for review under \u00a7 8-512(d) of the Labor and Employment Article. Furthermore, \u00a7 <em>2(f) </em>Administrative Procedures Act (APA), Md.Code, (1995 Repl.Vol., 1998 Supp.) State Gov. Art., \u00a7 10 \u2014 222(f), on which it also relied, does not apply to UI claim determinations. Finally, the appellee\u2019s obligation to follow procedural guidelines is no less simply because he proceeds <em>pro se. </em>We thus remand this case to the circuit court for review of the DLLR proceedings consistent with its role under \u00a7 8-512(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Section 8-512(d) of the Labor and Employment Article controls the circuit court\u2019s scope of review of appeals from the Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>In a judicial proceeding under this section, findings of fact of the Board of Appeals are conclusive and the jurisdiction of the court is confined to questions of law if-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">(1) findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence that is competent, material, and substantial in view of the entire record; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">(2) there is no fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">This Court repeatedly has stated that \u201cjudicial review of a decision of an administrative agency is narrow.\u201d <em>Blaker v. State Bd. of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>123.Md.App. 243, 254, 717 A.2d 964 (1998) (citing <em>United Parcel Serv. Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 576, 650 A.2d 226 (1994)). The reviewing court simply determines where there exists substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s final decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">With substantial evidence and absent fraud, agency decisions are presumed valid. The reviewing court merely asks whether \u201creasoning minds could reach the same conclusion from the facts relied upon by the Board.\u201d <em>Department of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation v. Hider, </em>349 Md. 71, 78, 706 A.2d 1073 (1998) (citing <em>Baltimore Lutheran High School Ass\u2019n v. Employment Sec. Admin., </em>302 Md. 649, 661-62, 490 A.2d 701, 708 (1985)). Further, the reviewing court may not \u201csubstitute its judgment for the <em>expertise </em>of those persons who constitute the administrative agency from which the appeal is taken.\u201d <em>Board of Education of Montgomery County v. </em>Paynter\u2019303 Md. 22, 35, 491 A.2d 1186, 1193 (1985) (emphasis in original). Instead, the administrative agency\u2019s decision is considered <em>prima facie </em>correct, and an appellate court must view that decision in the light most favorable to the agency. <em>Id. </em>at 35-36, 491 A.2d at 1193.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">In this case, the circuit court ignored these well-settled principles and overstepped its limited jurisdiction. The court correctly noted that \u201cthe unemployment law is silent on the [remand] issue,\u201d but erroneously assumed that silence conveys tacit authority. It does not. Instead, unemployment insurance law is silent on the issue of remands because it simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>does not contemplate them, absent extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Although Maryland Rule 7-209 grants nominal remand authority to circuit courts acting in an appellate capacity,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the case law delineates strict limits for such authority. In <em>Juili-ano v. Lion\u2019s Manor Nursing Home, </em>62 Md.App. 145, 488 A.2d 538 (1985), this Court held that a remand to the administrative agency is appropriate \u201conly after [the court] reviews the record for substantial evidence and finds it lacking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155, 488 A.2d at 544. The Court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">The circuit court ... recognized that it did not have jurisdiction to conduct additional fact finding itself, but its remand order was inappropriate because it had not yet determined whether the evidence supported the agency findings.... Thus, in unemployment compensation cases, the court must review the record \u2014 if it supports the agency findings, no further fact-finding is warranted and the court may proceed to review the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 156-57, 488 A.2d at 544. Furthermore, in <em>Holiday Spas v. Montgomery County Human Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>315 Md. 390, 554 A.2d 1197 (1989), the Court of Appeals stated that \u201c[a] court ordinarily should not ... remand an administrative proceeding before initiating any review whatsoever---- Remanding a case without any review is tantamount to denying review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400, 554 A.2d at 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">In this case, the circuit court did not conduct the required review of the record before deciding to remand for what it termed a \u201csupplemental hearing.\u201d In so doing, the court failed to carry out its primary statutory obligation to review the record for substantial evidence. Circuit courts sitting in judicial review are essentially appellate courts and, as such, must act only to correct errors. Here, the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>court declined to review the record for error before it decided to allow the appellee a second opportunity to present evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Finally, cases construing the predecessor to Rule 7-209 could be read to limit remand <em>prior to </em>review in the circuit court to situations \u201cwhere it is made to appear that the agency itself desires to take additional testimony and to reconsider the case.\u201d <em>Mid-Towne Plymouth, Inc. v. State Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation, </em>228 Md. 66, 70, 178 A.2d 422, 424 (1962). Agencies request such remands to cure factual ambiguities and other defects in the record. In those circumstances,- a remand serves to enhance the circuit court\u2019s eventual review of the case and to protect the interests of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Here, however, the Department has made no such request. Although Judge Carr cited this principle when he granted the appellee\u2019s motion, the state has made no such request here; neither are there cognizable defects in the record. Instead, the only end served by a remand is to allow the appellee a second opportunity to present evidence: evidence he was free to present at his first hearing. Consequently, the court\u2019s ruling in this case is prejudicial to the appellants because it needlessly vacates the Board\u2019s decision and requires the employer to appear before the Department for a second eviden-tiary hearing. Thus, for this reason and those stated above, we reverse its decision on the appellee\u2019s motion and remand this matter so that the circuit court might perform its primary function in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">In remanding this case to the Board, the court relied, at least in part, on \u00a7 2(f) of the Maryland APA, Md.Code, State Gov. Art., \u00a7 10-222(f):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">[The Court]: Preliminarily, there\u2019s a motion to take additional testimony. I\u2019m not sure that the Court has authority to do that, but I do have the authority to remand it to the Board and Hearing Officer to take additional testimony. What\u2019s your position on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>[Appellee\u2019s Counsel]: I believe you certainly do, Your Hon- or, pursuant to, I think it\u2019s, 10-222.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">[The Court]: Of the Administrative Procedures Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">[Appellee\u2019s Counsel]: Right. On 2(f)<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> it says that judicial review of disputed issues of fact shall be confined to the record for judicial review supplemented by additional evidence taken pursuant to this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">While this provision no doubt permits the taking of supplemental evidence in some administrative appeals, the Administrative Procedure Act, by its own express terms, does not apply to UI cases. Section 10-203 of the APA plainly states the statute\u2019s scope:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">(a) General Exclusions. \u2014 This subtitle does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">(5) unemployment insurance claim determinations, tax determinations, and appeals in the Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation, except as specifically provided in Subtitle 5 of Title 8 of the Labor and Employment Article....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">Md.Code Ann., State Gov. Art. \u00a7 10-202(g) (emphasis added); <em>see also Board of Education of Montgomery County v. Payn-ter, </em>303 Md. at 34, 491 A.2d at 1192 (\u201cBoard of Appeals [of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>then-Employment Security Administration] is excluded from the Administrative Procedure Act....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Under the plain meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act, the statute generally does not apply in UI proceedings. <em>See, e.g., McGraw v. Loyola Ford, </em>124 Md.App. 560, 592, 723 A.2d 502 (1999) (holding that the statute itself is the primary source for determining the intent of the legislature, and the Court is to \u201c \u2018give[ ] that language its natural and ordinary meaning\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523, 636 A.2d 448 (1994)). The phrase \u201cexcept as specifically provided\u201d means that the APA applies only in those limited circumstances provided in the UI statute itself. The part of the UI statute dealing with judicial review, Md.Code Ann., Labor &amp; Employ. Art., \u00a7 8-512, however, does not reference the APA, and nothing in the UI statute indicates that it should incorporate the APA\u2019s \u201csupplemental evidence\u201d provisions in \u00a7 222(f). Accordingly, the circuit court erred in relying on the APA as a basis for remanding this case, and we must remand this case for review consistent with the plain language of the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Finally, in his motion to offer additional evidence in the circuit court, Woodie\u2019s counsel claimed that his client did not present evidence to the Hearing Examiner because he \u201cdid not know how to go about doing it.\u201d The court sympathized with appellee\u2019s claim, stating at the hearing that \u201c[e]ven the best layman get [sic] confused and doesn\u2019t understand. There\u2019s the discovery that he doesn\u2019t know about and what\u2019s going to be said.\u201d Indeed, the court\u2019s decision seemed to be based in large part on the notion that because <em>pro se </em>litigants lack training and experience in the rules of procedure, they are entitled to procedural leeway in proving their cases. According to the court, \u201ca layman is always sort of at a disadvantage understanding the procedures and understanding the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The court, however, erred by giving the appellee a \u201csecond bite at the apple\u201d simply because he was not repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>sented by counsel during the administrative hearings. It is a well-established principle of Maryland law that <em>pro se </em>parties must adhere to procedural rules in the same manner as those represented by counsel. Indeed, this Court has stated that \u201c[t]he principle of applying the rules equally to <em>pro se </em>litigants is so accepted that it is almost self-evident.\u201d <em>Tretick v. Layman, </em>95 Md.App. 62, 68, 619 A.2d 201, 204 (1993); <em>see also Pickett v. Noba, Inc., </em>122 Md.App. 566, 568, 714 A.2d 212, 213 (1998) (\u201cWhile we recognize and sympathize with those whose economic means require self-representation, we also need to adhere to procedural rules in order to maintain consistency in the judicial system.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">In this case, the appellee did not follow DLLR\u2019s rules regarding the presentation of evidence at the <em>de novo </em>hearing. When the employer appealed the determination of the Claims Examiner, DLLR\u2019s Appeals Division mailed a scheduling notice to both parties informing them of the date, time, and location of the <em>de novo </em>hearing. Just below that information, on the front page of the scheduling notice, DLLR advised the parties that \u201c[t]his hearing is the last step at which either the claimant or the employer has the absolute right to present evidence. The decision will be made on the evidence presented.\u201d In addition, the notice stated, in bold print, that additional \u201cimportant information\u201d could be found on the reverse side. There, under the heading Witnesses and Subpoenas, the notice read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">Each party should arrange for all necessary witnesses to attend the hearing, and for all necessary documents to be presented at the hearing. If witnesses will not appear or documents will not be produced voluntarily, you may request a subpoena from the Appeals Division.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Finally, the notice advised that \u201c[a] party may be represented by an attorney, or other authorized agent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The appellee thus had clear notice of his obligation to present his case before the DLLR Hearing Examiner.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>rules cited above are simple and clear, and even if the appellee needed clarification, he could have obtained that information in the weeks preceding the hearing. In fact, Woodie had additional time to gather evidence and obtain witnesses after Rudy\u2019s representatives failed to attend the first scheduled evidentiary hearing. Furthermore, the appellee\u2019s contention that he \u201cdid not know how to go about [presenting evidence]\u201d is implausible in light of the fact that he did submit portions of his driving logs. The Hearing Examiner admitted the logs for February 1998 (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit 1), and January 1998 (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit 2), but rejected logs for earlier months as being too remote in time from the termination and, therefore, irrelevant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, regardless of his unsupported statements, the appellee\u2019s conduct shows that he was aware of his obligation to present evidence, and he simply failed to obtain the documents or compel the attendance of the witness raised in his motion to the circuit court. Because nothing in the record indicates that Woodie even tried in good faith to present evidence supporting his own interests, the circuit court erred when it granted him a second chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Because of the high volume of UI cases filed in the Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation, the Department must maintain a streamlined process for the disposition of those cases. The legislature supported this goal by narrowing the focus of judicial review for UI eligibility cases in the circuit courts. Under this regime, the Department requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>that all parties present their evidence in the <em>de novo </em>hearing before the DLLR Hearing Examiner, and sets forth this requirement clearly in the scheduling notice mailed to the parties in advance of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The circuit court in this case did not find that the Department\u2019s requirements were unreasonable or that the Department failed properly to advise the appellee of its requirements. Nevertheless, it sent the case back to DLLR in order to give the appellee a second bite at the UI apple. Thus, the circuit court\u2019s order infringes on the Department\u2019s legislatively granted power to manage its docket in an orderly manner. Accordingly, we cannot ratify the circuit court\u2019s action in this case. We thus vacate the court\u2019s order and remand this case with instructions to review the case in accordance with \u00a7 8-512 of the Labor and Employment Article of the Maryland Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">JUDGMENT VACATED.

The full text of the provision cited by appellee\u2019s counsel at the time reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-12\">(f) Additional evidence before agency. \u2014 (1) Judicial review of disputed issues of fact shall be confined to the record for judicial review supplemented by additional evidence taken pursuant to this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-13\">(2) The court may order the presiding officer to take additional evidence on terms that the court considers proper if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-14\">(i) before the hearing date in court, a party applies for leave to offer additional evidence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-15\">(ii) the court is satisfied that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-16\">1. the evidence is material; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-17\">2. there were good reasons for the failure to offer the evidence in the proceeding before the presiding officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-18\">Md.Code, State Gov. Art., \u00a7 10-222(f). \"Presiding officer\u201d is defined elsewhere in the subtitle as \"the board, commission, agency head, administrative law judge, or other authorized person conducting an administrative proceeding under this subtitle.\u201d Md.Code, State Gov.

The appellee never alleged that he did not receive the scheduling notice, and the record shows that it was mailed to the appellee\u2019s correct address.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b436-6\">. There is no merit to Woodie\u2019s argument that the Hearing Examiner should have considered the earlier months as part of the totality of the circumstances. Hearing examiners have discretion to accept or reject evidence based on the reliability and probative value of the evidence to satisfy procedural due process. <em>See Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services v. Cole, </em>342 Md. 12, 32, 672 A.2d 1115 (1996). In this case, moreover, the Hearing Examiner, applying the same standard, also rejected some evidence proffered by the employer\u2019s representatives. The Hearing Examiner did not admit a document offered by Rudy, which purported to contain an inter-office conversation regarding the appellee, on the grounds that it occurred post-separation and was therefore irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
