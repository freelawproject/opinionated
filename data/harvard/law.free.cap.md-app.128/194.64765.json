Yol., 1998 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-611 through 10-628 of the State Government Article (\u201cS.G.\u201d). We must determine whether the PIA requires the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (\u201cDHMH\u201d or \u201cthe Department\u201d), appellee, to release information to Susan Miller Haigley (\u201cMs.Miller\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant, identifying the Baltimore County eating establishment from which appellant may have contracted hepatitis. The Department refused to disclose the requested information, asserting that the information was \u201cconfidential\u201d under Md.Code (1982, 1994 RepLVol.), \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102 of the Health-General Article (\u201cH.G.\u201d), and therefore not available pursuant to S.G. \u00a7 10-615.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">After the Circuit Court for Baltimore County affirmed the Department\u2019s decision, appellant noted her appeal. She presents a single issue for our review, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">Pursuant to the Maryland Public Information Act, is appellant, who contracted hepatitis from an unknown establishment in Baltimore County, entitled to information regarding the results of the investigation conducted by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">For the reasons that follow, we shall neither affirm nor reverse, but shall remand to the circuit court for further proceedings. See Md. Rule 8-604(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Factual Background<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Appellant was diagnosed on January 28,1998, with hepatitis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>A, which she contracted in December 1997 or January 1998.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She was treated by physicians at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. During the course of her illness, appellant was admitted to the hospital on four occasions. She suffered the symptoms of the disease for ten weeks and, according to appellant, \u201cbecame critical and ... almost died.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Upon identifying appellant\u2019s illness, personnel at Johns Hopkins Hospital notified DHMH and the Baltimore County Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, as required by H.G. \u00a7 18-201.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After DHMH was notified, appellant contends that the Department conducted a \u201ccase investigation\u201d to determine the identity of the establishment; the Department avers that it undertook a \u201cstudy\u201d to discover the reason for an increase in hepatitis A in Baltimore County.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As part of its inquiry, the Department interviewed appellant while she was in the hospital, and collected from her a list of eating establishments that she patronized during the time she may have contracted the disease. Based on information the Department collected from appellant and other hepatitis patients, the Department visited a number of Baltimore County eateries in order to test their food and identify the potential source of appellant\u2019s illness. Neither party has furnished the court with details as to how many establishments were investigated, nor what the investigations entailed. According to appellant\u2019s brief, a Department investigator informed her in the \u201cSpring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>of 1998\u201d that the Department had \u201cdiscovered the identity of the Establishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Appellant asserts that she cooperated with the Department in part because the Department told her that it would reveal the identity of the offending restaurant to her; the Department denies that it made any such assurance. Appellant also asserts, and the Department denies, that DHMH investigators took \u201cstool, blood and other samples\u201d from her.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">On April 14, 1998, Ms. Miller wrote a letter to Carmela Groves, Chief of the DHMH\u2019s Division of Outbreak Investigation, requesting information related to her case. Appellant wrote, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">Dear Ms. Groves:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">I am writing to request records pertaining to the recent increase in Hepatitis A in Baltimore County. I believe I was one of the cases involved in this increase since I was diagnosed with Hepatits A on January 25, 1998 and I live in northern Baltimore County in Timonium and ate at several of the establishments that were in question during the time it was believed that the cases were infected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">I have been speaking with Dave Portesi and he is aware of the severity of my case. I was ill from Hepatitis A for over 10 weeks and am still under the care of a specialist at Johns Hopkins for the illness. I was hospitalized 4 times during the course of my illness. Because of this, I was unable to work and have incurred high medical expenses. I would like the opportunity to recoup these costs through legal action. Please provide me with this information at your earliest convenience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">On May 15, 1998, Ms. Groves informed appellant that although some records regarding the investigation would be available to her for a fee, the Department would not identify the establishment from which she contracted the disease. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Appellant declined to receive the redacted records, and asked Ms. Groves how she could appeal the Department\u2019s decision. On May 21, 1998, Ms. Groves wrote appellant a letter explaining the reasons for DHMH\u2019s decision. Ms. Groves responded, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">I am unable to comply with your request for records, as Maryland\u2019s Public Information Act, State Gov\u2019t \u00a7 10-615 requires that a custodian of a public record that is confidential by law deny inspection of that record. Pursuant to Md.Code Ann., Health-General (Health-General) \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102, any records, reports, or other information assembled for research or study by the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene that names or otherwise identifies any person, is confidential and may not be disclosed to anyone not engaged in the research or study.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">In regard to the recent increase in hepatitis A in Baltimore County, the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Division of Outbreak Investigation conducted research or study under Health-General 4-101 and 4-102. The documents generated or received by the Division of Outbreak Investigation in conducting this research or study identify various persons. Under Health-General \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102, the Division is unable to release to you the identity of those persons. In addition, the files also contain medical information identified to an individual. Furthermore, I am denying you reports pursuant to Health-General \u00a7\u00a7 18-201, 18-202, or 18-205. Pursuant to these statutes, the records are confidential, not open to public inspection, and subject to subpoena or discovery in any criminal or civil proceeding only pursuant to a court order sealing the court record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Ms. Groves\u2019s letter was consistent with a policy the Department had established beginning in 1991 regarding the release of what it considered as confidential information. On March 27, 1991, Diane M. Dwyer, M.D., Chief of the DHMH\u2019s Center for Clinical Epidemiology, asked the Office of the Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>General for \u201can official opinion ... concerning the issue of confidentiality.\u201d Doctor Dwyer\u2019s letter asserted that the Department was \u201creceiving requests for release of information that ask for the \u2018entire file\u2019 rather than simply [the Department\u2019s] \u2018final report.\u2019 \u201d The Department\u2019s questions included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">1. Are investigations of communicable disease outbreaks (e.g. influenza, <em>Salmonella </em>food poisoning, etc.) considered \u201cresearch or study\u201d and therefore covered under Health-General Article, Sections 4-101 and 4-102, Annotated Code of Maryland as a \u201cconfidential record\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">2. If investigations of communicable disease outbreaks are covered under Health-General Article, Sections 4-101 and 4-102, Annotated Code of Maryland, then are the final reports summarizing the investigation and results subject to public inspection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">6. Are the names of businesses and institutions such as hospitals, restaurants, food distributors, farms, and other establishments protected from public inspection under Health-General Article, Section 1-101, 4-101 and 4-102, Annotated Code of Maryland?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The Office of the Attorney General responded to the Department\u2019s inquiry in a letter dated April 30,1991, co-authored by Jack Schwartz, Chief Counsel for Opinions and Advice, and Helen E. Bowlus, Staff Attorney and counsel for the Department in the case <em>sub judice. </em>They answered the questions set forth above in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">1. Information developed as part of a study of an outbreak of communicable disease is a \u201cconfidential record\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4-101 of the Health-General Article (\u201cHG\u201d Article)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Accordingly, the information is subject to the confidentiality strictures of HG \u00a7 4-102, to be discussed in more detail in response to other of your questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">2. A document summarizing the results of an investigation of a communicable disease outbreak may be made public, subject to the restrictions in HG \u00a7 4 \u2014 102(b). That is, the summary report may provide as full an account of the incident as you deem desirable, so long as the report does not \u201cdisclos[e] the identity of any person who is the subject of the confidential record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\"><em>Because the terms \u201cperson\u201d includes business entities, HG \u00a7 l-101(g), the version of the report that would be publicly available should not identify, for example, the establishment that was the source of contaminated food. </em>Of course, a version of the report containing full details, including identification of all persons involved, may be prepared for internal use and for the limited distribution permitted under HG \u00a7 4-102(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\"><em>Thus, in answer to an individual who requests a file or report of a specific outbreak </em>\u2014 that <em>is, one linked to an identified person </em>\u2014 your <em>response would be that pursuant to HG 4-101 and 4-102, the Department must keep confidential any such records if they exist. </em>The limitation applies to requests from the media for interviews or information about a disease outbreak.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">In answer to a request for information on all outbreaks of a certain disease, your response would be that pursuant to HG \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102, the Department may release only summary reports that do not identify any person. In this situation you would release one or more reports, each addressing an outbreak of disease associated with a restaurant not identified in the summary. A request from the media for an interview or information about all outbreaks could be addressed in this same manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">We note, however, that the Secretary is charged by HG \u00a7 18-103 with the duties of obtaining accurate and complete reports on communicable diseases in Maryland, determining the prevalence of each communicable disease, and \u201c[d]e-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>vis[ing] means to control communicable diseases.\u201d In order to safeguard the public health, the Secretary may determine that it is necessary to release information to the public that identifies a person. This release of information may be accomplished, for example, through press releases or media interviews and may alert the public to health-threatening products or conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\">Such disclosure is authorized by law, and, in appropriate circumstances, would supersede the general bar to the disclosure of the identity of persons in HG \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and <em>4r-</em>102.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">6. As discussed in response to your second question, <em>the names of business entities or similar establishments are protected from public inspection </em>pursuant to HG \u00a7\u00a7 1\u2014 101(g), 4-101 and 4-102.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">We hope that this letter of advice, although not an opinion of the Attorney General, is fully responsive to your inquiry. Please let us know if we may be of further assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjP\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">On April 20, 1993, the Department\u2019s Epidemiology and Disease Control Program published and disseminated its \u201cGuidelines for Release of Confidential Communicable Disease Information\u201d (\u201cthe Guidelines\u201d). That document, which \u201coutline[d] how to process requests for confidential communicable disease information,\u201d echoed the interpretation articulated in the Attorney General\u2019s letter of advice. It stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArN\">ROUTINE AND OUTBREAK-RELATED INSPECTIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">While <em>routine </em>facility inspections are releasable, the inspection reports generated either in response to a complaint resulting in an outbreak investigation or as a part of the outbreak investigation itself are part of the outbreak file and are therefore confidential.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">The Guidelines also included a diagram illustrating the Department\u2019s procedure for \u201cProcessing Requests for Confidential Communicable Disease Information\u201d, which we have at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>tached as an Appendix. By all accounts, the Department handled appellant\u2019s request according to the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">On June 19, 1998, appellant filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, pursuant to S.G. \u00a7 10-623.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On September 10, 1998, after the parties submitted memoranda of law in support of their respective positions, the court conducted a hearing. Acknowledging that the issue was one of first impression, the court held the matter <em>sub curia. </em>On September 25, 1998, the court filed a written Memorandum and Order, stating, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">The legislative history and plain meaning of [S.G. \u00a7 10-615 and H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4-101, 4-102] make clear that, under the circumstances of this case, the identity of the person or persons involved in the investigation cannot be disclosed to the Plaintiff and that the legislative history as argued by the Plaintiff does not change this plain meaning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">Perhaps the most important reasons for not divulging such information concern public policy. In carrying out its duties of determining the cause of disease, controlling disease, and otherwise protecting the public health pursuant to Health-General \u00a7\u00a7 18-101 through \u00a7 18-103, DHMH gathers extensive information from many different sources, and medically, scientifically, and statistically analyzes this information to arrive at facts and conclusions about a disease outbreak. These facts and conclusions enable the health department to take measures to protect the public health and to recommend to those associated with the outbreak how illness can be prevented in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">Maintaining confidentiality will allow the health department to gain and keep the cooperation of individuals and entities implicated in the outbreak so that information and bodily specimens and food samples for testing may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>forthcoming. The information gathered and the resulting tests are crucial in carrying out a disease outbreak investigation for the protection of the public. Furthermore, DHMH has determined that devising means to control communicable diseases, as required by Health-General \u00a7 18-103, is an overriding health concern, and, to that end, provides outbreak information to any entity implicated in the outbreak to educate them about safe food handling practices in order to prevent subsequent outbreaks and to any federal agency that requires outbreak information for statistical or other public health purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">In deciding whether or not to divulge confidential information, DHMH had determined, pursuant to Health-General \u00a7\u00a7 4-102, 18-101, 18-103, and 18-208, that those \u201cengaged in the research\u201d do not include an individual who may have been ill or provided a bodily specimen for testing. The Plaintiff argues that, the samples that she provided to DHMH were crucial in their investigation and discovery of the offending entity and that without the information from DHMH she will be severely hampered in her attempts to recover for her losses. However, it must be remembered that it is not the duty of the health department in carrying out a disease investigation to act as an investigative arm for those seeking evidence, even for the purpose of litigation---- Rather, it is the duty of DHMH to protect the public welfare by ensuring that the offending \u201cperson\u201d is stopped from engaging in the particular practice that is or has the potential to cause harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">A thorough examination of all the pertinent statutes and terms lead[s] to the logical conclusion that the information sought by Ms. Haigley is in fact confidential, is not open to public inspection, and is subject to subpoena only pursuant to a court order sealing the court record. Therefore, the records can be used under court supervision only in enforcement procedures but are not available to Ms. Haigley for purposes of pursuing litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Thereafter, appellant timely noted this appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In 1970, the Maryland General Assembly enacted the PIA in order to \u201cprovide the public the right to inspect the records of the State government or of a political subdivision\u201d within the State. <em>Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney for Harford, County, </em>299 Md. 493, 506, 474 A.2d 880 (1984); <em>see </em>1970 Md. Laws, Chap. 698; <em>AS. Abell Publ\u2019g Co. v. Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. 26, 32, 464 A.2d 1068 (1983). State Government \u00a7 10-612 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">General Right to Information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">(a) <em>General right to information. </em>All persons are entitled to have access to information about the affairs of government and the official acts of public officials and employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">(b) <em>General Construction. </em>To carry out the right set forth in subsection (a) of this section, unless an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of a person in interest would result, this Part III of this subtitle shall be construed in favor of permitting inspection of a public record, with the least cost and least delay to the person or governmental unit that requests the inspection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">A \u201cperson in interest\u201d is defined in S.G. \u00a7 10-611(e)(l) as \u201ca person or governmental unit <em>that is the subject of a public record </em>or a designee of the person or governmental unit.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">In <em>Kirwan v. The Diamondback, </em>352 Md. 74, 721 A.2d 196 (1998), the Court of Appeals reiterated that \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]he provisions of the Public Information Act reflect the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>intent that citizens of the State of Maryland be accorded wide-ranging access to public information concerning the operation of their government.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81, 721 A.2d 196 (quoting <em>Fioretti v. Maryland State Board of Dental Examiners, </em>351 Md. 66, 73, 716 A.2d 258 (1998)(further citations omitted)). Moreover, the provisions of the statute must be \u201c \u2018liberally construed ... in order to effectuate the Public Information Act\u2019s broad remedial purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 81, 721 A.2d 196 (quoting <em>Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. at 32, 464 A.2d 1068); <em>see Faulk, </em>299 Md. at 506-507, 474 A.2d 880 (stating that \u201cthe basic policy\u201d of the PIA is \u201cin favor of disclosure\u201d); <em>see also Fioretti, </em>351 Md. at 76, 716 A.2d 258; <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v.

Nevertheless, because the PIA \u201cestablishes a public policy and a general presumption in favor of disclosure of government or public documents,\u201d <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 80, 721 A.2d 196, the exemptions are interpreted narrowly. <em>Fioretti, </em>351 Md. at 77, 716 A.2d 258. When a public official denies a request for records under the PIA, he or she bears the burden of showing, upon judicial review, \u201cthat the requested records are within the scope of a statutory exemption.\u201d <em>Faulk, </em>299 Md. 493, 507, 474 A.2d 880 (1984); <em>accord, Fioretti, </em>351 Md. at 78, 716 A.2d 258. We turn to review the exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">First, S.G. \u00a7 10-616 requires a custodian to deny inspection of specific types of public records, including records related to adoption, retirement, and public personnel. Second, S.G. \u00a7 10-617 requires custodians to deny inspection of records that contain medical, psychological, or sociological information about a person, or that contain confidential commercial information, including trade secrets. Third, S.G. \u00a7 10-618 permits a custodian to deny inspection of particular types of public records if the custodian \u201cbelieves that inspection ... would be contrary to the public interest.\u201d S.G. \u00a7 10-618(a). The fourth exception, which is relied upon by the Department here, is found in S.G. \u00a7 10-615.

Therefore, we adopted \u201cthe standard of review applied by federal courts of appeals involving claims under the FOIA, which is (1) whether the trial court had an adequate factual basis for the decision rendered and (2) whether upon this basis the decision reached was clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In contrast, \u201cPure legal errors ... are reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The Department claims that inspection of the documents requested by appellant is prohibited by S.G. \u00a7 10-615, because they are- \u201cconfidential,\u201d pursuant to H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4-101, and not subject to disclosure under H.G. \u00a7 4-102. Health-General \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102 are found in Subtitle 1 of Title 4 of the Health-General Article.

Nor have we uncovered a Maryland case defining the terms \u201cresearch\u201d or \u201cstudy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">The DHMH contends that the information sought by appellant was \u201cobtained for research for study\u201d because, in the course of carrying out its duty to protect the public health, the Department \u201cgathers extensive information from many different sources and analyzes this information medically, scientifically, and statistically to arrive at facts and conclusions about a disease outbreak.\u201d In particular, the Department contends that the information it possesses about the source of appellant\u2019s exposure to hepatitis A was gathered as part of \u201cresearch\u201d and \u201cstudy\u201d focusing on the increase in hepatitis in Baltimore County, and not in connection with an investigation of appellant\u2019s particular illness. Indeed, it notes that appellant was one of several people whose illness was investigated by the Department. Moreover, appellee contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>information was collected in connection with \u201cresearch\u201d and \u201cstudy\u201d because the results of its investigation are used not only to confront health violations at the particular facility that may have transmitted the disease to appellant, but also to \u201cidentify and devise means to address new problems in food preparation, new disease agents and their sources, and new vehicles that transmit diseases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The Department insists that, to the extent its investigations contain identifying information, such as the eating establishment from which appellant may have contracted her illness, these records must be kept confidential. Appellee states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak4\">Maintaining ... confidentiality allows the health department to gain and keep the cooperation of individuals and entities implicated in the outbreak so that information, including bodily specimens and food samples for testing, is forthcoming. The information and test results obtained are crucial for DHMH to carry out not only the investigation of a specific disease outbreak but also to learn the information necessary to help prevent future outbreaks and thus protect the public health.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In effect, the Department\u2019s policy is to treat as confidential under H.G. \u00a7 4-102 any information \u201cabout outbreak investigations or other communicable disease investigations.\u201d This is because the Department construes the terms \u201cresearch\u201d and \u201cstudy\u201d to cover almost any investigative step taken in response to a report of food-borne illness. The Department\u2019s Guidelines, for instance, instruct DHMH staff to ask the following question in determining how to respond to a PIA request: \u201cIs the requested information <em>about outbreak investigations or other communicable disease investigations (i.e., considered \u2018study\u2019) ? \u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Appellee argues that we should defer to the Department\u2019s construction of the terms \u201cresearch\u201d and \u201cstudy.\u201d <em>See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694, <em>reh\u2019g. den. </em>468 U.S. 1227, 105 S.Ct. 28, 82 L.Ed.2d 921 (1984). Citing <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary </em>(2d ed.1986), the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>ment avers that \u201cresearch\u201d means \u201ccareful, systematic, patient study and investigation in some field of knowledge, undertaken to discover or establish facts or principles.\u201d The word \u201cstudy\u201d is defined in that dictionary as \u201ccareful attention to, and critical examination and investigation of, any subject [or] event.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Appellant counters with numerous arguments to support her position that H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102 do not preclude the Department from disclosing to her the information generated or gathered by DHMH. In appellant\u2019s view, the Department\u2019s objective in its investigation was to correct health code violations that constitute a threat to public safety, not to conduct a \u201cresearch project\u201d on hepatitis A in Baltimore County. Claiming that the Department would not have begun an investigation had her doctor not reported her illness, appellant argues that the investigation conducted by the Department was authorized and controlled by Title 18 of the Health-General Article, entitled \u201cDisease Prevention,\u201d and Subtitle 3 of Title 20, entitled \u201cNuisance Control.\u201d Moreover, despite the broad language contained in appellant\u2019s initial letter to the Department, Ms. Miller contends that the limited information she requested related only to the identity of the establishment from which she may have contracted hepatitis.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, appellant argues that disclosure would not jeopardize the privacy rights of a \u201cperson in interest\u201d as defined in S.G. \u00a7 10 \u2014 611(e)(1). Appellant also asserts that the trial court\u2019s \u201cconcern for public policy\u201d was \u201cmisplaced\u201d, because the Department wields enormous power over its regulatees, so that disclosure would have a negligible effect on the Department\u2019s ability to enforce health code laws and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">As we see it, the Department\u2019s view is at odds with the purpose of the PIA and H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102. Clearly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>the Department\u2019s exegesis of H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102 has controlled its application of the provisions of the PIA. The deference we would ordinarily accord to the agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations is tempered by our obligation to safeguard the objectives of the PIA, which instructs us to construe its provisions \u201cin favor of permitting inspection of a public record.\u201d S.G. \u00a7 10-612(b). Considering that the Department bears the burden of establishing an exception to the liberal disclosure provisions of the PIA, see <em>Faulk, </em>299 Md. at 507, 474 A.2d 880; <em>Fioretti, </em>351 Md. at 78, 716 A.2d 258, we believe the agency\u2019s position with respect to appellant\u2019s request conflicts with the Legislature\u2019s intent to make confidential only those documents actually related to \u201cresearch\u201d and \u201cstudy.\u201d We explain further.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">In resolving the parties\u2019 dispute, we must apply the well-honed principles of statutory construction. These principles undergird our resolution of the thorny issue presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u201c \u2018The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Degren v.

As the Court recently said in <em>Martin v. Beverage Capital Corp., </em>353 Md. 388, 399, 726 A.2d 728 (1999), \u201c[i]n determining legislative intent, we must never lose sight of the overriding purpose and goal of the statute.\u201d This is because \u201cthe search for legislative intent is most accurately characterized \u2018as an effort to \u201cseek to discern some general purpose, aim, or policy reflected in the statute.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kaczorowski v.

In doing so, \u201cthe Court considers the language of an enactment and gives that language its natural and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523, 636 A.2d 448 (1994); <em>see Lewis v. State, </em>348 Md. 648, 653, 705 A.2d 1128 (1998); <em>Chesapeake and Potomac Tel. Co. v.

State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106 (1994); <em>see also State v. Thompson, </em>332 Md. 1, 7-8, 629 A.2d 731 (1993) (courts must reach a statutory interpretation compatible with common sense). As the Court said in <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 146, 626 A.2d 946 (1993) (internal citations omitted), \u201cGiving the words their ordinary and common meaning \u2018in light of the full context in which they appear, and in light of external manifestations of intent or general purpose available through other evidence,\u2019 normally will result in the discovery of the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">At oral argument, the Department\u2019s counsel contended that \u201call disease outbreak investigations\u201d constitute \u201cresearch and study\u201d from their inception. When pressed to define how \u201cdisease outbreak investigations\u201d differed from other sorts of investigations, appellee\u2019s attorney stated that the operative distinction was whether there was an \u201cactual\u201d outbreak, as opposed to a single report of illness. Counsel also suggested that for some diseases a single reported case is sufficient to constitute an \u201coutbreak\u201d. We are not privy to a list of diseases for which a single occurrence is deemed an \u201coutbreak.\u201d Based on the broad language in the Department\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Guidelines, however, it is clear that, from a practical point of view, very few investigations of reported communicable diseases fall outside of what the Department calls a \u201cresearch\u201d or \u201cstudy\u201d project.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">To be sure, \u201c[t]he consistent construction by [an] agency responsible for administering a statute is entitled to considerable weight.\u201d <em>National Asphalt Pavement Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>292 Md. 75, 80, 437 A.2d 651 (1981). That deference is premised on the notion that the agency has particular expertise in the area governed by the statute. <em>Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Administration, </em>346 Md. 437, 445, 697 A.2d 455 (1997). In this case, however, it is salient that the Department does not necessarily have any expertise with respect to the PIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Moreover, the weight accorded to an agency\u2019s interpretation of H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102 depends in part on the process by which the agency arrived at its conclusion. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the Department\u2019s interpretation of H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102 is the product of in-house deliberation between members of a committee formed by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Program, with input from the Attorney General\u2019s Office. The Department\u2019s Guidelines were completed in 1993, some twenty-three years after the enactment of the PIA. What the Court said in <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Public Service Comm\u2019n of Maryland, </em>305 Md. 145, 501 A.2d 1307 (1986), is pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">The weight to be accorded an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute depends upon a number of considerations. Although never binding upon the courts, the contemporaneous interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with its administration is entitled to great deference, especially when the interpretation has been applied consistently and for a long period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">Another important consideration is the extent to which the agency engaged in a process of reasoned elaboration in formulating its interpretation, of the statute. When an agency clearly demonstrates that it has focused its attention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>on the statutory provisions in question, thoroughly addressed the relevant issues, and reached its interpretation through a sound reasoning process, the agency\u2019s interpretation will be accorded the persuasiveness due a well-considered opinion of an expert body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\">In addition, the nature of the process through which the agency arrived at its interpretation is a relevant consideration in assessing the weight to be accorded the agency\u2019s interpretation. <em>If the interpretation is the product of neither contested adversarial proceedings nor formal rule promulgation, it is entitled to little weight.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 161-62, 501 A.2d 1307 (internal citations omitted)(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">We are also mindful that an opinion of the Attorney General is \u201centitled to consideration in determining legislative intent\u201d concerning a statute. <em>Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. at 40, 464 A.2d 1068. But, as the Court in <em>Mezzanote </em>made clear, the Attorney General\u2019s view \u201cis not binding upon the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This is especially true when, as here, the Attorney General\u2019s letter of advice was co-authored by an attorney who was also appointed to the Department committee promulgating its Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Appellee argues that three bills regarding the confidentiality of medical records that were considered but not passed by the Legislature in 1994, 1995, and 1996, \u201cgave the legislature the opportunity to alter DHMH\u2019s position and to inform DHMH that its interpretation was incorrect.\u201d Although none of the bills was enacted, appellee argues that the Legislature\u2019s rejection of those measures demonstrated its acquiescence to the DHMH position regarding H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102, and created a \u201cpresumption that the DHMH interpretation is correct.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">House Bill 1647, introduced on February 28, 1994, would have amended the PIA at S.G. \u00a7 10-618 to require disclosure of \u201creports, statements, notes, or other information concerning an investigation of a food poisoning outbreak.\u201d In 1995, the General Assembly rejected H.B. 901, which would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>amended S.G. \u00a7 10-617 to make \u201ccommunicable disease information regarding communicable disease outbreaks, individual diseases or conditions, or animal diseases or conditions of importance to the public health\u201d <em>not </em>subject to disclosure under the PIA. Then, in 1996, S.B. 106 was introduced \u201cto allow for the release of certain information regarding food-borne outbreaks.\u201d The bill proposed to amend H.G. \u00a7 4-101 by adding the following section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\">(B) \u201cCONFIDENTIAL RECORD\u201d DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY RECORD, REPORT, STATEMENT, NOTE OR OTHER INFORMATION THAT IS NOT A MEDICAL RECORD AS DEFINED IN \u00a7 4-301 OF THIS ARTICLE PERTAINING TO A COMPLETED INVESTIGATION OF A FOODBORNE OUTBREAK THAT DOES NOT NAME OR OTHERWISE IDENTIFY AN INDIVIDUAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">As the Court said in <em>Sacchet v. Blan, </em>353 Md. 87, 95, 724 A.2d 667 (1999), reliance upon \u201cwhat the Legislature could have done or upon what it has not done ... is almost always ... subject to arguably equally plausible interpretations\u201d, especially when the interpreting court focuses on a \u201csingle, contested phrase as if in a vacuum.\u201d The Legislature\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to enact H.B. 1647 in 1994 could just as readily have meant that the Legislature believed food poisoning investigation files were already subject to the PIA. We need not entertain that conjecture. In our view, the Legislature\u2019s inaction signifies only that the Legislature could not reach a consensus as to the wisdom of the proposed bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In our effort to ascertain the scope of H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102, we next consider that statute\u2019s history. Our effort has yielded little help in resolving the pending dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The provisions now found at H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102 were originally enacted in 1963, by 1963 Md. Laws, Chap. 826. That law, offered to the General Assembly as H.B. 61, added \u00a7 1-1 to then Md.Code (1957, 1962 Repl.Vol.), Art. 43, and provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>(a) All records, reports, statements, notes and other information <em>which have been assembled or procured by the State Board of Health and Mental Hygiene for purposes of research and study </em>and which name or otherwise identify any person or persons are confidential records within the custody and control of the Board and its authorized agents and employees, and may be used only for the purposes of research and study for which assembled or procured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-4\">(b) It is unlawful for any person to give away or otherwise to disclose to a person or persons not engaged in such research and study for the Board, any of such records, reports, statements, notes or other information which name or otherwise identify any person or persons.

A comparison of the language of the 1963 law and the 1982 re-enactment illustrates that most of the changes were, indeed, stylistic.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Nevertheless, appellant contends that use of the word \u201cproject\u201d in the 1982 draft narrows the meaning of \u201cresearch and study\u201d. Appellant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">[T]he word \u201cproject\u201d was added during the Recodification to more narrowly define \u201cresearch\u201d and \u201cstudy.\u201d It is clear that the General Assembly, in 1982, when they had a chance to do so, could have selected \u201ccase investigation\u201d if it was their intent to exclude such information from a \u2018person in interest.\u2019 However, the word \u201cproject,\u201d where no substantive changes were made to former Article 43, Section 1 \u2014 I, underscores that \u00a7 4-101 refers to \u201cacademic research projects\u201d and not to case investigations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Appellant also finds significant that the General Assembly shortened the phrase \u201cfor the purpose of research and study\u201d to \u201cfor research and study.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">In our view, these mild semantic differences shed no light on the Legislature\u2019s intent or the statute\u2019s meaning. \u201cProject\u201d is defined in the American Heritage Dictionary (3d ed.1994) as \u201c[a] plan or proposal; scheme ... An undertaking requiring concerted effort.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 661. But, an \u201cundertaking\u201d need not be \u201cacademic\u201d in order to constitute a \u201cproject.\u201d Moreover, the Legislature\u2019s substitution of the phrase \u201cfor research and study\u201d underscores, at most, that when the Legislature originally enacted the confidentiality provision, the reason for which information was gathered was crucial in determining whether it was confidential. That observation only begs the question: What is \u201cresearch\u201d or \u201cstudy\u201d? Specifically, does \u201cresearch\u201d or \u201cstudy\u201d encompass what the Department does in response to a report of a particular instance of communicable disease?</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In the absence of bill files, committee reports, or persuasive linguistic guidance, we return to the principles of statutory construction. We are left to render a common sense interpretation of the terms \u201cresearch\u201d and \u201cstudy,\u201d in light of the \u201coverriding purpose and goal of the statute,\u201d <em>Martin, supra, </em>353 Md. at 399, 726 A.2d 728, and consistent with the principles of statutory construction. In our view, the place<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>ment of H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102 in Title 4, as opposed to Titles 18 and 20 of the Health-General article, indicates that H.G. \u00a7 4-102 was not meant to apply to \u201ccase investigations\u201d authorized and conducted pursuant to titles 18 and 20 of that article.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The Department functions in an advisory capacity, evaluating threats to public health, and as an investigative arm of State government, enforcing health and safety provisions in order to stem the increase of communicable disease. When the General Assembly created the State Board of Health in 1874, it described its duties in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\"><em>And be it enacted, </em>That the State Board of Health shall take cognizance of the interests of health and life among the people generally; <em>they shall make sanitary investigations and inquiries respecting the causes of diseases, </em>especially of epidemics, the sources of mortality and the effects of localities, employments, conditions, and circumstances on the public health, and they shall gather such information in respect to these matters as they may deem proper; they shall devise some scheme whereby medical and vital statistics of sanitary value may be obtained, <em>and act as an advisory board to the State in all hygienic and medical matters.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">1874 Md. Laws, Chap. 200 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene was formed in 1969, by 1969 Md. Laws, Chap. 77. Titles 18 and 20 of the Health-General article empower the Department to investigate specific incidents that may threaten public health, and to enforce health regulations promulgated by the Department. Health-General \u00a7 18-101 charges the Department with the responsibility to conduct \u201cinvestigations into causes of disease and mortality.\u201d Health-General \u00a7 18-102(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\"><em>Rules and regulations. </em>\u2014 The Secretary shall adopt rules and regulations necessary to prevent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">(1) The introduction of an infectious or contagious disease into this State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>(2) The spread of an infectious or contagious disease in this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">In order to carry out its mandate, the Department is given broad power to \u201center on and inspect private property to determine the presence, cause, and source of an infectious or contagious disease.\u201d H.G. \u00a7 18-102(b). In addition, local health officers are required to take immediate action when they become aware of a potential public health threat. Health-General \u00a7 18-208 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">General duties.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">(a) <em>Dangerous diseases. </em>\u2014 (1) When a health officer has reason to believe that a disease that endangers public health exists within the county, the health officer shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">(i) Report immediately to the appropriate county board of health; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">(ii) With the approval of the board:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">1. investigate the suspected disease; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">2. Act properly to prevent the spread of the disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">(b) When a health officer is notified of an infectious or contagious disease within the county, the health officer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-13\">(1) Shall act immediately to prevent the spread of the disease;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-14\">(2) Within 24 hours after receiving notice of the disease, shall give the Secretary all information obtained on the disease; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-15\">(3) Shall cooperate with the Secretary to prevent the spread of the disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-16\">(c) (1) When a health officer knows of any unusual disease or mortality in the county or a contiguous county, the health officer promptly shall give the Secretary notice of the disease or mortality. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>(2) if a health officer is unsure whether a disease is infectious or contagious, the health officer shall notify the Secretary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Likewise, H.G. \u00a7 20-301 <em>et seq. </em>charges the Department with the duty to prevent health nuisances. Health-General \u00a7 20-301 provides that the Secretary of DHMH \u201cis responsible for the general care of the sanitary interests of the people of the State.\u201d Like Title 18, Title 20 gives the Department the right to inspect private property \u201cto determine whether a nuisance exists.\u201d H.G. \u00a7 20-304. Moreover, the Department \u201cmay bring an action to enjoin any person from committing any nuisance subject to the article,\u201d H.G. \u00a7 20-305, and to \u201csummarily abate ... any condition that is in a state of nuisance under this subsection.\u201d H.G. \u00a7 20-308.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Significantly, titles 18 and 20 do not contain a blanket provision making confidential <em>all </em>information gathered in the process of carrying out the Department\u2019s authority under those articles. Rather, title 18 declares, in piecemeal fashion, that particular types of information are confidential. For example, H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 18-201, 18-202, and 18-205 provide that reports of infectious or contagious diseases made by physicians, institutions, and medical laboratories are \u201cconfidential\u201d and \u201cnot open to public inspection.\u201d Similarly, H.G. \u00a7 18-207 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">Human immunodeficiency virus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">The director of a medical laboratory in which serum samples are tested for human immunodeficiency virus may not disclose, directly or indirectly, the identity of any individual tested for human immunodeficiency virus in any report submitted to the Department or the health officer for the county where the laboratory is located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Each of these provisions makes confidential what would already be covered under H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102, if we were to adopt the Department\u2019s definition of \u201cresearch\u201d and \u201cstudy\u201d in Title 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">On the scant record before us, we consider it likely that when the Department interviewed appellant in the hospital, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>obtained a list of potential sources of contamination, and inspected various restaurants in Baltimore County, the Department \u201cassembled\u201d and \u201cprocured\u201d that information \u201cfor the purpose of\u2019 identifying the offending establishment and enforcing health code regulations designed to prevent further outbreaks, pursuant to titles 18 and 20. This is true even if the Department also incorporated the data in a \u201cstudy\u201d of the rise of hepatitis A in Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The recent case of <em>Kirwan v. The Diamondback, supra, </em>352 Md. 74, 721 A.2d 196, illustrates that the PIA\u2019s preference for disclosure mitigates against any interpretation that would expand the scope of an enumerated exception to the Act. There, the <em>Diamondback, </em>a campus newspaper of the University of Maryland, College Park (the \u201cUniversity\u201d), requested documents from the University related to the paper\u2019s investigation of reports that members of the men\u2019s basketball team \u201cwere parking illegally on campus ... and were receiving preferential treatment from the University with respect to the ... fines imposed,\u201d and that a student-athlete had accepted money from a former coach to pay his fines. <em>Id. </em>at 79, 721 A.2d 196. Specifically, the paper sought: 1) correspondence between the University and the NCAA involving the student-athlete who was suspended for accepting payment of his fines; 2) records related to on-campus parking violations committed by other members of the team; and 3) records of parking violations committed by the team\u2019s head coach. <em>Id. </em>The University denied disclosure, claiming that the coach\u2019s parking tickets were exempt as \u201cpersonnel records\u201d pursuant to S.G. \u00a7 10-616(a)(i). In rejecting the University's argument, Judge Eldridge, writing for the Court, relied on a common sense interpretation of \u201cpersonnel records\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">As previously discussed, the policy of the Public Information Act is to allow access to public records. Generally, the statute should be interpreted to favor disclosure. In light of this policy, we do not believe that the General Assembly intended that any record identifying an employee would be exempt from disclosure as a personnel record. Instead, the General Assembly likely intended that the term \u201cpersonnel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>records\u201d retain its common sense meaning. This is indicated by the list following the prohibition on the release of the personnel records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 84, 721 A.2d 196. (Emphasis added). The Court also rejected the University\u2019s argument that, under S.G. \u00a7 10-618, it was permitted to deny <em>The Diamondback\u2019s </em>request because disclosure would have a \u201c \u2018chilling effect on the University\u2019s obligation to self-report any NCAA violations\u2019 and \u2018would discourage students from coming forward to admit to or advise the University about potential NCAA rules violations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87-88, 721 A.2d 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">As in <em>Kirwan, </em>we believe that the \u201ccommon sense meaning\u201d, of the words \u201cresearch\u201d and \u201cstudy\u201d in H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102 connote the sort of academic inquiry the Department engages in when it reports on the causes and effects of disease in the State. Moreover, although the Department does not rely on the \u201cpublic interest\u201d provision of S.G. \u00a7 10-618, its fear of a \u201cchilling effect\u201d provides no more basis for a denial of appellant\u2019s request than was present in <em>Kirwan. </em>Therefore, we are not persuaded that the confidentiality provisions of Title 4 encompass, <em>in toto, </em>these essentially investigatory functions of the DHMH as they relate to reports of food-borne illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">We also agree with appellant that the Department\u2019s desire to maintain the confidentiality of records that identify persons who are the subject of case investigations, in order to foster cooperation from persons who may be spreading infectious disease, is not a sufficient ground upon which to avoid disclosure under the PIA. The trial court relied almost exclusively on this \u201cconcern for public policy\u201d in construing the statute, stating that \u201cconfidentiality will allow the health department to gain and keep the cooperation of individuals and entities implicated in the outbreak so that information and bodily specimens and food samples for testing may be forthcoming.\u201d If we were to adopt the Department\u2019s interpretation, almost all of the Department\u2019s investigative functions would be shielded from disclosure. The Department is with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>out authority to circumvent the PIA\u2019s disclosure provisions in the name of administrative efficiency, nor may it become a fortress of secrecy immune from the PIA by virtue of its mission to investigate dangers to our collective health. Moreover, the investigative powers of the DHMH, set forth in articles 18 and 20, are sufficient to compel cooperation from those subject to the Department\u2019s purview.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">In our view, the Department is not entitled to deny Ms. Miller access to the identity of the restaurant that may have contaminated her on the ground that the entire \u201coutbreak investigation\u201d file is a product of \u201cresearch\u201d or \u201cstudy\u201d, as those terms are used in H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102. In this regard, the Department has misconstrued the scope of H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102, and its Guidelines thus subvert the provisions of the PIA. Accordingly, to the extent that appellant sought to obtain from the Department the identity of the restaurant from which she may have contracted hepatitis, and to the extent the Department ascertained the identity of the establishment in connection with its investigative function under titles 18 and 20 of the Health-General article, we conclude that the information is not \u201cconfidential\u201d under H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102. Therefore, the Department was not permitted to prohibit disclosure of such information to appellant on the ground that disclosure was barred under S.G. \u00a7 10-615.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We note, however, that appellant\u2019s written PIA request to the Department was expansive in scope; Ms. Miller asked for \u201crecords pertaining to the recent increase in Hepatitis A in Baltimore County.\u201d Conceivably, an enormous number of documents could \u201cpertain\u201d to \u201cthe recent increase in Hepatitis A in Baltimore County.\u201d Although appellant apparently spoke on the telephone with Carmela Groves about her request, the record does not reveal whether the Department actually knew that, despite the content of the written request, appellant was primarily interested only in the information related to the identification of the particular restaurant that may have made her ill. Regardless, S.G. \u00a7 10-614(a) provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>that \u201c[a] person ... that wishes to inspect a public record shall submit a <em>written </em>application to the custodian.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Moreover, apart from correspondence between Ms. Miller and Ms. Groves, the documentary \u201cevidence\u201d placed before the trial court only consisted of three exhibits attached to the Department\u2019s memorandum of law: 1) Diane Dwyer\u2019s March 27, 1991 letter to the Attorney General; 2) the Attorney General\u2019s response; and 3) a copy of the Department\u2019s Guidelines. Significantly, the lower court did not review the Department\u2019s documents <em>in camera, </em>nor did the Department submit an index or summary to the court describing the content of the material in issue. In <em>Cranford v. Montgomery County, supra, </em>300 Md. 759, 481 A.2d 221, the Court of Appeals underscored the variety of options available to a trial judge reviewing an agency\u2019s denial of a PIA request. It said: \u201c[T]he ultimate standard under the [PIA] for determining whether an <em>in camera </em>inspection is to be made is whether the trial judge believes that it is needed in order to make a responsible determination on claims of exemptions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 779, 481 A.2d 221. If the trial court finds that the documents at issue are voluminous, the court may, in the interest of judicial economy, direct the agency to \u201cfurnish such further affidavits, indices, tables, summaries, and cross references as the trial judge believes will be of help to him.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Due to the procedural posture of this case, a host of relevant facts remain unknown. We do not know, for instance, what subdivision of the DHMH investigated appellant\u2019s case, or whether appellant\u2019s diagnosis was the one that prompted the original investigation. Although appellant\u2019s written request encompassed more than the identity of the establishment in question, we have no way of knowing what portion of the Department\u2019s file is responsive. Moreover, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>the documents that might be responsive to appellant\u2019s broad petition, we cannot determine which, if any, were gathered pursuant to the Department\u2019s investigative function under titles 18 and 20, as opposed to \u201cresearch\u201d and \u201cstudy\u201d, as described in H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102. Although DHMH was not necessarily entitled to deny appellant\u2019s entire request as to <em>all </em>of the records encompassed in appellant\u2019s letter, parts of the request may well have been \u201cconfidential\u201d under the PIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the Department erred in its interpretation of H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 and 4-102. Nevertheless, because of the absence of a developed record, it is impossible for us to determine whether the Department\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s request, <em>in toto, </em>violated the PIA. It follows that, pursuant to Rule 8-604(d), a remand is appropriate. That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-5\">If [an appellate court] concludes that the substantial merits of a case will not be determined by affirming, reversing or modifying the judgment or that justice will be served by permitting further proceedings, the Court may remand the case to a lower court____ Upon remand, the lower court shall conduct any further proceedings necessary to determine the action in accordance with the opinion and order of the appellate court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">For the reasons set forth herein, we shall vacate the judgment and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<p id=\"AMB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-11\">.
