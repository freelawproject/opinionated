J.</author>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Morris, the respondent below, appeals an order denying his motion to terminate a stalking protective order (SPO).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. In December 2001, based on events that are not relevant to this appeal, the trial court entered an SPO of an unlimited duration prohibiting respondent from contacting petitioner, respondent\u2019s former girlfriend. Since its issuance, respondent began serving a prison sentence and is presently incarcerated. Respondent has never violated the SPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">In June 2007, respondent moved to terminate the SPO, asserting that the bases for issuing it were no longer present. In particular, he argued that petitioner no longer had a \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d of respondent, given his incarceration and the fact that he had never violated the SPO. Both parties appeared by telephone for a hearing on the motion. Petitioner testified that, despite the fact that respondent is incarcerated, she remained afraid of him. Petitioner explained that certain friends of respondent have threatened her since respondent was incarcerated. The court found that testimony to be \u201ccredible and genuine\u201d and concluded that petitioner continued to suffer a \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d due to the past acts of respondent. Accordingly, the court denied respondent\u2019s motion to terminate the SPO. Respondent did not appeal that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">In April 2008, respondent again moved to terminate the SPO, asserting, as he did before, that the reasons for the court issuing the order in the first place no longer exist. Respondent questioned the truth of petitioner\u2019s testimony at the hearing on the prior motion, but he did not assert that the circumstances had changed or offer new evidence or argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The court denied respondent\u2019s second motion to terminate \u201cfor the reason of issue preclusion.\u201d In its order, the court stated that it \u201cpreviously denied an earlier Motion To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Terminate Stalking Protective Order * * * after hearing testimony at trial from the parties.\u201d That order is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">On appeal, respondent contends that the trial court erred in relying on issue preclusion as the basis for denying his motion and that the facts as set out in his motion demonstrate that petitioner no longer has a reasonable basis to fear any harm from him .</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B) provides that a court may enter an SPO if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">\u201c(i) The person intentionally, knowingly or recklessly engages in repeated and unwanted contact with the other person or a member of that person\u2019s immediate family or household thereby alarming or coercing the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">\u201c(ii) It is objectively reasonable for a person in the victim\u2019s situation to have been alarmed or coerced by the contact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">\u201c(iii) The repeated and unwanted contact causes the victim reasonable apprehension regarding the personal safety of the victim or a member of the victim\u2019s immediate family or household.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Once an SPO has been entered, it may later be terminated if, on a respondent\u2019s motion, the court finds that the criteria for issuing the order under ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B) are no longer present. <em>Edwards v. Biehler, </em>203 Or App 271, 277, 124 P3d 1256 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">In determining whether to terminate the SPO, \u201c[t]he court\u2019s inquiry will focus primarily on whether [the] petitioner continues to suffer \u2018reasonable apprehension\u2019 due to the past acts of the respondent under ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B)(iii).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(noting that the elements in ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B)(i) and (ii) will be absent if the respondent has complied with the order prior to seeking termination, <em>id. </em>at 277 n 5). As the party seeking to terminate the SPO, the respondent \u201chas the burden of demonstrating that the concerns that underlay the issuance of the original SPO have sufficiently abated that the order should be set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>aside.\u201d <em>Benaman v. Andrews, </em>213 Or App 467, 476, 162 P3d 280 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">In this case, the trial court denied respondent\u2019s first motion to terminate the SPO because it concluded that respondent failed to meet his burden of persuasion \u2014 that is, respondent failed to demonstrate that petitioner no longer suffered a reasonable apprehension due to his prior acts. Defendant did not appeal that ruling. Five months later, he filed a new motion to terminate, but without asserting any new basis for his assertion that petitioner does not continue to suffer a reasonable apprehension. The trial court rejected the new motion based on \u201cissue preclusion.\u201d Whether respondent is correct that issue preclusion was not the appropriate label for the court to employ in explaining its decision, the bottom line of the court\u2019s decision is unassailable: The court determined that respondent failed to meet his burden of persuasion on his first motion to terminate, and that unappealed decision was controlling in the absence of any new, different evidence to support his assertion that petitioner no longer suffers a reasonable apprehension as a result of his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Respondent insists that he did offer new evidence, namely, the passage of five months\u2019 time without incident. We are not prepared to say, however, that the mere passage of several months \u2014 during which time respondent remained in prison \u2014 suffices to meet his burden of persuasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">We conclude that the trial court did not err in denying respondent\u2019s second motion to terminate the SPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-9\"> We refer to the parties by their designation in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
