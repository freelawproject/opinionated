J.</author>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Respondent City of Medford (the city) and intervenor-respondent Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Wal-Mart) seek judicial review of an order of the Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA) in which LUBA remanded the city\u2019s decision to approve a site development plan without requiring a more comprehensive traffic impact analysis than the one Wal-Mart provided. ORS 197.850(1). On judicial review, the legal issue is whether LUBA, pursuant to ORS 197.829, was required to affirm the city\u2019s interpretation that its code does not require a more comprehensive traffic impact analysis under these circumstances. Because we conclude that the city\u2019s decision is not \u201cinconsistent with the express language\u201d of the city\u2019s code, ORS 197.829(l)(a), LUBA\u2019s order is unlawful in substance, ORS 197.850(9)(a). Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Because it provides context for the parties\u2019 contentions, before turning to the facts, we explain the general structure of the Medford Land Development Code (MLDC) and the specific code provisions that inform the central issue in this <em>case </em>\u2014 viz., whether a comprehensive analysis of the traffic impacts resulting from Wal-Mart\u2019s proposed store is necessary before the city may approve Wal-Mart\u2019s site plan and architectural review application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The MLDC is divided into six articles. Three articles are pertinent to our review \u2014 that is, Article I, Article II, and Article IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The city and Wal-Mart\u2019s interpretation of the code relies primarily on the provisions in Article II, the purpose of which is \u201cto designate and define the responsibilities of the approving authorities and to set forth the procedural requirements and substantive criteria for plan authorizations and the development permit.\u201d MLDC 10.100. Article II provides for 13 different types of review, including site plan and architectural review as well as the review of zone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>changes. Those two distinct types of review are governed by different provisions of the MLDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The Site Plan and Architectural Commission (SPAC) conducts site plan and architectural review, which is governed by four provisions of the MLDC \u2014 that is, MLDC 10.285, MLDC 10.287, MLDC 10.290, and MLDC 10.291. MLDC 10.285 generally describes the site plan and architectural review process and provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">\u201c* * * The Site Plan and Architectural Review process is established in order to provide for review of the functional and aesthetic adequacy of development and to assure compliance with the standards and criteria set forth in this chapter for the development of property as applied to the improvement of individual lots or parcels of land as required by this code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\"><em>\u201cSite Plan and Architectural Review considers consistency in the aesthetic design, site planning and general placement of related facilities </em>such as street improvements, off-street parking, loading and unloading areas, points of ingress and egress as related to bordering traffic flow patterns, the design, placement and arrangement of buildings as well as any other subjects included in the code which are essential to the best utilization of land in order to preserve the public safety and general welfare, and which will encourage development and use of lands in harmony with the character of the neighborhood within which the development is proposed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Relatedly, MLDC 10.287 defines the content of a site plan and architectural review application. Generally, an application must contain particular information concerning landscaping and building construction. In addition to an architectural plan, the building construction section of the application requires site plan information, including information about (1) \u201c[e]xisting and proposed off-street parking: location, number, type and dimensions of spaces, parking area, internal circulation pattern\u201d; (2) \u201c[a]ccess: pedestrian, vehicular, service, points of ingress and egress\u201d; (3) \u201c[s]treet dedication and improvements\u201d; and (4) \u201c[l]ocation of existing public improvements including streets, curbs, sidewalks, street trees, utility poles, light fixtures, traffic signs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>signals, and such other data as may be required to permit [SPAC] to make the required findings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">The nature of those findings is contained in MLDC 10.290. That provision states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">\u201c[SPAC] shall approve a site plan and architectural review application if it can find that the proposed development conforms, or can be made to conform through the imposition of conditions, with the following criteria:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">\u201c(1) The proposed development complies with the <em>applicable </em>provisions of all city ordinances.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Finally, under MLDC 10.291, the conditions that SPAC may impose include \u201c[requiring the installation of appropriate public facilities and services and dedication of land to accommodate public facilities when needed\u201d; \u201c[Requiring the improvement of an existing, dedicated alley which will be used for ingress or egress for a development\u201d; and \u201cControlling the number and location of parking and loading facilities, points of ingress and egress and providing for the internal circulation of motorized vehicles, bicycles, public transit and pedestrians[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">In sum, the text of MLDC 10.285 and MLDC 10.287 demonstrates that SPAC is authorized to consider consistency in the aesthetic design, site planning, and general placement of related facilities. Specifically, SPAC reviews, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) the placement of facilities (e.g., bus pullouts) as they relate to a specific site plan, (2) ingress and egress from the site, and (3) the movement of vehicles and pedestrians within the site. However, the express wording of the code provisions circumscribing SPAC\u2019s authority do not indicate that SPAC has broad authority to determine the adequacy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>street capacity for development that constitutes a permitted use within the zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Instead, the adequacy of street capacity is determined during the review of zone changes, which is governed by an entirely separate provision, MLDC 10.227. Specifically, MLDC 10.227 provides that the Planning Commission \u2014 not SPAC \u2014 \u201cshall approve a quasi-judicial zone change\u201d if it finds, among other things, that the zone change complies with certain criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">One of those criteria is that the applicant demonstrate that \u201cCategory A urban services and facilities are available or can and will be provided, as described below, to adequately serve the subject property with the permitted uses allowed under the proposed zoning * * *.\u201d MLDC 10.227. Among the requirements of \u201cCategory A urban services and facilities\u201d in MLDC 10.227(2) are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201c(b) Adequate streets and street capacity must be provided in one (1) of the following ways:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">\u201c(i) Streets which serve the subject property, as defined in Section 10.461(2), presently exist and have adequate capacity; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">\u201c(ii) Existing and new streets that will serve the subject property will be improved and/or constructed, sufficient to meet the required condition and capacity, at the time building permits for vertical construction are issued; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\">\u201c(iii) If it is determined that a street must be constructed or improved in order to provide adequate capacity for more than one (1) proposed or anticipated development, the Planning Commission may find the street to be adequate when the improvements needed to make the street adequate are fully funded.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>In sum, MLDC Article II allocates authority among different decision-making entities. The Planning Commission has authority to determine the adequacy of street capacity to serve permitted uses before approving a zone change. Conversely, in reviewing a site plan application, SPAC has authority to consider consistency in the aesthetic design, site planning, and general placement of related facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Unlike Article II, which allocates authority among decision-makers, MLDC Article I contains provisions that \u201capply to the general provisions, administration and enforcement\u201d of the MLDC, including broad definitions of the terms \u201cdevelopment\u201d and \u201cdeveloper\u201d on which petitioners rely, and Article IV contains provisions that apply to \u201cthe establishment and application of development standards for public improvements.\u201d MLDC 10.007. Of particular pertinence to our review here, Article IV includes MLDC 10.460 to 10.462, the code provisions that petitioners invoke \u2014 and on which LUBA relied \u2014 as precluding the city from approving the site plan without requiring a more comprehensive traffic impact analysis than the one Wal-Mart provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Among other things, a TIA \u201cidentifies] the traffic impacts that a proposed development will have on the existing and future street network\u201d and \u201cdetermines all improvements or mitigation measures necessary to maintain adequate [levels of service] at study area intersections and ensure safe pedestrian and vehicular ingress to and egress from the transportation system.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> MLDC 10.460. A TIA is required when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>\u201ca proposed application has the potential of generating more than 250 net average daily trips * * * or the Public Works Department has concerns due to operations or accident history, a TIA will be required to evaluate development impacts to the transportation system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">MLDC 10.461(3). Nonetheless, \u201c[t]he level of detail and scope of a [TIA] will vary with the size, complexity, and location of the proposed application.\u201d MLDC 10.461(1). For that reason, the Public Works Department issues a \u201cscoping letter\u201d that defines the study area of the TIA. The study area</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">\u201cshall address at least the following areas:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">\u201c(a) All proposed site access points;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">\u201c(b) Any intersection where the proposed development can be expected to contribute 25 or more trips during the analysis peak period. * * *; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">\u201c(c) Any intersections directly adjacent to the subject property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">MLDC 10.461(2). Apparently, based on the outcomes of a TIA,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">\u201c[w]henever level of service is determined to be below level D for arterials or collectors, <em>development </em>is not permitted unless the <em>developer </em>makes the roadway or other improvements necessary to maintain level of service D respectively.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">MLDC 10.462 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>As we will amplify shortly, the references to \u201cdevelopment\u201d and \u201cdeveloper\u201d are central to petitioners\u2019 contentions (and LUBA\u2019s conclusion) that the provisions of MLDC 10.462 were applicable and controlling here. Specifically, petitioners contend, and LUBA agreed, that, because the proposed Wal-Mart store is a \u201cdevelopment,\u201d the provisions of Article IV required SPAC consideration and approval of a comprehensive analysis of the traffic impacts resulting from the proposed store before the city may approve Wal-Mart\u2019s application. Ultimately, the issue for purposes of our review reduces to whether, given the allocation of functions described and prescribed in Article II, the city\u2019s contrary construction of its code is \u201cinconsistent with the express language.\u201d ORS 197.829(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">With that background concerning the structure of the MLDC and the nature of TIAs \u2014 and with the legal issue clearly in mind \u2014 we turn to the material facts, which we take from LUBA\u2019s order and the record. Wal-Mart seeks to build a 176,335-square-foot retail store on 18.5 acres in the city. The city\u2019s previous decisions with respect to Wal-Mart\u2019s applications have resulted in two prior appeals to LUBA, <em>see Siporen v. City of Medford, </em>55 Or LUBA 29 (2007); <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. City of Medford, </em>49 Or LUBA 52 (2005), and, as LUBA indicated, \u201c[t]he procedural twists and turns that this matter has taken do not make for easy reading.\u201d <em>Siporen, </em>55 Or LUBA at 31. It is sufficient to note that, as pertinent to our review, LUBA\u2019s remands in those two cases ultimately directed the city to apply MLDC 10.462 to its review of Wal-Mart\u2019s site plan and architectural review application or explain the reason that it does not apply under these circumstances. <em>See Siporen, </em>55 Or LUBA at 53, 56; <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>49 Or LUBA at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Following LUBA\u2019s remand in <em>Siporen, </em>Wal-Mart filed an application concerning its proposed store \u2014 that is, the application that is the subject of our review \u2014 with SPAC. Wal-Mart also submitted a \u201climited\u201d TIA. Before SPAC, petitioners Siporen, Holen, and Medford Citizens for Responsible Development (MCRD) raised issues concerning the traffic impacts of the proposed development. Specifically, Siporen and MCRD squarely raised the legal issue that LUBA had previously remanded \u2014 namely, that the city needed \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>explain why it was not requiring [Wal-Mart] to provide a comprehensive traffic analysis under [MLDC] 10.462 and related provisions of the Medford Code.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">SPAC rejected petitioners\u2019 arguments and determined \u201cthat the project [was] in compliance\u201d with MLDC 10.290(1) \u2014 that is, that \u201c[t]he proposed development * * * complies with the applicable provisions of all city ordinances.\u201d In that regard, SPAC determined that, contrary to petitioners\u2019 premise, for purposes of MLDC 10.290(1), MLDC 10.462 was not \u201capplicable.\u201d According to SPAC, MLDC 10.462 is \u201capplicable at the time of zone change\u201d \u2014 and not at the time of SPAC\u2019s review of a site plan and architectural review application. Ultimately, SPAC approved Wal-Mart\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Petitioners appealed SPAC\u2019s approval to the city council. Petitioners noted that \u201cWal-Mart [had] submitted a revised traffic impact analysis\u201d but that the analysis \u201cwas limited to studying the ingress and egress points for the store\u2019s parking areas\u201d and that \u201c[t]he impacts on nearby intersections were not part of this revised TIA.\u201d (Underscoring in original.) Consistently with their position before SPAC, the gravamen of petitioners\u2019 position before the council was that (1) MLDC 10.460 to 10.462 operate collectively to require a more comprehensive TIA than the one that Wal-Mart had submitted; and (2) the text of those code provisions was inconsistent with the city\u2019s \u201cinformal policy of requiring a comprehensive TIA only at the time of zone change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">As did SPAC, the city council approved Wal-Mart\u2019s application. The council did not focus specifically on the meaning of MLDC 10.462; rather, the council\u2019s analysis pertained, broadly, to the scope of SPAC\u2019s authority as described in MLDC Article II. <em>See </em>231 Or App at 587-91 (describing provisions). Ultimately, the council concluded that SPAC had been correct in determining that \u201cthe facility adequacy of arterial and collector streets under MLDC 10.462 is <em>vested with the Planning Commission at time of zone change, and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number><em>not SPAC whose authority over transportation issues is defined and limited </em>* * (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, the council determined that MLDC 10.462 did not apply to SPAC\u2019s review of Wal-Mart\u2019s application so as to require a comprehensive TIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Petitioners appealed the city council\u2019s decision to LUBA. Before LUBA, the essential nature of the parties\u2019 positions remained constant.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">In particular, petitioners reiterated that (1) SPAC cannot approve an application unless it \u201ccomplies with the applicable provisions of all city ordinances.\u201d MLDC 10.290(1); (2) given their structure and content, MLDC 10.460 to 10.462 necessarily operate in concert to prohibit \u201cdevelopment\u201d if the level of service for arterials or collectors falls below level of service D unless roadway or other improvements necessary to maintain level of service D are made; and (3) Wal-Mart is a \u201cdeveloper\u201d that submitted an application for \u201cdevelopment.\u201d Consequently, petitioners asserted that the city erred by not requiring Wal-Mart to prepare a comprehensive TIA to demonstrate that its proposed development complies with the requirement in MLDC 10.462 to maintain level of service D.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Conversely, the city and Wal-Mart, focusing on code provisions related to the scope of SPAC\u2019s authority <em>(e.g., </em>MLDC 10.285 - 10.290), contended that MLDC 10.462 was inapplicable to site plan and architectural review. As Wal-Mart explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">\u201cthe City fully explained in its findings why [MLDC] 10.462 is not an applicable requirement for site plan and architectural review. The essence of those findings is that the site plan and architectural review code provisions ([MLDC] 10.285 -10.290) neither authorize SPAC to review comprehensive TIA[s] nor otherwise require such an analysis for site plan and architectural review applications. If the City intended to require such an analysis for site plan and architectural review applications, it would have done so expressly as it has done for other types of land use reviews, such as zone changes. As the City explained in its findings, the City determines the adequacy of the transportation system to accommodate permitted uses at the time of zone change, not upon review of a site plan architectural review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>application for a permitted use. Petitioners offer an alternative interpretation, but fail to explain why [MLDC] 10.462 overrides the explicit requirements of the site plan and architectural review standards. The City\u2019s interpretation of its Code regarding the allocation of duties and responsibilities among its decision-making bodies is entitled to deference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">(Record citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In sum, the parties\u2019 positions were essentially \u201ctwo ships passing in the night.\u201d On the one hand, petitioners contended that, because MLDC 10.460 to 10.462 apply to \u201cdevelopment\u201d and the site plan application for Wal-Mart\u2019s store concerned \u201cdevelopment,\u201d SPAC could not approve Wal-Mart\u2019s application without a comprehensive TIA. On the other, the city and Wal-Mart contended that, because, under the allocation of functional responsibility described in MLDC Article II, SPAC is not authorized to require or review a comprehensive TIA, MLDC 10.462 is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Ultimately, LUBA rejected the city\u2019s and Wal-Mart\u2019s arguments and remanded the city\u2019s decision. After examining the code provisions on which the city and Wal-Mart relied, LUBA rejected their contention that SPAC\u2019s scope of authority was limited so as to render MLDC 10.462 inapplicable in this context. In so holding, LUBA concluded that \u201cthe city\u2019s interpretation finds <em>almost no support\u201d </em>in the text of the code provisions on which the city relied and that, \u201c[g]iven the <em>paucity of textual support </em>for the city\u2019s interpretation of MLDC 10.290([1]), we cannot defer to that interpretation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) LUBA further observed, in remanding the city\u2019s decision, that \u201c[t]he city will need to amend MLDC 10.290([1]) if it wishes to approve development site plans without applying MLDC 10.461 and 10.462.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">On judicial review of LUBA\u2019s decision, the parties reiterate their respective positions concerning the correct interpretation of the city\u2019s code under these circumstances. However, beyond that \u2014 and dispositively here \u2014 the city and Wal-Mart contend that, regardless of the <em>relative </em>correctness of the parties\u2019 differing interpretations, LUBA erred in failing to sustain the city\u2019s interpretation of its code because that interpretation was not \u201cinconsistent with the express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>language\u201d of the code. ORS 197.829(l)(a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to Wal-Mart,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-4\">\u201cLUBA evaluated various provisions of the text and reached its own conclusions as to how the text should be interpreted. In every instance where the text could be interpreted in one of two ways, LUBA chose to discount the textual and contextual support cited by the City, and instead provided its own support for the alternative interpretation. In so doing, LUBA failed to acknowledge that the text is capable of supporting more than one interpretation, and that the City\u2019s reconciliation of conflicting provisions should be given deference. LUBA\u2019s approach is error as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Petitioners disagree, contending that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">\u201c[the city] and Wal-Mart both argue that LUBA conducted a comparative analysis between the city\u2019s interpretation of the code and * * * MCRD\u2019s interpretation of the code, and improperly substituted its judgment for that of the city. That is not the case. In the appeal below * * * MCRD presented LUBA with a set of arguments that showed that the provisions of Article IV [that govern development standards for public improvements] and MLDC 10.290([1]) explicitly contradicted the city\u2019s contextual rationalization for determining that a TIA is \u2018only required at the time of rezoning.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">\u201cBelow, LUBA expressly identified that its job was to determine whether the city\u2019s interpretation was sustainable under ORS 197.829(1) \u2014 \u2018not whether petitioners\u2019 interpretation is better or sustainable.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Accordingly, petitioners contend, \u201cLUBA understood its task was to consider whether the text and context of MLDC 10.290([1]) supported the city\u2019s view that a TIA under MLDC 10.461 and 10.462 is only required at the time of rezone.\u201d In sum, petitioners conclude, \u201cLUBA correctly found that the text and context of [the city\u2019s] development code does not support the city\u2019s interpretation that a comprehensive [TIA] is only required at the time of rezoning and that MLDC 10.461 and 10.462 do not apply to site plan review applications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">As correctly understood, the issue on judicial review is whether LUBA\u2019s order is \u201cunlawful in substance,\u201d ORS 197.850(9)(a), because, in rendering that order, LUBA failed to comply with the standard of review prescribed in ORS 197.829(l)(a): LUBA must affirm the city\u2019s interpretation of its code unless that interpretation is \u201cinconsistent with the express language\u201d of the code. In <em>Foland v. Jackson County, </em>215 Or App 157, 164, 168 P3d 1238, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 690 (2007), we described the meaning of \u201cinconsistency\u201d for purposes of ORS 197.829:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">\u201cWhether a local government\u2019s interpretation of its ordinance is \u2018inconsistent\u2019 with the language of the ordinance depends on whether the interpretation is plausible, given the interpretive principles that ordinarily apply to the construction of ordinances under the rules of <em>PGE </em>[v. <em>Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 859 P2d 1143 (1993)].\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Thus, on review in this case, our task is to determine whether, based on the express language of the code, the city\u2019s interpretation concerning the applicability of MLDC 10.462 is \u201cplausible\u201d in light of the interpretive principles of <em>PGE. Foland, </em>215 Or App at 164 (emphasis added). That is, LUBA\u2019s task \u2014 and now ours in reviewing whether LUBA\u2019s order comports with ORS 197.829(l)(a) \u2014 is not to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>whether the city\u2019s interpretation of its code was \u201ccorrect\u201d in some absolute sense of choosing among various plausible interpretations, but, instead, merely whether that interpretation satisfied <em>PGE\u2019s </em>first level threshold of plausibility. If it does, then, under ORS 197.829(l)(a), LUBA should have, and we must, sustain that interpretation, even if another interpretation might be \u201cbetter\u201d or more sensible or persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"> We turn then to whether the city\u2019s interpretation of its code in this case is plausible. The parties proceed from the same starting point, <em>viz., </em>MLDC 10.290(1), a provision that requires SPAC to approve an application if the proposed development, among other things, complies \u201cwith the <em>applicable </em>provisions of all city ordinances.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) But their respective treatments of what are \u201capplicable\u201d provisions for purposes of SPAC\u2019s review in this context differ diametrically. As noted, petitioners contend that the provisions of MLDC 10.460 to 10.462 are \u201capplicable\u201d in such a way as to compel Wal-Mart\u2019s submission, and SPAC\u2019s consideration, of a comprehensive TLA. Conversely, the city and Wal-Mart contend that the allocation in MLDC Article II of SPAC\u2019s functions as distinguished from, <em>e.g., </em>the Planning Commission\u2019s responsibility with respect to zoning substantiates its interpretation that MLDC 10.462 is not \u201capplicable\u201d here as to petitioners\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">We agree with petitioners that the city\u2019s interpretation of its code pertaining to whether MLDC 10.462 is \u201capplicable\u201d for purposes of MLDC 10.290(1) appears to be \u201cinconsistent with the express language,\u201d ORS 197.829(1)(a), of the former \u2014 but that is true only if MLDC 10.462 is read in isolation. When MLDC 10.462 is read in conjunction with other contextually pertinent code provisions relating to the scope of SPAC\u2019s review responsibilities, the city\u2019s contrary interpretation is <em>\u201cplausible.\u201d Foland, </em>215 Or App at 164 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>(emphasis added). Consequently, LUBA erred, under ORS 197.829(l)(a), in failing to affirm that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">We return to the city\u2019s rationale for its interpretation. As Wal-Mart explains, \u201c[t]he key to the City\u2019s interpretation of what provisions are applicable to site plan review is the understanding that its review bodies have different roles and responsibilities, and those roles and responsibilities are dictated by Article II (Sections 10.100 - 10.296) of the MLDC.\u201d Accordingly, those provisions \u2014 and specifically those pertaining to SPAC\u2019s authority and scope of review, <em>e.g., </em>MLDC 10.285, MLDC 10.287, and MLDC 10.290 \u2014 are pertinent context for determining whether MLDC 10.462 is \u201capplicable\u201d to the development proposed in this site plan review. <em>See PGE, </em>317 Or at 611 (reasoning that, \u201cat the first level of analysis, the court considers the context of the statutory provision at issue, which includes other provisions of the same statute and other related statutes\u201d); <em>Western Land &amp; </em>Cattle, <em>Inc. v. Umatilla County, </em>230 Or App 202, 209-10, 214 P3d 68 (2009) (explaining that \u201cthe \u2018consistency with the express language\u2019 inquiry looks at the text of the plan provision or the regulation in question, as well as the context of other parts of the plan or regulation that are relevant to the textual meaning of that \u2018express language\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The city has expressly indicated that the purpose of Article II of the MLDC is \u201cto designate and define the responsibilities of the approving authorities and to set forth the procedural requirements and substantive criteria for plan authorizations and the development permit.\u201d MLDC 10.100. As noted, the city has provided for 13 different types of review in Article II. Specifically, as pertinent here, the review of a proposed zone change by the Planning Commission and the review of a site plan by SPAC are two distinct types with different requirements and purposes. To be sure, as petitioners correctly point out, there is no express statement in the MLDC that a comprehensive TIA is required only at the time of rezoning. However, given the text and context of the code provisions on which the city relied, the city plausibly interpreted its code to allocate authority among its decision-making entities and, in so doing, limit the scope of authority of each entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>MLDC 10.227 expressly provides that the Planning Commission must determine that street capacity is adequate to \u201cserve the subject property with the permitted uses\u201d allowed in a zone before it approves a zone change. Following a zone change, when specific sites are proposed, MLDC 10.285 expressly provides that SPAC must consider \u201cconsistency in the aesthetic design, site planning and general placement of related facilities.\u201d The general placement of related facilities includes the review of \u201cpoints of ingress and egress as related to bordering traffic flow patterns,\u201d MLDC 10.285; however, the express wording of the code provisions governing SPAC\u2019s authority does not include authority to generally review street capacity and the adequacy of the transportation system for each permitted use within the zone \u2014 which is what petitioners in this case seek. For those reasons, the city plausibly determined that MLDC 10.462 does not apply to SPAC\u2019s review of Wal-Mart\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">The thrust of petitioners\u2019 opposing position on review is that the city\u2019s interpretation cannot be reconciled with various code provisions, which, in petitioners\u2019 view, the city has essentially ignored. To support their contention, petitioners rely on <em>Hodge Oregon Properties, LLC v. Lincoln Cty., </em>194 Or App 50, 93 P3d 93 (2004), and <em>Just v. City of Lebanon (A122516), </em>193 Or App 121, 88 P3d 307 (2004). However, those cases are materially distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In <em>Hodge Oregon Properties, LLC, </em>an applicant sought a conditional use permit to site a nonforest dwelling on property, part of which was zoned \u201cTimber Conservation\u201d (TC). 194 Or App at 52. A neighbor opposed the application because the applicant had not demonstrated that \u201cthe dwelling and its septic system would be located entirely within the TC zone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The county approved the application, reasoning that the dwelling itself would be sited in the TC zone and that the siting of the septic system was not a part of its decision. <em>Id. </em>at 52-53. LUBA disagreed, concluding that, because a \u201cdwelling\u201d was defined to include a septic system, the county erred. <em>Id. </em>at 53. On review, we affirmed, relying, as did LUBA, on the fact that a \u201cdwelling\u201d was defined to include \u201csanitation\u201d <em>ie.g., </em>a septic system). <em>Id. </em>at 54. We concluded that the county\u2019s approval of the \u201cdwelling\u201d as a conditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>use without a demonstration that the proposed structure had sanitation was \u201cinconsistent with the express language\u201d of its code. <em>Id. </em>at 54-55 (citing ORS 197.829(1)(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\">In <em>Just, </em>LUBA remanded the city\u2019s annexation and zoning designation, concluding that the city could not approve an annexation without a specific development proposal. 193 Or App at 123, 125. We affirmed, rejecting the city\u2019s argument that LUBA should have deferred to the city\u2019s interpretation because (in the city\u2019s view) that interpretation \u201c \u2018was consistent with the plain language of the ordinance and consistent with the City\u2019s plans and policies governing annexations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124. We reasoned that Urbanization Element Annexation Policy 3 of the Lebanon Comprehensive Plan included a mandatory requirement that a specific development proposal accompany annexation requests \u201c \u2018[ujnless otherwise approved by the city.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127 (brackets in original). Although it was unclear from the text of the exception whether the city could defer the requirement of a specific development proposal until after the approval of the annexation, other annexation and public facilities policies made it clear that the city would consider specific development proposals at the time that it made its annexation decision. <em>Id. </em>at 128-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">In <em>Hodge </em>and <em>Just, </em>the text of local enactments examined in context <em>foreclosed </em>the local government\u2019s interpretations. That is not the case here. Fundamentally, because there is no code provision that expressly indicates the type or types of development review in which MLDC 10.462 applies, the parties\u2019 arguments are entirely contextual and the code provisions on which either party relies do not foreclose the other party\u2019s interpretation. Notwithstanding that neither party\u2019s contentions fully harmonize all cited provisions of the city\u2019s code, both parties present plausible interpretations of the code. Under such circumstances, LUBA must affirm the city\u2019s interpretation. Because LUBA did not do so here, its order is unlawful in substance. Accordingly, we must reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b629-8\"> The parties have adopted a shorthand convention of referring to traffic impact analyses (TIAs) that address level of service only at points of ingress and egress to a site as \u2018limited\u201d TIAs. Conversely, they refer to TIAs that address a broader study area, including points of ingress and egress as well as intersections where the development would potentially contribute 25 or more trips, as \u201ccomprehensive\u201d TIAs. We adopt that convention as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b631-10\"> We note that the version of MLDC 10.290 quoted above is different from the version that LUBA quoted in its order. As pertinent to our review, the critical difference between the versions appears to be that subsection (2), to which LUBA and at least one of the parties on review referred, was apparently renumbered as subsection (1). For clarity, throughout this opinion, our quotations and references to MLDC 10.290 are to the version quoted above and, where necessary, we modify LUBA\u2019s and the parties\u2019 quotations and references to that code provision accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b632-10\"> Relatedly, MLDC 10.235, which governs the approval of preliminary planned unit developments (PUD), provides that, if such a development includes a use that is not allowed in the underlying zone, the applicant \u2014 as would be true of an applicant who requested a zone change \u2014 must demonstrate the adequacy of public facilities such as streets.
