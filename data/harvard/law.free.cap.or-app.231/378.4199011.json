The court also imposed restitution in the amount of $60.30. On appeal, defendant challenges only the trial court\u2019s imposition of restitution, contending that the record does not demonstrate that a victim suffered economic damages as a result of her criminal activity. <em>See </em>ORS 137.103; ORS 137.106. The state concedes the error and, for the reasons discussed below, we agree with the state and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Defendant took a cab to a convenience store and attempted to purchase cigarettes with a fake $100 bill. The store clerk refused to accept the bill. Defendant left the store, returned to the cab, and asked the cab driver whether the driver could make change for $100. The driver refused and took defendant to a different store, where the driver and the store clerk contacted the police. Defendant ultimately pleaded guilty to possessing a forged instrument under ORS 165.022.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">At sentencing, the court imposed restitution to the cab driver in the amount of defendant\u2019s unpaid cab fare. In defendant\u2019s view, the court erred in that regard because the cab driver was not a victim of the crime of possession of a forged instrument \u2014 the only crime to which defendant pleaded guilty. The state concedes that the cab driver, who never accepted the fake $100 bill, was not a victim of defendant\u2019s possession of the forged instrument. We agree, accept the concession, and remand for resentencing. ORS 137.103(4) (defining \u201cvictim\u201d to include persons who have suffered economic damages as a result of the offense); <em>State v. Edson, </em>329 Or 127, 132, 985 P2d 1253 (1999) (\u201c[T]here are three prerequisites to an order of restitution under ORS 137.106(1): (1) criminal activities, (2) pecuniary damages, and (3) a causal relationship between the two.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
