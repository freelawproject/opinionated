J.</author>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The appeal in this criminal case charging defendant with 40 counts of encouraging child sexual abuse in the second degree, ORS 163.686, was initiated by the state after the trial court allowed in part and denied in part defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence. Defendant cross-appeals pursuant to ORS 138.040<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the part of the order denying the motion to suppress. Subsequently, the state dismissed its appeal. The threshold issue before us is whether, under ORS 138.040, we may exercise our discretion to consider defendant\u2019s cross-appeal after the state has dismissed its appeal. We conclude that, under the holding in <em>State v. Shaw, </em>338 Or 586, 113 P3d 898 (2005), we are required to dismiss defendant\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The trial court\u2019s order recites that the charges against defendant arose out of the discovery of images of child pornography on defendant\u2019s computer by a computer repair technician. The evidence sought to be suppressed by defendant consisted of his statements and computer images depicting child pornography. In September 2003, defendant took his computer to a repair shop owned by Wells. Defendant asked Wells to repair his computer and to copy files from the hard drive so they could be loaded on defendant\u2019s new computer. Part of that process involved Wells copying files from defendant\u2019s computer onto his own computer in order to preserve those files in the event that there was a problem in restoring the files to defendant\u2019s computer. While copying the files to his computer, Wells came across a file with a name that Wells associated with gaming activities. Wells was uncertain whether defendant wanted the file copied to his new computer. Consequently, he opened the file and discovered multiple images of what appeared to be children engaged in sexual acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>After defendant picked up his computer from Wells, Wells reported his discovery to his mother, who works for the Multnomah County Sheriffs Office. A few days later, Wells was contacted by a Multnomah County sheriff deputy who informed him that the report would be referred to the City of Portland Police Bureau. Wells heard nothing further until approximately two months later when he was contacted by Multnomah County Sheriff Deputy Biles. In the interim, Wells had decided to copy defendant\u2019s files that existed on his own computer. He transferred those files to a CD and then deleted them from his own computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">When Biles contacted Wells, Wells offered to give the CD containing defendant\u2019s computer files to Biles. Biles took the CD and went back to his office, put the CD in his computer, viewed the images, and confirmed that the images depicted child pornography. The investigation was then determined to be within the jurisdiction of the Portland Police Bureau and transferred to that agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Andrews, a detective with the Portland Police Bureau, viewed the CD with defendant\u2019s files on it that had been made by Wells. The \u201cgaming\u201d file opened by Wells was determined to contain 287 pornographic images. Andrews also viewed another file entitled \u201cThumbs 31\u201d belonging to defendant that was on the Wells CD and found more images of child pornography. Andrews then procured a search warrant for the search of defendant\u2019s residence. When the officers executing the search warrant contacted defendant, they had him read a written <em>Miranda </em>warning and defendant signed a consent form agreeing to speak with the officers. During the ensuing interview, defendant admitted that he knew that the images of child pornography existed on his computer but explained that the images had been put there by the person from whom he had bought the computer. While the interview was ongoing, the police seized a number of personal items including computers and computer files from defendant\u2019s residence and subsequently opened or viewed those computer files.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">After defendant was charged, he initially moved to suppress the evidence that the police obtained from his computer files at his residence, arguing that the search warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>obtained by the police did not authorize a search of his computers and related electronic storage media. In a supplemental motion to suppress, he argued that the police impermissibly expanded Wells\u2019s private search of defendant\u2019s files by examining a copy of the files provided by Wells without a warrant. In a second supplemental motion, he contended that the initial copying of his computer files by Wells was done at the direction of law enforcement officials. Additionally, defendant filed a motion to controvert contents of the affidavit that the police had filed in support of their request for a search warrant, and he moved to suppress his statements that were made contemporaneously with the search of his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The trial court, in a memorandum opinion and a supplemental memorandum opinion, agreed with defendant\u2019s initial motion to suppress. It reasoned that the language in the warrant did not authorize the police to look at the images on the computers and disks seized from defendant\u2019s residence. According to the trial court, the warrant was supported by probable cause and authorized the search of defendant\u2019s residence for a list of items in the warrant and a seizure of those items but not a subsequent search or viewing of the contents of the seized items. It rejected defendant\u2019s argument that Wells was acting as an agent of the police. The court also granted defendant\u2019s supplemental motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of the police viewing the file contained on the CD provided to them by Wells but only to the extent that their search exceeded the scope of the private search by Wells. The trial court also denied defendant\u2019s motions to controvert the evidence and to suppress the statements that he made to the detectives at the time the search warrant was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Pursuant to its rulings, the court entered an order suppressing the evidence that police obtained through the search of items seized from defendant\u2019s residence and granting and denying in part the supplemental motion to suppress evidence that the \u201cpolice obtained in connection with their review of the CD provided to them by computer repairman Ron Wells.\u201d The order also denied defendant\u2019s second supplemental motion to suppress, defendant\u2019s motion to controvert, and defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the statements that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>had made to police. The state appealed. In its notice of appeal, the state stated, \u201cState of Oregon, Plaintiff, hereby gives notice of appeal from the ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTIONS TO SUPPRESS[.]\u201d Four days later, defendant filed a notice of cross-appeal appealing \u201cto the extent [the order] denied portions of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.\u201d Defendant also cross-appealed from other pretrial orders entered by the trial court. Approximately one year later, the state moved to dismiss its appeal, citing the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\">\u201cAfter careful evaluation of this appeal, and after consultation with the Multnomah County District Attorney\u2019s Office, the state has concluded that it would be more expeditious to reseize the challenged evidence by means of a search warrant, rather than to pursue this appeal of the trial court\u2019s order suppressing evidence obtained from defendant\u2019s computer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Defendant thereafter continued to pursue his cross-appeal, making five assignments of error, three of which pertain to the trial court\u2019s rulings on the motions to suppress: (1) The trial court erred by denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the results of Bile\u2019s view of the CD provided by Wells; (2) The search warrant was the product of the prior unlawful search of the CD; and (3) The statements obtained from defendant were the product of an illegal search.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">In <em>Shaw, </em>the court identified, for the first time, the circumstances under which appellate courts should elect to exercise their statutory discretion to review a defendant\u2019s cross-appeal under ORS 138.040. 338 Or at 617. In other words, the court\u2019s holding in <em>Shaw </em>effectively defines the boundaries of our discretion to consider defendant\u2019s cross-appeal. The initial holding in <em>Shaw </em>is that the exercise of discretion under ORS 138.040 to review a defendant\u2019s cross-appeal should be exercised \u201conly sparingly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The reasons for that limitation are two-fold, according to the <em>Shaw </em>court. First, a defendant, unlike the state, has a full opportunity to challenge any intermediate adverse trial court ruling if the defendant is convicted. If a defendant is acquitted, then any intermediate rulings become moot. Accordingly, a limitation on the exercise of discretion under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>ORS 138.040 of a defendant\u2019s cross-appeal promotes judicial economy at the appellate level, thereby negating the possibility of the expenditure of judicial time and resources on issues that will not arise unless the defendant is convicted. <em>Id. </em>at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Second, a state\u2019s pretrial appeal necessarily prolongs the pendency of a criminal proceeding against a defendant and may in some cases result in the defendant remaining in custody during the pendency of the appeal. The consideration of a cross-appeal by this court, along with the state\u2019s appeal, together with the possibility of review by the Supreme Court, only adds to the delay of the defendant being brought to trial. In the <em>Shaw </em>court\u2019s view, those considerations \u201cstrongly support ] the view that this court should limit the exercise of its discretion under ORS 138.040 to review a defendant\u2019s challenges to a trial court\u2019s intermediate rulings raised by cross-appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In addition to expressing the policies underlying the limitation on the discretion of an appellate court under ORS 138.040, the <em>Shaw </em>court undertook to define the circumstances regarding when that discretion should be exercised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">\u201cIn light of the considerations articulated above, we conclude that, in respect [to] a defendant\u2019s cross-appeal, this court\u2019s ordinary practice will be to limit its consideration only to those assignments of error that are inextricably linked, either factually or legally, to the state\u2019s assignments of error on appeal. Only under those factual circumstances can we reasonably be assured that our review of a defendant\u2019s assignments of error on cross-appeal will not contribute unnecessarily to the delay from a state pretrial appeal under ORS 136.060(2)(a).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">338 Or at 618-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The question then becomes, under <em>Shaw, </em>whether defendant\u2019s assignments of error are inextricably linked, either factually or legally, to the state\u2019s assignments of error to the trial court\u2019s ruling that the search warrant authorized a seizure of defendant\u2019s personal effects but not a search of their contents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the requirements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number><em>Shaw </em>test are not satisfied by the record underlying defendant\u2019s cross-appeal. The state appealed principally from a ruling regarding the scope of the search warrant and whether its language authorized the police to open the computer files that had been seized from defendant\u2019s residence. The body of law that governs that issue is unrelated to the jurisprudence that governs defendant\u2019s assignments of error. In reaching its conclusion regarding the scope of the warrant\u2019s authorization, the trial court relied on <em>State v. Carter, </em>200 Or App 262, 113 P3d 969 (2005), <em>aff'd, </em>342 Or 39, 147 P3d 1151 (2006), where a search warrant directed police to search for a detailed list of items including controlled substances, drug paraphernalia, other materials related to the manufacture and distribution of controlled substances, and firearms. However, the warrant did not authorize the seizure of any of the listed items. Among the items seized pursuant to the warrant were a microcassette audiotape and a computer. On appeal, we concluded that a warrant may validly authorize police to search for items without authorizing the seizure of any of the items. <em>Id. </em>at 265. We also remanded for the trial court to determine whether the items seized constituted incriminating evidence based on the plain view doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 268. Based on our holdings in <em>Carter, </em>the trial court in this case reasoned that, \u201cthe detectives should have looked no further until after they had obtained a warrant to seize and then search the remainder of the files and images on the CD provided to them by Wells.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">The trial court\u2019s holding pertaining to the scope of authority conferred by the provisions of the search warrant to search defendant\u2019s residence and seize items from there is easily disentangled from the issue of whether Bile\u2019s viewing of the CD made by Wells from Wells\u2019s computer was an unreasonable search within the meaning of Article I, section 9.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, the trial court\u2019s analysis did precisely that when it ruled in favor of defendant on part of his motion to suppress and in favor of the state on the remainder of the motion. Factually, the issues are framed by different circumstances, those occurring at Wells\u2019s repair shop and those occurring at defendant\u2019s residence. Also, the legal issues framed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>two discrete events referred to above are not inextricably linked. The issue with regard to the scope of warrant authority is a different legal issue from whether a \u201csearch\u201d occurred when Biles viewed Wells\u2019s CD. A brief discussion of when a \u201csearch\u201d occurs under Article I, section 9, illustrates the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"> Generally, a search occurs when the government invades a protected privacy or possessory interest of the defendant. Privacy interests are commonly circumscribed by the space in which they exist, <em>i.e., </em>the private space of a person. <em>State v. Smith, </em>327 Or 366, 372-73, 963 P2d 642 (1998). Nonetheless, in the abstract, the absence of a physical or sensory invasion of a private space does not necessarily defeat a claim that government conduct constitutes a search for purposes of Article I, section 9. <em>State v. Meredith, </em>337 Or 299, 304, 96 P3d 342 (2004). For example, in <em>State v. Campbell, </em>306 Or 157, 759 P2d 1040 (1988), the police, acting without a search warrant, attached a radio transmitter to the defendant\u2019s vehicle that enabled them to track its location. The Supreme Court held that the attachment and the monitoring of the signal from the transmitter constituted a search under Article I, section 9. <em>Id. </em>at 172.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">It follows from the above discussion that defendant\u2019s assignments of error are not inextricably linked, factually or legally, to the state\u2019s appeal because the factual circumstances and the legal issues that defendant frames are dissimilar to the factual circumstances and the legal issue upon which the state\u2019s appeal was predicated. As a result, under the holding in <em>Shaw, </em>we must decline to exercise our discretion under ORS 138.040 to review any of defendant\u2019s assignments of error on cross-appeal at this time.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>The dissent disagrees. The dissent criticizes the majority for not deferring to the Chief Judge\u2019s exercise of discretion when he preliminarily denied the state\u2019s motion to dismiss defendant\u2019s cross-appeal on the basis of the holding in <em>Shaw. </em>231 Or App at 92 (Sercombe, J., dissenting). With respect, our decision is based not on any exercise of unfettered discretion on our part but on our understanding of the holding in <em>Shaw. See State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 312, 4 P3d 1261 (2000) (\u201cIf there is only one legally correct outcome, then \u2018discretion\u2019 is an inapplicable concept.\u201d). The <em>Shaw </em>court\u2019s interpretation of ORS 138.040 is clear: the statutory discretion to entertain a cross-appeal has been significantly restricted by the court\u2019s interpretation of the statute, and its interpretation has the same force of law as if those limitations were written into the statute itself. <em>See Stephens v. Bohlman, </em>314 Or 344, 350 n 6, 838 P2d 600 (1992) (\u201cWhen this court interprets a statute, that interpretation becomes a part of the statute as if written into it at the time of its enactment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Also, part of the dissent\u2019s disagreement is based on the fact that the state\u2019s notice of appeal incorporated by reference the portion of the court\u2019s order granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence derived from the police viewing the \u201cThumbs 31\u201d file, a file that Wells had copied but not viewed. Apparently, that inclusion in the notice of the appeal, in the dissent\u2019s view, ought to change the result under <em>Shaw. </em>We are not persuaded by the dissent\u2019s argument. The state\u2019s motion to dismiss its appeal implies that it no longer relies on any evidence from the \u201cThumbs 31 file,\u201d and indeed, the trial court\u2019s order concerning that file has the legal effect of being a final order because of the state\u2019s dismissal of its appeal. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>not apparent to us why that result should require consideration of defendant\u2019s cross-appeal regarding Wells\u2019s copying of defendant\u2019s computer records, the subsequent issuance of a search warrant for the search of defendant\u2019s residence based on the information given by Wells to the police, and the suppression of defendant\u2019s statements made to the police in light of the policy issues discussed above by the <em>Shaw </em>court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The dissent also contends that given the delay in the prosecution of the cross-appeal, \u201cpostponing final resolution of the important search and seizure issues in this case is unfair to defendant and squanders the significant resources of this court already expended on this case.\u201d 231 Or App at 92 (Sercombe, J., dissenting). But, as the <em>Shaw </em>court pointed out in its opinion, no unfairness to defendant is caused by the dismissal of his cross-appeal when he will have a complete opportunity to appeal the trial court\u2019s suppression order if convicted. For that matter, we do not know what evidence will be offered by the state at trial in light of its intent to seek the issuance of another search warrant to search the items seized from defendant\u2019s residence. Also, as to the resources utilized by this court to date in considering defendant\u2019s cross-appeal, it is unlikely, for the same reason that this case would be finally resolved by any decision made by us even if we were to exercise jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">We conclude, based on the pronouncement in <em>Shaw, </em>that to refuse to dismiss defendant\u2019s cross-appeal would fall outside the boundaries of the discretion conferred by ORS 138.040 on this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Cross-appeal dismissed; case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-6\"> ORS 138.040 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">\u201cExcept as provided under ORS 138.050, the defendant may appeal to the Court of Appeals from a judgment or order described under ORS 138.053 in a circuit court, and may cross-appeal when the state appeals pursuant to ORS 138.060(l)(c) or (2)(a). The following apply upon such appeal or cross-appeal:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">\u201c(1) The appellate court may review:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">\u201c(a) Any decision of the court in an intermediate order or proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b108-9\"> We note that given the holding in <em>Shaw, </em>our decision in <em>State v.

Penner, </em>190 Or 542, 227 P2d 316 (1951) (holding that there was no violation of Article I, section 9, when a private citizen removed incriminating evidence from a wrecked car and delivered it to the police); <em>see also Burdeau v. McDowell, </em>256 US 465, 475, 41 S Ct 574, 65 L Ed 1048 (1921) (holding that no government search occurred within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution when a thief stole private papers belonging to the defendant and delivered them to law enforcement officers). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Arguably, defendant maintained a privacy interest in the information in his computer files even though he authorized them to be copied to Wells\u2019s computer. <em>See, e.g., State v. Johnson, </em>340 Or 319, 336, 131 P3d 173 (2006) (holding that the defendant had a cognizable privacy interest in the content of his telephone calls). Because we decline to exercise our discretion under ORS 138.040 to review defendant\u2019s cross-appeal for the reasons expressed above, we do not decide whether a \u201csearch\u201d of a defendant\u2019s private information or \u201cpapers\u201d by the government occurs within the meaning of Article I, section 9, when a third party in possession of such a container authorizes the police to view the contents of the container. <em>But see State v. Tanner, </em>304 Or 312, 323, 745 P2d 757 (1987) (\u201cIn general * * * the entrustment of an effect to another is sufficient to establish a privacy interest that is violated when the effect is discovered through an unlawful search.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b112-7\">SERCOMBE, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AlB\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s dismissal of defendant\u2019s cross-appeal. The issue presented is whether this court should exercise its discretion to consider defendant\u2019s cross-appeal under ORS 138.040. The rule that guides the exercise of that discretion, under <em>State v. Shaw, </em>338 Or 586, 618, 113 P2d 898 (2005), is that the \u201cordinary practice\u201d of the court is to consider \u201conly * * * [defendant\u2019s] assignments of error that are inextricably linked, either factually or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>legally, to the state\u2019s assignments of error on appeal.\u201d In this case, the state appealed from a ruling granting a motion to suppress some of the evidence obtained from the police examination of the Wells compact disk (CD) because that search violated Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution. One of defendant\u2019s assignments of error seeks review of part of the same ruling denying the motion to suppress other evidence obtained from the police examination of the Wells CD. Same motion, same ruling, evidence from the same CD, all arising under Article I, section 9 \u2014 it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the parties\u2019 contentions were \u201cinextricably linked\u201d both \u201cfactually and legally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">The majority avoids reaching that conclusion by focusing the <em>Shaw </em>analysis on the ruling from which the state \u201cprincipally\u201d appealed. <em>See </em>231 Or App at 86-87. The state appealed from a July 22, 2005, order granting defendant\u2019s motions to suppress. That order was adverse to the state in two respects. The order suppressed evidence that the \u201cpolice obtained through their search of items seized from [defendant\u2019s] residence * * * because the warrant did not authorize a search of those items.\u201d The majority contrasts the legal and factual issues concerning that part of the order with defendant\u2019s appellate contentions in applying the \u201cinextricably linked\u201d test under <em>Shaw.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The order under review, however, also suppressed some of the \u201cevidence police obtained in connection with their review of the CD provided to them by computer repairman Ron Wells.\u201d The majority ignores the state\u2019s appeal from that part of the order in applying <em>Shaw. </em>Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion to suppress other evidence seized as part of the police review of the Wells CD. Resolution of that assignment of error involves the same motion to suppress, trial court order, evidence, and legal analysis as would be involved in determining the equivalent part of the state\u2019s appeal. The parties\u2019 respective contentions about the evidence on the Wells CD were \u201cinextricably linked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Moreover, the issue of the court\u2019s exercise of its discretion in this case under ORS 138.040 does not arise in the course of the \u201cordinary practice\u201d of this court. The dismissal of defendant\u2019s cross-appeal at this point \u2014 four years after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>filing of the cross-appeal, two years after our denial of the state\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis of <em>Shaw, </em>16 months after the close of briefing on the cross-appeal, and over one year after the case was argued \u2014 would be extraordinary. Given that delay, postponing final resolution of the important search and seizure issues in this case is unfair to defendant and squanders the significant resources of this court already expended on this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Finally, it should not be the \u201cordinary practice\u201d of this court to revisit discretionary decisions made by the Chief Judge or a different panel of the court unless the prior exercise of discretion was beyond the decision-maker\u2019s authority. The state\u2019s motion to dismiss the cross-appeal on the basis of <em>Shaw </em>was denied by an order by Chief Judge Brewer on June 22, 2007. The order announced reasons why the court was exercising its discretion under ORS 138.040 to deny the motion to dismiss. Perhaps the majority would exercise that discretion differently. But that difference should not justify reversal of a prior decision of this court on which the parties have relied in briefing and arguing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Thus, I would conclude that the majority errs in dismissing defendant\u2019s cross-appeal for lack of jurisdiction under ORS 138.040. In my view, the court should decide the appeal and reverse the part of the trial court order that denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained from the Wells CD. My reasons are explained below, following a restated history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The charges against defendant arise out of the discovery of child pornography on his personal computer by a computer repair technician.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant brought his old computer to a computer repair shop owned and operated by Wells. He asked Wells to repair the computer, copy the files that existed on its hard drive, and transfer those files to floppy disks for transferring those files to a new computer. Defendant specifically instructed Wells not to look at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>image files on the computer because those files contained private information, <em>i.e., </em>pictures of his wife in the nude. Wells copied the entire contents of the hard drive of defendant\u2019s computer to his own computer. That copying is a standard protocol that preserves data in the event of a mishap. While copying the files, Wells noticed a file named \u201cSierra\u201d that he recognized as a file name commonly associated with gaming activities. Wells was uncertain whether defendant would want the contents of a game file transferred to the new computer. Wells opened the file and discovered \u201cmultiple disturbing images of what appeared to be children engaging in various sexual acts.\u201d After defendant retrieved his computers from the repair shop, Wells reported the discovery to the Multnomah County Sheriffs Office. The matter was referred to the Portland Police Bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">Two months later, Detective Biles interviewed Wells at the repair shop. In the meantime, and on his own volition, Wells copied the files containing the offensive images to a CD and then erased the files from his own computer. Wells gave the CD to Biles. Biles then viewed the images on the CD on his office computer and confirmed that they contained child pornography.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The case was assigned to Detective Andrews. Biles gave Andrews the CD, who then opened and viewed the file identified by Wells as the \u201cSierra\u201d file and determined that it contained 287 pornographic images. In addition, Andrews opened another file named \u201cThumbs 31\u201d and found more images, for a total of approximately 800 images on the CD. Andrews interviewed Wells who told her that he believed there were 250 to 300 images of child pornography on defendant\u2019s computer, describing some pictures in detail to the detective, including the ages of the children and the nature of the sexual contact depicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Andrews obtained a search warrant and executed it at defendant\u2019s residence. Detectives read the search warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>to defendant and told him that they wanted to ask him some questions. Before defendant was questioned, however, he read aloud and signed a written <em>Miranda </em>warning and consent form and indicated his understanding of the warning. Despite being told he did not have to talk to the detectives, defendant did so voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Defendant was indicted on 40 counts of encouraging child sexual abuse in the second degree, ORS 163.686. Before trial, defendant moved to suppress evidence that he contended was obtained unlawfully by the police. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence obtained from the computers seized during execution of the search warrant. Relying on Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, he contended that the warrant did not authorize the search of the contents of the computers, only their seizure, and that the warrant was otherwise overbroad and unsupported in fact. Defendant separately moved to suppress evidence obtained from the police examination of the Wells CD without a search warrant. Defendant finally moved to suppress evidence of his statements to the police during the execution of the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The trial court partially granted the motions to suppress. The court allowed the motion to suppress evidence seized under the search warrant because the warrant only allowed seizure of the computers and not a separate search of those computers. The motion to suppress evidence of defendant\u2019s statements to police was denied. The court partially allowed and partially denied the motion to suppress evidence obtained from the Wells CD. It concluded that defendant lost privacy rights in the computer files that had been viewed by Wells, but retained those rights in the other, unseen computer files. Those rulings were made in a July 22,2005, order that made findings and conclusions and then provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">\u201cIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence police obtained through their search of items seized from his residence is GRANTED because the warrant did not authorize a search of those items.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">\u201cIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendant\u2019s supplemental motion to suppress evidence police obtained in connection with their review of the CD provided to them by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>computer repairman Ron Wells is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">\u201cIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the statements he made to Detectives Geiger and Andrews is DENIED because the statements were voluntarily given after Defendant was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">On August 12, 2005, the state filed its notice of appeal under ORS 138.060(l)(c) \u201cfrom the order granting defendant\u2019s motions to suppress, entered on July 22, 2005 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On August 17, defendant filed his cross-appeal under ORS 138.040, reciting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">\u201cThe State of Oregon has given notice of its appeal from those portions of the trial court\u2019s order granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, entered on July 22, 2005 by Judge Marilyn E. Litzenberger. Defendant hereby gives notice of cross-appeal from said order and Judge Litzenberger\u2019s supplemental order to the extent they denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">The state moved to dismiss its appeal on October 4, 2006. That motion was granted, and defendant filed his opening brief on the cross-appeal on February 20,2007. The state had not moved to dismiss the cross-appeal at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Two months later, the state moved to dismiss the cross-appeal, relying on <em>Shaw. </em>The state argued that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>court should exercise its discretion to dismiss the cross-appeal under ORS 138.040 based on considerations of judicial economy and avoidance of unnecessary delay, and because defendant\u2019s claims were no longer \u201cinextricably linked\u201d to the state\u2019s. Defendant claimed that a dismissal of the appeal would be unfair to him, and that a resolution of the substantive issues were needed sooner than later.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Chief Judge Brewer ruled on the motion to dismiss on June 22, 2007, in an order that provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">\u201cIn April 2007, the state moved to dismiss defendant\u2019s cross-appeal on the ground that dismissal of the cross-appeal would promote judicial economy and prevent delay. The motion is denied on the ground that dismissal of defendant\u2019s cross-appeal would result in unfair expense to the defendant and would render purposeless the five months of delay between the date the court dismissed the state\u2019s appeal and the date the state moved to dismiss defendant\u2019s appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Thereafter, the state responded to defendant\u2019s briefing and asked that the order be affirmed, rather than seeking dismissal of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">JUSTICIABILITY OP THE CROSS-APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The majority decides that the cross-appeal is not justiciable under ORS 138.040. In <em>Shaw, </em>the Supreme Court examined ORS 138.140 and determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-9\">\u201cBy providing that this court \u2018may\u2019 review any intermediate decision of the trial court on a defendant\u2019s cross-appeal from a state appeal under ORS 138.060(2)(a), ORS 138.040 reserves to this court\u2019s sound discretion the decision whether to undertake such a review.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">338 Or at 617. The court then noted that an appellate court \u201cshould limit the exercise of its discretion under ORS 138.040 to review a defendant\u2019s challenges to a trial court\u2019s intermediate rulings raised by cross-appeal\u201d because of the desirability of conserving judicial resources and the need to avoid prolonging appeals from intermediate rulings. <em>Id. </em>at 618. The court concluded that \u201cthis court\u2019s ordinary practice will be to limit its consideration only to those assignments of error that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>are inextricably linked, either factually or legally, to the state\u2019s assignments of error on appeal.\u201d Id. at 618-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\">Relying on that holding, the majority writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-4\">\u201cWe conclude that the requirements of the <em>Shaw </em>test are not satisfied by the record underlying defendant\u2019s cross-appeal. The state appealed principally from a ruling regarding the scope of the search warrant and whether its language authorized the police to open the computer files that had been seized from defendant\u2019s residence. The body of law that governs that issue is unrelated to the jurisprudence that governs defendant\u2019s assignments of error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">231 Or App at 86-87. Only after the initial <em>Shaw </em>analysis does the majority note that the state\u2019s notice of appeal also incorporated the court\u2019s order granting in part defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence derived from the police viewing the Wells CD. 231 Or App at 89-90. The majority views it as unnecessary to analyze that portion of the order regarding the Wells CD under <em>Shaw </em>in light of the state\u2019s dismissal of its appeal. <em>Id. </em>I respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">To reiterate, the order under review decided two separate motions adversely to the state \u2014 a motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant and a supplemental motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the Wells CD. The latter motion was granted in part, suppressing evidence of computer files that had not been viewed by Wells.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Defendant\u2019s first assignment of error is that the trial court erred in not granting the supplemental motion to dismiss in its entirety. That is, defendant contends on appeal that he retained a privacy right in the data stored on the Wells CD, whether or not some of that data had been accessed by Wells. Defendant argues that the police use of mechanical means to manipulate that data was a search that required a warrant under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">The legal issues presented by defendant\u2019s first assignment of error \u2014 whether defendant retained any privacy rights in the Wells CD data and whether the police examination of that information was a search \u2014 are the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>legal issues that would arise in determining the state\u2019s appeal of the court\u2019s order on the supplemental motion to suppress. I would conclude, as set forth below, that the police needed a warrant to examine the contents of the Wells CD, without regard to whether a third party had examined part of its contents. Had the court reached the merits of defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, and reached that same conclusion, its holding would necessarily validate the part of the court\u2019s order that was adverse to the state. Those parts of defendant\u2019s appeal and the state\u2019s abandoned appeal from the same part of the court\u2019s order are not only \u201cinextricably linked,\u201d in the words of <em>Shaw, they also arise from exactly the same facts and present exactly the same legal issues.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The necessary linkage under <em>Shaw </em>is not lost when the state abandons its appeal. In <em>State v. Atkinson, </em>we previously held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">\u201cORS 138.040 expressly authorizes a defendant to cross-appeal, and once he has filed his notice of cross-appeal within the time permitted, this court acquires jurisdiction. The state may not oust jurisdiction by dismissing its appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">64 Or App 517, 519 n 1, 669 P2d 343 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Even if one were to conclude that the \u201cinextricably linked\u201d test under <em>Shaw </em>is not met when the state withdraws its appeal and there are no appellate contentions to compare, and that <em>Atkinson </em>is no longer dispositive, there are substantial reasons to exercise our discretion to allow continuation of defendant\u2019s appeal under ORS 138.040. The <em>Shaw </em>court states the \u201cinextricably linked\u201d test as one of the \u201cordinary practice\u201d of the court. <em>Shaw, </em>338 Or at 618. As the majority notes, that \u201cordinary practice\u201d is derived from the interests of an appellate court in the promotion of \u201cjudicial economy at the appellate level\u201d and avoiding \u201cthe delay of the defendant being brought to trial.\u201d 231 Or App at 85-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Whatever those policy interests may be at the <em>beginning </em>of an appellate process, they are no longer in play at the <em>end </em>of that process. The dismissal of the appeal by the majority comes four years after the filing of the cross-appeal, 16 months after the close of briefing, and one year after oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>argument of the case. When, as here, a case has been briefed and argued and an opinion is in the works, there is little judicial economy to be had or delay to be avoided by dismissing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Beyond the squandering of already invested judicial resources, there are other considerations that suggest that our \u201cordinary practice\u201d not guide the exercise of discretion under ORS 138.040 in this case. First, the state invited continuation of defendant\u2019s appeal by initially seeking to dismiss only its appeal. The state moved to dismiss defendant\u2019s appeal months later, only after the filing of defendant\u2019s opening brief. Having induced the appellate journey, and followed defendant in its path, the state ought not to champion cancellation of the trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Second, justice delayed is justice denied. This case presents questions of first impression on the application of Article I, section 9, to electronically stored information. If not resolved now, those questions will require resolution by this court in this case if it proceeds to defendant\u2019s conviction on the basis of the evidence at issue and to a second appeal. More importantly, an authoritative ruling on the way that Article I, section 9, applies to electronically stored information at this time would be of great benefit to the parties and the trial court in any trial of this case. Having sought that insight for four years, it is unfair to defendant to postpone consideration of the issue to a later time.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Based largely on those reasons, this court denied the state\u2019s motion to dismiss the cross-appeal over two years ago. Chief Judge Brewer\u2019s June 22, 2007, order reasoned that \u201cdismissal of defendant\u2019s cross-appeal would result in unfair expense to the defendant and would render purposeless the five months of delay between the date the court dismissed the state\u2019s appeal and the date the state moved to dismiss defendant\u2019s appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Our earlier decision was within the range of discretion given to the court under ORS 138.040 for the reasons state above. I do not believe it to be sound policy for the court now to revisit its prior exercise of discretion merely to exercise that discretion differently. It better promotes efficiency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>in the administration of appeals to respect an earlier discretionary decision made in an appeal unless that decision was outside the range of discretion allowed to the court. That is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Because the issues raised in defendant\u2019s first assignment of error are \u201cinextricably linked\u201d to the facts and law involved in any appeal by the state of the supplemental motion to suppress, and because consideration of that cross-appeal better promotes policies of judicial efficiency, avoidance of further delay, and fairness to defendant under ORS 138.040, I would proceed to consider the merits of that assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">That same logic does not apply to the relationship between the parts of the order that were the subject of the state\u2019s appeal and defendant\u2019s remaining assignments of error. The fourth and fifth assignments of error concern different orders of the trial court (an order denying defendant\u2019s demurrer to the indictment and an order allowing an amendment to the indictment) that bear no relationship to the facts or legal issues involved in the state\u2019s appeal. Defendant\u2019s second assignment of error (insufficient evidence to support the search warrant) and third assignment of error (exploitation of a search unsupported by sufficient warrant) can be resolved without regard to resolution of any issues potentially raised in the state\u2019s appeal. For those reasons, I agree with the majority that defendant\u2019s appeal on those issues should be dismissed under ORS 138.040.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">LAWFULNESS OF THE POLICE EXAMINATION OF THE WELLS CD</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Defendant asserts in his first assignment or error that the court erred in partially denying the motion to suppress evidence of the results of the police view of the Wells CD. As noted earlier, the trial court granted the motion to suppress evidence of the police inspection of the Wells CD \u201cto the extent that [the detectives\u2019] search exceeded the scope of the private citizen search conducted by Wells.\u201d The trial court\u2019s ruling limited the testimony of Wells and the detectives about the CD to testimony concerning the computer images that Wells and the police observed in common.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress all the evidence obtained by the police when they viewed the files on the CD provided by Wells because defendant had a protected privacy interest in all of the files. Defendant argues that, under both state and federal constitutional guarantees against unreasonable searches and seizures, the police were required to obtain a warrant before opening and viewing the files on the CD handed over by Wells. The state responds that the police were entitled to examine all of the files on the CD because defendant no longer had a protected privacy interest in the data. The state argues that defendant abandoned any privacy interest in the computer files because he had previously given the files to Wells with a significant possibility of their inspection by Wells. The state also asserts that Wells converted the information into his own property, the CD, and consented to the police examination of his own property. I would conclude that defendant had a protected Article I, section 9, privacy interest in the computer files that was not extinguished by the unauthorized viewing by Wells and would reverse the partial denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Article I, section 9, guarantees \u201cthe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The constitutional provision protects both privacy and possessory interests. <em>State v. Owens, </em>302 Or 196, 206, 729 P2d 524 (1986). A \u201cseizure\u201d occurs when the state significantly interferes with a person\u2019s possessory or ownership interests in property. <em>Id. </em>at 207; <em>State v. Heckathorne, </em>218 Or App 283, 287, 179 P3d 693 (2008). Defendant does not contend that the police obtained the Wells CD through their own unlawful acts so as to effect an unreasonable <em>seizure </em>of the CD itself and the information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>that it contained. Rather, defendant asserts that an unreasonable <em>search </em>occurred when the state examined the contents of the CD.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">A search conducted without a warrant is unreasonable <em>per se </em>unless it falls within an exception to the warrant requirement. No warrant was obtained for the viewing of the files on the CD, and the state has failed to identify an applicable exception to the warrant requirement. Thus, the only argument available to the state to justify the warrantless viewing of the data on the CD was that the viewing did not constitute a \u201csearch\u201d within the meaning of Article I, section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">A \u201csearch\u201d occurs under Article I, section 9, \u201cwhen a person\u2019s privacy interests are invaded by the state.\u201d <em>Owens, </em>302 Or at 206; <em>Heckathorne, </em>218 Or App at 287. \u201cA privacy interest * * * is an interest in freedom from particular forms of scrutiny.\u201d <em>State v. Campbell, </em>306 Or 157, 170, 759 P2d 1040 (1988). That interest is determined using an objective test that asks whether the government\u2019s conduct \u201cwould significantly impair an individual\u2019s interest in freedom from scrutiny, <em>i.e., </em>his [or her] privacy.\u201d <em>State v. Dixson/Digby, </em>307 Or 195, 211, 766 P2d 1015 (1988). Unlike in related inquiries under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a subjective test \u2014 a person\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy \u2014 is not used to determine a protected interest under Article I, section 9. <em>State v. Sanders, </em>343 Or 35, 43, 163 P3d 607 (2007).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, the privacy interest protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>under the state constitution is \u201cone of right, not of expectation.\u201d <em>State v. Tanner, </em>304 Or 312, 321 n 7, 745 P2d 757 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">That right or \u201cinterest in freedom from scrutiny\u201d is \u201cdetermined by social and legal norms of behavior, such as trespass laws and conventions against eavesdropping.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>306 Or at 170. The protected interest is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">\u201cnot one of freedom from scrutiny in general, because, if that were the case, any form of scrutiny would infringe a privacy interest and thereby be considered a search. A court has never held, for example, that a police officer engages in a search by making unaided observations from a public place, and an individual therefore cannot be said to have a constitutionally protected interest in freedom from such scrutiny.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Thus, the question becomes whether defendant had an \u201cinterest in freedom from scrutiny\u201d of the data stored on the Wells CD so as to require a search warrant prior to police inspection of the data on that CD. Under the facts of this case, the resolution of that question depends on the answers to the following inquiries: (1) whether defendant had a protected privacy interest under Article I, section 9, in the data stored on the hard drive of his personal computer, (2) whether defendant abandoned or diminished that protected interest by delivering the hard drive to Wells so that Wells could manipulate the data; (3) whether defendant lost any protected privacy interest as a result of the examination of some of the files by Wells; and (4) whether defendant retained that privacy interest when the data was copied and transferred to a different medium. I would conclude that defendant did not abandon or lose his protected privacy interest in the data stored on the hard drive of his computer and that the privacy interest continued after the data was transferred to the Wells CD. In light of those conclusions, a warrant was required before any inspection of the contents of the CD by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">First, there is little question that defendant had a protected privacy interest in the data stored on the hard drive of his personal computer. A personal computer often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>contains records of the most intimate details of its users\u2019 lives. It is the virtual equivalent of a file cabinet containing calendars, financial records, letters, diary entries, photograph albums, and other private information. Professor Orin S. Kerr observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\">\u201c[C]omputers are playing an ever greater role in daily life and are recording a growing proportion of it. In the 1980s, computers were used primarily as glorified typewriters. Today they are postal services, playgrounds, jukeboxes, dating services, movie theaters, daily planners, shopping malls, personal secretaries, virtual diaries, and more. As computers become involved in more aspects of our lives, they record increasingly diverse information. Each new software application means another aspect of our lives monitored and recorded by our computers. * * * As our computers perform more functions and preserve more data, we may eventually approach a world in which a considerable chunk of our lives is recorded and stored in perpetuity in our computers. These details may end up stored inside our machines in a way that can be reconstructed later by a forensic analyst with remarkable accuracy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Orin S. Kerr, <em>Searches and Seizures in a Digital World, </em>119 Harv L Rev 531, 569 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Under Oregon law, it is a crime to knowingly use or access data stored within a computer without authorization.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Computer users regularly use software programs to protect against unauthorized intrusions into the computer\u2019s operating system and stored data and require the entry of confidential passwords or other identification to use the machine. Under our \u201csocial and legal norms of behavior,\u201d the information stored within personal computers is regarded as confidential and private. Defendant had an \u201cinterest in freedom from scrutiny\u201d of the data stored in his personal computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Second, defendant did not abandon his privacy rights in that data by engaging Wells to manipulate the information. <em>See State v. Purvis, </em>249 Or 404, 410-11, 438 P2d 1002 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>(1968) (holding that under Article I, section 9, a person has no constitutionally protected privacy interest in abandoned property). The Supreme Court found an abandonment of possessory and privacy interests in <em>State v. Howard/Dawson, </em>342 Or 635, 157 P3d 1189 (2007). In that case, the defendants sought to suppress evidence obtained by police through a warrantless search of garbage that a sanitation company picked up in the regular course of business. <em>Id. </em>at 638. The court affirmed a trial court finding that, \u201cwhen defendants left their garbage for the sanitation company to collect, \u2018there [wa]s an intent to give up ownershipt,]\u2019 \u201d and affirmed a Court of Appeals conclusion that, in fact, the defendants had \u201crelinquished their possessory interests in the garbage and, as a result, their privacy interests as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 639. The court\u2019s conclusion, however, rested on the relationship between the defendants and the sanitation company:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\">\u201cHere, the legal relationship between defendants and the sanitation company effectively controls the question whether defendants retained a constitutionally protected privacy interest in the garbage. <em>See State v. Cook, </em>332 Or 601, 607-08, 34 P3d 156 (2001) (recognizing that proposition). To be sure, the privacy that Article I, section 9, protects is not necessarily coextensive with property law. Rather, the degree to which property law informs questions of privacy varies with the context in which the challenged action occurs. In this context, the court has recognized that, when a person gives up all rights to control the disposition of property, that person also gives up his or her privacy interest in the property in the same way that he or she would if the property had been abandoned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\"><em>Howard/Dawson, </em>342 Or at 642-43 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The legal relationship between a defendant and a third party in possession of the defendant\u2019s property was relevant in assessing the nature of privacy rights in <em>State v. Britten, </em>89 Or App 374, 749 P2d 1193, <em>rev den, </em>306 Or 78 (1988). In that case, the defendant rented a cabin from McComas in Montana. The defendant was arrested and detained in Oregon and was thus late in paying his rent. The defendant\u2019s mother instructed McComas to pack the defendant\u2019s belongings and to put them in storage. In the course of those efforts, McComas discovered evidence of sexual abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>by the defendant. McComas called the sheriffs office and an undersheriff seized the evidence and sent it to police in Oregon. <em>Id. </em>at 376-77. The suppression of that evidence by the trial court was affirmed on appeal. We concluded that the defendant had not abandoned the property but instead retained a property and privacy interest in his effects. <em>Id. </em>at 377. Moreover, the defendant had not given McComas authority to examine the property and investigate for evidence of a crime. We noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-4\">\u201cMcComas had the authority to do whatever was reasonably necessary to gather up and store defendant\u2019s effects. It is clear that that authority did not extend to examining defendant\u2019s ledgers and photographs and did not authorize McComas to consent to [the sheriffs] search of defendant\u2019s effects. Defendant retained a privacy interest in the effects that he entrusted McComas to store.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 378 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">By the same logic, defendant did not abandon or lessen his privacy interests in the data on the computer hard drive by entrusting the computer to Wells. Nor was the loss of those privacy rights a necessary casualty of the legal relationship between defendant and Wells. The trial court found that \u201cdefendant did not abandon his privacy interest in the contents of his computer and the other electronic storage media he left at the computer repair shop\u201d because he \u201casked that his files be transferred from the hard drive on his old computer to disks so that he could load the files onto a new computer.\u201d He \u201cspecifically requested that the person transferring the files not look at image files because * * * those files contained private information, <em>i.e., </em>pictures of his wife in the nude.\u201d As I understand the facts, the services requested from Wells did not require that he visually inspect the content of any image file.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">A person can relinquish a right to privacy by revealing conduct or items in such a way as to make the conduct or items generally observable or accessible by the public at large. <em>State v. Louis, </em>296 Or 57, 61, 672 P2d 708 (1983) (an individual can abandon his or her right to privacy by engaging in conduct \u201cin otherwise protected areas in such a way that [his or her] * * * acts can plainly be seen or heard outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>without any special effort\u201d). In this case, however, defendant merely took his computer to a repair shop and requested that files be copied. Defendant specifically instructed the repair technician not to view the images he was copying. There is no indication that defendant abandoned his privacy interest or in any way engaged in conduct that made the information he sought to keep from prying eyes generally observable or accessible by the public at large. As a general matter, the entrustment of an effect to another does not diminish a person\u2019s privacy interest in that effect. <em>See State v. Lynch, </em>94 Or App 168, 171-72, 764 P2d 957 (1988) (search warrant needed for examination of contents of defendant\u2019s duffel bag stored in a car, notwithstanding consent to search by car owner); <em>State v. Ventris, </em>164 Or App 220, 233-34, 991 P2d 54 (1999) (car owner lacked authority to consent to the search and forensic testing of a pair of pants stored in his car by the defendant).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> I would conclude that the legal relationship between defendant and Wells and the nature of the commissioned services did not create any abandonment or diminution of defendant\u2019s privacy interests in the information stored on his computer and on the CD.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Third, defendant did not lose any privacy interest in the computer image files because the files were examined by Wells. The court reached that conclusion under analogous facts in <em>State v. Luman, </em>220 Or App 617, 188 P3d 372, <em>rev allowed, </em>345 Or 381 (2008). In <em>Luman, </em>the defendant videotaped women using a restroom at his place of business. He instructed his employees not to use the television attached to a video recorder that held a videotape with those images. Two employees turned on the television and watched the videotape nonetheless. The employees gave the videotape and other tapes that they discovered to the police. Police officers viewed the contents of all of the videotapes without first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>securing a search warrant. After the defendant was charged with several counts of invasion of personal privacy, he moved to suppress the videotapes and all evidence derived from the videotapes. <em>Id. </em>at 619-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">In <em>Luman, </em>as here, we noted that the question presented concerned the police search of the videotape and not the lawfulness of any seizure. The police obtained the videotapes lawfully. We concluded that the defendant had not abandoned any privacy interest in the videotapes. <em>Id. </em>at 622. Thus, the issue was \u201csimply whether, by viewing the videotapes without first obtaining a warrant, [the police] unlawfully \u2018searched\u2019 the videotapes, in violation of defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623. More particularly, the issue was \u201cwhether the fact that [the] defendant\u2019s employees had viewed a portion of the tape before turning it over to the police somehow eliminated [the] defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected privacy interest in its contents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 624. We concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">\u201cthe mere fact that a private third party has knowledge of the contents of something in which a defendant claims a privacy interest \u2014 even if that party conveys the information to the police \u2014 does not mean that a defendant no longer has \u2018the right to be free from intrusive forms of government scrutiny.\u2019 <em>State v. </em>Dixson/Digby, 307 Or 195, 208, 766 P2d 1015 (1988). Article I, section 9, does not countenance such a result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">That same conclusion results in this case. The fact that Wells observed some of the content of defendant\u2019s hard drive does not change the personal nature of that information or defendant\u2019s rights to safeguard that information from governmental scrutiny. The CD containing defendant\u2019s files was, in effect, a closed container. The requirement to obtain a search warrant before opening and examining the contents of the container was not excused just because the state had some evidence of its contents, in much the same way that the videotape in <em>Luman </em>was a \u201cclosed container that did not announce its contents and in which defendant retained a privacy interest when it was in the lawful possession of the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Fourth, defendant\u2019s privacy rights in the information stored in his personal computer is retained even if the information is copied and stored on a medium owned by someone else. It makes little practical sense to distinguish between newly created computer files and copied files in assessing privacy rights in those files. As Professor Kerr has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-4\">\u201cAll computer data is a copy. Computer hard drives work by generating copies; accessing a file on a hard drive actually generates a copy of the file to be sent to the computer\u2019s central processor. More broadly, computers work by copying and recopying information from one section of the machine to another. From a technical perspective, it usually makes no sense to speak of having an \u2018original\u2019 set of data. Given this, it would be troublesome and artificial to treat copies as different from originals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Kerr, 119 Harv L Rev at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Further, it is helpful to take note that, in the context of the Fourth Amendment, the United States Supreme Court has recognized a person\u2019s privacy interest in copies of personal information. <em>See Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United States, </em>506 US 9, 13, 113 S Ct 447, 121 L Ed 2d 313 (1992). In <em>Church of Scientology of Cal., </em>the Court decided that an appeal of a district court order requiring the delivery of copies of taped attorney-client conversations to the IRS was not moot even though the copies of the tapes had already been delivered. <em>Id. </em>at 10-13. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">\u201cTaxpayers have an obvious possessory interest in their records. When the Government has obtained such materials as a result of an unlawful summons, that interest is violated and a court can effectuate relief by ordering the Government to return the records. <em>Moreover, even if the Government retains only copies of the disputed materials, a taxpayer still suffers injury by the Government\u2019s continued possession of those materials, namely, the affront to the taxpayer\u2019s privacy. A person\u2019s interest in maintaining the privacy of his \u2018papers and effects\u2019 is of sufficient importance to merit constitutional protection.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 13 (footnote omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>If a person makes copies of computer files and stores them on a flash drive, the protection provided by Article I, section 9, against government scrutiny of that information should not dissipate merely because of the <em>form </em>of the information. Under the same logic, defendant\u2019s privacy rights in the contents of his computer hard drive are not lost because those contents are copied and portions of the information are copied again and stored in another storage device.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Nor are a person\u2019s privacy rights in electronically stored personal information lost because that data is retained in a medium owned by another. Again, in a practical sense, our social norms are evolving away from the storage of personal data on computer hard drives to retention of that information in the \u201ccloud,\u201d on servers owned by internet service providers.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That information can then be generated and accessed by hand-carried personal computing devices. I suspect that most citizens would regard that data as no less confidential or private because it was stored on a server owned by someone else.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Indeed, our case law has rejected a crabbed view that limits the protections of Article I, section 9, to the physical space owned or controlled by a person. The constitutional provision protects more than an interest against physical trespass, assault, or confinement by the government. Under Article I, section 9, <em>\u201ca </em>person\u2019s right to be free from unreasonable searches extends to those places and things in which the person has a \u2018privacy interest,\u2019 even when there is no physical or sensory invasion into the person\u2019s own possessions or space.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>340 Or 319, 336, 131 P3d 173, <em>cert den, </em>549 US 1079 (2006). As held in <em>Campbell, </em>\u201cthe notion that the interests protected against government searches by Article I, section 9, are limited to interests in certain \u2018protected premises\u2019 is unsustainable given this court\u2019s repeated recognition of privacy as the principal interest protected against unlawful searches.\u201d 306 Or at 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Our precedents suggest that the existence of a protected privacy interest in private information is not determined by ownership of the storage medium for that information. In <em>Johnson, </em>the issue was whether a person had a protected privacy interest in records of cell phone usage maintained by a cellular telephone service provider. The court recognized that the \u201c[defendant clearly had a cognizable privacy interest in the <em>content </em>of his telephone calls * * * [but not a privacy] interest in keeping private any records * * * respecting his cellular telephone usage.\u201d 340 Or at 336 (emphasis in original). The existence or not of a protected privacy interest was not determined by who owned the servers and other devices on which the information was stored. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Rather, a privacy interest was found not to exist in that case because the usage records were \u201cgenerated and maintained * * * from the provider\u2019s own equipment and for the provider\u2019s own, separate and legitimate business purposes (such as billing).\u201d <em>Id. </em>By contrast, a privacy interest in the content of the telephone calls, information generated by the defendant, was inferred because of statutory requirements for a warrant to intercept telephonic communications. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">In much the same way, we concluded that a defendant did not have a privacy interest in subscriber information in possession of an internet service provider in <em>State v. Delp, </em>218 Or App 17, 178 P3d 259, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 317 (2008). Again, the question was not resolved on the basis of whether that information was stored on a medium owned by the service provider, but rather the lack of \u201cany source of law that establishes that [the defendant] has some interest in keeping private the noncontent information that is held by a third party regarding his Internet usage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26-27 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Because of the different nature of the privacy interests protected under the federal and state constitutions, consideration of analogous Fourth Amendment cases is helpful but not instructive. In that area of law as well, the ownership of the storage medium does not determine whether a privacy interest exists in the stored data. For example, in <em>Quon v. Arch Wireless Operating Co., Inc., </em>529 F3d 892, 904 (9th Cir 2008), <em>retig den, </em>554 F3d 769 (2009), the Ninth Circuit held that users of text messaging services have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the content of their <em>text </em>messages stored on their service provider\u2019s network. In <em>Quon, </em>the service provider had archived copies of the text messages received by its server. <em>Id. </em>at 896. The Ninth Circuit concluded that it was irrelevant that the service provider may have been able to access the contents of the messages for its own purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 905. Rather, it was relevant that the users of the service \u201cdid not expect that [the service provider] would monitor their text messages, much less turn over the messages to third parties without [the users\u2019] consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 906.1 would hold, then, that defendant had a privacy right under Article I, section 9, in his computer files that were copied and stored on the Wells CD.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Finally, I would conclude that the police examination of the CD was a search under Article I, section 9.1 do not view this case, as the majority does, merely as one where <em>\u201ca </em>third person acquires private information and then delivers that information to the police.\u201d 231 Or App at 88-89 n 5. This is not a case of a private search revealing contraband and turning that evidence over to the police. If Wells, acting on his own, had opened defendant\u2019s computer files and printed the images stored in those files and gave the prints to the police, the analysis would be different. In that case, the police would take no steps to uncover the data and make the images available for inspection. The police would have not undertaken a search, and their conduct would require no justification under Article I, section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Instead, Wells gave police the CD, a container that held data in which defendant had a privacy interest. The contents of the CD were examined by the police in order to determine their relevance as proof of criminal activity. The evidence sought to be suppressed was images produced when governmental agents opened that container and subjected its contents, defendant\u2019s data, to scrutiny and manipulation. That examination of the contents of the Wells CD constituted a search under Article I, section 9, because it exposed those contents, in which defendant retained a privacy interest, to governmental review.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Again, analogy to Fourth Amendment case law is helpful. In <em>U. S. v. Crist, </em>627 F Supp 2d 575, 585 (MD Pa 2008), a federal district court concluded that a forensic examination of the contents of a computer lawfully obtained by police was a \u201csearch\u201d under the Fourth Amendment. In <em>Crist, </em>the government was given the defendant\u2019s computer by a third party who had discovered a folder on it containing child pornography. <em>Id. </em>at 577. The government then conducted a warrantless forensic examination of the computer, which included making an exact copy of the hard drive and running a hash value and signature analysis on that copy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 578-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>The defendant moved to suppress evidence recovered from his computer during that examination. <em>Id. </em>at 576. Among its arguments in response to the defendant\u2019s motion, the government contended that, under the Fourth Amendment, no search occurred during the forensic examination of the defendant\u2019s computer because the governmental agents \u201cdidn\u2019t look at any files, they simply accessed the computer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585 (internal quotations marks omitted). The district court, however, concluded: \u201cBy subjecting the entire computer to a hash value analysis \u2014 every file, internet history, picture, and \u201cbuddy list\u2019 became available for Government review. Such examination constitutes a search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>I would come to the same conclusion under Article I, section 9, with respect to the examination of the data on the Wells CD through a search program.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Thus, I would conclude that defendant had a recognized privacy interest in the information stored on his personal computer. ORS 164.377. That information was not generated or maintained by Wells or any third party. Article I, section 9, protects both any possessory interest in the CD from unreasonable seizure and any privacy interest in the data embedded in the CD from unreasonable search. <em>Owens, </em>302 Or at 206. Defendant\u2019s privacy interest in that data does not change even if that data was copied, transferred, or manipulated, or stored on a medium owned by another, so long as the information was not abandoned or exposed to the public. The use of mechanical means to inspect that data was a search that required a warrant under Article I, section 9. Consequently, I would hold that the trial court erred in denying, in part, defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of the warrantless viewing of the files on the Wells CD.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-8\"> Defendant does not concede that the images found on his computer are child pornography.
