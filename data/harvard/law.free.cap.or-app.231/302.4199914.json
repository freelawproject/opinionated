J.</author>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Defendant was convicted, following a jury trial, of recklessly endangering another person. ORS 163.195. That statute provides that \u201c[a] person commits the crime of recklessly endangering another person if the person recklessly engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of serious physical injury to another person.\u201d On appeal, defendant\u2019s sole assignment of error is that the court impermissibly commented on the evidence in violation of ORCP 59 E when it instructed the jury that \u201c[djriving under the influence of intoxicants is, itself, evidence that a person created a substantial risk of physical injury to passengers.\u201d We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. Oregon State Police Troopers Webster and Adams were riding in their patrol car along Lancaster Drive in Salem when a car driven by defendant pulled out in front of them, requiring Webster, who was driving, to \u201cbrake hard in order to avoid hitting\u201d it. Webster turned on his emergency lights and initiated a traffic stop. Defendant had three passengers in her car at the time \u2014 two other adults and defendant\u2019s young child, who was in a car seat. Webster observed that defendant had a dazed appearance and glassy eyes, and he noted an order of alcohol coming from the car. When Webster asked her if she had had anything to drink, defendant said she had drunk a beer. Adams administered field sobriety tests, during which defendant demonstrated several \u201cclues\u201d of intoxication. He then arrested defendant, and the troopers took her to the jail. At the jail, defendant took a breath test, which showed that her blood alcohol content was .08 percent. Based on those events, defendant was charged with driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII), ORS 813.010, and recklessly endangering another person, ORS 163.195.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Defendant pleaded guilty to DUII and entered diversion on that charge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At trial on the reckless endangerment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>charge, Webster and Adams testified to the events described above. They each also offered testimony as to the dangers of driving under the influence of intoxicants. Evidence of defendant\u2019s diversion petition, which included her admission that she was driving under the influence of intoxicants, was also admitted at trial. During closing arguments, defense counsel acknowledged that defendant had driven under the influence of intoxicants, but argued that the evidence was insufficient to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant\u2019s conduct rose to the level of recklessly endangering another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury, over her objection, that \u201c[d]riving under the influence of intoxicants is, itself, evidence that a person created a substantial risk of physical injury to passengers.\u201d We agree with defendant that the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\"> ORCP 59 E, made applicable in criminal cases by ORS 136.330(1), provides that, \u201c[t]he judge shall not instruct with respect to matters of fact, nor comment thereon.\u201d As the Supreme Court explained in <em>State v. Hayward, </em>327 Or 397, 410-11, 963 P2d 667 (1998), \u201c[a] court impermissibly comments on the evidence when it gives a jury instruction that tells the jury how specific evidence relates to a particular legal issue.\u201d We review whether a jury instruction is a comment on the evidence for legal error. <em>State v. Blanchard, </em>165 Or App 127, 130, 995 P2d 1200, <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 429 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Defendant argues that the instruction here was \u201creversible error, because it conveyed an impermissible comment on the evidence that may have led the jury to believe that it could convict defendant on a lesser degree of proof than was required.\u201d In defendant\u2019s view, the instruction runs afoul of ORCP 59 E because it \u201cspecifically highlighted defendant\u2019s act of DUII\u201d and \u201cexplained to the jury how that evidence applied to a particular element of the reckless endangerment charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Defendant relies on <em>State v. Poole, </em>175 Or App 258, 29 P3d 643 (2001), as support for her position. In <em>Poole, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>defendant was charged with assaulting a public safety officer and fourth-degree assault, both of which required proof of physical injury. The relevant statute defined \u201cphysical injury\u201d to mean \u201c \u2018impairment of physical condition or substantial pain.\u2019 <em>\u201d Id. </em>at 261 (quoting ORS 161.015(7) (emphasis omitted)). Relying on <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Greenwood, </em>107 Or App 678, 682, 813 P2d 58 (1991), in which we had determined, on <em>de novo </em>review of a juvenile court adjudication, that pain lasting an hour was sufficient to constitute substantial pain, the trial court instructed the jury that \u201c \u2018Oregon law provides that pain that lasts an hour constitutes substantial pain.\u2019 \u201d <em>Poole, </em>175 Or App at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The defendant challenged that instruction as violating ORCP 59 E; the state responded that the instruction was proper, because it did not require the jury to find as fact that the victim had suffered pain for more than an hour, but, instead \u201cmerely described the legal effect of that fact, should the jury find it to be true.\u201d <em>Poole, </em>175 Or App at 262. We rejected that argument, reasoning that, \u201c[e]ven though the instruction did not require the jury to find that [the victim] suffered pain for an hour, it told the jury that, if it so found, it should infer that the victim suffered physical injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the instruction thus \u201ctold the jury <em>how </em>[the victim\u2019s] testimony that he suffered pain for an hour related to whether he suffered physical injury,\u201d a necessary factual element of the crimes, it was an impermissible comment on the evidence under <em>Hayward. Poole, </em>175 Or App at 263 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">In defendant\u2019s view, the present case is directly analogous. According to defendant, although, as in <em>Poole, </em>evidence that defendant committed DUII was, if believed by the jury, <em>sufficient </em>to support a conviction for reckless endangerment, <em>see State v. Mojarro-Sandoval, </em>208 Or App 178, 183, 144 P3d 996, <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 117 (2006) (so stating), the trial court nonetheless erred in giving the instruction because it \u201cspecifically highlighted] to the jury that such evidence related to the question * * * whether defendant created a substantial risk of serious physical injury.\u201d In other words, defendant argues, the court improperly instructed the jury as to the probative value of defendant\u2019s DUII conduct as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>applied to the jury\u2019s resolution of the reckless endangerment charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">The state responds that <em>Poole </em>is distinguishable because, in the present case, the instruction \u201cdid not tell the jury that it <em>had </em>to find or infer anything from [the] evidence,\u201d but, \u201c[r]ather, the instruction merely informed the jury that, if it found that defendant had driven under the influence of intoxicants, it was permitted to then consider that evidence in determining whether defendant had created a substantial risk of injury to passengers.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">In the state\u2019s view, the case is thus more like <em>Blanchard. In Blanchard, </em>the defendant appealed his conviction for DUII, arguing that the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury regarding his refusal to submit to a breath test was an impermissible comment on the evidence because it \u201cdirected] the jury to infer from the fact that defendant refused the test that he was under the influence of intoxicants.\u201d 165 Or App at 130. The instruction at issue stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">\u201c \u2018If you find that the defendant refused to submit to a chemical test of his breath, after being advised of his rights and the consequences of his refusal, you may consider his refusal to submit to the breath test in determining whether he was under the influence of intoxicants. You may give his refusal to submit to the breath test such weight as you feel is appropriate in reaching your verdict.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 130-31. We concluded that the trial court did not err, because,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">\u201c[w]hile the instruction did direct the jury to the particular issue to which this evidence was relevant, the instruction was neutral. It did not direct the jury to draw any particular inference that could be drawn from defendant\u2019s refusal or tell the jury, in any way, <em>how </em>the evidence of defendant\u2019s refusal related to the question of his intoxication. <em>State v. Lunow, </em>131 Or App 429, 433, 885 P2d 731 (1994). The jury was told only that it was to give the refusal \u2018such weight as you feel is appropriate in reaching your verdict.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-9\"><em>Blanchard, </em>165 Or App at 131-32 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">The state argues that the same is true of the instruction in the present case, focusing on the instruction\u2019s use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the word \u201cevidence.\u201d In the state\u2019s view, because the jury was instructed that driving under the influence of intoxicants is \u201cevidence\u201d that a person created a substantial risk of physical injury to another, the jury was not required to draw a particular inference about the evidence, and, thus, as in <em>Blanchard, </em>the instruction is permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">We are not persuaded by the state\u2019s argument. As an initial matter, we disagree with the state\u2019s reading of <em>Blanchard </em>that anything short of an instruction directing the jury to draw a particular inference is necessarily permissible. Rather, the dispositive point in <em>Blanchard </em>was that the instruction was neutral \u2014 that is, it did not direct the jury to draw a particular inference from the evidence, <em>nor </em>did it \u201ctell the jury, <em>in any way, how </em>the evidence of defendant\u2019s refusal related to the question of his intoxication.\u201d 165 Or App at 131 (emphasis on \u201chow\u201d in original; other emphasis added). Thus, even though \u201c[t]he instruction told the jury which issue the evidence applied to,\u201d it did not violate ORCP 59 E because it \u201cwas neutral as to the inference, if any, that could be drawn from that evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The same cannot be said here. First, the state\u2019s argument does not account for the complete phrasing of the court\u2019s <em>instruction </em>\u2014 viz., that \u201c[d]riving under the influence of intoxicants <em>is, itself, </em>evidence that a person created a substantial risk of physical injury to passengers.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The use of the phrase \u201cis, itself\u2019 suggested to the jury that the latter flows inevitably from the former. In other words, the instruction implied to the jury that, if they found that defendant had driven under the influence of intoxicants, then it followed that she had also created a substantial risk of serious physical injury to her passengers. Unlike in <em>Blanchard, </em>the court here did not couch its instruction in permissive <em>terms </em>\u2014 \u201cif you find x, then you <em>may consider </em>x in determining y.\u201d <em>See also Hayward, </em>327 Or at 411 (upholding instruction reminding the jury that, if the state proved that the defendant acted with a criminal intent, it was \u201cpossible\u201d for it to find that the defendant had one or more other coexisting intents). Thus, even if, as the state contends, the instruction cannot be read as a mandate to the jury to conclude from the DUII evidence that defendant created a substantial risk of serious physical injury to her passengers, at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>minimum, it suggested to the jury that that was an appropriate inference to be drawn. In that sense, the instruction was not \u201cneutral as to the inference, if any, that could be drawn.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">In sum, whether defendant created a substantial risk of serious physical injury to another person is a factual element of the offense of reckless endangerment that the jury was required to decide. Because the disputed instruction explained to the jury <em>how </em>evidence \u2014 defendant\u2019s act of driving under the influence of intoxicants \u2014 related to a specific legal issue \u2014 whether that factual element was proved beyond a reasonable doubt-the instruction was an improper comment on the evidence. <em>See Hayward, </em>327 Or at 410-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The state also argues that no reversible error occurred because, considering the instructions in their totality, defendant was not prejudiced. <em>State v. Pratt, </em>316 Or 561, 576, 853 P2d 827, <em>cert den, </em>510 US 969 (1993) (\u201cFor an instruction to constitute reversible error, it must have prejudiced the defendant when the instructions are considered as a whole.\u201d (Internal quotations omitted.)). In the state\u2019s view, defendant was not prejudiced by the challenged instruction because the trial court also instructed the jury, <em>inter alia, </em>that the state was required to prove the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt; that the jury was not to \u201cplace undue emphasis on one particular instruction, but rather view them as a whole\u201d; and that it could \u201cdraw inferences and reach conclusions from the evidence if your inferences and conclusions are reasonable and are based on your common sense and experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">We disagree. Despite evidence of defendant\u2019s driving while under the influence of intoxicants, the jury <em>could </em>have concluded that the state did not satisfy its burden of proving that that conduct created a substantial risk of serious physical injury to defendant\u2019s passengers or others under the circumstances of the case. The challenged jury instruction suggested to the jury that that possibility was foreclosed. We do not see how the other instructions and caveats to the jury could overcome that improper suggestion. As the state correctly points out, we presume that juries follow the court\u2019s instructions. <em>State v. Thompson, </em>328 Or 248, 271, 971 P2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>879, <em>cert den, </em>527 US 1042 (1999). However, in this case, if the jury was misled by the disputed instruction into believing that, if it found that defendant drove under the influence of intoxicants, then it followed that the \u201ccreat[ion of] a substantial risk of serious physical injury\u201d element of the crime charged was also established, then the jury could have properly followed all of the court\u2019s instructions in reaching its verdict, and, still, the verdict would be tainted by the error. And, as in <em>Poole, </em>\u201cnothing in the record, including the other instructions given, suggests that the jury was not so misled.\u201d 175 Or App at 264. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-7\"> Defendant\u2019s diversion agreement was later revoked on the basis that she had violated the terms of diversion, and a judgment of conviction for DUII was entered. In her notice of appeal and statement of the case, defendant purports to also appeal from that judgment; however, she advances no assignment of error or argument pertaining to that conviction, nor does she explain why she is entitled to an appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>given that the conviction was based on her guilty plea. <em>See </em>ORS 138.050 (limiting the circumstances under which a defendant who has pleaded guilty or no contest may appeal a criminal judgment). Accordingly, we do not consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
