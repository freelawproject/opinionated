The relevant facts are undisputed. Whether those facts justify the trial court\u2019s decision presents a question of law that we review for legal error. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993). We conclude that the court erred in suppressing the test results. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Defendant was arrested in connection with a domestic disturbance. During the investigation related to that arrest, Officer Richards developed probable cause to believe that defendant had been driving under the influence of alcohol. Richards took him to the police station and, with defendant\u2019s consent, conducted field sobriety tests and a breath test using an instrument called the Intoxilyzer 8000. According to ORS 813.160, a police officer must have a valid permit in order to administer a breath test.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further, the Department of State Police has promulgated a rule specifying that \u201c[o]nly operators who possess both a valid permit and PIN will be authorized to conduct a[n] [Intoxilyzer 8000] test sequence.\u201d OAR 257-030-0130(4)(a). Richards had been trained and certified to use the Intoxilyzer 8000 a few days before he arrested defendant, and, as a result, he had qualified for a permit and had chosen a PIN. However, that information had not yet been entered into the statewide data system, and Richards had not yet received the actual documentation in the mail. Thus, the Intoxilyzer 8000 did not recognize Richards\u2019s PIN, and he was unable to start the machine to conduct the test. In accordance with the training he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>received, he borrowed a fellow officer\u2019s PIN and used it to administer the test. Consequently, Richards\u2019s name did not appear on the Intoxilyzer result card.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">During the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the court ruled (and defendant conceded) that the officer had had probable cause, and consent, to conduct the Intoxilyzer test. Regarding the result of the test itself, defendant argued that it was invalid and therefore subject to suppression because Richards did not have a valid permit and PIN, contrary to the requirements of ORS 813.160 and OAR 257-030-0130(4)(a). The state responded that, when Richards administered the test, he \u201cpossessed\u201d a valid permit and PIN, despite the fact that the information had not been entered into the state\u2019s data system. Further, the state argued, the permit and PIN requirements were merely administrative and did not relate to the reliability of the test and, for that reason, failure to conform to them did not justify suppression of the test result. The court ruled against the state based entirely on its conclusion that Richards did not possess a valid permit and PIN:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">\u201cWhat the law says is only operators who possess both a valid permit and PIN will be authorized to conduct a test. This particular officer did not possess both a valid permit and PIN. That is plain language; it can\u2019t be any plainer than that. And the question is whether or not the court\u2019s going to follow the plain language or whether I\u2019m going to read something else into it that says, \u2018We don\u2019t really mean what we\u2019re saying in this law.\u2019 Because it\u2019s plain to me what the language says. If this court or the Court of Appeals or somebody else chooses to say, Well, we don\u2019t really mean that,\u2019 then they can make that decision. But the law to me seems very clear. It says, \u2018Only operators who possess both a valid permit and PIN will be authorized to conduct the test.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The court issued an order suppressing the result of the breath test, and this appeal ensued. <em>See </em>ORS 138.060(l)(c) (authorizing state\u2019s appeal from an order suppressing evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">We agree with the state that the premise on which the trial court relied \u2014 that Richards did not \u201cpossess both a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>valid permit and PIN\u201d \u2014 is not correct. The undisputed evidence establishes that Richards successfully completed his training on the Intoxilyzer 8000 on April 17, five days before he used that machine to test defendant\u2019s breath. Richards testified that, at that point, the Department of State Police issued him a permit. That testimony is in accord with OAR 257-030-0090(2): \u201cUpon completion of the course of instruction, a written examination will be given and a passing grade of 80 percent or above will be required. Each officer or technician obtaining a passing grade will be issued a permit[.]\u201d Indeed, Richards brought his permit to the suppression hearing, and it indicated that the date of issuance was April 17. Further, Richards testified that he had selected a PIN. Again, the relevant rule supports that assertion: \u201cUpon issuance of a permit to operate * * * the operator shall select a Personal Identification Numberf.]\u201d OAR 257-030-0160(3). It is true that, when he tested defendant, Richards had received neither the document attesting to his successful completion of the training nor a tangible record of his PIN. Those facts, however, would mean that he did not \u201cpossess\u201d the necessary certification or identification only if we were to read \u201cpossess\u201d to mean \u201chave in his physical possession.\u201d Defendant suggests no reason why we should adopt such a narrow definition of the term, nor can we think of any. One can, for example, \u201cpossess\u201d a license to practice law without carrying any physical document indicating that status. One \u201cpossesses\u201d real or personal property without carrying it on one\u2019s person. Indeed, the first nonobsolete definition of \u201cpossess\u201d in <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1770 (unabridged ed 2002) is: \u201cto have and hold as property: have a just right to : be master of.\u201d If we were to adopt defendant\u2019s definition, police officers would have to carry their Intoxilyzer permits and PINs with them whenever they administered a breath test. Nothing suggests that the Department of State Police could have had that result in mind when it promulgated OAR 257-030-0130(4)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">As noted above, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress based entirely on the conclusion that Richards did not possess a valid permit or PIN. On appeal, defendant appears to suggest another basis for suppression, which we address because it could arise on remand: that, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>entering another officer\u2019s PIN, Richards failed to comply with the testing procedure established by OAR 257-030-0130(4): \u201cThe operator <em>shall </em>enter into the instrument a permit and Personal Identification Number (PIN) * * * for the purpose of: (1) identifying the operator conducting the test, and (2) establishing that the operator possesses a valid operator permit and PIN combination.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We have held, however, that an error in administering a breath test justifies suppression only if the error is likely to affect the accuracy of the result. <em>State v. Galli, </em>125 Or App 218, 220, 865 P2d 361 (1993); <em>State v. Hemkin, </em>102 Or App 79, 82, 792 P2d 483 (1990). We recognize that, in some circumstances, an officer\u2019s failure to enter his own permit and PIN could detract from the reliability of the test \u2014 for instance, if the officer did not actually have a permit or PIN because he or she had not been trained on the machinery. This case does not present such a situation. The fact that Richards, a certified operator of the Intoxilyzer 8000, used another officer\u2019s PIN, did not affect in any way the accuracy of the test result.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-6\"> ORS 813.160 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">\u201c(1) A chemical analysis is valid under ORS 813.300 if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">\u201c(b) It is an analysis of a person\u2019s breath and is performed by an individual possessing a valid permit to perform chemical analyses issued by the Department of State Police and is performed according to methods approved by the Department of State Police.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
