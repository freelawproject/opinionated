ORS 811.182. He makes two assignments of error on appeal. In the first, he assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence of his identity and the fact that his driver\u2019s license had been revoked, arguing that the arresting officer learned that information as a result of illegally stopping defendant without reasonable suspicion. In his second assignment of error, which defendant concedes is unpreserved, he argues that the charging instrument did not allege facts sufficient to establish the crime of misdemeanor driving while revoked. We reject defendant\u2019s second assignment of error without discussion. With respect to the first assignment of error, we conclude that the trial court erred in ruling that a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s circumstances would not have believed that he or she had been stopped. Because the court did not address whether defendant subjectively believed that his liberty had been restrained, we remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Because defendant was convicted, we view the facts in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Cervantes, </em>319 Or 121, 125, 873 P2d 316 (1994). Deputy Gerba of the Washington County Sheriffs Department was in his patrol car, observing an adult bookstore that had been the subject of three recent armed robberies. He went inside the store to conduct a security check. While in the store, he saw defendant and his girlfriend. Both of them looked young to Gerba, so he asked them how old they were. Gerba did not suspect them of any wrongdoing, but he was concerned that the store owner could have been violating ORS 167.065, which prohibits furnishing obscene materials to minors. Defendant told Gerba that he was 22. Gerba asked him if he had any identification. Both defendant and his girlfriend produced their identification. Gerba took the cards and called dispatch with the identification numbers on them. Gerba testified that he called dispatch with the information in order to ensure that the identification cards were genuine. He explained, \u201cWhen somebody has a fake ID, if we run it, it comes back unable to locate.\u201d After calling the information to dispatch, he returned the cards, said, \u201cHave a good day,\u201d and left the store. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>had retained the identification cards for a total of 10 to 15 seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">As he was leaving, dispatch called back and informed Gerba that defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license had been suspended. Gerba thought nothing of that fact at the time. He went back to his patrol car and continued to observe the store in connection with its security issues. A few minutes later, he saw defendant and his girlfriend leave the store and drive away. Defendant was driving. Gerba pulled them over and arrested defendant for driving while suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Although dispatch told Gerba that defendant\u2019s license had been suspended, it had actually been revoked, so defendant was charged with driving while revoked. Before trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress all evidence that was the product of his encounter with Gerba in the store. He argued that, by calling his identification information in to dispatch in his presence, Gerba had stopped him. Defendant argued that his case was analogous to <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 115 P3d 908 (2005), in which the Supreme Court held that the defendant was stopped when a police officer asked for his identification and then requested a warrant check in his presence. Because Gerba lacked reasonable suspicion that defendant was involved in any criminal activity, defendant contended that the stop was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The trial court denied the motion to suppress. It stated, \u201cI accept the deputy\u2019s testimony that he wasn\u2019t investigating this defendant for any wrongdoing. He was investigating whether the store was violating the statute [prohibiting furnishing obscene materials to minors]. So actually, he was investigating whether this gentleman, the defendant, was a victim of a crime.\u201d In the court\u2019s view, a crime victim \u201cwould think they would do some sort of investigation to see if you were a victim * * The court stated that, in an analogous case in which the person was suspected of a crime, it would \u201cprobably say it\u2019s an invalid stop,\u201d but, because the encounter was a \u201cminim[al] intervention to see if [defendant was] a victim,\u201d the analysis in <em>Hall </em>did not apply. It therefore concluded that Gerba had not stopped defendant, and it denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Defendant waived the right to a jury trial, and he agreed that the court could consider, for trial purposes, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>evidence presented in the suppression hearing. In addition to that evidence, the state offered, and the court admitted, certified records from Driver and Motor Vehicle Services showing that defendant\u2019s license had indeed been revoked. The court then convicted defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">On appeal, defendant renews his contention that Gerba stopped him without reasonable suspicion and learned his identity and that his license had been revoked only as a result of the stop. In response, the state first argues that defendant\u2019s interaction with Gerba did not amount to a stop. The state notes that, unlike in cases such as <em>Hall, </em>in which the police ran a warrant check in the defendant\u2019s presence, here, Gerba \u201cmerely called in the ID number to check if it was valid \u2014 not to determine if defendant was a wanted criminal \u2014 and promptly gave defendant back his ID\u201d and ended the encounter. In the state\u2019s view, Gerba did not intentionally and significantly interfere with defendant\u2019s liberty of movement, and a reasonable person would not have believed that he had. The state goes on to argue that, even if defendant was stopped, the evidence that he seeks to suppress was not a product of the stop. In support of that argument, the state contends that (1) defendant failed to show a \u201cminimal factual nexus\u201d between the stop and the evidence that he seeks to suppress; (2) the evidence was available from an independent source; and (3) the connection between the stop and the evidence is so attenuated that the stop cannot properly be viewed as the source of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The first question before us is whether Gerba stopped defendant. To be lawful, a stop must be justified by reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. <em>State v. Toevs, </em>327 Or 525, 534, 964 P2d 1007 (1998). It is undisputed that Gerba did not suspect that defendant was involved in criminal activity. Thus, if Gerba stopped defendant, the stop constituted an unlawful seizure. For purposes of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, a stop occurs \u201c(a) if a law enforcement officer intentionally and significantly restricts, interferes with, or otherwise deprives an individual of that individual\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement; or (b) whenever an individual believes that (a), above, has occurred and such belief is objectively reasonable in the circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Holmes, </em>311 Or 400, 409-10, 813 P2d 28 (1991). Police conduct interfering with a person\u2019s liberty of movement may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>take the form of either physical force or a show of authority. <em>State v. Juarez-Godinez, </em>326 Or 1, 6, 942 P2d 772 (1997). A show of authority effects a stop if it leads the person to subjectively believe that he or she is not free to leave and that belief is objectively reasonable. <em>State v. Ruiz, </em>196 Or App 324, 327, 101 P3d 824 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 363 (2005). Determining whether a stop has occurred requires a \u201cfact-specific inquiry into the totality of the circumstances of the particular case.\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>311 Or at 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">As noted, the trial court concluded that a reasonable person would not view a brief detention to determine whether he or she is a crime victim as a significant intrusion on his or her liberty. Under the circumstances here, however, a reasonable person would not necessarily have believed that he or she was regarded solely as a potential victim. That is, even if a reasonable person would have understood that Gerba\u2019s initial concern was that the store owner may have been furnishing obscene materials to minors, such a person could have believed that Gerba was also investigating whether defendant and his girlfriend had given him false identification or whether there were any outstanding warrants for their arrest. There would seem to be no reason for Gerba to call dispatch with the ID numbers other than to determine the authenticity of the cards or to conduct a warrant check. Although Gerba\u2019s subsequent actions demonstrated that he was not going to require defendant and his girlfriend to wait for the results of that inquiry to dispatch, until he told them \u201cHave a nice day\u201d and walked away, a reasonable person in the same circumstances could have believed that he or she was not free to leave. Thus, although the encounter was brief, a reasonable person could have viewed it as a stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The question remains whether defendant subjectively believed that he was not free to leave. The trial court did not make a finding on that issue. It follows that we must remand for such a determination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>The state argues that we need not remand, contending that, even if Gerba stopped defendant, the evidence that defendant seeks to suppress is not a product of the stop. For purposes of analyzing that argument, the encounter is presumed to have been a stop, and this opinion refers to it as such, with the understanding that, depending on the trial court\u2019s findings on remand, it may not actually have been a seizure within the meaning of Article I, section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"> For evidence to be suppressed as a product of police illegality, a defendant must establish \u201ca minimal factual nexus \u2014 that is, at minimum, the existence of a \u2018but for\u2019 relationship \u2014 between the evidence sought to be suppressed and prior unlawful police conduct * * <em>Hall, </em>339 Or at 25. If the defendant succeeds, the state may nevertheless show that the evidence is admissible by proving that it did not derive from the police illegality.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">\u201cTo make that showing, the state must prove that either (1) the police inevitably would have obtained the disputed evidence through lawful procedures even without the violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9; (2) the police obtained the disputed evidence independently of the violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9; or (3) the preceding violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9, has such a tenuous factual link to the disputed evidence that that unlawful police conduct cannot be viewed properly as the source of that evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-8\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">As noted above, the state first contends that defendant failed to establish a factual nexus between the stop and the evidence. According to the state, assuming \u2014 as defendant argues \u2014 that the stop began at the moment that Gerba called defendant\u2019s identification number to dispatch, the officer already had the information that enabled him to determine that defendant\u2019s driving privileges were revoked \u2014 namely, defendant\u2019s name and ID number. Thus, in the state\u2019s view, Gerba did not obtain any evidence as a result of the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>The state is correct with respect to evidence of defendant\u2019s identity. Defendant voluntarily produced his ID card and gave it to Gerba before the stop began. Whether Gerba actually read the information on the ID card before calling it in is irrelevant. Gerba may have internalized the information simultaneously with the commencement of the stop, but he did not obtain it as a result of the stop. Therefore, that evidence of defendant\u2019s identity is not subject to suppression.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The state is incorrect, however, with respect to the evidence that came to light after the stop began. Even though defendant gave Gerba the ID card before Gerba called the information in, but for the act of calling it in \u2014 the very act that effected the stop \u2014 Gerba would not have known that defendant\u2019s license had been revoked. The call to dispatch is an essential factual link between Gerba\u2019s obtaining defendant\u2019s name and ID number and his discovery that defendant\u2019s license had been revoked. But for that discovery, Gerba would not have known that defendant was driving illegally when he left the store. It follows that he also would not have arrested defendant and that the state would not have obtained the DMV records that were taken into evidence at defendant\u2019s trial. In other words, but for the stop, none of the evidence (other than defendant\u2019s identity) would have come to light. Therefore, defendant established the necessary factual nexus between the stop and the evidence obtained after the stop began.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>The state next argues that that evidence did not derive from the stop, because it was available from an independent source \u2014 again, because Gerba already had obtained defendant\u2019s name and ID number before the stop began. The state essentially recasts its \u201cfactual nexus\u201d argument as an \u201cindependent source\u201d argument. The state\u2019s argument remains unpersuasive. Although Gerba obtained defendant\u2019s name and ID number before the stop began, his discovery of the fact that defendant\u2019s license had been revoked did not flow from that information independently of the stop. The \u201cindependent source\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule applies when the police <em>\u201cdid in fact </em>acquire certain evidence by reliance upon an untainted sourcef.]\u201d Wayne R. LaFave, 5 <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 11.4(a), 241 (3d ed 1996) (emphasis added). Thus, the fact that the evidence in question was available from an independent source \u2014 because Gerba <em>could have </em>conducted the same records check without stopping defendant \u2014 is irrelevant. Again, but for the stop, defendant\u2019s name and ID number would not have led to Gerba\u2019s discovery of the fact that defendant\u2019s license had been revoked or his awareness that defendant was driving illegally. Evidence of those facts thus cannot be said to be independent of the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">The state finally argues that the connection between the stop and the evidence in question is so attenuated that the stop cannot properly be viewed as the source of the evidence. The state asserts that Gerba\u2019s knowledge that defendant\u2019s license had been revoked had no evidentiary significance before Gerba saw defendant get into a car and drive away. In the state\u2019s view, only that intervening act by defendant \u201ctransformed that inconsequential piece of information into evidence of a crime.\u201d The state contends that the facts here are analogous to the discovery of an outstanding arrest warrant for the defendant, which operates to attenuate the taint of prior illegal police conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The state does not explain why evidence obtained by illegal police conduct is attenuated from that conduct merely because the police are not aware of its evidentiary significance when they obtain it. Although the stop by itself did not produce sufficient information to prompt Gerba to arrest defendant, the information that the stop <em>did </em>produce was an essential factor in his decision to arrest defendant. Thus, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>cannot be said that the stop was not the source of the evidence that defendant was driving while revoked. <em>See Hall, </em>339 Or at 25 (evidence is not subject to suppression if \u201cthe preceding violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9, has such a tenuous factual link to the disputed evidence that that unlawful police conduct cannot be viewed properly as the source of that evidence\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">This case is not analogous to those in which the police discovered an outstanding arrest warrant after illegally stopping the defendant. The line of cases on which the state relies began with <em>State v. Dempster, </em>248 Or 404, 434 P2d 746 (1967). In that case, the Supreme Court explained that an outstanding arrest warrant can serve to attenuate the link between a police illegality and evidence discovered thereafter because, once the warrant is discovered, the police are bound to obey its command and arrest the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 407-08. In circumstances such as those in the <em>Dempster </em>line of cases, an outstanding arrest warrant is based on information that was unquestionably obtained by the state independently of the illegal stop \u2014 given that the warrant was already outstanding when the stop occurred \u2014 and has already been judicially determined to establish probable cause to arrest the person named in the warrant. Any search incident to the lawful arrest on the warrant is thus purged of the taint of the earlier police illegality. For that reason, even though the police would not have discovered the warrant but for the illegal stop, evidence that the police discover after the warrant is executed is attenuated from the illegal stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">In this case, there was no similar command to arrest defendant that Gerba was bound to obey. Moreover, unlike the information leading to the issuance of the arrest warrants in the <em>Dempster </em>line of cases, at least some of the information that formed Gerba\u2019s decision to arrest defendant was a direct product of the initial stop. The intervening circumstance on which the state relies \u2014 defendant\u2019s driving away from the store \u2014 did not, by itself, provide a sufficient basis for Gerba to arrest him. In <em>Dempster, </em>on the other hand, the intervening circumstance that created the attenuation \u2014 the arrest <em>warrant </em>\u2014 did by itself provide a sufficient basis for arresting the defendant. The state\u2019s argument that this case is analogous to <em>Dempster </em>therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>The concurring opinion contends that, if the stop did not begin until Gerba called dispatch, defendant suffered no constitutionally cognizable detriment from the stop, so suppression is not required. The dissent agrees with that aspect of the concurring opinion. The concurrence rightly asserts that our analysis must be consistent with the principle that evidence is not subject to suppression if \u201cthe defendant is not placed in a worse position than if the governmental officers had acted within the bounds of the law.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>339 Or at 25. The approach taken by the concurrence, however, goes astray in two respects. First, in determining whether defendant was placed at a disadvantage, it focuses on the circumstances of Gerba\u2019s conduct rather than the conduct itself. The concurrence notes that, under the reasoning reflected in this opinion, defendant\u2019s presence during the call to dispatch is the circumstance that transformed otherwise lawful police conduct into an unlawful stop. 231 Or App at 642 (Haselton, P. J., concurring). From there, it argues that \u201cdefendant was not placed in any constitutionally cognizable \u2018disadvantage\u2019 <em>vis-\u00e1-vis </em>his ultimate arrest <em>because of that circumstance.\u201d Id. </em>at 642 (emphasis added) (Haselton, P. J., concurring). The question is not whether a defendant is disadvantaged by the <em>circumstances </em>that render police conduct illegal, but whether he or she is disadvantaged by the <em>conduct </em>that the police engaged in \u2014 in this case, calling dispatch with defendant\u2019s identification information.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Second, the concurrence goes astray when comparing defendant\u2019s position to the position he would have been in had the illegal conduct not occurred. It contends that \u201cdefendant was \u2018not placed in a worse position\u2019 with respect to his arrest than if Gerba \u2018had acted within the bounds of the law\u2019 by contacting dispatch out of defendant\u2019s presence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 642 <em>(quoting Hall, </em>339 Or at 25) (Haselton, P. J., concurring). But the concurrence does not consider the position defendant would be in had Gerba simply refrained from engaging in the conduct that violated defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. Rather, it considers the position defendant would be in had Gerba done something different \u2014 namely, calling dispatch later, when defendant was no longer in his presence. In many search and seizure cases involving illegal police action, we likely could say that the police could have taken a different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>course of action \u2014 one that remained \u201cwithin the bounds of the law\u201d \u2014 and obtained the same evidence. It is inappropriate to determine the defendant\u2019s relative position by considering hypothetical lawful conduct that the police could have engaged in (but did not) or hypothetical circumstances that would have rendered the police conduct lawful (but which were not present). Rather, the defendant\u2019s relative position should be determined by considering the position he or she would be in had the police refrained from engaging in the unlawful conduct, without speculating about what the police might lawfully have done thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Under the circumstances of this case, calling dispatch with defendant\u2019s identification information was (presumably, for present purposes) illegal. In determining whether the evidence should be suppressed, we must consider the position defendant would be in had Gerba not done that, without regard to anything else that Gerba <em>might </em>have done. The answer is obvious: Had Gerba not called dispatch, he would not have discovered that defendant\u2019s license had been revoked, he would not have known that defendant was driving illegally, and he would not have arrested defendant. In short, this case would not have been brought against defendant had Gerba not made the call to dispatch. Defendant was clearly \u201cplaced in a worse position\u201d by Gerba\u2019s having acted outside the bounds of the law. Respectfully, the conclusion reached by the concurrence and the dissent is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">To summarize, regardless of whether Gerba stopped defendant or not, the trial court correctly ruled that evidence of defendant\u2019s identity is not subject to suppression. If defendant was in fact stopped, however, the stop was unlawful and evidence of the facts that defendant\u2019s license had been revoked and that he was driving illegally was tainted by the unlawful stop. On remand, the trial court shall determine whether defendant subjectively believed that he was not free to leave when Gerba called dispatch with his identification information. If the court finds that defendant did not hold that belief, it should reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction. If it finds that he did hold that belief, the evidence must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Vacated and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b672-6\"> We may not apply the presumption from <em>Ball v. Gladden, </em>250 Or 485, 487, 443 P2d 621 (1968), that, in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the trial court implicitly found that defendant believed he was free to leave. We are so constrained not because of an absence of evidence in the record, but because it is clear that the court\u2019s ruling was based on the \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d prong of the <em>Holmes </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>analysis, and the court has not yet completely analyzed the issue of defendant\u2019s subjective intent. <em>See State v. Lantzsch, </em>229 Or App 505, 516, 214 P3d 22 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b674-5\"> As defendant notes, in <em>State v. Starr, </em>91 Or App 267, 754 P2d 618 (1988), we held that the defendant\u2019s identity was obtained as a result of an unlawful stop in circumstances similar to those here. Without reasonable suspicion that the defendant was involved in criminal activity, a police officer asked the defendant for his driver\u2019s license. He retained the license for five to 10 minutes before returning it. After the defendant left, the officer ran a records check and discovered that the defendant\u2019s license was suspended. He followed the defendant and arrested him for driving while suspended. The trial court ruled that an unlawful stop began when the officer first asked the defendant for his license, and it suppressed all of the evidence obtained after that point, including the defendant\u2019s identity. <em>Id. </em>at 269. On the state\u2019s appeal, we disagreed that the stop began with the officer\u2019s request, but concluded that he had retained the license long enough for the encounter to amount to a stop. <em>Id. </em>at 270. We affirmed the suppression ruling, holding that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s identity was obtained as a result of the unlawful stop\u201d because the officer \u201cdid not have authority to compel [the] defendant to do anything, including giving his name.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the state did not argue, as it does here, that, because the defendant voluntarily gave the officer his license before the stop began, evidence of his identity was not a product of the stop. Because we did not consider that position in <em>Starr, </em>the case is not controlling here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b679-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>HASELTON, P. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A4S\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">The trial court erred in denying suppression, but not for the reasons advanced by Judge Rosenblum in the lead opinion. Our dispute turns on the timing of the operative \u201cstop.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The lead opinion rests on the premise that the stop did not occur until Deputy Gerba actually contacted dispatch. <em>See </em>231 Or App at 628 (characterizing Gerba\u2019s call to dispatch as \u201cthe very act that effected the stop\u201d). However, as amplified below, if the stop began at that point, there would be no basis for suppression under <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 115 P3d 908 (2005), because no inculpatory information was obtained from defendant, by way of questioning, consent, or observation, during or immediately after the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Conversely, in my view, the stop began earlier\u2014 when, in response to Gerba\u2019s inquiries, defendant produced, and Gerba took, defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license. At <em>that </em>point, \u201cin the totality of the circumstances * * * \u2018a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position could have believed\u2019 that he was not free to go.\u201d <em>State v. Parker, </em>225 Or App 610, 615, 202 P3d 205, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>227 Or App 413, 206 P3d 259 (2009) (quoting <em>State v. Toevs, </em>327 Or 525, 536, 964 P2d 1007 (1998)); <em>see also State v. Ashbaugh, </em>225 Or App 16, 24-25, 200 P3d 149 (2008), <em>rev allowed, </em>346 Or 257 (2009). And it was at <em>that </em>point \u2014 before Gerba ever contacted dispatch \u2014 that Gerba obtained ultimately inculpatory information from defendant, <em>viz., </em>defendant\u2019s identification and date of birth, which, in turn, yielded the information that defendant\u2019s driving privileges had been suspended. Consequently, unless the trial court determines on remand that defendant did not subjectively believe that his freedom of movement had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>significantly restrained, <em>see, e.g., Ashbaugh, </em>suppression is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">At first blush, that distinction with respect to the timing of the operative stop may seem to be academic, perhaps even metaphysical \u2014 after all, defendant was stopped, and the difference is a matter of only a few seconds. However, that distinction has profound implications regarding <em>Hall\u2019s </em>proper application, which I will endeavor to explain below. <em>See </em>231 Or App at 641-42 (Haselton, P. J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The facts material to our review of the trial court\u2019s denial of suppression are undisputed and straightforward. Defendant and his girlfriend, Rodriguez, were shopping late at night in an adult novelty and book store. That establishment was posted as excluding anyone under the age of 18. Gerba, who was on patrol (and, thus, presumably was in full uniform), entered the store and, immediately upon seeing defendant and Rodriguez, \u201ccontacted\u201d them because \u201con the door it says you\u2019ve got to be 18 or older.\u201d Gerba asked defendant and Rodriguez how old they were, and defendant replied that he was 22 years old. Gerba, who was unsatisfied with that response because \u201che looked pretty young to me,\u201d then asked defendant and Rodriguez if they had any identification. In response, defendant and Rodriguez then handed their driver\u2019s licenses to Gerba, who took them and retained them for 10 to 15 seconds, during which he contacted dispatch, which \u201c[r]an the numbers.\u201d Gerba did so to confirm that defendant\u2019s and Rodriguez\u2019s licenses were genuine, not \u201cfake.\u201d Gerba then returned the licenses and said, \u201c[H]ave a good day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Gerba then left the store and, immediately thereafter, dispatch responded that defendant\u2019s identification was genuine but his driving privileges had been suspended. Gerba returned to his patrol car and continued to watch the store for security purposes. About five minutes later, he saw defendant and Rodriguez come out of the store and get into a car, with defendant driving. Based on the information obtained from dispatch, Gerba stopped and arrested defendant for driving while suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>Defendant was subsequently charged with misdemeanor driving while revoked, ORS 811.182.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant moved to suppress all evidence that was the product of his encounter with Gerba in the store \u2014 including his identity and date of birth, dispatch\u2019s consequent communication to Gerba that defendant\u2019s driving privileges had been \u201csuspended,\u201d and the arrest that was predicated on that information. The trial court denied suppression and convicted defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">On appeal, as before the trial court, the dispute centers on suppression. As framed by the parties, the proper disposition of this case \u2014 as in the entire genre of <em>post-Hall </em>cases \u2014 requires consideration of three ultimately interrelated questions: (1) Was defendant unlawfully stopped? (2) If so, when? (3) Was the unlawful stop so related to inculpatory evidence that the constitution \u2014 here, defendant invoked only Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution\u2014 compels suppression of that evidence?<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">I begin with the first two, interrelated questions of whether, and when, defendant was unlawfully stopped. The question of timing here is especially critical because, with respect to defendant\u2019s ultimate arrest, the only inculpatory information that Gerba obtained from defendant, by questioning, consent, or observation, was defendant\u2019s name and date of birth, which Gerba did not know until he took and inspected defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license. Thus, if defendant were unlawfully stopped at the time that Gerba took his license, that would be a quintessential <em>Hall </em>scenario, in which inculpatory information was elicited or obtained during or following an unlawful stop. Conversely, if the stop did not begin until thereafter, the circumstances would depart qualitatively from those within the standard <em>Hall </em>construct because the only inculpatory information elicited from defendant would have been obtained <em>before </em>the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Defendant (perhaps appreciating the importance of that distinction) argues that he was stopped \u201c[a]t the moment [Gerba] took and retained defendant\u2019s ID for the purposes of calling his information into dispatch in defendant\u2019s presence.\u201d That contention appears to be based on either, or both, of two propositions: (1) An officer\u2019s mere physical receipt of a citizen\u2019s driver\u2019s license or similar identification in and of itself effects a stop, regardless of the attendant circumstances or how long the document is in the officer\u2019s possession. (2) Even if an officer\u2019s receipt and possession of a driver\u2019s license or identification does not <em>per se </em>effect a stop, in the totality of circumstances here, a person in defendant\u2019s position could, upon producing identification in response to an officer\u2019s inquiry, reasonably believe that he or she was not free to leave, at least until the document is returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">To the extent that defendant is relying on some bare, <em>per se </em>notion of mere \u201cphysical receipt and possession,\u201d that contention is unavailing as incompatible with <em>Hall </em>and irreconcilable with our own <em>pre-Hall </em>precedent. If, in <em>Hall, </em>the officer\u2019s brief retention of the defendant\u2019s identification would have been sufficient, in and of itself, to effect a stop, the Supreme Court could easily have said so. But it didn\u2019t. Rather, the court emphasized the concurrence of the officer contacting dispatch for a warrants check. <em>Hall, </em>339 Or at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Further, we have repeatedly rejected arguments that an officer\u2019s physical receipt of a driver\u2019s license <em>per se </em>effects a stop. <em>See, e.g., State v. Woods, </em>102 Or App 671, 675, 796 P2d 1209, <em>rev den, </em>310 Or 422 (1990) (where the defendant, in response to officer\u2019s request, produced his driver\u2019s license and officer, after taking it, \u201cwrote down the license information in his notebook and immediately handed it back to [the] defendant,\u201d \u201cthere had not been a sufficient show of authority to constitute a stop\u201d); <em>State v. Jackson, </em>91 Or App 425, 428, 755 P2d 732, <em>rev den, </em>306 Or 661 (1988) (concluding that where, at officer\u2019s request, the defendant gave identification to officer and made inculpatory admissions that his license had been revoked before the officer ran a records check, inculpatory admissions were not made during the course of an unlawful stop because they antedated the officer\u2019s \u201cretention\u201d of the identification card for investigatory \u201crecord check purposes\u201d (emphasis in original)); <em>accord State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number><em>v. Starr, </em>91 Or App 267, 269-70, 754 P2d 618 (1988) (although officer\u2019s initial request for identification did not \u201ctransform the encounter into a stop,\u201d subsequent retention of the license for \u201cfive to ten minutes,\u201d \u201cconstituted a show of authority sufficient to lead a reasonable person to believe that he was not free to leave\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Nevertheless, I do agree with defendant\u2019s alternative, broadly contextual argument that, in the totality of the circumstances, the stop began when Gerba took defendant\u2019s identification. That is so because, although <em>\u201cretention </em>of a suspect\u2019s identification, or the length of retention * * *, is not the touchstone of whether a stop has occurred,\u201d in this case, in the totality of the circumstances, an objectively reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position could have understood at that point that \u201che or she [was] under investigation and [was] not free to leave\u201d until, at least, Gerba returned the license. <em>State v. Highley, </em>219 Or App 100, 109, 180 P3d 1230 (2008), <em>rev pending </em>(2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The operative inquiry under <em>State v. Holmes, </em>311 Or 400, 409-10, 813 P2d 28 (1991), as construed in <em>Ashbaugh, </em>225 Or App at 22-25, and amplified in <em>Parker, </em>is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">\u201c[A] <em>Holmes </em>type (b) inquiry implicates conjunctive subjective and objective <em>components </em>\u2014 viz., the defendant subjectively believed that he or she was significantly restrained and that belief was objectively reasonable. Consequently, as the party bearing the burden of demonstrating the lawfulness of the search, the state can prevail against a <em>Holmes </em>type (b)-based motion to suppress if it disproves either of those conjunctive components. That is, the state can prevail either (1) by proving that the defendant did not believe that the officer had significantly restrained or interfered with the defendant\u2019s freedom of movement or (2) if such a belief would not be objectively reasonable. <em>[Ashbaugh, </em>225 Or App] at 24. In assessing whether \u2018such a belief is objectively reasonable under the circumstances,\u2019 the operative inquiry is whether \u2018 \u201ca reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position could have believed that the officers significantly had restricted [his or her] liberty or freedom of movement.\u201d \u2019 <em>[Ashbaugh, </em>225 Or App] at 25 (quoting <em>Toevs, </em>327 Or at 536) * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number><em>Parker, </em>225 Or App at 614-15 (emphasis omitted). <em>See also id. </em>at 615 (emphasizing that \u201cthe controlling inquiry\u201d with respect to the objective component of the <em>Holmes </em>type (b) inquiry \u201cis not whether <em>every </em>reasonable person <em>would </em>have so believed, but, instead, whether a reasonable person <em>could </em>have so believed\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The circumstances here pertaining to the objective component of <em>the Holmes </em>type (b) inquiry are undisputed and straightforward: Defendant and his girlfriend were shopping in an adult bookstore, and the door to that store stated that persons under the age of 18 were excluded. Gerba, a uniformed officer, entered the store and, immediately upon seeing defendant and his girlfriend, asked defendant how old he was. When defendant responded that he was 22, Gerba obviously did not accept or believe that response. Instead, he asked defendant and his girlfriend if they had any identification. In response to that inquiry, they both produced driver\u2019s licenses, which Gerba then took.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Thus, this was not a case in which an officer merely requested and retained identification. Rather, in context\u2014 <em>viz., </em>the store being posted so as to exclude persons under the age of 18, Gerba\u2019s immediate approach to the couple and questions about their ages, and his apparent disbelief of defendant\u2019s response \u2014 a person in defendant\u2019s position could reasonably have understood that Gerba was investigating him for some criminal activity (ostensibly, being underage in an adult bookstore).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A person in those circumstances could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>also have understood reasonably that Gerba had requested the production of identification \u2014 and would seek to confirm the validity of that identification \u2014 as part of that continuing investigation. Consequently, a person in defendant\u2019s circumstances could reasonably have understood that, once Gerba took the identification, lie or she would not be free to leave until, at least, the officer returned the identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">The circumstances of this case are conceptually analogous to those in <em>State v. Zamora-Martinez, </em>229 Or App 397, 211 P3d 349 (2009). There, we reversed the defendant\u2019s convictions for criminal possession of forged instruments, concluding that the trial court had erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress two forged documents that the defendant contended were the product of an unlawful stop. <em>Id. </em>at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In <em>Zamora-Martinez, </em>Hillsboro police and a federal immigration agent executed a search warrant at the defendant\u2019s sister\u2019s house. The defendant\u2019s sister was not present and, because all the adults who were present were taken into custody, the sister\u2019s children would have been left without adult supervision. At his sister\u2019s request, the defendant went to the residence to pick up the children. <em>Id. </em>at 399. When the defendant arrived, the Hillsboro officers asked why the defendant was there and, when he explained, the federal immigration agent asked to see the defendant\u2019s identification. <em>Id. </em>at 399-400. The defendant then produced an Oregon identification card, and the immigration agent asked the defendant where he was from. When the defendant responded, \u201cMexico,\u201d the agent asked whether the defendant had any other identification \u2014 and, in response, the defendant produced a resident alien card and a Social Security card, both of which the agent immediately recognized as forgeries. <em>Id. </em>at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The dispositive issue with respect to suppression was whether the defendant had been stopped before he produced the second set of identifying documents (which became the basis for the criminal charges). <em>Id. </em>at 400-01. In reversing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>the trial court\u2019s denial of suppression, we agreed with the defendant that (at least for purposes of the objective component of the <em>Holmes </em>type (b) inquiry) the encounter escalated into a stop when the agent \u201casked whether [the] defendant had additional identification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">In so holding, we concluded that the initial request for identification did not effect a stop because it was for a valid noninvestigatory purpose <em>(i.e., </em>to confirm that the defendant was, in fact, who he said he was \u2014 and, thus, was authorized to pick up the children). <em>Id. </em>at 403 (\u201c[A] reasonable person seeking to take custody of children would expect to be asked for identification.\u201d). When, however, the defendant presented an apparently valid Oregon identification card, that valid noninvestigative purpose had been satisfied \u2014 and, thus, a person in the defendant\u2019s circumstances could reasonably have understood that the immigration agent\u2019s purpose in requesting additional identification \u201cwas not to ascertain [the] defendant\u2019s identity before releasing his nieces into his care, but to investigate whether [the] defendant was lawfully residing in the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404. Consequently, the agent\u2019s request that the defendant produce additional identification effected an unlawful stop. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Here, Gerba\u2019s initial question to defendant about his age was the functional equivalent of the agent\u2019s initial request for identification in <em>Zamora-Martinez. </em>At least arguably, Gerba\u2019s question was \u201cnoninvestigative\u201d in nature. However, once Gerba indicated his disbelief of defendant\u2019s answer by requesting that he produce identification, the investigative character of the inquiry was manifest, and the encounter escalated into a stop. Again, a person in defendant\u2019s circumstances could reasonably have understood that the officer intended, at least, to confirm the validity of the information in any identification that was produced and that he or she was not free to leave until (at the earliest) the officer received such confirmation.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">With the beginning of the stop so fixed, this case comports with the standard <em>Hall </em>construct. That is, inculpatory information (defendant\u2019s name and date of birth), which ultimately was the predicate for Gerba\u2019s knowledge of defendant\u2019s \u201csuspended\u201d status and consequent arrest, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>obtained <em>after </em>defendant was stopped. If, however \u2014 as the lead opinion concludes \u2014 the stop did not begin until Gerba actually called dispatch in defendant\u2019s presence, then the only information that was obtained from defendant was elicited <em>before </em>the unlawful stop began, and suppression would be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">In <em>Hall, </em>the Supreme Court explained that the purpose of the exclusionary rule under Article I, section 9, is to \u201cvindicate a defendant\u2019s personal rights\u201d by \u201crestoring] a defendant to the same position as if\u2018the government\u2019s officers had stayed within the law.\u2019 \u201d 339 Or at 24 (quoting <em>State v. Davis, </em>295 Or 227, 234, 666 P2d 802 (1983)). Thus, the exclusionary rule is inapposite where \u201cthe defendant has not been disadvantaged as a result of the unlawful police conduct or, stated differently, [where] the defendant is not placed in a worse position than if the governmental officers had acted within the bounds of the law.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Hall, </em>339 Or at 25. Here, if one concludes (as does the lead opinion) that no stop occurred until Gerba contacted dispatch to confirm defendant\u2019s personal information, then defendant was not placed in a \u201cworse position\u201d with respect to his ultimate arrest for driving while suspended than he would have been if Gerba \u201chad acted within the bounds of the law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">To put the matter in more concrete terms, <em>if the stop did not begin until Gerba contacted dispatch, </em>then:</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">(1) Gerba lawfully obtained defendant\u2019s personal identifying information <em>before </em>any stop occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">(2) Gerba did not elicit any information or consent from defendant after the stop and before he arrested defendant for driving while suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">(3) Although Gerba learned of defendant\u2019s license suspension when dispatch responded to his initial contact in defendant\u2019s presence, that response was based on defendant\u2019s identifying information, which Gerba had lawfully obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Thus, assuming <em>arguendo </em>the premises of the lead opinion, the rationale for suppression reduces to the fact that Gerba\u2019s initial contact with dispatch occurred <em>while Gerba was still in defendant\u2019s presence </em>\u2014 and that, but for that circumstance, there would not have been an unlawful stop. However, defendant was not placed in any constitutionally cognizable \u201cdisadvantage\u201d <em>vis-\u00e1-vis </em>his ultimate arrest because of that circumstance. To be sure, defendant was disadvantaged because of Gerba\u2019s <em>call </em>to dispatch in that, but for that call, Gerba would never have known that defendant\u2019s license was suspended and, in turn, would never have arrested defendant. But there is nothing unlawful about an officer contacting dispatch to confirm information; that is hardly an unlawful police practice. Bluntly, there is nothing constitutionally objectionable about the call <em>qua </em>call.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Again, under the lead opinion\u2019s reasoning, the constitutionally objectionable circumstance, transforming otherwise lawful police conduct (the call to dispatch) into an unlawful stop, was that the call occurred in defendant\u2019s presence. But that circumstance had no effect on the information that Gerba received from <em>dispatch </em>\u2014 i.e., dispatch would have informed Gerba of defendant\u2019s license suspension, regardless of whether Gerba had called when he was outside the store, in defendant\u2019s presence, or in his patrol car grabbing a quick gulp of coffee. Nor did that circumstance affect defendant\u2019s interactions with Gerba. In short, notwithstanding that Gerba called dispatch in defendant\u2019s presence, defendant was \u201cnot placed in a worse position\u201d with respect to his arrest than if Gerba \u201chad acted within the bounds of the law\u201d by contacting dispatch out of defendant\u2019s presence. <em>See Hall, </em>339 Or at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The upshot is that, if one assumes that the unlawful stop did not begin until Gerba contacted dispatch in defendant\u2019s presence, defendant suffered no constitutionally cognizable detriment from that stop that warrants suppression. Nevertheless, because a reasonable person could have understood that his or her liberty had been substantially restrained at an earlier point in this particular encounter\u2014 specifically, when Gerba took defendant\u2019s identification\u2014 suppression could be required, depending on the trial court\u2019s determination with respect to defendant\u2019s subjective belief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number><em>See, e.g., Zamora-Martinez, </em>229 Or App at 404; <em>Parker, </em>225 Or App at 616-17. Accordingly, the case must be vacated and remanded for that determination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-7\"> I fully appreciate that, in this procedural posture, my use of \u201cstop\u201d ostensibly begs the question. After all, both Judge Rosenblum and I agree that the ultimate determination of whether defendant was stopped will depend on the trial court\u2019s finding on remand regarding defendant\u2019s subjective belief as to whether his freedom of movement had been significantly impaired. <em>See, e.g., State v. Parker, </em>225 Or App 610, 616-17, 202 P3d 205, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>227 Or App 413, 206 P3d 259 (2009); <em>State v.

Still, \u201cstop\u201d is unavoidable, and useful, shorthand in this context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b681-6\"> Although dispatch told Gerba that defendant\u2019s driving privileges had been suspended, they had actually been revoked.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b681-7\"> I use the term \u201cinculpatory\u201d in its broadest sense of information that materially contributed to defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b684-6\"> To be sure, as the state points out, there is no crime of being \u201cunderage in an adult bookstore\u201d (or some functional equivalent). Rather, culpability under potentially applicable statutes runs solely against the owner, operator, or manager of such an establishment. <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 167.080 (a person commits the crime of displaying obscene materials to minors \u201cif, being the owner, operator or manager of a business or acting in a managerial capacity, the person knowingly or recklessly permits [an unaccompanied] minor * * * to enter or remain on the premises\u201d where various materials are \u201cvisibly displayed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">However, Gerba did not tell defendant and Rodriguez that his ostensible investigation pertained solely to the manager or proprietor of the establishment. Further, the statutes governing licensed establishments selling alcoholic beverages <em>do </em>provide that a person under the age of 21 is criminally liable if he or she \u201center[s] or attempt[s] to enter any portion of a licensed premises that is posted or otherwise identified as being prohibited to the use of minors.\u201d ORS 471.430(3). Consequently, unless the \u201creasonable person\u201d standard requires complete command of the Oregon Revised Statutes \u2014 which Gerba himself candidly acknowledged he did not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>(\u201cI don\u2019t know the statute off hand, but there is a statute that prohibits explicit material to minors\u201d) \u2014 a person in defendant\u2019s circumstances could reasonably have understood that he or she was the subject of a criminal investigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b687-9\"> As the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized, Oregon\u2019s exclusionary rule is not predicated on a rationale of deterring unlawful police conduct. <em>See, e.g., Hall, </em>339 Or at 24 n 14; <em>State v.
