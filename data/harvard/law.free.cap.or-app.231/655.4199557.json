The PUC entered the order after determining that defendants were in default due to their failure to timely respond to the PUC\u2019s complaint. Defendants assign error to both the PUC\u2019s decision to enter the order and to what they characterize as its denial of their subsequent \u201cmotion to set aside default.\u201d The PUC argues that we should dismiss defendants\u2019 petition for judicial review as untimely. We dismiss the petition for two reasons: (1) The petition is untimely with respect to judicial review of the default order in that it was not filed within 60 days of service of that order on defendants and that period was not extended by defendants\u2019 filing of their \u201cmotion to set aside default.\u201d (2) As of the date this petition for judicial review was filed, the PUC had not ruled on, much less denied, defendants\u2019 \u201cmotion to set aside default\u201d and that motion was not deemed denied by operation of law; consequently, there was no reviewable disposition of that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">On September 26, 2007, the PUC entered the order referred to above. On September 28, 2007, defendants filed a \u201cmotion to set aside default.\u201d The PUC did not act on that motion. On January 23, 2008, 117 days later, defendants filed their petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The PUC argues, pursuant to ORS 183.482(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the petition for judicial review is untimely because it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>filed more than 60 days after the order. In response, defendants assert that their set-aside motion is the legal equivalent of a petition for reconsideration, thereby implicating the \u201cdeemed denied\u201d provision of ORS 183.482(1). The timing of the filing of defendants\u2019 petition for judicial review is such that, if defendants are correct, their petition for judicial review would be timely because ORS 183.482(1) provides for a new 60-day filing period following the denial of a petition for reconsideration. A petition for reconsideration is deemed denied on the sixtieth day after it is filed if the agency does not otherwise act on it. <em>Id. </em>As previously noted, the PUC failed to act on defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>\u201cJurisdiction for judicial review of contested cases is conferred upon the Court of Appeals. Proceedings for review shall he instituted by filing a petition in the Court of Appeals. The petition shall be filed within 60 days only following the date the order upon which the petition is based is served unless otherwise provided by statute. If a petition for rehearing has been filed, then the petition for review shall be filed within 60 days only following the date the order denying the petition for rehearing is served. If the agency does not otherwise act, a petition for rehearing or reconsideration shall he deemed denied the 60th day following the date the petition was filed, and in such cases, petition for judicial review shall be filed within 60 days only following such date. Date of service shall be the date on which the agency delivered or mailed its order in accordance with ORS 183.470.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>The problem with defendants\u2019 assertion is that a motion to set aside a final order of default and a petition for reconsideration are not legal equivalents in several pertinent respects. First, the statutory and regulatory bases for the two are distinct: ORS 756.561<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and OAR 860-014-0095<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> allow a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>party to file a petition for reconsideration of an order entered by the PUC; OAR 860-013-0055<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> allows a party to file a motion to set aside a final order of default. Second, the legal standard governing a motion to set aside a final order of default differs from the standard governing a petition for reconsideration. OAR 860-013-0055(2) provides that a motion to set aside a final order of default may be granted where a party\u2019s default was due to \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect, or other good cause.\u201d In contrast, OAR 860-014-0095(3)(a) - (d) provides that a petition for reconsideration may be granted where there is \u201c[n]ew evidence,\u201d a \u201cchange in the law,\u201d \u201c[a]n error of law or fact in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>order,\u201d or \u201c[g]ood cause * * *.\u201d Third, we note both that, in their presentation to the PUC, defendants consistently characterized their motion as a \u201cmotion to set aside default\u201d and that their motion did not comply with the requirements specified for a petition for reconsideration, as provided by OAR 860-014-0095(2) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">We conclude that defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the order did not modify the 60-day deadline for filing a petition for judicial review of that order. Because the petition was untimely, we lack jurisdiction to review the merits of the PUC\u2019s order finding defendants to be in default and liable to the PUC in the amount of $203,391.97. <em>See Ososke v. DMV, </em>320 Or 657, 661, 891 P2d 633 (1995) (\u201c[T]he untimely filing of a petition for review of a final order of DMV [pursuant to ORS 183.482(1)] is a jurisdictional defect.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">We now turn to the other matter that defendants challenge: the PUC\u2019s \u201cdenial\u201d (in defendants\u2019 words) of their motion to set aside the default order. The problem with that contention is that, at least as of the time this petition was filed, the PUC had never acted on, much less denied, that motion; nor was that motion deemed denied by operation of law. Thus, there was no disposition that was subject to judicial review under ORS 183.482.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">We reiterate that defendants\u2019 \u201cmotion to set aside default\u201d was not a petition for reconsideration. Unlike ORS 756.561 and OAR 860-014-0095, which provide for a 60-day \u201cdeemed denied\u201d cut-off (functionally analogous to the 55-day \u201cdeemed denied\u201d provision in civil practice for motions for JNOV under ORCP 63 D(1) and motions for new trial pursuant to ORCP 64 F(1)), there is no \u201cdeemed denied\u201d provision in OAR 860-013-0055, which governs motions to set aside a final order of default (just as there is no such provision in ORCP 71). As noted, the PUC never ruled on defendants\u2019 \u201cmotion to set aside default,\u201d so there was never any denial of that motion. There was therefore no reviewable disposition of that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Petition for judicial review dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\"> ORS 183.482(1) provides:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b702-5\"> ORS 756.561 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">\u201c(1) After an order has been made by the Public Utility Commission in any proceeding, any party thereto may apply for rehearing or reconsideration thereof within 60 days from the date of service of such order.
