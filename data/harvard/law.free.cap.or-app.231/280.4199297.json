Coen, </em>203 Or App 92, 125 P3d 761 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 141 (2006) <em>(Coen I). </em>The state appeals pretrial orders in which the trial court (1) excluded evidence of defendant\u2019s prior DUII conviction and (2) suppressed defendant\u2019s testimony from his first trial. ORS 138.060(1)(c). We review for errors of law. <em>State v. Moore, </em>229 Or App 255, 257, 211 P3d 344 (2009); <em>State v. Orr, </em>197 Or App 327, 329, 105 P3d 904, <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 680 (2005). We conclude that the trial court erred in excluding the evidence of defendant\u2019s DUII conviction but did not err in suppressing defendant\u2019s prior trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">As discussed in greater length in <em>Coen I, </em>this case arose out of an automobile accident that resulted in the death of one driver and the hospitalization of the other driver \u2014 that is, defendant. 203 Or App at 94. Defendant was charged with second-degree manslaughter and DUII. <em>Id. </em>at 95. Before trial, defendant unsuccessfully moved to suppress statements he had made to a state trooper while in the hospital and the results of a chemical analysis of his blood. <em>Id. </em>at 95-96. At trial, in accordance with the advice of his counsel \u2014 in an effort to ameliorate his inculpatory statements to the trooper \u2014 defendant testified. <em>Id. </em>at 98. Defendant testified that he had consumed \u201c15 or 16 beers in the eight hours before the accident,\u201d but that he had a high tolerance for alcohol, was not under the influence of intoxicants, and did not veer from his own lane or cause the accident. <em>Id. </em>Defendant was ultimately convicted of both counts and appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">On appeal in <em>Coen I, </em>we held that certain statements defendant made to the trooper in the hospital should have been suppressed because they were made in \u201ccompelling circumstances\u201d and were not preceded by <em>Miranda </em>warnings, in violation of Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution. 203 Or App at 99-102. We also held that defendant\u2019s consent to give samples for the chemical analysis was involuntary, and, consequently, the results of the chemical analysis should have been suppressed. <em>Id. </em>at 105. Further, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>those errors were not harmless, we reversed the manslaughter and DUII convictions and remanded for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 103,107.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">On remand, the state moved for a pretrial ruling on the admissibility of evidence that defendant participated in a diversion program for an incident occurring in 1992, and that defendant had been convicted of DUII in 1997. The state argued that both defendant\u2019s participation in diversion and his prior DUII conviction were relevant to prove, with respect to the present charges, that he had acted with a reckless mental state \u2014 an element of the second-degree manslaughter charge. ORS 163.125(l)(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, the state argued that the evidence was relevant to prove that defendant had \u201cknowledge of the risks involved in drinking and driving\u201d at the time of the collision. The trial court ruled that evidence of defendant\u2019s participation in diversion was admissible. However, after apparently conducting an OEC 403 balancing analysis \u2014 and notwithstanding the state\u2019s contention that OEC 404(4) precluded such balancing \u2014 the court excluded evidence of defendant\u2019s 1997 DUII conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Defendant also filed a pretrial motion on remand to suppress the testimony that he had given at the first trial. Invoking <em>Harrison v. United States, </em>392 US 219, 88 S Ct 2008, 20 L Ed 2d 1047 (1968), defendant argued that his prior trial testimony should be suppressed because it was given to rebut the <em>un-Mirandized </em>inculpatory statements that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>made in the hospital, which were erroneously admitted into evidence in his first trial. The trial court agreed, reasoning that \u201c[i]t is clear that the defendant only testified in order to counter the use of the illegally obtained blood draw and his statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">On appeal, the state first assigns error to the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the DUII conviction, contending that OEC 404(4) precluded the trial court from engaging in balancing under OEC 403.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant remonstrates that the trial court did not err in engaging in OEC 403 balancing because OEC 404(4) is facially unconstitutional as incompatible with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Specifically, defendant contends that (1) due process innately requires a reasoned balancing of the probative value verses the unfairly prejudicial potential effect of evidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s prior bad acts and (2) OEC 404(4) creates a one-sided evidentiary scheme that deprives defendant of the protections afforded by OEC 403 that the prosecution enjoys.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, and alternatively, defendant contends that, in all events, the DUII conviction is irrelevant. For the reasons that follow, we agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Contrary to what defendant argues, our case law clearly establishes that evidence of defendant\u2019s prior DUII conviction is relevant to whether defendant had, as the state argues, \u201cknowledge of the risks involved in drinking and driving\u201d on the date of the accident. <em>See, e.g., State v. Wyant, </em>217 Or App 199, 203, 175 P3d 988 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 558 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>(2008) (\u201c[E]vidence of defendant\u2019s prior DUII convictions <em>and </em>participation in a DUII probation program were relevant to prove that defendant acted recklessly.\u201d (Emphasis added.)); <em>State v. Hardman, </em>196 Or App 522, 530, 102 P3d 722 (2004) (\u201cBoth the fact of the accident itself and the [DUII] charge * * * permit a logical inference that defendant acted with a heightened awareness of the dangers of drinking and driving.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">2. Defendant\u2019s challenges to the constitutionality of OEC 404(4) are equally unavailing. We have previously, albeit without extended or detailed treatment, rejected precisely the same contentions that defendant raises here. <em>See, e.g., State v. Berg, </em>223 Or App 387, 399, 196 P3d 547 (2008), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>228 Or App 754, 208 P3d 1006, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 361 (2009); <em>Wyant, </em>217 Or App at 206; <em>State v. Phillips, </em>217 Or App 93, 98, 174 P3d 1032 (2007). We adhere to those holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The state also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s suppression of defendant\u2019s inculpatory testimony given at his first trial. At oral argument, the state acknowledged that, at least for purposes of our review, its argument is foreclosed by <em>Moore. </em>229 Or App at 265-66. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Order suppressing evidence of defendant\u2019s driving under the influence of intoxicants conviction reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-6\"> As pertinent here, ORS 163.125(1) provides, in part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">\u201c[cjriminal homicide constitutes manslaughter in the second degree when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACK\">\u201c(a) It is committed recklessly[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">In turn, \u201crecklessly,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">\u201cwhen used with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense, means that a person is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists.
