He argues that the state failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that any of the children\u2019s \u201ccondition or circumstances are such as to endanger [their] welfare,\u201d the statutory basis for jurisdiction alleged in the state\u2019s dependency petition. ORS 419B.100(l)(c); ORS 419B.809. On <em>de novo </em>review, ORS 419A.200(6)(b), we agree with father that the juvenile court erred in extending jurisdiction. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Father and mother have four children together, three of whom \u2014 DC, JC, and KMY \u2014 are the subject of this appeal. At the time of the hearing, DC was 12 years old, KMY was 11, and JC was 8. Father and mother ended their relationship sometime around 2000, and mother is not involved in this appeal. At the time of the hearing, father had been involved for approximately seven years with his current partner, Tabitha, with whom he lives and has a child, J. J was five years old at the time of the hearing and had never been removed from their care.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Father first came to the attention of the Department of Human Services (DHS) when his and mother\u2019s children were removed from mother\u2019s care in 2005. DHS placed the children with father in late 2006 or early 2007, despite concerns about father\u2019s alcohol use and disciplinary methods. Four months later, however, DHS removed the children from father\u2019s care; the record indicates that the reason for removal was father\u2019s alcohol use, but there are no further details or information about how that use affected the children. The court assumed jurisdiction over the children in June 2007 and ordered father to participate in a substance abuse assessment and any recommended follow-up treatment, and to complete parenting classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Father participated in a substance abuse assessment with Vicky Cooper of OnTrack, Inc., a comprehensive counseling service agency, on May 31, 2007. Cooper diagnosed father with \u201cAlcohol Dependence Provisional,\u201d level one. She recommended that father attend three two-hour \u201cIntensive Outpatient Group\u201d treatment sessions at OnTrack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>on weekday afternoons; attend monthly one-on-one counseling sessions at OnTrack; attend weekly Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings in the community, verifying his attendance at those meetings with signed slips; and undergo random urinalyses (UAs), for a minimum of 16 weeks. Cooper testified later at the dependency hearing that random UAs were the only way to verify that a person had remained sober and that verification of AA meeting attendance was necessary because, with \u201cdrug and alcohol [treatment,] it\u2019s all about documentation and paperwork. If it\u2019s not on paper it didn\u2019t happen, usually.\u201d She also explained the difference between treatment and AA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-3\">\u201c[TJreatment is good for information and having a look at the denial and * * * [to] get the education on alcoholism as a disease * * * [and] what it does to the family systems and what it does to you physically, psychologically. And then AA is a place to learn how to live life now without the alcohol.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Father refused to give a UA at the end of his May 31 assessment, stating that his ride was waiting for him and that he did not have time. In her evaluation, Cooper stated that father presented as \u201cguarded,\u201d \u201cgrandiose,\u201d and as a \u201cvictim\u201d; that he possessed poor judgment and poor insight into his disease; that he did not recognize that he had a problem and thus saw no reason to change; and that his risk of relapse was \u201csevere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">One week later, in June 2007, the children told a DHS caseworker that father \u201cha[d] been drinking heavily to the point where he passes out on the couch on a regular basis and is upset and angry, yells a lot[,] and is not able to parent them.\u201d The children also stated that father \u201cacts out\u201d when he is drinking, which frightens them. The caseworker concluded that the children had been \u201cinjured emotionally by the things [father] does and says to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">After attending his first appointment at OnTrack, father never returned and was discharged for noncompliance. According to father, he chose not to participate because he had previously completed an OnTrack treatment program in 2004 after being convicted of driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII) and felt that he would not receive any benefit from attending again; because the treatment was too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>expensive (despite Cooper\u2019s assurance that he would not be denied on account of his inability to pay); because he could not get the time off from work (despite his testimony that he was self-employed); and because DHS had lied to him about placing the children with him and had instead decided to place them again with mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">On July 26, 2007, DHS caseworker Lindorf held a family decision meeting with father, Tabitha, mother, and the children\u2019s grandmother. At that time, the children were again transitioning into mother\u2019s home. During the meeting, father declined supervised visits with the children, stating that he planned to \u201cjust wait DHS out.\u201d According to Lindorf, father was \u201cagitated,\u201d \u201con edge,\u201d \u201cnon-cooperative,\u201d and \u201cended up leaving half way through the meeting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Lindorf held another meeting in November with mother, father, and Tabitha in an \u201cattempt to bring [father] into the process\u201d and to \u201cengage him * * * in[ ] any kind of * * * treatment.\u201d Because it was clear to Lindorf that father was not willing to complete a treatment program, she suggested, as a \u201clast ditch effort,\u201d that he attend AA meetings, verifying his attendance at those meetings, \u201cas a gesture that he was trying to comply and work with [her] at all\u201d and so that he could resume visits with the children. At that time, father told Lindorf that he had \u201cbeen sober for several months, but [that he] didn\u2019t have a specific sober date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">That same month, father\u2019s oldest daughter, who is not involved in this proceeding, reported to DHS that father had been drinking alcohol on Halloween night. She told DHS that father had grabbed her arm and raised his voice to prevent her from going to a Halloween party of which he did not approve and that he had been \u201cmean and forceful,\u201d which, she later testified, typified his behavior when drunk. She also later testified that she had seen father drink a beer that night, that his eyes had been red, that she had smelled alcohol on his breath when he grabbed her, and that, when father drinks, he is generally \u201cedgier,\u201d \u201cmeaner,\u201d and more controlling than usual.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Father successfully completed parenting classes in December 2007. In her \u201cClosing Report,\u201d the instructor stated that, although father was \u201cbelligerent at first,\u201d he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>eventually able to enjoy the course and to employ successfully some of the techniques he had learned. She noted that father and Tabitha would sometimes bring J with them to class, commenting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\">\u201c[father and Tabitha] always made sure [J] would have a positive experience; they would bring snacks for him to eat, coloring books, crayons, blocks, etc. They praised him abundantly, listened patiently to his requests, modeled healthy responses and dialogue. [J] was always clean, happy and responsive to his parents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">She further noted that father and Tabitha \u201cspoke lovingly of [father\u2019s] older children, missing them, and desiring to parent them.\u201d She opined that father and Tabitha \u201ccan provide a stable and secure home for their children. They are certainly doing so for [J].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In April 2008, DHS closed father\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">In August 2008, DHS again removed the children from mother\u2019s home. DHS did not place the children with father; instead, it filed a new jurisdiction petition under ORS 419B.809, alleging that the children\u2019s \u201ccondition or circumstances are such as to endanger [their] welfare,\u201d ORS 419B.100(l)(c), because (1) \u201cfather\u2019s substance abuse interferes with his ability to safely parent\u201d the children; and (2) \u201cdespite prior services offered * * * through DHS and other agencies, * * * father has been unable and/or unwilling to overcome the impediments to his ability to provide safe, adequate care to\u201d the children. The court held a hearing on the petition on October 22 and 24, 2008, as required by ORS 419B.305.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">At the hearing, father denied that he had an alcohol problem. Nonetheless, he testified that he had stopped drinking approximately one year earlier \u201cfor [him]self, for [his] children, [and] to better [his] life\u201d; he further testified that he did not intend to drink again because his 2004 DUII conviction had \u201ccost [him] money [and] time\u201d and he didn\u2019t \u201cneed that kind of stuff in [his] life.\u201d He could not remember precisely when he had stopped drinking, but estimated that his last drink had been sometime in the fall of 2007. Father stated that he could not remember the precise date of his last drink because he often went long periods without drinking and because \u201cthe exact date\u201d had not \u201creally been that big a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>deal for [him].\u201d Tabitha testified that father\u2019s last \u201cslip up\u201d drink had been in December 2007, 10 months before the hearing, and that he had been continuously sober since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Father testified that he had understood AA to be an acceptable alternative to treatment based on his November 2007 meeting with Lindorf. He explained that he had preferred AA meetings because they were free and in the evening. He claimed to have had attended AA meetings sporadically \u201cif [he] felt like [he] wanted to\u201d for approximately three or four months, then stopped attending in the spring of 2008 because he thought himself \u201cnot [as] bad off as\u201d the other people there and \u201cdidn\u2019t want to sit there and continually dredge and live it over and over and over.\u201d He did not participate in the receiving of sobriety coins commemorating periods of continuous sobriety, because he did not wish to \u201cbe reminded of something that\u2019s negative in [his] life\u201d and felt that he did not need the group\u2019s encouragement. Father never obtained an AA sponsor and was unable to produce any verification of his attendance at AA meetings. Although he recalled having undergone some UAs in the week prior to the hearing, he could not produce the results of those UAs.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Tabitha testified that she does not drink alcohol or use drugs and that she and father \u201chave a sober household\u201d and \u201csober friends * * * around.\u201d She also testified that she supports and encourages father in his sobriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court noted that it was clear that father \u201cloves his children\u201d and that father\u2019s completion of the parenting classes shows that he is \u201cwilling to do things to try to be * * * their parent.\u201d It also acknowledged that the recommended course of treatment conflicted with father\u2019s work schedule. Although it found father\u2019s testimony \u201cvery vague and * * * indefinite,\u201d it was nonetheless \u201creassured\u201d by Tabitha\u2019s testimony, which it found credible, that father had been \u201cmaking a good-faith effort at sobriety on his own.\u201d The court stated that father \u201creally is a good candidate for custody for these children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The court ultimately concluded, however, that the state had proved both allegations in its petition by a preponderance of the evidence. Regarding the second allegation\u2014 that, \u201cdespite prior services offered * * * through DHS and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>other agencies, * * * father has been unable and/or unwilling to overcome the impediments to his ability to provide safe, adequate care to\u201d the children \u2014 the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\">\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that if somebody comes into court later and says, \u2018Despite being ordered to do that, I managed to do the equivalent on my own and therefore we should disregard what this judge has ordered that I should do.\u2019 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t think I can do that or should do that and I\u2019m not going to do it in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">\u201cWhat I find is that you were ordered to do the evaluation and the treatment and you didn\u2019t. And so I do find that by preponderance of the evidence that [the second] allegation has been proven.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">\u201cI will say that * * * I don\u2019t take lightly what you said about * * * just doing this cold-turkey or doing it on your own. I think to some extent you may have done that. I don\u2019t know if you have a raging alcohol problem at this moment. But [it] seems to me * * * that if you would just go do the program, if you really are sober, maintaining your sobriety for 16 weeks * * * [and] doing the classes should be * * * not that hard compared to all the other services that so many people are ordered to do. I mean, other people that come into family court are literally ordered to do three or four different types of things at one time, classes, do this, do that. We\u2019re just asking that you do this one thing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Regarding the first allegation \u2014 that \u201cfather\u2019s substance abuse interferes with his ability to safely parent\u201d the children \u2014 the court concluded that, \u201cbecause [father] had not done the program [of recommended treatment] and then continued to consume alcohol [in October and December 2007,] * * * that allegation has also been proven by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Accordingly, the court took jurisdiction over the children, and father appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\"> The parties do not dispute the relevant legal principles. The juvenile court \u201chas exclusive original jurisdiction\u201d in any case involving a child \u201c[w]hose condition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare of the [child].\u201d ORS 419B.100(1)(c). \u201cAlthough there is a strong preference that children live in their own homes with their own families, the state recognizes that it is not always possible or in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>best interests of the child or the public for children who have been abused or neglected to be reunited with their parents or guardians.\u201d ORS 419B.090(5). \u201cThe key inquiry in determining whether \u2018condition or circumstances\u2019 warrant jurisdiction is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, there is a reasonable likelihood of harm to the welfare of the child.\u201d <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. T. S., </em>214 Or App 184, 191, 164 P3d 308, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 363 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). In deciding whether the juvenile court has jurisdiction, \u201c[i]t is the <em>child\u2019s </em>condition or circumstances that are the focus of the * * * inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original). The state must prove the facts supporting jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. ORS 419B.310(3); <em>T. S., </em>214 Or App at 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">On appeal, as noted, father argues that the evidence presented at the October 2008 hearing did not justify taking jurisdiction. He focuses in particular on the juvenile court\u2019s apparent reliance on his refusal to complete the recommended OnTrack program; he argues that, by relying on that failure, the court shifted the inquiry from the children\u2019s circumstances to his own condition. Moreover, father maintains that the juvenile court\u2019s decision to take jurisdiction stemmed from considerations of fairness to other litigants who had followed the court\u2019s recommendations, and that such considerations were not lawful. The state\u2019s response does not directly address the role that father\u2019s refusal to complete the OnTrack program played in the juvenile court\u2019s decision. Rather, it argues that the totality of the evidence was sufficient to show that the children\u2019s \u201ccondition or circumstances are such as to endanger [their] welfare.\u201d ORS 419B.100(l)(c). The state focuses on the following facts in addition to father\u2019s refusal to participate in the recommended course of treatment: (1) father denied that he had an alcohol problem; (2) although father claimed to have been sober for approximately one year before the October 2008 hearing, the record demonstrates that he used alcohol in October and December 2007; (3) father failed to provide any verification of his attendance at AA meetings; and (4) father\u2019s alcohol use causes him to \u201cact out\u201d toward the children, which scares them. In other words, the state contends that \u201cthere is sufficient evidence in the record to establish by a preponderance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>of the evidence that father\u2019s alcohol dependence and his unwillingness to participate in treatment pose a reasonable likelihood of harm to the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Although we find this to be a close case, we conclude that the court erred. Father\u2019s refusal to participate in treatment is a serious concern, as is his refusal to provide UAs, and we do not mean to downplay the importance or the wisdom of the court\u2019s recommendations. Further, we recognize that drinking to excess can be harmful or dangerous to children and that father\u2019s continued sobriety is not guaranteed. We are nonetheless persuaded that the state did not produce sufficient evidence in this case. It bears repeating that \u201c[t]he key inquiry * * * is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, there is a reasonable likelihood of harm to the welfare of the child.\u201d <em>T. </em>S., 214 Or App at 191. Here, we perceive little if any evidence that father\u2019s condition was harmful to the children in the past. From the record, we learn that he \u201cact[ed] out\u201d when he drank, that his conduct when drinking frightened the children, and that drinking made him mean and \u201ccontrolling.\u201d Obviously, that is not ideal parenting. However, without more, it is not inherently or necessarily more harmful or dangerous than other varieties of parenting that would, by no stretch of the imagination, justify state intervention into the parent-child relationship. Passing out is a different matter; had father been the only caregiver in the home when that occurred, we would readily conclude that doing so endangered the welfare of the children. However, at all relevant times, father was living with Tabitha, a nondrinker, and there is no evidence that she was not in the home when father drank himself unconscious.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">More importantly, however, even if we were convinced that father\u2019s condition <em>did </em>endanger the welfare of the children before October 2007, we are not persuaded that, at the time of the hearing, a preponderance of the evidence supported the conclusion that the children were still at risk. \u201c[Gjiving considerable weight to the [credibility] findings of the trial judge who * * * observe[d] the -witnesses and their demeanor,\u201d <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Geist, </em>310 Or 176, 194, 796 P2d 1193 (1990), we, like the juvenile court, find Tabitha\u2019s testimony that father last used alcohol in December 2007, 10 months before the hearing, credible, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>the state does not dispute that evidence. The state\u2019s second allegation, that, \u201cdespite prior services offered * * * through DHS and other agencies, * * * father has been unable and/or unwilling to overcome the impediments to his ability to provide safe, adequate care to\u201d the children, fares no better. The only evidence presented by the state regarding father\u2019s risk of relapse was an OnTrack evaluation, then one and one-half years old, in which Cooper stated that father\u2019s risk of relapse at that time had been \u201csevere\u201d due to his denial that he had an alcohol problem and resulting unwillingness to change. But the state has failed to show that any such risk existed when the hearing took place; rather, the undisputed evidence is that father last used alcohol 10 months earlier and had since made the decision not to drink \u201cfor [himjself, for [his] children, [and] to better [his] life.\u201d Moreover, to the extent that father\u2019s parenting when sober was an issue, we find that his successful completion of the parenting program alleviates that concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">We thus conclude that, under the totality of the circumstances, the state has failed to show a reasonable likelihood of harm to the welfare of the children. As noted above, our focus in determining whether the court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction was proper is on \u201cthe <em>child[ren]\u2019s </em>condition or circumstances,\u201d <em>T. S., </em>214 Or App at 191 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original), not on how \u201cfair\u201d the court\u2019s decision is to \u201cother people\u201d or on father\u2019s obstinacy and failure to comply with specific DHS directives. Because the state has not shown that father was using alcohol at the time of the dependency hearing, nor that he was then at risk of relapsing, nor that a relapse was likely to endanger the children\u2019s welfare, it has failed to meet its burden. ORS 419B.100(l)(c). Accordingly, we conclude that the court erred in extending jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-6\"> Father also argues that the juvenile court erred in its disposition of the case, ORS 419B.325, by placing the children in the legal custody of DHS, ORS 419B.337, and granting guardianship of the children to DHS, ORS 419B.370. Because we conclude that the juvenile court erred in exercising jurisdiction, we need not address father\u2019s alternative argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
