He appeals, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s failure to secure a written waiver of his right to a jury trial, in violation of Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution. The state agrees that the trial court failed to obtain a written jury waiver and that we must reverse and remand on the ground that the failure amounts to plain error. We agree that the failure to obtain a written jury waiver is reversible error and that defendant\u2019s failure to object at trial does not preclude our review \u2014 and correction \u2014 of that error. <em>State v. Barber, </em>343 Or 525, 530, 173 P3d 827 (2007) (appellate court may not elect to refuse to recognize failure to comply with written jury waiver requirement of Article I, section 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
