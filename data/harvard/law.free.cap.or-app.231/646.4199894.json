Claimant has a compensable occupational disease that renders him partially disabled. He was initially awarded a permanent partial disability award of $82,828.98. Employer disagreed with the impairment findings that gave rise to the award, and sought administrative review. Ultimately, on July 20, 2006, the DCBS Appellate Review Unit issued an order on reconsideration, awarding claimant an additional $54,685.02 \u2014 that is, a total award of $137,514.00. On July 25, 2006, pursuant to ORS 656.230(1), claimant transmitted to employer an application for a lump sum payment, requesting that he be paid the balance of his award. Specifically, claimant filled out and transmitted to employer DCBS Form 1174, a form created by DCBS for the purpose of facilitating a claimant\u2019s request for a lump sum payment. Form 1174 includes a waiver by the claimant of his or her right to appeal the adequacy of an award and instructs the employer\u2019s insurer that, if it objects to the payment of the award in a lump sum, it must state its reasons for objecting in the space provided and forward its response to the director of the DCBS within 14 days. Employer did not pay claimant or respond to the application within that time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">On August 22, claimant filed a request for a hearing in which he sought an order compelling the lump sum payment and assessing penalties and attorney fees against employer for its unreasonable resistance and delay. A hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) was scheduled for November 16.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Employer\u2019s insurer paid the lump sum award on August 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Claimant argued to the ALJ that employer had violated OAR 436-060-0060 (2006) and ORS 656.230(1) by failing to either pay the lump sum award or state its objection to doing so in a timely manner and urged the ALJ to impose penalties and fees against employer. Following the hearing, the ALJ concluded that employer had not unreasonably resisted payment of the lump sum award because employer had not yet waived its right to appeal the adequacy of the lump sum award when claimant requested the payment. The ALJ reasoned that the requirement in ORS 656.230(1) that \u201cthe award has become final by operation of law or waiver of the right to appeal its adequacy\u201d requires waiver by both the claimant and the employer. He issued an order denying claimant\u2019s request for penalties and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Claimant appealed the AL J\u2019s decision, and the board affirmed. The relevant portion of the board\u2019s order is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">\u201c \u2018[W]aiver\u2019 of the right to appeal the <em>award </em>rests not only with claimant, but also with the insurer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">\u201cClaimant asserts that the term \u2018adequacy\u2019 implies an intent by the legislature to limit the \u2018right to appeal\u2019 to the worker. However, to interpret the statute as claimant suggests would require inserting language into the statute. Specifically, the statute would have to be read to provide <em>\u2018claimant\u2019s </em>waiver of the right to appeal its adequacy.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-8\">\u201cMoreover, to do so would render ORS 656.268(6)(g) [allowing either party to appeal from an order on reconsideration] meaningless. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-9\">\u201cHere, claimant was awarded PPD [permanent partial disability] via Order on Reconsideration. * * *. Yet, when claimant filed his \u2018lump sum\u2019 application, the insurer was still within its 30-day statutory right to appeal * * * pursuant to ORS 656.268(6)(g). Therefore, because the PPD award had not become final by operation of law, nor had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>insurer waived its right to appeal the adequacy of the award, the conditions necessary for the application of ORS 656.230(1) had not occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">(Emphasis in original.) In ruling in employer\u2019s favor, the board acknowledged that the applicable administrative rule, OAR, 436-060-0060 (2006), required only that the worker\u2014 not the employer \u2014 waive his or her right to appeal the adequacy of the award before a request could be made for lump sum payment pursuant to ORS 656.230(1). However, the board \u201cdecline[d] to interpret OAR 436-060-0060(1) [(2006)] in a manner that would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme [of ORS 656.230(1) and ORS 656.268(6)(g)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">On judicial review, claimant argues that the board erred in concluding that ORS 656.230(1) requires both parties to waive their rights to appeal, that OAR 436-060-0060 (2006) impermissibly altered ORS 656.230(1), and that OAR 436-060-0060 (2006) conflicted with employer\u2019s right to appeal pursuant to ORS 656.268(6)(g). Employer argues that the board\u2019s construction of ORS 656.230(1) and its conclusion that OAR 436-060-0060 (2006) conflicted with the statutory scheme were both correct. For the reasons expressed below, we conclude that the board\u2019s construction of ORS 656.230(1) was erroneous and that the \u201cwaiver of the right to appeal its adequacy\u201d language in the statute requires waiver only by the claimant. We also conclude that OAR 436-060-0060 (2006) is a proper implementation of ORS 656.230(1) and does not impermissibly alter the terms of that statute. Finally, we conclude that the provision in OAR 436-060-0060 (2006) that allows a claimant to request a lump sum payment before the employer has waived its right to appeal does not conflict with the statutory provision in ORS 656.268(6)(g) that allows either party to appeal an order on reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\"> The question presented by claimant\u2019s petition\u2014 whether the statutory reference to appealing the \u201cadequacy\u2019 of a lump sum award applies to both the claimant and the employer or only to the claimant \u2014 requires us to interpret ORS 656.230(1). To construe ORS 656.230(1), we first examine the text of the statute in context. <em>See State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). \u201cAfter examining the text <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>and context, even if we do not perceive an ambiguity in the statute\u2019s text, we will consult legislative history that has been proffered by a party where that legislative history appears useful to our analysis.\u201d <em>State v. Blair, </em>230 Or App 36, 47, 214 P3d 47 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">In this case, the text and context of the statute are dispositive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The relevant portion of ORS 656.230(1) provides that a claimant may request payment of a lump sum award when the right to appeal the \u201cadequacy\u201d of the award has been waived. The dictionary defines adequacy as \u201cthe quality or state of being adequate.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>25 (unabridged ed 2002). \u201cAdequate,\u201d in turn, is defined in part as \u201cproportionate to, or fully sufficient for a specified or implied requirement; <em>often </em>: narrowly or barely sufficient : no more than satisfactory[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>(italics in original). In the context of a workers\u2019 compensation award for a permanent partial disability, to argue that a monetary award is inadequate or insufficient is to argue that the award is not large enough. For that reason, the phrase \u201cwaiver of the right to appeal its adequacy\u201d logically applies only to the claimant in a workers\u2019 compensation case, where only the claimant receives an award and only the claimant would dispute the amount of the award by challenging its adequacy. Because we conclude that only a claimant can appeal an award\u2019s adequacy, only a claimant can waive his or her right to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">As a general rule, we assume that the legislature did not intend any portion of a statute to be meaningless surplus-age. <em>See Friends of Yamhill County v. Yamhill County, </em>229 Or App 188, 193, 211 P3d 297 (2009). The board\u2019s construction of ORS 656.230(1) impermissibly rewrites the statute by failing to give effect to the words \u201cits adequacy.\u201d ORS 174.010 provides that, in construing a statute, we may not \u201cinsert what has been omitted\u201d or \u201comit what has been inserted.\u201d If the legislature had intended to require that an employer waive its right to appeal the award before a claimant could request a lump sum payment, it could easily have written the statute to require a \u201cwaiver of the right to appeal [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>award]\u201d instead of a \u201cwaiver of the right to appeal [the award\u2019s] adequacy^]\u201d We conclude that the legislature used the term \u201cadequacy\u201d to indicate its intent to allow a claimant to request a lump sum payment after the award has become final by operation of law or by the claimant\u2019s waiver of his or her right to seek an increase in the amount awarded. The board thus erred in its construction of ORS 656.230(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">It follows from our conclusion concerning the proper construction of ORS 656.230(1) that the board erred in declining to enforce OAR 436-060-0060 (2006). <em>See, e.g., Meltebeke v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>322 Or 132, 157, 903 P2d 351 (1995) (\u201c[R]ules have the effect of statutory law.\u201d (Citing <em>Bronson v. Moonen, </em>270 Or 469, 476, 528 P2d 82 (1974).)). Because ORS 656.230(1) requires only a claimant\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal, OAR 436-060-0060 (2006) did not impermissibly alter the terms of ORS 656.230(1) by explicitly providing that a claimant may request a lump sum payment after waiving his or her right to challenge the adequacy of the award. Moreover, the language in ORS 656.230(1) and OAR 436-060-0060 (2006) that requires an employer to pay a lump sum award or state its reason for objecting to the payment of a lump sum award does not conflict with an employer\u2019s right to appeal an order on reconsideration under ORS 656.268(6)(g). Employer could have informed the director that it objected to the payment of the lump sum award because it intended to appeal the award or was still considering whether to appeal. Instead, employer chose not to respond to claimant\u2019s request for a lump sum payment. We agree with claimant that requiring employer to state its reasons for objecting to the payment in the space provided for doing so on Form 1174 and transmit it to the director does not burden employer\u2019s right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Accordingly, the board erred in concluding that OAR 436-060-0060 (2006) conflicted with ORS 656.268(6)(g). It similarly erred in concluding that the rule impermissibly altered ORS 656.230(1). We therefore conclude that the board erred in declining to enforce OAR 436-060-0060 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">In sum, the board erred in its construction of ORS 656.230(1), in its conclusion that OAR 436-060-0060 (2006) impermissibly altered ORS 656.230(1), and in its conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>that OAR 436-060-0060 could not be applied in a manner that would not conflict with employer\u2019s statutory right to appeal the order on reconsideration. We remand for the board to reconsider its denial of claimant\u2019s claim for penalties and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-5\"> ORS 656.262(11)(a) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">\u201cIf the insurer or self-insured employer unreasonably delays or unreasonably refuses to pay compensation, or unreasonably delays acceptance or denial of a claim, the insurer or self-insured employer shall be liable for an additional amount up to 25 percent of the amounts then due plus any attorney fees assessed under this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b692-7\"> ORS 656.382(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">\u201cIf an insurer or self-insured employer refuses to pay compensation due under an order of an Administrative Law Judge, board or court, or otherwise unreasonably resists the payment of compensation, except as provided in ORS 656.385, the employer or insurer shall pay to the claimant or the attorney of the claimant a reasonable attorney fee * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b692-9\"> ORS 656.230(1) (2005) was amended by Oregon Laws 2007, chapter 270, section 1.
