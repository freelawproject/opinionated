On appeal, defendant argues (1) that the record does not establish that his conduct was willful and (2) that his conduct did not occur in the court\u2019s presence. <em>See </em>ORS 33.096 (providing, in part, that \u201c[a] court may summarily impose a sanction upon a person who commits a contempt of court in the immediate view and presence of the court\u201d); ORS 33.015(2) (defining contempt as particular acts \u201cdone willfully\u201d). A discussion of the facts would be of no benefit to the bench, the bar, or the public. The state concedes that the record does not contain evidence that defendant\u2019s conduct was willful. <em>See Patchett and Patchett, </em>156 Or App 69, 72, 964 P2d 1114 (1998) (reversing a trial court\u2019s determination that \u201cwife is guilty of contempt because the record does not support a finding that wife violated the dissolution judgment willfully\u201d). Based on our review of the record, we agree that the record contains no evidence that defendant\u2019s conduct was willful and accept the state\u2019s concession. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of contempt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-5\"> In light of our disposition, we need not address defendant\u2019s alternative contention that his conduct did not occur in the court\u2019s presence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
