For the assault, the trial court sentenced him to 55 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by 24 months\u2019 post-prison supervision. Defendant did not object to the sentence. He now appeals, assigning error to the imposition of the sentence, which he contends violates OAR 213-005-0002(4). That rule provides that a \u201cterm of post-prison supervision, when added to the prison term, shall not exceed the statutory maximum indeterminate sentence for the crime of conviction.\u201d In this case, defendant contends, he was convicted of a Class C felony, which carries a maximum indeterminate sentence of 60 months. ORS 161.605(3). That means that his sentence of 55 months\u2019 imprisonment plus 24 months\u2019 post-prison supervision \u2014 totaling 79 months\u2014 exceeds the 60-month maximum. The state concedes that the sentence plainly violates OAR 213-005-0002(4) and that the case must be remanded for resentencing. We agree and accept the concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
