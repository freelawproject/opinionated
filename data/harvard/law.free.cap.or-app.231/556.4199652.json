Both counts alleged the same entry of a home owned by a husband and wife, but the counts alleged separate crimes against each owner. On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in failing to merge his convictions for first-degree burglary (Counts 4 and 5) because the homeowners were a single victim for purposes of the burglary statute. ORS 161.067(2)(e) (joint owners are a single victim for determining the number of separate burglary convictions). The state concedes that the trial court erred in that regard, and we agree and accept the concession. <em>State v. Sanchez-Alfonso, </em>224 Or App 556, 198 P3d 946 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 258 (2009). On remand, the trial court should enter a judgment merging the two convictions for first-degree burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Defendant raises a number of other contentions regarding his convictions and sentences.
