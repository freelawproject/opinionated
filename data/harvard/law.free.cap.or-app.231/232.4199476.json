ORS 813.010. He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence of his blood alcohol content obtained after he consented to a blood draw. Defendant argues that the blood draw was obtained in violation of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons explained below, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">We review the denial of a motion to suppress for errors of law and are bound by the trial court\u2019s factual findings that are supported by sufficient evidence in the record. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 74-75, 854 P2d 421 (1993). Thus, we take the salient facts in this case primarily from the trial court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Defendant was involved in a single-car accident on Naito Parkway in Portland; he suffered injuries and was transported to the hospital emergency room facilities at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU). Officer Oelke, the first officer on the scene, arrived at approximately 1:52 a.m. Officer Ladd arrived a few minutes later and took over the investigation. By 2:10 a.m., Ladd concluded that there was probable cause to believe that defendant had committed the crime of DUII. Ladd then went to OHSU to investigate further.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">After Ladd\u2019s arrival, hospital personnel allowed him to enter the emergency room facilities through a locked entry door, and he was directed by security staff to \u201cemergency room two.\u201d Defendant was alone in the room, \u201clying on a hospital bed receiving some care.\u201d There was a very strong smell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>of alcohol in the room. Defendant, snoring loudly and in a deep sleep, was slow to wake. Ladd asked defendant several questions to evaluate his comprehension. Ladd explained why he was there and that defendant was under arrest for DUII and reckless driving. He gave defendant <em>Miranda </em>warnings and asked defendant questions from the standard DUII Interview Report form. Defendant responded to the questions slowly but directly. Ladd testified that defendant \u201cunderstood he\u2019d bee[n] in a wreck, knew where he was, he was in Portland at the hospital * * *. So he was fully aware of his situation, surroundings and why he was at the hospital.\u201d Then Ladd read defendant his Driver and Motor Vehicle Services Division \u201cimplied consent rights and consequences\u201d and asked defendant if he would like to take a blood test.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant agreed to take the test, and Ladd summoned a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>nurse who administered the test, extracting defendant\u2019s blood at 3:18 a.m.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Defendant was charged with reckless driving and DUII. He moved to suppress the evidence obtained by the officer at the hospital, arguing that it was obtained in violation of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The trial court denied the motion, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\">\u201cThe state established its burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant\u2019s consent to have his blood drawn and analyzed was given voluntarily based on the totality of the circumstances. The state did not meet its burden, however, with respect to the second proffered exception to the warrant requirement, <em>i.e. </em>the existence of probable cause and exigent circumstances. More specifically, the state failed to prove that the evidence it sought would have been sacrificed by the time it would take the officers to obtain a search warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Based on that ruling, defendant entered a conditional plea of guilty, reserving the right to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">On appeal, defendant advances three arguments in support of his assignment of error. First, he argues that his warrantless arrest in the hospital room was unlawful and that all of the evidence obtained in the hospital room should be suppressed, including evidence of the results of the blood test, his physical appearance, and his admissions. Next, defendant contends that the state did not prove that he voluntarily consented to the blood test so as to excuse the need for a search warrant. Third, and finally, he asserts that the state failed to prove that a warrant was not necessary due to exigent circumstances, specifically that evidence of his intoxication would have been lost by the time a warrant was obtained. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">First, defendant submits that his arrest was unlawful because an arrest warrant was needed before entering the emergency treatment room. Defendant explains that he had a protected privacy interest in the hospital room setting analogous to that enjoyed in one\u2019s home. That argument is controlled by our decision in <em>State v. Cromb, </em>220 Or App 315, 185 P3d 1120, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 381 (2008), which was decided after briefing and oral argument in the present case. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number><em>Cromb, </em>we rejected the contention that the defendant had a constitutionally protected privacy interest, under either the state or federal constitution, in the area of the emergency room where he was being treated and that the officer\u2019s entry into that area and his observations of the defendant\u2019s condition constituted a warrantless search that violated that interest. <em>Id. </em>at 319, 327. The defendant in <em>Cromb </em>relied on state statutory policies on the unauthorized disclosure of medical information to buttress the claim of a protected privacy interest. <em>Id. </em>at 320. We noted that \"with a few possible exceptions, privacy interests can be recognized only by their association with a <em>private </em>place where the claimant has the right to exclude others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325 (emphasis in original). We concluded that \u201c[t]he hospital emergency room in this case, even a curtained-off portion of it, is not a private place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">That same result obtains here. Ladd was admitted to defendant\u2019s treatment area by hospital staff. Defendant had no right to restrict access to his treatment area by controlling whether police officers might be present there. The area was associated with the hospital emergency room and was not provided to defendant for his sole use. We conclude that <em>Cromb </em>is controlling and reject defendant\u2019s argument without further discussion. Defendant\u2019s arrest was lawful, and the trial court did not err in failing to suppress evidence of Ladd\u2019s observations in the hospital treatment room during the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The next question is whether particular evidence\u2014 defendant\u2019s blood \u2014 was seized in accordance with defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. Article I, section 9, provides that \u201c[n]o law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure * * *.\u201d \u201cThe extraction of a blood sample by the police is both a search of the person and a seizure of an \u2018effect\u2019 \u2014 the person\u2019s blood.\u201d <em>State v. Milligan, </em>304 Or 659, 664, 748 P2d 130 (1988). Warrantless searches and seizures are <em>per se </em>unreasonable unless the state proves an exception to the warrant requirement. <em>State v. Bridewell, </em>306 Or 231, 235, 759 P2d 1054 (1988). The state contends that the search and seizure were reasonable because defendant gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>consent and alternatively because it fell within the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Defendant argues that his consent was coerced and cannot be regarded as a free exercise of his will. The consent was coerced, according to defendant, because it was obtained after he was warned that he would incur substantial penalties if he did not consent. The trial court recognized that the implied consent proclaimed by ORS 813.100 \u201ccannot be regarded as a free exercise of will.\u201d The trial court concluded that defendant\u2019s consent was voluntary, however, after reviewing the factors that contribute to a determination of voluntariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">In reviewing the voluntariness of a person\u2019s consent to a search, \u201c[w]e are not bound by the trial court\u2019s ultimate holding as to voluntariness, * * * [but] assess anew whether the facts suffice to meet constitutional standards.\u201d <em>State v. Stevens, </em>311 Or 119, 135, 806 P2d 92 (1991). The proper test for voluntariness is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the consent was given by an act of free will or was the result of coercion, express or implied. <em>State v. Dimeo, </em>304 Or 469, 474, 747 P2d 353 (1987); <em>State v. Wolfe, </em>295 Or 567, 572, 669 P2d 320 (1983). The state bears the burden of proving voluntariness by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>State v. Paulson, </em>313 Or 346, 351-52, 833 P2d 1278 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The relevant factors to be considered in determining the voluntariness of consent include (1) whether physical force was used or threatened; (2) whether weapons were displayed; (3) whether the consent was obtained in public; (4) whether the person who gives consent was the subject of an investigation; (5) the number of officers present; (6) whether the atmosphere surrounding the consent was antagonistic or oppressive; and (7) whether drug or alcohol use has impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to make a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent choice. <em>State v. Larson, </em>141 Or App 186, 198, 917 P2d 519, <em>rev den, </em>324 Or 229 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Some of those factors suggest that defendant\u2019s consent was not voluntary. Defendant gave consent after he was placed under arrest, shortly after being injured in an automobile accident, and while under the influence of alcohol. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>the other hand, defendant\u2019s assent did not result from the use of physical force or the display of weapons. What is determinative in this context, however, is that the consent was procured through a threat of economic harm and loss of privileges. It was obtained only after defendant was given the warnings required by ORS 813.130(2) about the consequences of a refusal to allow a blood test. Under <em>State v. Newton, </em>291 Or 788, 801, 636 P2d 393 (1981), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Spencer, </em>305 Or 59, 750 P2d 147 (1988), a consent to search obtained in that fashion is coerced by the fear of adverse consequences and is ineffective to excuse the requirement to obtain a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">In <em>Newton, </em>the defendant was arrested for DUII and was asked to take a Breathalyzer test. He responded by asking for an opportunity to telephone counsel. The officer interpreted defendant\u2019s request as a refusal, and he read to the defendant from the implied consent statutes, including the legal consequences of failing to submit to the test. Before trial, the defendant moved to suppress the results of the Breathalyzer test. The trial court granted his motion on the grounds that \u201cdefendant was entitled to a telephone call to consult with a lawyer before taking the test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The Supreme Court reversed. The plurality opinion by Justice Tanzer was joined by Chief Justice Denecke and Justice Campbell. The opinion first analyzed whether suppression of the evidence was warranted under Article I, section 9, because it was obtained without a search warrant. It concluded that the consent for the search and seizure was coerced, but that the search and seizure was justified because there was probable cause to search and a warrant was excused by exigent circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 800-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">After reviewing the history and purpose of Oregon\u2019s implied consent law, a plurality of the court noted that \u201cthe consent envisioned by the statute is to be implied and if submission is not forthcoming, it is to be coerced by fear of adverse consequences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 799-800. In concluding that the \u201c[defendant's statutorily implied consent cannot excuse an otherwise unconstitutional seizure!,]\u201d the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">\u201cWhere a person\u2019s consent to a seizure is solicited, and the person consents only after being warned that he will suffer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>a substantial penalty if he refuses, the resulting consent cannot be regarded as a free exercise of will. We therefore hold that defendant\u2019s submission to the breath test was not a voluntary consent to seizure because it was coerced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 801. The plurality opinion found that the warrantless search was nonetheless \u201cnot forbidden by * * * Article I, section 9, because there was both probable cause to believe that defendant\u2019s breath contained evidence of intoxicants and exigent circumstances making it likely that the evidence would dissipate if time were taken to obtain a warrant for its seizure.\u201d Id. at 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The opinion further noted that the constitutional limitations on unreasonable searches and seizures did not prevent a compelled extraction of blood \u201cover the refusal of the person and the objection of his lawyer.\u201d <em>Newton, </em>291 Or at 801. It then held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">\u201cthe police could have lawfully compelled defendant to provide a breath sample for testing regardless of whether defendant called a lawyer and regardless of whether defendant had refused to submit to the seizure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">\u201c* * * No right of counsel is implied by the right of freedom from unreasonable seizures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Finally, the <em>Newton </em>plurality determined that the state need not allow consultation with an attorney before a breath test under the Article I, section 11, right to counsel \u201cin all criminal prosecutions.\u201d It concluded that the criminal prosecution only commences at the time of the \u201cformal charge\u201d of the crime. 291 Or at 804-05. The plurality found, however, that the threat of adverse consequences if the defendant telephoned counsel was a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but that the constitutional violation did not require the exclusion of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 808-09. The court reversed the suppression order. <em>Id. </em>at 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">Justice Tongue concurred \u201cin the result reached by the opinion by Tanzer, J.\u201d The concurrence, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>expressly questioned the \u201cholding that the right of a person arrested to call an attorney is a constitutional \u2018liberty\u2019 under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 813. Instead, Justice Tongue agreed with the dissent that the right to consult with counsel prior to a breath test was statutory in nature. <em>Id. </em>at 813-14. However, Justice Tongue would not have excluded the evidence because of a statutory violation. Id. at 814.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Thus, in light of <em>Newton </em>and the other factors discussed above (the facts that defendant had just been arrested, had been injured in a car accident, and was under the influence of intoxicants), defendant\u2019s consent was not voluntary for the purposes of Article I, section 9.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress on the basis that defendant voluntarily consented to the blood test.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The dissent asserts that we are not bound to the conclusion reached by the <em>Newton </em>plurality on the coercive consent issue for four reasons: (1) the conclusion was reached in a plurality opinion, not a majority opinion, of the Supreme Court; (2) the conclusion was not essential to the result reached by the court; (3) the conclusion has not been relied on in subsequent cases; and (4) the conclusion is wrong. 231 Or App at 248-50 (Haselton, J., dissenting). We share some of the dissent\u2019s misgivings on the abstract correctness of the conclusion reached in <em>Newton. </em>We do not decide whether a different result would obtain if other ingredients were added to the stew, factors that were not present in <em>Newton </em>and are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>not before us in this case, <em>e.g., </em>consultation of a defendant with counsel before granting consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">However, we cannot turn a blind eye, as the dissent suggests, to a determination by a majority of the Supreme Court that is labeled as a holding by the court and is relevant to the outcome reached by that majority and that has not been distinguished, questioned, or implicitly overturned in subsequent opinions of that court. 231 Or App at 248-50 (Haselton, J., dissenting). First, the force of the plurality opinion in <em>Newton </em>on Article I, section 9, issues is not dissipated by a concurrence that quibbles with the plurality on <em>different issues </em>arising under Article I, section 11, and the Due Process Clause. Justice Tongue\u2019s concurrence begins:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">\u201cI concur in the result reached by the opinion by Tanzer, J. I question, however, its holding that the right of a person arrested to call an attorney is a constitutional \u2018liberty\u2019 under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. No such contention was made by defendant in this case. I agree that a person arrested has a right to call an attorney, but am not prepared to hold at this time that such a right is a constitutional \u2018liberty\u2019 under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-7\"><em>Newton, </em>291 Or at 813. That concurrence states no difference with the plurality on the first of two issues decided in the case \u2014 that suppression of the evidence was not required under Article I, section 9. It is the reasoning of that part of the plurality opinion that we apply in this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Second, the plurality\u2019s conclusion on the coercive consent issue was important to that result under Article I, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>section 9, in two ways. The plurality concludes that the defendant\u2019s consent was ineffective to excuse the need to obtain a warrant in order to permit the breath test. That conclusion decided one of two arguments made by the state to support reversal of the suppression order under Article I, section 9, the other being that the warrant was not required because of exigent circumstances. Although it is true, as the dissent observes, that the court could have avoided analysis of the effectiveness of the defendant\u2019s consent and decided to reverse the suppression order under Article I, section 9, solely on the lack of exigent circumstances, <em>that is not what the court did. </em>Instead, it determined that the consent was involuntary and highlighted its conclusion as a holding: \u201cWe <em>therefore hold that </em>defendant\u2019s submission to the breath test was not a voluntary consent to seizure because it was coerced.\u201d <em>Newton, </em>291 Or at 801 (emphasis added). The dissent\u2019s classification of this conclusion as mere <em>dictum </em>is inconsistent with the express wording of the opinion. 231 Or App at 248, 249-50 (Haselton, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Moreover, the conclusion regarding coercive consent was then used by the plurality to make a third holding on the Article I, section 9, issues. According to the plurality, the absence of a valid consent amounted to a \u201crefusal\u201d by the defendant to take the breath test. The opinion concluded that \u201cneither [Article I, section 9, nor the Fourth Amendment] prohibits the police from compelling a person to submit to physical extraction of blood over the refusal of the person and the objection of his lawyer.\u201d <em>Newton, </em>291 Or at 801. The opinion then stated that the \u201cdominant constitutional principle of this case\u201d is that \u201cthe police could have lawfully compelled defendant to provide a breath sample for testing regardless of whether defendant called a lawyer <em>and regardless of whether defendant had refused to submit to the seizure. </em>Therefore, we conclude that the <em>search and seizure provisions of neither constitution </em>were violated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 802 (emphasis added). The absence of a valid consent or \u201crefusal to submit to the seizure\u201d was a necessary predicate to the court\u2019s holding that the \u201csearch and seizure provisions of neither constitution were violated.\u201d Contrary to the dissent\u2019s arguments, then, the coercive consent conclusion in the case was not <em>dictum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Third, it is immaterial that <em>Newton\u2019s </em>conclusion on the coercive nature of the implied consent disclosures has not been ratified in subsequent opinions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> What is more probative is that that conclusion has not been questioned or confined in subsequent decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court, notwithstanding the reversal of other parts of the <em>Newton </em>opinion in <em>Spencer. </em>Other Supreme Court decisions have applied a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test to assess whether a consent to search was voluntary. <em>See, e.g., Paulson, </em>313 Or at 351-52; <em>Stevens, </em>311 Or at 136; <em>Wolfe, </em>295 Or at 572. <em>Newton </em>should be understood consistently with that \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test. There may be circumstances where the coercive effect of the disclosures is mitigated sufficiently to allow a conclusion that the consent was voluntary. Those circumstances are not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">But to conclude, as does the dissent, that the coercive effect of the disclosures is immaterial to the question of whether defendant\u2019s consent was voluntary, because those disclosures are compelled by statute, gives an undue determinative effect to that factor in the constitutional equation. 231 Or App at 249-50 (Haselton, J., dissenting). Legislative choices have no such effect in other constitutional inquiries. And, as we have said, <em>Newton\u2019s </em>directive is quite to the contrary. We turn, then, to the question of whether the blood test can be justified on alternative grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Notwithstanding the ineffective consent to search and seize, the blood test could be justified as based on probable cause and the necessity to preserve the diminishing evidence of intoxication. Defendant responds that, although Ladd developed probable cause that he had committed DUII, the officer conceded that he could have obtained a telephonic search warrant in one hour. Defendant argues that, because one hour and eight minutes elapsed between the time when probable cause arose and when the blood was extracted, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>warrant could have been obtained without sacrificing evidence. For the reasons that follow, we agree with the trial court that the state failed to meet its burden to prove this exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">In order for the state to discharge that burden, in order to allow admission of a blood sample obtained without a warrant, the state must prove the following: (1) the police had probable cause to believe that defendant\u2019s blood contained evidence of a crime, <em>i.e., </em>alcohol, and that analysis of the blood would yield that evidence; (2) a warrant could not be obtained without sacrificing that evidence; and (3) the extraction was made promptly once defendant was taken to a place where the extraction could be made. <em>State v. Moylett, </em>313 Or 540, 548-49, 836 P2d 1329 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Ladd had probable cause to believe that defendant was intoxicated based on his investigation at the crime scene. The only issue is whether that evidence would have dissipated in the time that it took to obtain a search warrant. We recently observed in <em>State v. Kruse, </em>220 Or App 38, 42, 184 P3d 1182 (2008):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">\u201cIn the context of DUII, exigent circumstances may exist when police officers who have probable cause to arrest a suspect are confronted with a situation in which evidence of the suspect\u2019s intoxication will be destroyed by the natural dissipation of alcohol during the time it takes to secure a warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">\u201cThat does not mean, however, that warrants are not required in DUII cases. In <em>State v. Roberts, </em>75 Or App 292, 296, 706 P2d 564 (1985), for example, we held that the potential destruction of evidence may justify a warrantless entry into a suspect\u2019s home <em>\u2018if the state proves that the arresting officers could not have obtained a warrant before the alcohol in the suspect\u2019s body dissipated.\u2019 \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">(Citation omitted; emphasis in <em>Roberts.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">In this case, the state failed to prove that a warrant could not have been obtained within a reasonable time to secure the evidence. In fact, Ladd testified that, in his experience, a warrant could be obtained in as little time as one hour and that the blood was obtained from defendant one hour and eight minutes after Ladd developed probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>cause.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There was no testimony that Ladd could not have obtained a warrant given the demands of immediate and necessary tasks.

In the present case, defendant \u201cconsented\u201d immediately following Ladd\u2019s reading of the implied consent law and the request for a blood draw. He was told the substantial penalty he would suffer if he failed to consent, was asked to comply, and did so rather than risk further penalty.

Newton, </em>291 Or 788, 801, 636 P2d 393 (1981), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Spencer, </em>305 Or 59, 750 P2d 147 (1988). That aspect of the <em>Newton </em>plurality is not binding, has never been cited, much less ratified, in the intervening 28 years, and is patently wrong. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">In holding that defendant\u2019s consent to the blood draw was not voluntary, the majority opinion concludes that the \u201cdeterminative\u201d consideration was that \u201cthe consent was procured through a threat of economic harm and loss of privileges. It was obtained only after defendant was given the warnings required by ORS 813.130(2) about the consequences of a refusal to allow a blood test.\u201d 231 Or App at 240.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>That conclusion is, in turn, ultimately predicated on a single sentence in the <em>Newton </em>plurality opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">\u201c \u2018Where a person\u2019s consent to a seizure is solicited, and the person consents only after being warned that he will suffer a substantial penalty if he refuses, the resulting consent cannot be regarded as a free exercise of will.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">231 Or App at 240-41 (quoting <em>Newton, </em>291 Or at 801).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The majority\u2019s treatment of that statement as immutably binding is erroneous. That is so, jurisprudentially and practically, for any of several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">First, that statement was made in a plurality opinion, not a majority opinion, of the Supreme Court. Three justices, including the author, Justice Tanzer, joined in the <em>Newton </em>plurality. Justice Tongue, \u201cspecially concurring,\u201d \u201cconcurred] in the <em>result </em>reached by the opinion by Tanzer, J.,\u201d 291 Or at 813 (emphasis added), without any reference to the plurality opinion\u2019s treatment of \u201cconsent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Further, in concurring in the plurality\u2019s \u201cresult,\u201d Justice Tongue did not, by necessary implication, join in the plurality\u2019s \u201cholding\u201d with respect to consent. That is so because, even within the context of the <em>Newton </em>plurality, that opinion\u2019s treatment of consent was not essential to its <em>result </em>\u2014 viz., that the trial court had <em>erred </em>in <em>suppressing </em>the results of the defendant\u2019s breath test. The plurality, after concluding that the defendant\u2019s consent was not voluntary\u2014 a determination that militated <em>in favor of </em>suppression\u2014 proceeded, in the next paragraph, to conclude that the warrantless seizure of the defendant\u2019s breath sample was, nevertheless, constitutionally valid under the probable cause/ exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 801-02. Given that conclusion, the <em>Newton </em>plurality\u2019s treatment of consent was gratuitous.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">In the 28 years since <em>Newton, </em>neither the Supreme Court nor this court has ever ratified the plurality\u2019s gratuitous and conclusory treatment of consent. It is a barren <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>branch. Indeed, until today, no published opinion in the past 28 years has favorably cited that aspect of the <em>Newton </em>plurality.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">That is unsurprising, because the <em>Newton </em>plurality\u2019s treatment of consent was, and is, wrong. According to the <em>Newton </em>plurality, merely informing a suspect of the statutorily prescribed consequences of refusal is impermissibly \u201ccoercive.\u201d The upshot is that there can <em>never </em>be an enforceable consent for constitutional purposes when the police have complied with ORS 813.100(1) and ORS 813.130(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even if the defendant expressly consents, it is worthless as a constitutional matter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, if the <em>Newton </em>plurality\u2019s proposition were taken literally, it would preclude constitutionally effective consent <em>even after a DUII suspect consults with counsel, </em>because the \u201ccoercive\u201d effect of the statutorily prescribed warnings would impermissibly skew the suspect\u2019s calculus in determining whether to consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">That is not the law. Informing a citizen of statutorily prescribed consequences that will <em>as a matter of law </em>flow from a refusal is not, and cannot be deemed, impermissibly coercive for constitutional purposes. Contrary to the <em>Newton </em>plurality\u2019s unamplified <em>dictum, </em>we and the Supreme Court have repeatedly reiterated the principle that an accurate statement of lawful consequences is not coercive with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>to a defendant\u2019s consent to search. <em>See, e.g., State v. Hirsch, </em>267 Or 613, 622, 518 P2d 649 (1974) (quoting with approval Chief Justice O\u2019Connell\u2019s observation in dissent in <em>State v. Douglas, </em>260 Or 60, 81, 488 P2d 1366 (1971): \u201cBut not all coercion inducing consent to a search is constitutionally impermissible. If the officers threaten only to do what the law permits them to do, the coercion that the threat may produce is not constitutionally objectionable.\u201d); <em>State v. Bowen, </em>137 Or App 327, 331, 904 P2d 1076 (1995), <em>rev den, </em>323 Or 74 (1996) (\u201cUnder state law, consent is not involuntary simply because police threaten \u2018to do what the law permits them to do.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>State v. Williamson, </em>307 Or 621, 627, 772 P2d 404 (1989) (Carson, J., concurring) (some internal quotation marks omitted))).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><em>Smith v. Washington County, </em>180 Or App 505, 43 P3d 1171, <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 491 (2002), exemplifies that principle. There, we rejected a contention that submission to courthouse security screening procedures was coerced, not consensual, because citizens \u201care forced to submit as a condition of entering the courthouse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511. In so holding, we emphasized that \u201cvalid \u2018consent\u2019 occurs when a citizen submits to a search rather than face a disagreeable alternative <em>if </em>the choice to which the government puts the citizen is itself lawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512 (emphasis in original). <em>See also State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Stephens, </em>175 Or App 220, 227, 27 P3d 170 (2001) (noting that, when \u201ca defendant is confronted with the reality of what the law permits government officials to do if consent is refused,\u201d \u201c[tjhe decision whether to consent, when made in the face of such a legal reality, is not enough, in and of itself, to render the consent involuntary for constitutional purposes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The irony, of course, is that, under the majority\u2019s analysis, the state is \u201cdamned if it does, and damned if it doesn\u2019t\u201d: If officers convey the statutorily prescribed information, as mandated under ORS 813.100(1), it is impermissibly \u201ccoercive\u201d \u2014 and, if they do not, they have violated their statutory duties. The latter would, in turn, beget yet another irony: Because the failure to convey the statutorily prescribed consequences to a suspect who consents to a breath test or blood draw does not give rise to suppression, <em>see State v. Bloom, </em>216 Or App 245, 251-52, 172 P3d 663 (2007), <em>rev </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number><em>den, </em>344 Or 280 (2008), under the majority\u2019s analysis, the state is actually better off if police officers violate their statutory duties rather than comply with them. The <em>Newton </em>plurality did not, of course, acknowledge, much less grapple with, those fundamental incongruities.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">, In sum, the <em>Newton </em>plurality is neither binding nor correct with respect to the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s consent to the blood draw in this case. Rather, in the totality of the circumstances, defendant\u2019s consent was voluntary; accordingly, the warrantless seizure of defendant\u2019s blood was lawful. The trial court\u2019s denial of suppression must be affirmed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b279-5\">Landau, Armstrong, and Schuman, JJ., join in this dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-10\"> The majority opinion also referred to other circumstances, including that, at the time defendant consented to the blood draw, he was under arrest and under the influence of alcohol, and had been injured in the automobile accident shortly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>before. 231 Or App at 239-40. Not surprisingly, given that the first two of those circumstances are almost invariably present when a suspect consents to a blood draw or breath test \u2014 and the third is hardly unusual \u2014 the majority does not treat those circumstances individually, or collectively, as decisive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b277-6\"> ORS 813.100(1) provides, as pertinent, that, before \u201ca chemical test of the person\u2019s breath, or of the person\u2019s blood if the person is receiving medical care in a health care facility immediately after a motor vehicle accident\u201d is administered, \u201cthe person requested to take the test shall be informed of consequences and rights as described under ORS 813.130.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">ORS 813.130(2), in turn, prescribes the content of the \u201cinformation about rights and consequences,\u201d including the consequences of refusing or failing a test under ORS 813.100, <em>e.g., </em>inculpatory use of the refusal or failure, automatic suspension of driving privileges, and, in the case of refusal, impaired eligibility for a hardship permit and exposure to a fine of not less than $500 and not more than $1,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\"> Nevertheless \u2014 and somewhat incongruously \u2014 the administering officer would still be obligated, as a statutory matter, to confirm the suspect\u2019s willingness to submit to the breath test or blood draw. <em>See </em>ORS 813.100(2) (precluding administration of a \u201cchemical test of the person\u2019s breath or blood\u201d if the person refuses the request to submit after being \u201cinformed of consequences and rights as described under ORS 813.130\u201d); <em>see generally State v.

I would note, however, that the practical consequence of the majority\u2019s reasoning in that regard, see 231 Or App at 245-47, is that \u2014 because it is impossible to know at the outset how long it will take to actually obtain a blood sample or breath test \u2014 the state, as a prophylactic matter, would be obligated in virtually every case to obtain a warrant before administering a breath test or drawing blood.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
