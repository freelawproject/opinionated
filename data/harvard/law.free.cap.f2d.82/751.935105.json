No question concerning the bank account was propounded, but he was asked, \u201cDo you know Joseph Harmon?\u201d He declined to answer, claiming privilege against self-incrimination. The trial judge explained to him that an answer to that question could not incriminate him, and and the court committed him to jail until he should purge himself by answering questions which the court should direct him to answer. On the next trial day he was given an opportunity to purge himself. The same question was again propounded. He again refused to answer, Thereupon he was adjudged guilty of a contempt of court and was sentenced to six months in jail. From this judgment he has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-32\"> It is established law that, to justify silence under claim of the constitutional privilege, it must appear that the answer which might be given would have a direct tendency to incriminate. Mason v. United States, 244 U.S. 362, 37 S.Ct. 621, 61 L.Ed. 1198; United States v. Weinberg, 65 F.(2d) 394 (C.C.A.2); Abrams v. United States, 64 F.(2d) 22 (C.C.A.2). In the case at bar, whether the witness answered \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d to the question could not possibly incriminate him. If Joseph Harmon was, as alleged in the indictment, an alias of Flegenheimer, an affirmative answer would have been no more than an admission that the witness knew the defendant. The next question might well have been whether he knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>the defendant by the name of Harmon. As preliminary to proof .of the alias, it was a material and proper question. Whether Di Larmi could have been questioned about the bank account, we need not say, for he never was. The District Judge had informed Di Larmi that an answer to the question he was directed to answer could not incriminate him. His persistence in prematurely asserting the privilege and refusing to answer justified the court\u2019s finding of contumacy. -v</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
