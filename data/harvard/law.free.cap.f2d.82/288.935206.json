Exporters of Mfrs.\u2019 Products v. Butterworth-Judson Co., 258 U.S. 365, 42 S.Ct. 331, 66 L.Ed. 663. Judge Moscowitz sentenced the prisoners on April 1, 1935, and on April 29, 1935, extended the time within which to settle their bill of exceptions till May 17th. On October 29, 1935, he settled the bill of exceptions, but the. term had meanwhile lapsed. It is true that the appellants got a series of orders from a judge of this court ex parte, extending their time \u201cto file and 'serve\u201d their bill of exceptions, and we may assume arguendo that these orders meant to extend the time within which to \u201csettle\u201d the bill, although that was not the language; but rule IX (28 U.S.C.A. following section 723a) prescribes that it must be settled \u201cwithin thirty days after the taking of the appeal, or within such further time as within said period of thirty (30) days may be fixed by <em>the trial judge.\" </em>The \u201ctrial judge\u201d means the judge who tried the case, or \u201cin case of his absence from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the district, or disability, or death, any other judge assigned to hold, or holding, the court in which the case was tried.\u201d Rule XIII (28 U.S.C.A. following section 723a). Judge Moscowitz was not at any time absent or disabled, so far as appears, and only he had power to extend the time. We need not therefore consider the question whether under rule IX he had power to grant more than one extension, a question yet undecided.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"> Though the bill is for this reason not before us. we can hear the appeal under rule VIII (28 U.S.C.A. following section 723a) upon \u201cthe indictment and other pleadings and the orders, opinions, and judgment of the trial court, without a bill of exceptions.\u201d There is nothing to challenge in \u201cthe indictment or other pleadings,\u201d but perhaps the word \u201corders\u201d opens to our review an order made before trial which denied a motion to suppress certain documents seized from the possession of two of the defendants upon what they asserted to be an unlawful search. Assuming that this order is before us and that we could reverse it, it would do the appellants no good, for the papers are described only as \u201cthe contents of a steel cabinet file * * * and other personal papers, documents and other personal property.\u201d Without the bill of exceptions we have no means of knowing how important the papers were, whether any of them were used upon the trial, or whether they could have affected the result. We could not therefore reverse the convictions, if we would.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Judgments affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
