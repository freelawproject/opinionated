No. 1,680,818,\u201d and the following statement: \u201cThis bread brings you the extra Sunshine Vitamin-D you need\u201d; that on or about May 9, 1931, it also adopted as its trade-mark a, certain other \u201cdistinctive representation of the sun\u201d unassociated with any wording; that on or about December 15, 1931, the opposer also adopted as its trade-mark \u201ca distinctive representation of the sun\u201d and certain wording used in connection therewith, to wit, \u201cSunshine Vitamin-D Bread,\u201d and \u201cGuaranteed to. Contain Vitamin-D Sufficient for Normal Nutrition,\u201d and \u201cLicensed by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation under Steenbock Pat. No. 1,680,818,\u201d apd applied this trade-mark and the \u201cdistinctive representation of the sun,\u201d unassociated with any wording, thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">The notice of opposition also states, in paragraph 3 thereof, that the applicant, Commander-Larabee Corporation, represents that the flour known by the name \u201cSunfed\u201d contains vitamin D, and proposes to supply bakers purchasing its flour with advertising matter representing that bread made from the applicant\u2019s flour has been impregnated with vitamin D by a natural sunshine process; that it proposes to do so by featuring a mark printing such information within a representation of the sun on bread wrappers to be supplied to said bakers.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">Paragraph 4 of the notice of opposition is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b464-14\">\u201c4. Opposer is informed and believes: that applicant has never used the mark for which registration is sought upon white bread, whole wheat bread, or any kind of bread; that applicant is engaged in the business of making flour and selling the same to bakers and others desiring to purchase flour for making bread and other goods; that applicant has no connection with such purchasers of its flour other than that involved in the purchase and sale of the flour; that applicant has never engaged in the business of making or selling bread; that applicant is neither the owner of the bread on which the mark sought to be registered herein is applied, nor an agent authorized to sell or dispose of said bread.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-15\">The appellee-applicant answered the notice of opposition, denying that the representations of a sun in association with the wording used by the opposer, namely, \u201cLi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>censed by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation under Steenbock Pat. No. 1,680,818,\u201d and \u201cThis bread brings you the extra Sunshine Vitamin-D you need,\u201d constituted a trade-mark, and that the alleged \u201cdistinctive representation of the sun,\u201d associated with any wording, constituted a tyade-mark, and alleged that the said marks constituted merely a grade mark adopted for the sole purpose of indicating the grade, kind, style, or quality of the bread manufactured or sold by opposer under its trade-mark \u201cBond Bread.\u201d The answer further admits that the applicant manufactures and sells flour under the trade-mark \u201cSunfed,\u201d and that it proposes to supply bakers purchasing its said flour with advertising matter indicating that applicant\u2019s flour had been activated with vitamin D by a natural sunshine process.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The answer further denies specifically each and every allegation contained in paragraph numbered 4 of the notice of opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">By paragraph 10 of this answer the applicant alleges that it has used the mark \u201cSunfed\u201d on flour sold to bakers, to be baked into bread- for distribution to the public under the trade-mark \u201cSunfed,\u201d and continues: \u201cAnd applicant has carried out its said plan as a logical and natural expansion of its business and has <em>manufactured bread, crackers, macaroni, spaghetti and other flour products from \u2018Sunfed\u2019 flour and sold the same under its trademark \u2018Sunfed.\u2019\" </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Further answer is made as to matters which we will not find it necessary to allude to here.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The issues received careful and repeated consideration by the tribunals of the Patent Office. The Examiner of Interferences found and held that the marks of both parties are used on wheat bread; that the notation \u201cSunshine Vitamin-D\u201d performs a merely descriptive function, and is generally descriptive of the kind of bread manufactured by the opposer. The Examiner of Interferences was further of opinion that the General Baking Company was a licensee under the said Steenbock patent, and that other licensees under that patent might use the notation \u201cSunshine Vitamin-D\u201d in description of bread made by them. Therefore the Examiner of Interferences held that the opposer did not own the said mark within the meaning of the statutory language \u201cowned and used by another\u201d of the confusion in trade clause of section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, as amended (15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 85). He was further of the opinion that no confusion in trade would be likely by the concurrent use of the notations \u201cSunshine Vitamin-D\u201d and \u201cSun-fed.\u201d As to the contention of the opposer that applicant used its mark only on flour, and that the trade-mark used inured only to bakers who might bake the bread from such flour, the Examiner remarked: \u201cThe examiner is not persuaded that such use may not inure to the applicant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">The Commissioner of Patents, on appeal, affirmed- the decision of the Examiner of Interferences. In doing so, the Commissioner held that the Examiner of Interferences erred in finding that the use by General Baking Company of the notation \u201cSunshine Vitamin-D\u201d had been merely descriptive of its goods, from which it had derived no trade-mark ownership, and that, because of this, it could not successfully oppose the registration applied for. The Commissioner was of opinion that the validity of the opposer\u2019s mark was not a proper subject of inquiry, and that the opposer was not required to establish a strictly trade-mark use; that all that was required of the opposer was the showing of such a use as would support a finding of probable damage from the registration. The Commissioner was, however, of the opinion that the marks of the respective parties were not confusingly similar, although applied to identical goods. The Commissioner had the following to say on this subject:</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">\u201c * * * The notation \u2018Sunshine Vitamin-D\u2019 as applied to appellant\u2019s bread wrapper is surrounded with a heavy circular border pierced outwardly by a number of symmetrically-spaced, wedge-shaped points; but in the absence of the words the design itself would only vaguely suggest a representation of the sun. Applicant\u2019s mark, on the other hand, as shown by the specimen wrappers submitted with its application, is enclosed in an oblong border partly penetrated from within by a conventional design of light radiations. This may be said to represent the rays of the sun when viewed in association with the word \u2018Sunfed,\u2019 but certainly it could not be described as a representation of the sun. I am clearly of the opinion that no confusion could reasonably occur between the design features of the two marks, and that the question of deceptive similarity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>must therefore he determined from a comparison of the words and the manner of their application.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\u201cAppellant\u2019s bread wrapper conspicuously displays the word \u2018Bond,\u2019 printed in letters so large in comparison with those of the \u2018Sunshine Vitamin-D\u2019 mark as to render the latter relatively insignificant. The evidence clearly establishes that the \u2018Bond\u2019 mark has been used to identify appellant\u2019s product for over fifteen years when, in 1931, it incorporated vitamin D in its bread. That mark is still used as before, and the wrappers have not been materially changed except that -the' notation \u2018Sunshine Vitamin-D\u2019 has been added, according to appellant\u2019s president, \u2018to indicate to the purchasing public that Bond bread now contains \u2018Sunshine Vitamin-D.\u2019 On applicant\u2019s wrapper the word \u2018Sunfed\u2019 very strikingly predominates. It is many times larger than any other printed matter, and like \u2018Bond\u2019 on appellant\u2019s wrapper, constitutes the outstanding feature. In my opinion it would be necessary to inspect the two wrappers rather critically to -discover any similarity in language or design. Under these circumstances I am unable to believe that the concurrent use of the two marks under consideration would be likely to confuse the public or to damage appellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The Commissioner also discussed the contention of the opposer that the applicant had made no trade-mark use of its mark, and that registration should be therefore denied. As to this point the Commissioner was of opinion that such contention should not be upheld; that the contention of the opposer that the applicant had never used the mark for which registration was sought upon bread of any kind was denied in the answer, \u201cbut such denial was wholly unnecessary, for the averment in the notice put nothing in issue. Obviously what op-poser was informed, or what it believed, are matters with which neither the applicant nor the Patent Office is concerned.\u201d The Commissioner added that there was no evidence in the record to overcome the sworn statement found in the application as. to trade-mark use, \u201ceven were the matter properly pleaded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The opposer requested a reconsideration, which was granted, and again the Commissioner rendered an extended decision denying the rehearing. Rehearing was requested a second time, attached to the application for which was a series of interrogatories drawn, as it was claimed, and presented under Equity Rule 58 (28 U.S.C.A. following section 723). In response to this, the Commissioner rendered a further decision denying a second reconsideration, and refusing to reopen the case for the taking of further testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">From the three decisions of the Com* missioner, the opposer has prayed an appeal to this court. In this court the appellant moved to reopen the case, in the Patent Office and to require answer to said interrogatories, which motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">The appellant-opposer took the testimoney of one witness, Frederic PI. Frazier, chairman of the board of directors of the General Baking Company. This testimony shows the general facts as to the adoption of the appellant\u2019s mark and its use upon appellant\u2019s product and the extent of the advertising expenditures and campaigns. It shows, generally, that the opposer conducts a very large business in the sale of bread, which has been known since 1915 as \u201cBond Bread,\u201d and'has since been extended until it includes forty-nine operating plants scattered over the whole of the United States, with a gross sale, prior to 1930, of about 270,000,000 loaves of bread in a year. Large sums of money, approximating $12,000,000, were spent from 1915 to 1930 on advertising the brand known as \u201cBond Bread.\u201d In 1930 the company made contact with the Paediatric Research Foundation of Toronto, Canada, and undertook to operate under what was called the Steenbock patent, hereinbefore referred to, by means of which vitamin D was said to be incorporated into the bread manufactured by the opposer. Since that time, this practice has been extended until, as we understand the record, all bread now produced by the appellant is claimed to contain vitamin D. The company, at various times since that date, has had designs which are placed upon the wrappers used in selling its bread which were intended to convey to the purchaser the idea that the bread in said wrappers was \u201cSunshine Vitamin-D Bond Bread.\u201d Alleged imitations of the sun and varying forms of statements on the wrapper were used to convey this information. It is claimed by this witness that on account of this advertising the words \u201cSunshine Vitamin-D\u201d have come to indicate to the purchasing public that the bread so sold is Bond Bread. This witness was of the opinion that the use by appellee of the word \u201cSun-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>fed\u201d would damage and interfere with the business of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">No testimony was offered by the appellee, but notice was given under rule 154 (e) of the Patent Office that, in lieu of such testimony, appellee would rely on certain magazine articles and Patent Office records. The appellant\u2019s witness Frazier gave the only testimony which was offered by either side, as to the use, by appellee, of its mark \u201cSunfed\u201d on bread, in the following question and answer: \u201cQ. 139. Is Commander-Larabee Corporation engaged in the baking business? A. Not that I know of. Not commercial baking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">It is contended by the appellant that the record here affirmatively shows that the appellee is not entitled to registration of its mark \u201cSunfed.\u201d Appellant charges that the appellee did not make a trade-mark use of this mark, but was and is a manufacturer of flour only, and that the alleged trade-mark use consisted of the practice by appellee of furnishing labels containing its mark \u201cSunfed\u201d to bakers who baked bread from flour made by the appellee, and that the appellee itself was not engaged in the business of making and selling bread. Some consideration of the pleadings must be had in this connection. When the sworn application for registration was filed by the appellee, it had made a prima facie case which entitled it to registration, assuming that the mark was otherwise entitled to registration. Upon this verified application the Patent Office might have proceeded and issued a certificate of registration. In other words, the office was justified, under the law, in coming to the conclusion, from this application, that a proper trade-mark use of the mark had been established. When the appellant filed its notice of opposition, this was its bill or complaint. The answer of the applicant thereto, in law, was the answer to such bill or complaint, and thereafter the cause was at issue in the opposition proceeding. It was thereupon incumbent upon the opposer to overcome, by proof, the prima facie case of trade-mark use arising from the sworn application of the appellee. This sworn application was required by the law to be supported by labels which showed the trade-mark use by the appellee, and such labels appear in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The appellant contends it has overcome such prima facie case by the testimony of the witness Frazier which has been hereinbefore quoted. This witness stated, in answer to the inquiry, \u201cIs CommanderLarabee Corporation engaged in the baking business?\u201d \u201cNot that I know of. Not commercial baking.\u201d It cannot be said that this is sufficient to overcome the prima facie case arising from the sworn application and the accompanying labels. While the witness Frazier was engaged in the baking business, with a large number of business connections, it does not follow that, because he did not know of the appellee being engaged in the baking business, as a matter of fact it was not so engaged. A case in point is William Wrigley, Jr. &amp; Company v. Norris, 34 App.D.C. 138, 141, where it was said: \u201cThe sale of the. spearmint gum by the Huff Company covered such a wide area that the testimony of a few witnesses that they had never heard of .such sales falls far short of overcoming the case then made by the opposition. It follows that the decision of the Commissioner is right, and is therefore affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">We said in Montevallo Coal Mining Co. v. Little Gem Coal Co., 48 F.(2d) 411, 18 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1195, that a prima facie case was made from the applicant\u2019s sworn application that its mark was used by it as required by the statute, and that, when such prima facie case was rebutted, the burden was upon the applicant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence its exclusive use.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">The procedure in trade-mark opposition cases is quite fully developed by the Patent Office in Rosenberg Co. v. Phillips-Jones Company, Inc., 1921 C.D. 81, 289 O.G. 411. There the Assistant Commissioner, after citing several authorities, among which is William Wrigley, Jr. &amp; Company v. Norris, supra, thus well stated the law: \u201cAll this leads to the conclusion that the filing of a regular application for the registration of a trade-mark supported by an affidavit under section 2 and accompanied by specimens of the mark as actually used should be taken as prima facie proof that the applicant was the owner of the mark on the date the application was filed, and that fact having been established the presumption must arise that the applicant continued to own the mark and to use it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">It is argued by the appellee, and intimated by the Examiner of Interferences herein, that it is not essential that the owner of a trade-mark use the mark on gobds produced or manufactured by itself, but that the mark may be properly used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>upon his goods in fact manufactured and produced by others. There is ample authority for this position. Menendez v. Holt, 128 U.S. 514, 520, 9 S.Ct. 143, 32 L.Ed. 526; Ralston Purina Co. v. Saniwax Paper Co. et al. (D.C.) 26 F.(2d) 941. But, without going into this point further, it is sufficient to say that the court is of opinion the opposer has not overcome the prima facie case made by the applicant by its application and proofs submitted therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Many questions have been raised and discussed during this hearing which it is unnecessary to here- pass upon. For- instance, the right of the opposer to oppose was raised, and this question was decided adversely to the opposer by the Examiner of Interferences. The' decision of the Examiner of Interferences was, however, reversed by the Commissioner on this point; the Commissioner holding that upon the record the opposer had shown such use of his mark as entitled him to oppose. In view of our conclusions, we find it unnecessary to pass upon this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">This leaves for decision, therefore, but one question, whether the mark of the appellee, proposed to be registered, is so confusingly similar to the notation as applied to appellant\u2019s bread wrappers as to be likely to cause confusion as to origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The mark proposed to be registered by the appellee consists of the word \u201cSunfed.\u201d The various marks, as used by the appellant, are fully described by the Commissioner in the portion of the decision which we have hereinbefore quoted, and little need be added to what the Commissioner has therein stated. A copy of the wrapper which is used by the appellant to inclose the individual loaf of bread is before us. The surface of the wrapper is covered with a number of varying designs and marks. Principal among these is a label about 2\u00bd by <em>4\u00bc </em>inches in size. The printed matter of this label is inclosed by a border simulating the curvilinear design usually found on the margin of bonds, paper money, and the like, with a simulation of a seal wafer in the lower right-hand corner. This wafer is printed in redi while the border is in green. Across the red wafer are the words' \u201cBond Bread\u201d in white. Within the border is certain language in the form of a bond or obligation. The obligor is represented as the General Baking Company. The goods upon which the bond purports to be issued are described as \u201cBond Bread Trade Mark Reg. U. S. Pat. Off.,\u201d following which is a warranty by the General Baking Company of the purity and quality of the bread. The principal part of the reading matter consists of the words \u201cBond Bread,\u201d which are printed in letters approximately one-half inch in height; the remainder of the printed matter being in small sized type. Other labels upon the wrapper consist of a rectangular figure surrounded by a similar border, and containing the words, in large type, \u201cBond Bread,\u201d with a notation of the registration of the trade-mark. Interspersed between these labels are simulations of the sun, which consist of a number of red rays extending outwardly from the circumference of a circle. The central portion of this circular part contains the following language: \u201cThis bread brings you the extra Sunshine Vitamin-D you need,\u201d with additional wording around the periphery, \u201cLicensed by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation under Steenbock Pat. No. 1,680,818.\u201d The background of the center of this design is yellow. There are also small alleged representations of the .sun around the border, consisting of a yellow circular central portion with red rays radiating therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">It seems to us that the preponderating feature in these labels is the words \u201cBond Bread,\u201d and that the notation that \u201cThis bread brings you the extra Sunshine Vitamin-D you need\u201d are merely incidental to the words \u201cBond Bread.\u201d The use is not so much a trade-mark use as it is that of an advertisement or statement of the quality of the product. Lawrence Mfg. Co. v. Tennessee Mfg. Co., 138 U.S. 537, 546, 11 S.Ct. 396, 34 L.Ed. 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">We are of opinion that the purchaser would not be likely to become confused when desiring to purchase Bond Bread by the appearance of other bread which bore the label \u201cSunfed.\u201d Millions of dollars have been spent by the opposer-appellant in advertising its label \u201cBond Bread.\u201d Having become convinced in its business that it would add to the quality of its product by irradiating the bread with sunlight and thus producing vitamin D therein, this method was adopted and used, and has apparently become very successful. The mark which the appellee seeks to register is the mark which it has disclosed in the drawing accompanying its application, and consists of the word \u201cSunfed.\u201d While it is true that the labels which are offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>with the application contain, in addition to the word \u201cSunfed,\u201d an illustration of red rays radiating outward from this word, as we take it, the probable confusion in this case must rest upon the representation as sought by the appellee by the possible registration of the word \u201cSunfed.\u201d In re Standard Underground Cable Co., 27 App. D.C. 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">We agree with the tribunals below that no confusion in trade would likely arise, and are therefore of the opinion that the opposition was properly dismissed and that the tribunals of the Patent Office did not err in permitting registration of appellee\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The Commissioner held that the appellant had not put in issue by his pleading the failure of the appellee to show a trademark use of its mark. This was upon the theory that the allegation of the notice of opposition was stated only on information and belief. On this point, the Commissioner relied upon the authorities collated in 49 Corpus Juris, 148. In view of our conclusions, hereinbefore given, we do not find it necessary here to decide that question, and the point is reserved for future consideration, when its decision becomes necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Finally, it is alleged as error that the Commissioner did not reopen the case to permit the appellant to offer further testimony as to appellee\u2019s alleged failure to make a trade-mark use of the mark in question. Notice of opposition was filed June 28, 1932. Testimony was taken on behalf of appellant on February 20, 1933. Thereafter the matter was considered by the Examiner of Interferences and Commissioner of Patents, and repeatedly argued by the solicitors for the appellant. It was not until October 20, 1934, after the Commissioner had exhaustively examined the issues for a second time, that appellant petitioned for a reopening of the matter to take further testimony. As is well said by the Commissioner: \u201cOpposer had full opportunity at the proper time to take such testimony as it deemed material to its case, including that of applicant\u2019s officers which it now seems to think desirable. There must be an end to litigation, even in the Patent Office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">The allowance of this reopening was a matter within the discretion of the Commissioner. We find no abuse of this discretion in his refusal of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
