Commissioner, 79 F.(2d) 295, 297, certiorari denied Helvering v. Pennsylvania Co., 56 S.Ct. 310, 80 L.Ed. \u2014, where this court held: \u201cBeing of opinion the insured\u2019 could not change the beneficiary, surrender the policy for cash, or obtain loans thereon without consent of the beneficiary, it follows that his estate acquired no interest in the policy on his death,\u201d we-hold, in the present case, that the Board of Tax Appeals was in error in its holding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">The second question here involved concerns a policy for $30,000 taken out by the taxpayer, payable to the \u201cinsured\u2019s executors, administrators or assigns,\u201d but, subsequently, at her request, made payable to certain charitable and philanthropic institutions, and without any power retained by her to change beneficiaries' or to surrender or borrow on the policy. At her death, the $30,000 was received by the beneficiaries, and no right, interest, or property in the policy passed to her estate. By the taxation action taken in this case the decedent\u2019s estate' was taxed $4,649.18 as part of taxpayer\u2019s gross estate. Thereupon there arose the second question here involved, namely: \u201cWhere the full $40,000 exemption for insurance has first been taken, are the proceeds of a policy of insurance payable in toto to charitable or philanthropic institutions \u2019to be allowed in full as a deduction from the gross estate for the purpose of determining the estate tax, or must they be prorated in the proportion of the total insurance includable in the gross estate with the t\u00f3tal amount of taxable insurance before the exemption has been taken out?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZP\">As, bearing on life insurance policies, t-e Revenue\u2019 Act of 1926 includes in the \u2019g-roSs estate of a decedent \u201cto the extent of the amount receivable by the executor as \"insurance under policies taken out by the decedent upon his own life\u201d (section 302 (g), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 411 (g), thus it will be seen that the insurance under this policy never was receivable by the executors, but was an assigned claim owned solely and irrevocably by the assignees, and was never received by the executors as part of her estate. In view of that fact, and of the provision in the act that \u201cfor the purpose of the tax the value of the net estate shall be determined * * * by deducting from the value of the gross estate * * * the amount of all * * * transfers * * * to or for the use of any corporation organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable,- * * * purposes\u201d (section 303 (a) (3), 44 Stat. 72, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 412 and note), which was the case here, we find \"no statute expressly warranting the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>of the taxing authorities, and to allow them by indirection to in any way tax the decedent\u2019s estate, or to exact the tax from charities expressly exempt from taxation, would be unjust. So holding, the action of the Tax Board is reversed, and the record remanded for procedure in accordance herewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
