Plaintiff had brought suit to recover damages for personal injuries received by him as a result of a collision between the motorcycle which he was riding and a truck owned by defendants. A verdict was returned in favor of the plaintiff. Upon argument, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>District Court granted a new trial. The appeal is from such order. No question of bias, prejudice, or arbitrary action is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Our appellate jurisdiction is restricted to reviewing final decisions and to reviewing interlocutory orders or decrees only as are specified in 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 225, 227. An order granting a new trial is not a final decision, since it does not finally determine the rights of the parties. The granting of the new trial obviously does not come within our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The parties orally asked us to pass on the merits so as to avoid the necessity of a new trial. Being without jurisdiction of the appeal, we are unwilling to act on this oral request, and so restrict ourselves to dismissing it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
