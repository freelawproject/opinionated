Appellant alleged that it had popularized its cigarettes under the trademark \u201cTwenty Grand,\u201d and that the purchasing public generally associated it with appellant\u2019s goods. Appellant admitted, however, that the concurrent use by the parties of the trade-marks here involved would cause confusion in the trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">The sole issue in the case, in view of the fact that appellee did not adopt or use its composite trade-mark on cigarettes \u25a0until approximately nine months after appellant\u2019s adoption and use of its mark, is whether appellant\u2019s prior use amounts, in law, to a trade-mark use. If it does, appellant is the prior user and is entitled to the registration of its trade-mark. If it does not, we must then inquire as to \u2022the nature and character of appellee\u2019s use of its trade-mark from February to June 8, 1932, on which latter date, and subsequent thereto, it is conceded by counsel for appellee, appellant made a trade-mark use of the term \u201cTwenty Grand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-15\">It appears from the record that appellant . manufactures cigarettes and sells them at wholesale, and, to some extent, at retail; that for some time prior to its adoption and use of the trade-mark \u201cTwenty Grand\u201d <em>it </em>manufactured and sold three brands of cigarettes, namely, \u201cSpud,\u201d \u201cClown,\u201d and \u201cCommander\u201d; that the \u201cSpud\u201d and \u201cClown\u201d brands were sold in the United States; that, due to the fact that appellant did not have the right to use the trade-mark \u201cCommander\u201d in this country, the cigarettes bearing that mark were sold only for export; and that the trade-mark \u201cTwenty Grand\u201d was first suggested to the president of the appellant company, the witness Wood F. Axton, in October, 1930, from whose testimony we quote:</p>\n<p id=\"b332-16\">\u201c * * * I asked Mr. Wrege [assistant to the secretary and treasurer and export manager of appellant] to have the brand registered with the Tobacco Mer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>chants Association, which meant to investigate whether there was any brand of this kind on the market, or not, as they keep very good records of all tobaccos registered in the Patent Office, and in use whether they are registered there, or not, and sometime later on I asked him had he registered this brand with the Patent Office. He told me that he had not but intended to do it, and I said \u2018Get these cigarettes on the market \u2014 get some out and register them with the Patent Office\u2019; and in April, 1931, he registered them with the Patent Office, and we began to make them at that time, or before he registered them with the Patent Office.</p>\n<p id=\"ACo\">\u201cO.14. Then you adopted the name \u2018Twenty Grand\u2019 about October, 1930? A. We adopted it.</p>\n<p id=\"A8Nz\">it , , . , , \u00ab ,, Q. 15. And you instructed the man- , <em>~ c </em>. <em>r* </em>- ufacture of Twenty Grand cigarettes about April, 1931, is that correct? A. , , , , ,, .... We began to manufacture them m April, 1931,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Al6\">At the top of appellant\u2019s certificate of registration \u2014 Exhibit B \u2014 issued October 22, 1930, for use of its trade-mark \u201cTwenty Grand\u201d appears the following: \u201cUnited Registration Bureau of the Tobacco Industries afiiliated with the Tobacco Merchants Association of the United States,\u201d New York.</p>\n<p id=\"AZX\">It further appears from Exhibit B that trade-mark records wort; kept by that concern for registration purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"AX8\">The witness Axton stated that it was customary in the tobacco trade to have the Tobacco Merchants Association make a search of its records in order to determine whether a proposed trade-mark was being used by others engaged in that business, and that the registration of the marle with that concern was for the purpose of giving notice to others that the registrant intended to use the registered trade-mark; that the Tobacco Merchants Association had been in business for about twenty years, and it had been the policy of appellant to register its marks with that concern.</p>\n<p id=\"AM6\">It appears from the record that on or about April 10, 1931, appellant ordered labels bearing the trade-mark \u201cTwenty Grand\u201d; that those labels were received by it on April 15 of that year; that the trade-mark was first placed upon a comp\u00edete package of cigarettes on April 22, 1931; that the first interstate sale, consisting of one package containing twenty cigarettes, was made under the trademark \u201cTwenty Grand\u201d to Frank P. Clipp of New Albany, Ind., on April 25, 1931; that, thereafter, the following sales were made in interstate commerce under the trade-mark \u201cTwenty Grand\u201d: May 13, 1931, one carton containing ten packages of twenty cigarettes each to Frank P. P. Clipp; June 27, 1931, one carton to Raymond C. Ellis; August 6, 1931, one to Raymond C. Ellis; August 6, 1931, one carton to George A. Stephens; August 24, 1931, one carton to Raymond C. Ellis; September 11, 1931, one carton to George A. Stephens; December 29, 1931, one carton to Raymond C. Ellis; January 4, 1932, one carton to George A. Stephens; January 25, 1932, one carton to Frank P. Clipp; February 10, 1932, five cartons to Raymond C. Ellis; April 01 ir.00 . - A <em>J. </em>. . . . x 21, 1932, eight packages containing twen- \u2019 . \u2019 <em>\\ </em>, % A c? <em>u </em>ty cigarettes each to George A. Stephens, and one carton to Prank P. Clipp. .</p>\n<p id=\"AbX\">All of those sales were recorded in tke ko\u00b0ks of appellant,</p>\n<p id=\"ALF\">It further appears from the record that on or about May 6, 1932, drawings were made for a new label for appellant\u2019s \u201cTwenty Grand\u201d cigarettes, known as the \u201cbrown label\u201d; that wrappers and cartons bearing the new label were ordered by appellant, and were delivered to it on June 2, 1932; that on June 8 of that year ^ so^ large quantities of cigarettes bear-in\u00a3 brown label, under the trademark \u201cTwenty Grand,\u201d in interstate cornmerce-</p>\n<p id=\"A45q\">It is contended by counsel for appellee that prior to June 8, 1932, appellant neither displayed nor advertised its so-called \u201cTwenty Grand\u201d cigarettes; that, in order to prevent others engaged in the tobacco trade knowing of its use of the trade-mark \u201cTwenty Grand,\u201d all of appellant\u2019s sales prior to that time were made secretly to friends of the officials of the company, who were not connected with the tobacco trade; and that such sales were wholly insufficient to establish a trade-mark use of the term \u201cTwenty Grand,</p>\n<p id=\"AXyK\">It clearly appears from the record that appellant\u2019s first use of the trade-mark \u201cTwenty Grand,\u201d in April, 1931, was on a cigarette of substantially the same blend as its \u201cCommander\u201d; that, at that lime and for a year thereafter, appellant sought to produce a blend of tobaccos for a cig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>arette that would be pleasing to the public; that various blends were produced and sold under the trade-mark \u201cTwenty Grand,\u201d but it was not until April, 1932, that the officials of 'the appellant company were satisfied with its \u201cTwenty Grand\u201d blend; that, due to the,reduction in the price of tobacco and to the particular blend selected by it, appellant was able to produce a cigarette for sale under its trade-mark \u201cTwenty Grand,\u201d which would retail at 10 cents per package of twenty.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Counsel for appellee is somewhat critical because appellant did not use a particular blend of tobaccos in its \u201cTwenty Grand\u201d cigarettes, prior to June 8, 1932.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">We are in entire accord with the views expressed by the Examiner of TradeMark Interferences that the precise nature of the blend of tobaccos used in appellant\u2019s \u201cTwenty Grand\u201d cigarettes is not of vital importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">It is true that appellant\u2019s use of the mark was not extensive, being confined to fourteen sales in interstate cpmmerce during the period from April, 1931, to April, 1932. However, the evidence of record establishes that those sales were neither confidential, nor made secretly. Each of the purchasers recognized the fact that he was buying \u201cTwenty Grand\u201d cigarettes, which were manufactured by appellant only. Surely, the trade-mark law does not prevent a trader dealing with its friends, nor require it to advertise its sales in any particular manner, provided its transactions are bona fide.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">It appears from the record that appellant\u2019s business was carried on at wholesale, and, to some extent, at retail. Accordingly, the mere fact that the fourteen sales were retail sales is not in and of itself particularly significant. That its use of its mark was not intended to be confidential and secretive, is evidenced by the fact that the mark was registered by appellant with the Tobacco Merchants Association. It- further appears from the record \u2014 evidence introduced by counsel for appellee \u2014 that appellee, whose use of the mark at that time was \u201cinconsiderable,\u201d knew that appellant was using the trade-mark at least as early as April 18 and 19, 1932, and that it claimed ownership thereto, because, on those dates, appellee offered to purchase appellant\u2019s trade-mark rights for the sum of $5,-000.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">In his decision, the Commissioner of Patents stated: \u201cThe applicant seeks to attach some significance to the fact that in April, 1932, the opposer offered to purchase the trade-mark from the former for $5,000. From this fact, no implication adverse to the opposer can properly be drawn. An offer to compromise is not to be construed as an admission against interest.\u201d Wigmore on Evidence, \u00a7 1061 et seq., vol. 2 (p. 522).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">The general principle of law announced by the Commissioner is, of course, well recognized. However, the evidence of appellee\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to purchase appellant\u2019s rights in the trade-mark \u201cTwenty Grand\u201d was introduced by counsel for appellee, and no objection was made thereto by counsel for appellant. Surely, under those circumstances, such evidence may properly be considered by the court for the purpose of determining whether the sales made by appellant, as claimed by counsel for appellee, were secretly and confidentially made. If they were, it is a strange circumstance that - appellee, who, prior to its adoption of the trade-mark \u201cTwenty Grand\u201d so far as the record discloses, had never been engaged in the tobacco trade should know of appellant\u2019s alleged clandestine sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">It may be said, furthermore, that appellant could not have abandoned the 'trade-mark, as alleged by appellee, had it not previously adopted and used it as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">We are unable to hold that the sales by appellant during the period in question were sporadic, secretive, confidential, casual, or fortuitous, or that they were experimental, transitory, or inconsiderable within the meaning of those terms as used in the decisions cited by counsel for appellee. On the contrary, we are of opinion that appellant\u2019s use of the mark, although not extensive, was deliberate and continuous, and under such circumstances as to show an intention by its sales to adopt it as a trade-mark for cigarettes. Certainly, appellant\u2019s continuous use of the mark for at least nine, months prior to appellee\u2019s adoption and use of its mark, is sufficient, in view of the facts of record, to justify a holding that appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>has a superior claim, and that appellee will not be damaged by the registration of appellant\u2019s mark. See Nims on Unfair Competition in Trade-Marks (3 Ed.) pp. 557 to 568, inclusive, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">We are unable to concur in the conclusion reached by the Commissioner of Patents, and, for the reasons stated, his decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">LENROOT, Associate Judge, dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
