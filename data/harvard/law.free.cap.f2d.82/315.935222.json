What the compulsion consisted of is not stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-14\">The petition further alleges that, after resigning his position in the district office of the civil service commission, appellant complied with said military order and, at the expiration of said period of military service, requested restoration to his position in said district office; that appellant was and is entitled to such restoration by virtue of the Act of May 12, 1917, c. 12, 40 Stat. 72, 10 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371, but that appellee has refused to restore appellant to said position; and that the commission has sustained appellee in said refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-15\">The prayer of the petition is for a writ of mandamus, compelling appellee to restore appellant to his position in the district office of the civil service commission, effective December 19, 1934, and to pay appellant the salary of said position from said last-mentioned date, and for costs. No other relief is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-16\">This, clearly, is an original proceeding in mandamus. Of such proceedings .the District Courts of the United States have no jurisdiction. They have power to issue writs of mandamus in aid of their jurisdiction only, in cases already .pending, wherein jurisdiction has been acquired by other means and by other process. Covington &amp; C.

This is not such a case. Appellant\u2019s petition was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-17\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
