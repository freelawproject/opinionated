Petitioner applies the words \u2018Gold Bond\u2019 as a trade-mark to shoes by stamping them in the soles thereof and also by printing them on boxes containing said shoes. Petitioner\u2019s \u2018Gold Bond\u2019 shoes have been extensively sold in interstate commerce and are now so sold. As a result of the excellence of the product sold by petitioner under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>name \u2018Gold Bond,\u2019 petitioner has built up an extremely valuable good will. The words indicate to a very substantial portion of the public shoes of high quality sponsored by petitioner. The volume of money spent by petitioner so to advertise its \u2018Gold Bond\u2019 trade-mark for shoes is large.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Appellant further alleged that it had advertised its \u201cGold Bond\u201d shoes , in its catalogues since as early as July, 1926; that \u201cin addition petitioner\u2019s said \u2018Gold Bond\u2019 shoes have been advertised in flyers and other advertising media with the result that the name is being constantly kept before the public as identifying shoes sold by this petitioner\u201d; that, subsequent to the registration of its mark, appellee had attempted to prevent appellant\u2019s use of the term \u201cGold Bond\u201d in \u201cconnection with the sale and advertisement of [appellant\u2019s] shoes\u201d; that appellee was not entitled to the use of its mark on the date of its application for registration; that appellant deemed itself injured by such registration, and, accordingly, prayed that it be canceled.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Thereafter, on June 13, 1933, appellee moved to dismiss the petition for cancellation \"on the ground that, although it appeared ' that appellant had used the term \u201cGold Bond\u201d in advertising its shoes, it did not appear that it had used the mark, or one confusingly similar thereto, on boots and shoes \u201cas a trade-mark\u201d prior to the date of appellee\u2019s registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">In his decision affirming the decision of the Examiner of Trade-Mark Interferences, the Commissioner of Patents reviewed many authorities upon the subject, and held that as appellant had failed to allege a trade-mark use of the term \u201cGold Bond,\u201d prior to the date of appellee\u2019s registration, it was not entitled to relief under section 13 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, as amended (15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 93), which reads: \u201cSec. 13. That whenever any person shall deem himself injured by the registration of a trademark in the Patent Office he may at any time apply to the Commissioner of Patents to cancel the registration thereof. The commissioner shall refer such application to the examiner in charge of interferences, who is empowered to hear and determine this question and who shall give notice thereof to the registrant. If it appear after a hearing <em>before the </em>examiner that the registrant was not entitled to the use of the mark at the date of his application for registration thereof, or that the mark is not used by the registrant, or has been abandoned, and the examiner shall so decide, the commissioner shall cancel the registration. Appeal may be taken to the commissioner in person from the decision of examiner of interferences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">It will be observed that, although appellant alleged in its petition for cancellation that it had advertised its \u201cGold Bond\u201d shoes, and had received some orders for \u201c \u2018Gold Bond\u2019 oxfords\u201d long prior to appellee\u2019s date of first use, as set forth in its trade-mark registration, the petition contains no allegation that appellant had applied its alleged trade-mark to its goods, or that it had actually sold its goods under its mark. It is alleged in the petition, however, <em>that it is now using </em>the notation \u201cGold Bond\u201d as a trade-mark on its shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">The declaration that appellant advertised its shoes as \u201cGold Bond\u201d shoes, and received some orders for \u201c \u2018Gold Bond\u2019 oxfords,\u201d prior to appellee\u2019s first use of its mark, is not an allegation of a trademark use, or of a use analogous thereto, of the term \u201cGold Bond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">Counsel for appellant relies to a considerable extent upon our decision in the case of John Wood Manufacturing Co. v. Servel, Inc., <em>77 </em>F.(2d) 946, 22 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1370, wherein this court, after reviewing the authorities on the subject, held that, although appellee, Servel, Inc., did not allege in its notice of opposition that the word \u201cHostess\u201d was used by it as a trade-mark, it nevertheless did allege that its use of the word was analogous to a trade-mark use \u201cin that [it was stated] one of its models of refrigerators had become popularized and identified in the mind of the public as the product of appellee\u201d; that it indicated to the purchasing public that refrigerators, sold under the name \u201cHostess,\u201d originated with appellee; that the use by appellee was analogous to a trademark use; that it was entitled to use that term in connection with the marketing of its goods; that appellant was not entitled to its exclusive use; and that, therefore, appellee would be damaged by the registration of the mark to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">An entirely different situation is presented by appellant\u2019s petition in the case at bar. It did not allege a trade-mark use, or one analogous thereto, of the term \u201cGold Bond,\u201d prior to appellee\u2019s first use of the mark. In other words, the petition contains no allegation that the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>\u201cGold Bond,\u201d as used by appellant prior to appellee\u2019s first use thereof, indicated to the purchasing public that \u201cGold Bond\u201d boots and shoes originated with appellant. Accordingly, appellant failed to allege facts, which, if established on the trial, would entitle it to relief under the provisions of section 13, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">We are in accord with the conclusion reached by the tribunals of the Patent Office, and, for the reasons hereinbefore stated, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">LENROOT, Associate Judge, dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
