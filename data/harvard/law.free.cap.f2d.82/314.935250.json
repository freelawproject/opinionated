Richardson (C.C.A.9) 82 F.(2d) 313, decided this day. From a decree denying appellant\u2019s petition, he prosecutes this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Although it did not terminate the receivership proceeding, the decree determined appellant\u2019s rights by rejecting his claim. Such a decree is \u201cfinal,\u201d within the meaning of section 128 of the Judicial Code, as amended, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 225, and is, therefore, appealable. Dexter Horton National Bank v. Hawkins (C.C.A.9) 190 F. 924, 926. Gripton v. Richardson, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Appellant filed in the District Court an assignment of errors, but his brief filed in this court contains no specification of errors. Our rule 24 provides that every appellant\u2019s brief shall contain a specification of the errors relied upon; that in equity cases the specification shall state, as particularly as may be, in what the decree is alleged to be erroneous; and that errors not specified according to this rule will be disregarded. Appellant has not complied with this rule. Not having been specified in his brief, the alleged errors assigned by appellant might and perhaps should be deemed to have been waived and, for that reason, might well be disregarded. LIowever, we have not disregarded them, but have considered them all, and find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
