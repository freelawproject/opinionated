Joint negligence was charged, and a joint judgment asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">The nonresident defendants filed a petition for removal on the ground of diversity of citizenship, a separable controversy, and a fraudulent joinder, and the case was removed to the federal court. The plaintiff denied the existence of a separable controversy or a fraudulent joinder, and moved to remand. The motion was denied, and, from a judgment of dismissal for failure to prosecute the action further, this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">The situation presented upon this appeal is in all substantial respects the same as that presented in the case of Huffman v. Baldwin et al., Trustees of Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, Debtor, et al. (C.C.A.8) 82 F.(2d) 5, the opinion in which was filed this day. The decision in that case rules this case. Hie court below permitted the appellees, upon their petition for removal, to try out the merits of a cbntroversy which was clearly not removable.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">The judgment is reversed and the lower court directed to remand the case to the state court from which it was removed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
