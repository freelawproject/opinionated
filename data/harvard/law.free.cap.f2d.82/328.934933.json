In 1927 respondent received $15,993.66 representing his share of the stipulated deferred payment from oil produced and sold in that year. During 1928 respondent received $54,006.34 representing his share of the balance of the stipulated deferred payment from oil produced and sold. The Board of Tax Appeals decided that, with respect to the sums of $15,993.-66 and $54,006.34, respondent was entitled to the depletion allowance of 27\u00bd per cent, provided for by section 204 (c) (2) of the Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 9, 14, 16) and section 114 (b) (3) of the Revenue Act of 1928 (45 Stat. 791, 821, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 114 note). The respondent retained an economic interest in the oil, in place, in that his right to receive his share of the stipulated deferred payment of $192,500 was dependent upon that amount being realized from oil produced after the vendees had recovered $160,000 from gross sales of seven-eighths of the oil produced. One has an economic interest in oil, in place, whether the interest he has retained is a right to share in the oil produced or a right to share in the proceeds of the sale of the oil produced. Palmer v. Bender, 287 U.S. 551, 557, 53 S.Ct. 225, 77 L.Ed. 489. Whether the right to share is one of those kinds or the other, it is subject to be adversely affected by the exhaustion of the oil remaining in the land after the sale was made. The decision of this court in the case of Commissioner v. Fleming, 82 F.(2d) 324 (March 7, 1936), on a state of facts not materially different from that disclosed in the instant case, supports the conclusion that the above-mentioned ruling of the Board of Tax Appeals was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">The petition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
