Appellant, the Bissell Company, is an extensive manufacturer of such sweepers, and it is apparent from the record that the art was so well developed that there was little room for further improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-19\">On March 25, 1927, the company, in the name of its assignor Pullen, filed application No. 178,283 relating to \u201cimproved carpet sweeper brush drive mechanism in which stub axles are used for the floor wheels and rods are avoided.\u201d This application resulted in patent No. 1,800,958, dated April 14, 1931.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-21\">On March 31, 1928, the Bissell Company, in Pullen\u2019s name, filed application No. 266,268. The Patent Office ruled that the difference between the structure shown in the drawing of that application and that of the copending application No. 178,-283 (patent granted) is that in the former the wheels on each side are connected by axles, whereas in the patented structure the floor wheels are carried on stub axles.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-22\">On June 4, 1928, there was filed by the company, in Pullen\u2019s name, application No. 282,581. This application differed from application No. 266,268 in the substitution of a spring axle for the stiff axle and hub-acting spring of the earlier application.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-23\">On June 4, 1928, appellant, in Pullen\u2019s name, also filed application No. 282,582, which the Patent Office, ruled differed from application No. 266,268 \u201conly in the substitution of a different means for operatively connecting the spring arms to the wheel hubs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-24\">The. Patent Office further ruled that the applications disclosed \u201conly one specific novel structure, that is, the construction of the equalizer between the wheels of the carpet sweeper\u201d; that it was old in such sweepers to employ an equalizer of the same general type as that disclosed by appellant, and as shown in the Drew patent, No. 391,129. \u201cApparently,\u201d said the Board of Appeals, \u201cthe patentable novelty in the equalizer over that shown in Drew above mentioned is in the slideways and slides opposite the ends of the brush roll.\u201d The Board directed attention to the fact that the claims in applicant\u2019s patent are restricted to the use of stub axles, and that claim 11 of application No. 266,268 \u201cspecifies wheels connected by axles.\u201d The Board suggested amending claim 11 by the omission of the connection between the wheels. The Board concluded: \u201cIt is our opinion, therefore, that there is only room for one patent and that the only proper way to obtain protection is by a reissue of patent 1,800,958. Certainly we do not consider that there is any patentable distinction between stub axles and axles extending entirely through the sweeper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-25\">Following the rejection .of claims of applications o. 266,268, No. 282,581, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>No. 282,582, the present suit was instituted. The court below, after hearing, ruled that a patent issue on application No. 266,268 containing claim 11 as modified by the Board of Appeals; that is, by the omission of the clause, \u201cthe wheels at each side being supported and connected by axles.\u201d The court further ruled that on application No. 282,581 there should issue' a patent containing claims 2 and 3 of that application, which the court found \u201care for respectively different inventions from that covered in Letters Patent 1,800,958.\u201d Finally, the court ruled that as to all other claims involved in the suit (including those of application No. 282,582) the complaint should be dismissed. The Patent Office did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">In o.ur view the court properly rejected the claims (2 and 3) of application No. 282,582. There is no novelty in .these claims beyond that disclosed in other allowed claims. Through axles and tensioning springs were old.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">But claim 11 of application No. 266,-268 should be allowed without modification; that is to say, the claim should be allowed as presented in the application and containing the limitation: \u201cthe wheels at each side being supported and connected by axles.\u201d As already observed, claims 2 and 3 of application No. 282,581 were allowed by the court below as \u201cdifferent inventions from that covered in Letters Patent 1,800,958.\u201d Claim 11 of No. 266,-268, allowed by the court below, is a sub-combination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The decree is affirmed in part, and reversed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Affirmed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">Reversed in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
