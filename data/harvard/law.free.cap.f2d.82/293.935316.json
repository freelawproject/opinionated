Appellant further alleged that the goods of the opposer had been extensively advertised and sold to the general public, and that the registration of appellee\u2019s mark would cause confusion in trade and damage to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">In its answer, appellee denied that appellant\u2019s Registrations Nos. 93,250 and 98,-021, of the trade-mark \u201cRexall,\u201d were for use on \u201cpreparations for use in the laundry for cleaning and/or bleaching,\u201d and alleged that appellant\u2019s trade-marks, set out in its notice of opposition, were for use on pharmaceutical and medicinal preparations, the sales of which were confined to drug stores; that appellee\u2019s trade-mark was for use on starching compounds, \u201csold and offered for sale only in grocery stores and the like\u201d; that the goods of the parties do not possess the same descriptive properties; that appellee\u2019s mark is not confusingly similar to any of appellant\u2019s registered marks; and that, therefore, appellant would not be damaged by the registration of appellee\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">It appears from the record that approximately 10,000 \u201cRexall\u201d stores, located in various cities and towns throughout the United States sell appellant\u2019s products, and many items of merchandise other than drugs, or medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations, including preparations for use in the laundry for cleaning and bleaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Although appellant alleged in its notice of opposition that it was using the trademark \u201cRexall\u201d both on medicinal preparations and on \u201cPreparations for use in the laundry for Cleaning and Bleaching, as evidenced by Certificates Nos. 93,250 and 98,021,\u201d those certificates of registration do not support that allegation. There is nothing in either of them to indicate that appellant ever used the trade-mark \u201cRexall\u201d on \u201cpreparations for use in the laundry for Cleaning and Bleaching.\" On the contrary, it appears that Registration No. 93,250 was issued on August 26, 1913, for use of the trade-mark \u201cRexall\u201d on \u201cshampoo-paste, hair-tonic, depilatory, and a parasiticide or insecticide for cleansing and diseases of the scalp and hair,\u201d and that Registration No. 98,021, was issued on June 30, 1914, for use of the trade-mark \u201cRexall\u201d on numerous medicinal preparations.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">It appears from the record that appellee has used the trade-mark \u201cBlurex\u201d since December 20, 1932, on \u201cStarching Compounds,\u201d such as \u201cstarch finish,\u201d and \u201cwashing and bluing powder\u201d; that these compounds, which are used in the laundry for cleaning and bleaching, ai;e sold to the general public through retail grocery stores only. It further appears that appellee, the Stevens-Wiley Manufacturing Company, has been selling similar products under a trade-mark, the dominant feature of which is the word \u201cRexblu,\u201d since the registration of that mark \u2014 December 18, 1917, Registration No. 119,925.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">It is argued by counsel for appellant that as the syllable \u201cRex\u201d is one of its trade-marks, and is used as a prefix or suffix to its trade-marks \u201cRexall,\u201d \u201cAlcoRex,\u201d \u201cRex-Salvine,\u201d \u201cAgarex,\u201d \u201cBismaRex,\u201d \u201cRexillana,\u201d and \u201cRex-Mentho,\u201d referred to in its notice of opposition, and as its goods are sold in \u201cRexall\u201d stores, appellee\u2019s trade-mark \"Blurex\u201d will indicate to the purchasing public that the goods sold thereunder originate with appellant; that, in fact, there is evidence of record tending to establish that such confusion actually exists; that \u201cTwo druggists who were accustomed to carrying laundry aids, bleaching preparations, and like merchandise in their stores, on hearing the name Blurex identified it with Rexall. The first said that he had never heard of Blurex and asked if it was not a Rexall product. * * The second druggist said: \u2018That must be Liggett\u2019s, \u201cRex\u201d stands for \u201cRexall\u201d \u2019 <em>* * </em>* \u201d; that if those druggists, neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>of whom was a \u201cRexall agent\u201d were confused, the public likewise would be confused ; that the Commissioner of Patents erred in holding that the certificates of registration pleaded in the notice of opposition were \u201crestricted to medicinal remedies or toilet preparations, and <em>there is no satisfactory evidence that any of the marks has been otherwise used. </em>(Italics ours)\u201d; that there is satisfactory evidence of record tending to establish that the trade-mark \u201cRexall\u201d is used on the following articles : \u201cBorax,\u201d as evidenced by a label attached to the notice of opposition; \u201cEpsom, Salt,\u201d as evidenced by Appellant\u2019s Exhibit No. 3, consisting of an empty container so labeled; cleaning fluid for fabrics, Appellant\u2019s Exhibit No. 5; Peroxide of Hydrogen, used for bleaching purposes, Appellant\u2019s Exhibit No. 6; and soap, Appellant\u2019s Exhibit No. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">It appears from those exhibits that \u201cBorax,\u201d \u201cEpsom Salt,\u201d and \u201cHydrogen Peroxide\u201d are sold under the name \u201cPure-test\u201d ; that the cleaning fluid for fabrics, formerly known as \u201cRexall Universal Cleanser,\u201d and the soap, referred to, are sold under the name \u201cElkay\u2019s\u201d \u2014 the former is denominated \u201cElkay\u2019s Klens-All,\u201d and the latter \u201cElkay\u2019s Hand Soap.\u201d In other words, so far as we are able to learn from the record, although all of the articles referred to were sold in \u201cRexall\u201d stores, not one of them was sold under the trade-mark \u201cRexall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The mere fact that an article is sold in a so-called \u201cRexall store\u201d does not necessarily mean that it is sold under the trademark \u201cRexall,\u201d as is evidenced by the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Neither the trade-marks \u201cPuretest\u201d nor \u201cElkay\u2019s,\u201d if they may be so designated, were mentioned in the notice of opposition, and, accordingly, are not before us for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">We are of opinion that the decision in the case of Purex Corp., Ltd., v. United Drug Co., 67 F.(2d) 918, 21 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 753, is decisive of the issues in this case. Obviously, if the trade-mark \u201cPurex,\u201d for use on \u201ca bleach and water softener,\u201d is not confusingly similar, as held in that case, with the trade-marks \u201cPuretest,\u201d for use on medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations, \u201cRex,\u201d for use on medicines and toilet and pharmaceutical preparations, \u201cRexall,\u201d for use on shampoo paste, hair tonic, depilatory, and a parasiticide, \u201cRexal,\u201d for use on perfume, toilet water, sachet powders, and smelling salts, \u201cRex-Salvine,\u201d for use on an ointment for cuts and burns, \u201cRexillana,\u201d for use on cough sirup, and \u201cAgarex,\u201d for use on mineral oil, the trade-mark \u201cBlurex,\u201d for use on \u201cStarching Compounds,\u201d is certainly not confusingly similar with the trade-marks referred to by appellant in its notice of opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
