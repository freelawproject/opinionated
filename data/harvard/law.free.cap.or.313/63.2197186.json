Petitioners are electors who timely submitted written comments on the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title. Therefore, they are entitled to petition this court seeking a different title. ORS 250.085(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The Attorney General certified this ballot title to the Secretary of State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">\u201cAMENDS CRIMINAL LAWS; CREATES NEW FELONIES FOR ASSAULTS INVOLVING PREJUDICE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">\u201cQUESTION: Shall criminal code expand felonies for prejudice-based assaults, change coverage of assaults based on perception of victim\u2019s sexual behavior?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">\u201cSUMMARY: Amends criminal code. Current intimidation laws punish assaults based on perception of victim\u2019s race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation. Measure adds assaults based on perception of victim\u2019s political activities. Measure deletes \u2018sexual orientation\u2019 (defined as heterosexuahty, homosexuality or bisexuality), substitutes \u2018abnormal and unnatural sexual behavior\u2019 (defined as homosexuality, pedophilia, sadism or masochism). Creates new Class A and B felonies for intentional, knowing or reckless assaults causing serious physical injury with dangerous or deadly weapon, if motivated by listed types of perception of victim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">Petitioner Wren asserts that the Caption, Question, and Summary are deficient in several ways. Petitioner McCain asserts that the Question is deficient. We have considered petitioners\u2019 arguments but conclude that the ballot title certified by the Attorney General complies substantially with the requirements of ORS 250.035. ORS 250.085(4). No more is required. <em>Eaton v.
