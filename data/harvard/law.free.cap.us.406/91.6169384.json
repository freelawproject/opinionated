The cause of action alleged is pollution by the defendants of Lake Michigan, a body of interstate water. According to plaintiff, some 200 million gallons of raw or inadequately treated sewage and other waste materials are discharged daily into the lake in the Milwaukee area alone. Plaintiff alleges that it and its subdivisions prohibit and prevent such discharges, but that the defendants do not take such actions. Plaintiff asks that we abate this public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Article III, \u00a7 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution provides: \u201cIn all Cases ... in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction.\u201d Congress has provided in 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1251 that \u201c(a) the Supreme Court shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of: (1) All controversies between two or more States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">It has long been this Court\u2019s philosophy that \u201cour original jurisdiction should be invoked sparingly.\u201d <em>Utah </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U. S. 89, 95. We construe 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1251 (a) (1), as we do Art. Ill, \u00a7 2, cl. 2, to honor our original jurisdiction but to make it obligatory only in appropriate cases. And the question of what is appropriate concerns, of course, the seriousness and dignity of the claim; yet beyond that it necessarily involves the availability of another forum where there is jurisdiction over the named parties, where the issues tendered may be litigated, and where appropriate relief may be had. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>incline to a sparing use of our original jurisdiction so that our increasing duties with the appellate docket will not suffer. <em>Washington </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., post, </em>p. 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Illinois presses its request for leave to file saying that the agencies named as defendants are instrumentalities of Wisconsin and therefore that this is a suit against Wisconsin which could not be brought in any other forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Under our decisions there is no doubt that the actions of public entities might, under appropriate pleadings, be attributed to a State so as to warrant a joinder of the State as party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>180 U. S. 208, Missouri invoked our original jurisdiction by an action against the State of Illinois and the Sanitary District of the City of Chicago, seeking an injunction to restrain the discharge of raw sewage into the Mississippi River. On a demurrer to the motion for leave to file a bill of complaint, Illinois argued that the Sanitary District was the proper defendant and that Illinois should not have been made a party. That argument was rejected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">\u201cThe contention . . . seems to be that, because the matters complained of in the bill proceed and will continue to proceed from the acts of the Sanitary District of Chicago, a corporation of the State of Illinois, it therefore follows that the State, as such, is not interested in the question, and is improperly made a party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">\u201cWe are unable to see the force of this suggestion. The bill does not allege that the Sanitary District is acting without or in excess of lawful authority. The averment and the conceded facts are that the corporation is an agency of the State to do the very things which, according to the theory of the complainant\u2019s case, will result in the mischief to be ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>prehended. It is state action and its results that are complained of \u2014 thus distinguishing this case from that of <em>Louisiana </em>v. <em>Texas </em>[176 U. S. 1], where the' acts sought to be restrained were alleged to be those of officers or functionaries proceeding in a wrongful and malevolent misapplication of the quarantine laws of Texas. The Sanitary District of Chicago is not a private corporation, formed for purposes of private gain, but a public corporation, whose existence and operations are wholly within the control of the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">\u201cThe object of the bill is to subject this public work to judicial supervision, upon the allegation that the method of its construction and maintenance will create a continuing nuisance, dangerous to the health of a neighboring State and its inhabitants. Surely, in such a case, the State of Illinois would have a right to appear and traverse the allegations of the bill, and, having such a right, might properly be made a party defendant.\u201d 180 U. S., at 242.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">In <em>New York </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>256 U. S. 296, the State of New York brought an original action against the State of New Jersey and the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commissioners, seeking an injunction against the discharge of sewage into Upper New York Bay. The question was whether the actions of the sewage agency could be attributed to New Jersey so as to make that State responsible for them. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">\u201cAlso, for the purpose of showing the responsibility of the State of New Jersey for the proposed action of the defendant, the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commissioners, the bill sets out, with much detail, the acts of the legislature of that State authorizing and directing such action on their part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>\u201cOf this it is sufficient to say that the averments of the bill, quite undenied, show that the defendant sewerage commissioners constitute such a statutory, corporate agency of the State that their action, actual or intended, must be treated as that of the State itself, and we shall so regard it.\u201d 256 U. S., at 302.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The most recent case is <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>345 U. S. 369. The action was originally brought by the State of New Jersey against the City and State of New York for injunctive relief against the diversion of waters from Delaware River tributaries lying within New York State. Pennsylvania was subsequently allowed to intervene. The question presented by this decision was the right of the City of Philadelphia also to intervene in the proceedings as a party plaintiff. The issues raised were broad:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">\u201cAll of the present parties to the litigation have formally opposed the motion to intervene on grounds (1) that the intervention would permit a suit against a state by a citizen of another state in contravention of the Eleventh Amendment; (2) that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has the exclusive right to represent the interest of Philadelphia as <em>parens pa-triae; </em>and (3) that intervention should be denied, in any event, as a matter of sound discretion.\u201d 345 U. S., at 372.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">We denied the City of Philadelphia\u2019s motion to intervene, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">\u201cThe City of Philadelphia represents only a part of the citizens of Pennsylvania who reside in the watershed area of the Delaware River and its tributaries and depend upon those waters. If we undertook to evaluate all the separate interests within Pennsylvania, we could, in effect, be drawn into an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>intramural dispute over the distribution of water within the Commonwealth. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">\u201cOur original jurisdiction should not be thus expanded to the dimensions of ordinary class actions. An intervenor whose state is already a party should have the burden of showing some compelling interest in his own right, apart from his interest in a class with all other citizens and creatures of the state, which interest is not properly represented by the state.\u201d 345 U. S., at 373.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">We added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">\u201cThe presence of New York City in this litigation is urged as a reason for permitting Philadelphia to intervene. But the argument misconstrues New York City\u2019s position in the case. New York City was not admitted into this litigation as a matter of discretion at her request. She was forcibly joined as a defendant to the original action since she was the authorized agent for the execution of the sovereign policy which threatened injury to the citizens of New Jersey. Because of this position as a defendant, subordinate to the parent state as the primary defendant, New York City\u2019s position in the case raises no problems under the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d 345 U. S., at 374-375.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">We conclude that while, under appropriate pleadings, Wisconsin could be joined as a defendant in the present controversy, it is not mandatory that it be made one.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">It is well settled that for the purposes of diversity of citizenship, political subdivisions are citizens of their respective States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Bullard </em>v. <em>City of Cisco, </em>290 U. S. <em>179; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>Cowles </em>v. <em>Mercer County, </em>7 Wall. 118, 122. If a political subdivision is a citizen for diversity purposes, then it would make no jurisdictional difference whether it was the plaintiff or defendant in such an action. That being the case, a political subdivision in one State would be able to bring an action founded upon diversity jurisdiction against a political subdivision of another State.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">We therefore conclude that the term \u201cStates\u201d as used in 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1251 (a)(1) should not be read to include their political subdivisions. That, of course, does not mean that political subdivisions of a State may not be sued under the head of our original jurisdiction, for 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1251 provides that \u201c(b) the Supreme Court shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of: (3) all actions or proceedings by a State against the citizens of another State <em>. . .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">If the named public entities of Wisconsin may, however, be sued by Illinois in a federal district court, our original jurisdiction is not mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">It is to that aspect of the case that we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Title 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1331 (a) provides that \u201c[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions wherein the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $10,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">The considerable interests involved in the purity of interstate waters would seem to put beyond question the jurisdictional amount provided in \u00a7 1331 (a). See <em>Glenwood Light </em>&amp; <em>Water Co. </em>v. <em>Mutual Light, Heat &amp; Power Co., </em>239 U. S. 121; <em>Mississippi &amp; Missouri R. Co. </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>2 Black 485, 492; <em>Ronzio </em>v. <em>Denver &amp; R. G. W. R. Co., </em>116 F. 2d 604, 606; C. Wright, The Law of Federal Courts 117-119 (2d ed. 1970); Note, 73 Harv. L. Rev. 1369. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>The question is whether pollution of interstate or navigable waters creates actions arising under the \u201claws\u201d of the United States within the meaning of \u00a7 1331(a). We hold that it does; and we also hold that \u00a7 1331 (\u00e1) includes suits brought by a State.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Mr. Justice Brennan, speaking for the four members of this Court in <em>Romero </em>v. <em>International Terminal Operating Co., </em>358 U. S. 354, 393 (dissenting and concurring), who reached the issue, concluded that \u201claws,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1331 (a), embraced claims founded on federal common law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">\u201cThe contention cannot be accepted that since petitioner\u2019s rights are judicially defined, they are not created by 'the laws ... of the United States\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 1331 .... In another context, that of state law, this Court has recognized that the statutory word 'laws\u2019 includes court decisions. The converse situation is presented here in that federal courts have an extensive responsibility of fashioning rules of substantive law .... These rules are as fully \u2018laws\u2019 of the United States as if they had been enacted by Congress.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Lower courts have reached the same conclusion. See, <em>e. g., Murphy </em>v. <em>Colonial Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn., </em>388 F. 2d 609, 611-612 (CA2 1967); <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Adair, </em>265 F. 2d 662 (CA4 1959); <em>Mater </em>v. <em>Holley, </em>200 F. 2d 123 (CA5 1952); American Law Institute, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts 180-182 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Judge Harvey M. Johnsen in <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Pankey, </em>441 F. 2d 236, 240, stated the controlling principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">\u201cAs the field of federal common law has been given necessary expansion into matters of federal concern and relationship (where no applicable fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>eral statute exists, as there does not here), the ecological rights of a State in the improper impairment of them from sources outside the State\u2019s own territory, now would and should, we think, be held to be a matter having basis and standard in federal common law and so directly constituting a question arising under the laws of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Chief Judge Lumbard, speaking for the panel in <em>Ivy Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>391 F. 2d 486, 492, expressed the same view as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">\u201cWe believe that a cause of action similarly \u2018arises under\u2019 federal law if the dispositive issues stated in the complaint require the application of federal common law .... The word \u2018laws\u2019 in \u00a7 1331 should be construed to include laws created by federal judicial decisions as well as by congressional legislation. The rationale of the 1875 grant of federal question jurisdiction \u2014 to insure the availability of a forum designed to minimize the danger of hostility toward, and specially suited to the vindication of, federally created rights \u2014 is as applicable to judicially created rights as to rights created by statute.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">We see no reason not to give \u201claws\u201d its natural meaning, see <em>Romero </em>v. <em>International Terminal Operating Co., supra, </em>at 393 n. 5 (Brennan, J., dissenting and concurring), and therefore conclude that \u00a7 1331 jurisdiction will support claims founded upon federal common law as well as those of a statutory origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">As respects the power of a State to bring an action under \u00a7 1331 (a), <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>111 U. S. 449, 470-472, is controlling. There Kansas had sued a number of corporations in its own courts and, since federal rights were involved, the defendants had the cases removed to the federal court. Kansas resisted, saying that the federal court lacked jurisdiction because of Art. Ill, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>\u00a7 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution, which gives this Court \"original Jurisdiction\u201d in \"all Cases ... in which a State shall be Party.\u201d The Court held that where a State is suing parties who are not other States, the original jurisdiction of this Court is not exclusive <em>(id., </em>at 470) and that those suits \u201cmay now be brought in or removed to the Circuit Courts [now the District Courts] without regard to the character of the parties.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>We adhere to that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Congress has enacted numerous laws touching interstate waters. In 1899 it established some surveillance by the Army Corps of Engineers over industrial pollution, not including sewage, Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899, 30 Stat. 1121, a grant of power which we construed in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Republic Steel Corp., </em>362 U. S. 482, and in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co., </em>384 U. S. 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The 1899 Act has been reinforced and broadened by a complex of laws recently enacted. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 62 Stat. 1155, as amended, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1151, tightens control over discharges into navigable waters so as not to lower applicable water quality standards. By the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 83 Stat. 852, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 4321 <em>et seq., </em>Congress \u201cauthorizes and directs\u201d that \u201cthe policies, regulations, and public laws of the United States shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with the policies set forth in this Act\u201d and that \u201call agencies of the Federal Government shall. .. identify and develop methods and procedures . . . which will insure that presently unquantified environmental amenities and values <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>may be given appropriate consideration in decisionmak-ing along with economic and technical considerations.\u201d Sec. 102, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 4332. Congress has evinced increasing concern with the quality of the aquatic environment as it affects the conservation and safeguarding of fish and wildlife resources. See, <em>e. g., </em>Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956, 70 Stat. 1119, 16 U. S. C. \u00a7 742a; the Act of Sept. 22, 1959, 73 Stat. 642, authorizing research in migratory marine game fish, 16 U. S. C. \u00a7760e; and the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, 48 Stat. 401, as amended, 16 U. S. C. \u00a7 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Buttressed by these new and expanding policies, the Corps of Engineers has issued new Rules and Regulations governing permits for discharges or deposits into navigable waters. 36 Fed. Reg. 6564 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The Federal Water Pollution Control Act in \u00a7 1 (b) declares that it is federal policy \u201cto recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of the States in preventing and controlling water pollution.\u201d But the Act makes clear that it is federal, not state, law that in the end controls the pollution of interstate or navigable waters.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While the States are given time to establish water quality standards, \u00a7 10 (c)(1), if a State fails to do so the federal administrator<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> promulgates one. \u00a710 (c)(2). Section 10(a) makes pollution of interstate or navigable waters subject \u201cto abatement\u201d when it \u201cendangers the health or welfare of any persons.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>The abatement that is authorized follows a long-drawn-out procedure unnecessary to relate here. It uses the conference procedure, hoping for amicable settlements. But if none is reached, the federal administrator may request the Attorney General to bring suit on behalf of the United States for abatement of the pollution. \u00a710 (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The remedy sought by Illinois is not within the precise scope of remedies prescribed by Congress. Yet the remedies which Congress provides are not necessarily the only federal remedies available. \u201cIt is not uncommon for federal courts to fashion federal law where federal rights are concerned.\u201d <em>Textile Workers </em>v. <em>Lincoln Mills, </em>353 U. S. 448, 457. When we deal with air and water in their ambient or interstate aspects, there is a federal common law,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Pankey, </em>441 F. 2d 236, recently held.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>The application of federal common law to abate a public nuisance in interstate or navigable waters is not inconsistent with the Water Pollution Control Act. Congress provided in \u00a7 10 (b) of that Act that, save as a court may decree otherwise in an enforcement action, \u201c[s]tate and interstate action to abate pollution of interstate or navigable waters shall be encouraged and shall not ... be displaced by Federal enforcement action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The leading air case is <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>Tennessee Copper Co., </em>206 U. S. 230, where Georgia filed an original suit in this Court against a Tennessee company whose noxious gases were causing a wholesale destruction of forests, orchards, and crops in Georgia. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">\u201cThe caution with which demands of this sort, on the part of a State, for relief from injuries analogous to torts, must be examined, is dwelt upon in <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>200 U. S. 496, 520, 521. But it is plain that some such demands must be recognized, if the grounds alleged are proved. When the States by their union made the forcible abatement of outside nuisances impossible to each, they did not thereby agree to submit to whatever might be done. They did not renounce the possibility of making reasonable demands on the ground of their still remaining <em>quasi-</em>sovereign interests; and the alternative to force is a suit in this court. <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>180 U. S. 208, 241.\u201d 206 U. S., at 237.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The nature of the nuisance was described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">\u201cIt is a fair and reasonable demand on the part of a sovereign that the air over its territory should not be polluted on a great scale by sulphurous acid gas, that the forests on its mountains, be they better or worse, and whatever domestic destruction they have suffered, should not be further destroyed or threatened by the act of persons beyond its control, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the crops and orchards on its hills should not be endangered from the same source. If any such demand is to be enforced this must be, notwithstanding the hesitation that we might feel if the suit were between private parties, and the doubt whether for the injuries which they might be suffering to their property they should not be left to an action at law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 238.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Our decisions concerning interstate waters contain the same theme. Rights in interstate streams, like questions of boundaries, \u201chave been recognized as presenting federal questions.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Hinderlider </em>v. <em>La Plata Co., </em>304 U. S. 92, 110. The question of apportionment of interstate waters is a question of \u201cfederal common law\u201d upon which state statutes or decisions are not conclusive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In speaking of the problem of apportioning the waters of an interstate stream, the Court said in <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>206 U. S. 46, 98, that \u201cthrough these successive disputes and decisions this court is practically building up what may not improperly be called interstate com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>mon law.\u201d And see <em>Texas </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>379 U. S. 674 (escheat of intangible personal property), <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>306 U. S. 398, 405 (suit by bill in the nature of interpleader to determine the true domicile of a decedent as the basis of death taxes).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Equitable apportionment of the waters of an interstate stream has often been made under the head of our original jurisdiction. <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Wyoming, </em>325 U. S. 589; <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Colorado, supra; </em>cf. <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>California, </em>373 U. S. 546, 562. The applicable federal common law depends on the facts peculiar to the particular case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzA\">\u201cPriority of appropriation is the guiding principle. But physical and climatic conditions, the consumptive use of water in the several sections of the river, the character and rate of return flows, the extent of established uses, the availability of storage water, the practical effect of wasteful uses on downstream areas, the damage to upstream areas as compared to the benefits to downstream areas if a limitation is imposed on the former \u2014 these are all relevant factors. They are merely an illustrative, not an exhaustive catalogue. They indicate the nature of the problem of apportionment and the delicate adjustment of interests which must be made.\u201d 325 U. S., at 618.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">When it comes to water pollution this Court has spoken in terms of \u201ca public nuisance,\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>New York </em>v. <em>New Jer</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number><em>sey,, </em>256 U. S., at 313; <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York City, </em>283 U. S. 473, 481, 482. In <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>200 U. S. 496, 520-521, the Court said, \u201cIt may be imagined that a nuisance might be created by a State upon a navigable river like the Danube, which would amount to a <em>casus belli </em>for a State lower down, unless removed. If such a nuisance were created by a State upon the Mississippi the controversy would be resolved by the more peaceful means of a suit in this court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">It may happen that new federal laws and new federal regulations may in time pre-empt the field of federal common law of nuisance. But until that comes to pass, federal courts will be empowered to appraise the equities of the suits alleging creation of a public nuisance by water pollution. While federal law governs,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> consideration of state standards may be relevant. Cf. <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>282 U. S. 660, 670; <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>185 U. S. 125, 146-147. Thus, a State with high water-quality standards may well ask that its strict standards be honored and that it not be compelled to lower itself to the more degrading standards of a neighbor. There are no fixed rules that govern; these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>will be equity suits in which the informed judgment of the chancellor will largely govern.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">We deny, without prejudice, the motion for leave to file.

We conclude that the substantive law to apply in suits under \u00a7 301 (a) is federal law, which the courts must fashion from the policy of our national labor laws. The Labor Management Relations Act expressly furnishes some substantive law. It points out what the parties may or may not do in certain situations. Other problems will lie in the penumbra of express statutory mandates. Some will lack express statutory sanction but will be solved by looking at the policy of the legislation and fashioning a remedy that will effectuate that policy. The range of judicial inventiveness will be determined by the nature of the problem. Federal interpretation of the federal law will govern, not state law. But state law, if compatible with the purpose of \u00a7 301, may be resorted to in order to find the rule that will best effectuate the federal policy. Any state law applied, however, will be absorbed as federal law and will not be an independent source of private rights.\u201d (Citations omitted.)

As Mr. Justice Harlan indicated for the Court in <em>Banco Nacional de Cuba </em>v. <em>Sabbatino, </em>376 U. S. 398, 421-427, where there is an overriding federal interest in the need for a uniform rule of decision or where the controversy touches basic interests of federalism, we have fashioned federal common law.

It is the creation of a public nuisance of simple type for which a State may properly ask an injunction.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b171-6\"> \u201cFederal common law and not the varying common law of the individual States is, we think, entitled and necessary to be recognized as a basis for dealing in uniform standard with the environmental rights of a State against improper impairment by sources outside its domain. The more would this seem to be imperative in the present era of growing concern on the part of a State about its ecological conditions and impairments of them. In the outside sources of such impairment, more conflicting disputes, increasing assertions and proliferating contentions would seem to be inevitable. Until the field has been made the subject of comprehensive legislation or authorized administrative standards, only a federal common law basis can provide an adequate means for dealing with such claims as alleged federal rights. And the logic and practicality of regarding such claims as being entitled to be asserted within the federal-question jurisdiction of \u00a7 1331 (a) would seem to be self-evident.\u201d <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Pankey, </em>441 F. 2d 236, 241-242.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b172-8\"> The rule of decision being federal, the \u201caction . . . may be brought only in the judicial district where all defendants reside, or in which the claim arose,\u201d 28 U.

Thus in a proper case a municipal corporation will be restrained by injunction from creating a nuisance on private property, as by the discharge of sewage or poisonous gases thereon, or, in some jurisdictions, by the obstruction of drainage of waters, or by discharging sewage or filth into a stream and polluting the water to the damage of lower riparian owners, or by dumping garbage or refuse, or by other acts. Likewise, a municipality may be enjoined from creating or operating a nuisance, whether the municipality is acting in a governmental or proprietary capacity, impairing property rights. And, if a nuisance is established causing irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law it may be enjoined irrespective of the resulting damage or injury to the municipality.\u201d 17 McQuil-lin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 49.55.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
