In 1892, in another suit brought by Nebraska against Iowa, this Court held that the boundary line in the river at Carter Lake, Iowa, was to be located according to the principle that the boundary \u201cis a varying line\u201d so far as affected by \u201cchanges of diminution and accretion in the mere washing of the waters of the stream,\u201d but not where the river is shifted by avulsion: \u201cBy this selection of a new channel the boundary was not changed, and it remained as it was prior to the avulsion, the centre line of the old channel; . . . unless the waters of the river returned to their former bed, [such center line] became a fixed and unvarying boundary, no matter what might be the changes of the river in its new channel.\u201d <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>143 U. S. 359, 370 (1892); the decree is in 145 U. S. 519 (1892). The Compact adopts this line at Carter Lake, and for the rest of the boundary fixes the line in \u201cthe middle of the main channel of the Missouri river,\u201d defined as the \u201ccenter line of the proposed stabilized channel of the Missouri river as estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>lished by the United States engineers\u2019 office, Omaha, Nebraska, and shown on the alluvial plain maps of the Missouri river from Sioux City, Iowa, to Rulo, Nebraska, and identified by file numbers AP-1 to 4 inclusive, dated January 30, 1940, and file numbers AP-5 to 10 inclusive, dated March 29, 1940, which maps are now on file in the United States engineers\u2019 office at Omaha, Nebraska, and copies of which maps are now on file with the secretary of state of the State of Iowa and with the secretary of state of the State of Nebraska.\u201d The \u201cproposed stabilized channel\u201d refers to a project begun in the early 1930\u2019s by the United States Army Corps of Engineers to tame the river along its entire length by containing it within a designed channel. The work had been partially completed by 1943, but was suspended when World War II intervened. When work resumed in 1948, the channel was partly redesigned, and by 1959 the river had been confined in the newly designed channel.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The States determined in 1943 to agree by compact upon a permanent location of the boundary line when experience showed that \u201cthe fickle Missouri River . . . refused to be bound by the Supreme Court decree [of 1892]. In the past thirty-five years the river has changed its course so often that it has proved impossible to apply the court decision in all cases, since it is difficult to determine whether the channel of the river has changed by \u2018the law of accretion\u2019 or \u2018that of avulsion.\u2019 \u201d Eriksson, Boundaries of Iowa, 25 Iowa J. of Hist, and Pol. 163, 234 (1927). The Special Master found, on ample evidence, and we adopt his findings, that by 1943 the shifts of the river channel had been so numerous and intricate, both in its natural state and as a result of the work of the Corps of Engineers, that it would be practically impossible to locate the original boundary line.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>The fixing of the permanent boundary by Compact resulted in some riparian lands formerly in each State being located within the other State. This created the problem of the effect to be given by the new State to titles, mortgages, and other liens that had arisen under the laws of the other State. Sections 2 and 3 of the Compact were designed to solve this problem.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 2 each State \u201ccedes\u201d to the other State \u201cand relinquishes jurisdiction over\u201d all such lands now located within the Compact boundary of the other. Under \u00a7 3, \u201c[tjitles, mortgages, and other liens\u201d affecting such lands \u201cgood in\u201d the ceding State \u201cshall be good in\u201d the other State.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The instant dispute between the States arose when Iowa in 1963 claimed state ownership of some 30 separate areas of land, water, marsh, or mixture of the three wholly on the Iowa side of the Compact boundary. The eighth and part of a ninth such areas were formed before 1943. The 21st and part of a 22d were formed after 1943.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Iowa's claim was based on Iowa common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>law that private titles to riparian lands run only to the ordinary high-water mark on navigable streams and that the State is the owner of the beds of all navigable streams within the State and is also the owner of any islands that may form therein. <em>McManus </em>v. <em>Carmichael, </em>3 Iowa 1 (1856); <em>Holman </em>v. <em>Hodges, </em>112 Iowa 714, 84 N. W. 950 (1901). The areas formed before 1943 lie south of Omaha and those formed after 1943 lie north of Omaha. Two of the pre-1943 areas are Nottleman Island and Sehemmel Island. Each is the subject of an action to quiet title brought by Iowa in Iowa courts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defense in each case is that there exist \u201ctitles . . . good in Nebraska\u201d to the islands that, under \u00a7 3 of the Compact, Iowa obligated itself to recognize to be \u201cgood in Iowa\u201d as against any claim of Iowa under its doctrine of state ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Thus, the controversy between the States in this case centers around the proper construction of their Compact. The Special Master\u2019s Findings and Conclusions generally favor Nebraska\u2019s position on the merits of the controversy over the areas that formed before July 12, 1943, and Iowa\u2019s exceptions are addressed to them. On the other hand, the Findings and Conclusions favor Iowa\u2019s position on the merits of the controversy over the areas that formed after July 12, 1943, and Nebraska\u2019s exceptions are primarily addressed to them. We overrule all excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>tions, save two, of Nebraska\u2019s addressed to printing errors in the Report,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> except as we sustain, <em>infra, </em>Iowa\u2019s Exceptions IV and V insofar as the Special Master recommended that an injunction issue, and except as mentioned in n. 8, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The Special Master construed the word \u201ccedes\u201d in \u00a7 2 as meant by the States to describe all areas formed before July 12, 1943, regardless of their location with reference to the original boundary, whose \u201c[tjitles, mortgages, and other liens\u201d were, at the date of the Compact, \u201cgood in\u201d the ceding State, and ruled that, under \u00a7 3, the other State is bound to recognize such \u201c[tjitles, mortgages, and other liens\u201d to be \u201cgood in\u201d its State, and not to claim ownership in itself. Iowa urges, in its Exceptions II and III, that this construction is erroneous and that \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 should be construed as relating only to areas formed before July 12, 1943, that can be proved by clear, satisfactory, and convincing evidence to have been on the Nebraska side of the <em>original </em>boundary before the Compact fixed the permanent boundary. We overrule Iowa\u2019s Exceptions. Iowa\u2019s construction would require the claimant who proves title \u201cgood in-Nebraska\u201d also to shoulder the burden of proving the location of the <em>original </em>boundary before 1943, as well as proving that the lands were on the Nebraska side of that boundary. That, said the Special Master, and we agree, \u201cwould be placing a burden upon the land owner which the states themselves refused to undertake in 1943 and agreed would not be necessary. The states would in effect be saying to the land owners, \u2018we could not prove where the boundary was in 1943 but now, after we have waited 27 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>years, we are going to make you prove where it was at your expense even though we know it is impossible.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A40\">Iowa\u2019s Exceptions IV and V concern the Special Master\u2019s findings that the State of Iowa does not own Nottleman Island and Schemmel Island. The Special Master found that the proofs sufficed to establish title \u201cgood in Nebraska\u201d to Nottleman Island and Schemmel Island, but did not suffice to prove title \u201cgood in Nebraska\u201d to the other areas claimed by Iowa that were formed before 1943.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He found, and we agree, that titles \u201cgood in Nebraska\u201d include private titles to riparian lands that under Nebraska law, differing from Iowa law, run to the thread of the contiguous stream. <em>Kinkead </em>v. <em>Turgeon, </em>74 Neb. 573, 104 N. W. 1061 (1905), 74 Neb. 580, 109 N. W. 744 (1906).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He found further that titles \u201cgood in Nebraska\u201d embrace titles obtained by 10 years\u2019 open, notorious, and adverse possession under claim of right without any requirement of a record title; under Iowa law, a claim must be under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>\u201ccolor of title,\u201d requiring some type of record title to commence the period of adverse possession.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">The Special Master recommended that as to areas formed before July 12, 1943, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 should be construed as limiting the State of Iowa to contesting with private litigants in state or federal courts the question whether the private claimants can prove title \u201cgood in Nebraska,\u201d and when private litigants prove such title, as obliging Iowa not to interpose Iowa\u2019s doctrine of state ownership as defeating such title.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We agree, and to that extent overrule Iowa\u2019s Exceptions IV and Y. As to Nottleman Island and Schemmel Island, however, the Special Master recommended that, in addition to a judgment that titles \u201cgood in Nebraska\u201d have been proved as to those islands, so that Iowa is precluded from claiming title thereto under its doctrine of state ownership, this Court should enjoin the State of Iowa, its officers, agents, and servants from further prosecution of the cases now pending in the Iowa courts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We see no reason for an injunction at this stage. We are confident that the State of Iowa will abide by our adoption of the Special Master\u2019s conclusion that in any proceeding between a private litigant and the State of Iowa in which a claim of title good under the law of Nebraska is proved, the State of Iowa will not invoke its common-law doctrine of state ownership as defeating such title. Iowa\u2019s Exceptions IV and V are therefore sustained insofar as the Special Master recommended that an injunction issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Nebraska\u2019s basic Exception is to the Findings and Conclusion of the Special Master that ownership of areas that have formed since July 12, 1943, should be deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>mined under the law of the State in which they formed, the boundary fixed by the Compact being the line that determines in which State they formed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This pertains to the 21 areas and part of a 22d that lie north of Omaha. See n. 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Although the Special Master recommended, and we agree, that claimants of title to these areas as against Iowa may also have the opportunity to show title \u201cgood in Nebraska\u201d on the Compact date, July 12, 1943,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Nebraska offered no proof to support such a claim as to any of the areas. Nebraska does contend, however, that any accretions to Nebraska riparian lands that cross the Compact boundary line into Iowa, caused when the river moves gradually and imperceptibly, should be declared to accrue to the Nebraska riparian owner under Nebraska law, since under Nebraska law the boundary of the Nebraska owner moves with the thalweg or main navigable channel, regardless of which State the movement is in. The Special Master rejected that contention. We agree that the contention is without merit for the reasons stated in <em>Tyson </em>v. <em>State of Iowa, </em>283 F. 2d 802 (CA8 1960). That was a condemnation action by the United States in which the question was the ownership of an island at Tyson Bend, one of the areas north of Omaha to which Iowa claims ownership. See n. 4, <em>supra. </em>The island had formed between the designed channel and a main channel created when the river escaped from the designed channel between 1943 and 1948. The island had then become connected to the Nebraska shore when the designed channel filled with sediment after a 1952 flood. The Corps of Engineers determined to dredge a canal in the designed channel to place the river back in the designed channel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Condemnation of an easement on the island was necessary to carry the project forward, and the question of ownership of the island had to be settled to determine who was entitled to compensation. The Tyson claimants claimed the land as an accretion to Nebraska land or river beds belonging to them. The State of Iowa claimed it as an island formed over the state-owned river bed in Iowa under the Iowa doctrine of state ownership. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the ownership of the island should be determined by the law of the State in which the land was situated, that is, by the law of Iowa, since the island was on the Iowa side of the Compact boundary. The Court of Appeals expressly rejected the same contention urged upon us by Nebraska, holding, in agreement with the District Court in the case, that \u201cthe Nebraska law of accretion did not operate to create riparian rights within the territorial limits of Iowa.\u201d 283 F. 2d, at 811. Hence, whether the Nebraska riparian owner has title to the accretions that cross the boundary into Iowa is determined by Iowa law. Nebraska argues that <em>Tyson </em>was wrongly decided. We do not agree. <em>Tyson </em>is consistent with what the Court said in <em>Arkansas </em>v. <em>Tennessee, </em>246 U. S. 158, 175-176 (1918):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\">\u201cHow the land that emerges on either side of an interstate boundary stream shall be disposed of as between public and private ownership is a matter to be determined according to the law of each State, under the familiar doctrine that it is for the States to establish for themselves such rules of property as they deem expedient with respect to the navigable waters within their borders and the riparian lands adjacent to them. . . . <em>But these dispositions are in each case limited by the interstate </em>boundary, <em>and cannot be permitted to press back the boundary </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number><em>line from where otherwise it should he located.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The States may submit a proposed decree in accord with this opinion. If the States cannot agree, the Special Master is requested, after appropriate hearing, to prepare and submit a recommended decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-6\"> Iowa Code 1971, p. lxiv; Iowa Acts 1943, c. 306; Nebraska Laws 1943, c. 130; Act of July 12, 1943, 57 Stat. 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Leave to file the action was granted in 1965. 379 U.
