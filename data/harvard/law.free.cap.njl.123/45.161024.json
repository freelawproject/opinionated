Olbis, the owner of a tract of vacant land abutting one hundred and fifty-nine feet on Piaget Avenue, in the City of Clifton, and extending back therefrom a depth of two hundred and fifty-four feet to Barclay Avenue, entered into an agreement with the State of New Jersey, through the State Highway Commissioner, for the sale and conveyance to the State,, at the price of $2,893.80, of the entire frontage on Piaget Avenue to a uniform depth of forty-three feet, for the construction of State Highway Eoute 6 (Bev. 1927), section 8,. Valley Boad to Boute 3, and on August 4th, 1938, made, executed and delivered to the State a deed of conveyance for that parcel. Thereupon, the State and Olbis joined in a petition to the City Council for an apportionment of the existing municipal liens; and on September 20th, 1938, that body adopted a resolution whereby an assessment lien for local improvements (then totaling with accrued interest the sum of $2,587.13) was \u201capportioned\u201d to the parcel conveyed to the-state, while the tax arrears (in the aggregate principal sum of $529.41) were apportioned on the basis of one-sixth thereof (amounting with interest to $116.14) to the lands so conveyed-</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">It is conceded that the latter parcel is approximately one-sixth of the 'whole of the Olbis tract; and, on the hypothesis-that the Council in effect \u201crefused to apportion the assessment lien\u201d in accordance with the petition thus presented, Olbisprays a writ of <em>mandamus </em>commanding its apportionment \u201cpursuant to the statute,\u201d or, in the event that the action taken be deemed an \u201capportionment,\u201d a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to vacate it as \u201cnot made in accordance with the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">In my view, the resolution reveals an assumption by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Council of its statutory jurisdiction, albeit its exercise was ineffectual for the reasons to be presently stated. The municipality concedes that this is so. It argues that, by the \u201caction taken [the adoption of the resolution], the lien was apportioned by placing against the portion * * * taken by the State for highway purposes a sum representing the cost of improvements and approximately one-sixth of the taxes accumulated thereon;\u201d and, in defense of the resolution, it urges (a) that the \u201capportionment was made according to the valuations of the respective subdivisions at the time the liens were imposed;\u201d (b) that the \u201cassessments for improvements were property chargeable against the portion taken for state highway purposes;\u201d and (c) that the parcel taken \u201cincreased in value by reason of the improvements for which\u201d the assessment was made, and the State, i\u00a3by agreeing to pay for the land taken and the replacement of all improvements,\u201d has undertaken \u201cto pay the cost\u201d of the improvements, \u201cand the same should therefore be paid to the City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The statute commands that: \u201cWhen part of a plot or parcel of land has or shall have been taken for the opening, widening or extension of a street in a municipality, all taxes, assessments and water rents which shall be liens upon the whole plot or parcel of land from which the plot or parcel has or shall have been taken, shall be equitably and justly apportioned between the plot or parcel so taken and the balance that shall remain in the same manner as other apportionments are made.\u201d <em>R. 8. </em>1937, 54:7-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The standard of apportionment is laid down in section 54:7-3. It provides that: \u201cThe apportionment * * * shall be made according to the values of the respective subdivisions at the time the respective charges were imposed or levied, unless the claim is justly chargeable only to a particular part of the whole parcel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">The proofs disclose no basis for the finding by the municipal governing body that the entire assessment \u201cis justly chargeable\u201d to the parcel sold and conveyed to the State. The improvements for which the assessment in question was levied consisted of the grading and paving of the highway, the installation of sidewalks and curbing, the building of a \u201csani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>tary sewer,\u201d and gas, water and sewer connections to the curb, all made in the year 1928; and the insistence is that the benefits of the improvements so made did not extend to the lands abutting on Barclay Avenue, and therefore \u201cconsideration should be given only to the property extending to the center of the block;\u201d that \u201cafter the highway is constructed the property fronting on the new highway will have a depth of approximately eighty (80) feet;\u201d that it is fairly inferable that \u201cprosecutor obtained such a high price\u201d for the parcel in question \u201cbecause of the improvements represented by the assessment and the fact that the remainder of the property fronting on Piaget Avenue is damaged, by reducing the depth from approximately one hundred (100) feet to that of eighty (80) feet,\u201d thus making it \u201cless desirable and useful because of the inadequate depth;\u201d and that, in the circumstances \u201cit is only fair and equitable that the portion of the tax lien representing the assessment should justly be against the property taken by the State along the front.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">These contentions are plainly untenable. They ignore the uncontroverted evidence that the depth of the original Olbis tract between Piaget and Barclay Avenues was two hundred and fifty-four feet. Moreover, since the State has concededly undertaken to replace the improvements in the construction of the highway, it necessarily proceeds on the assumption that the land fronting on the new highway to a depth of eighty feet, merely because of \u201cinadequate depth,\u201d has no value whatever. The proofs lend no support to this conclusion. Nor is there tangible evidence tending to show such a restriction of the benefits of these improvements. In fact, a much larger tract, of which the Olbis lands were a part, was originally assessed for benefits accruing from these improvements; and, upon the conveyance to Olbis, the amount of the instant assessment was apportioned to the whole of the lands so conveyed as the value of the benefits' conferred upon that subdivision; hence, the necessity for the current apportionment petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">It is also contended that the State, \u201cin agreeing to replace these improvements is doing so in order to reduce the owner\u2019s claim for damages,\u201d and that, even though there be a replace-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>meat of \"all the improvements disturbed by the construction of the highway, * * * nevertheless the cost of the improvements is properly allocated to\u201d the parcel taken, \"and should be paid out of the moneys received by the owner for the same,\u201d since the prosecutor is \"in effect being repaid for the improvements.\u201d It is pointed out that the existing pavement is to remain as a part of the new highway construction; and the argument is made that, \"for that reason also, * * * the owner should pay, out of the amount received from the State, the cost of the improvement because the same is reflected\u201d in the purchase price. It is said that this will constitute apportionment \"according to the value of the several parcels\u201d\u2019 \u2014 \u2022 citing <em>Luckenbach, &amp;c., Inc., </em>v. <em>Township of North Bergen, </em>118 <em>N. J. L. </em>348, and <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Bloomfield, </em>81 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>163.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">But this argument overlooks the fact that the improvements (with the exception of the pavement, which is not to be disturbed) are to be \u201creplaced\u201d by the state in such a manner as to enhance the value of the lands remaining to Olbis, abutting on the new highway, to the same, if not indeed a greater, degree as the parcel taken. The stipulated purchase price does not therefore include the cost of the original improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">And so I am of the view that the action taken was arbitrary and capricious, and not in conformance with the statutory standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">But it is insisted that, even so, Olbis \u201cis estopped from complaining about the method of apportionment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">This point is grounded in the testimony of the municipal director of finance that, some six months before the instant application for apportionment was made, the wife of relator-prosecutor, in response \u201cto a letter addressed to Mr. Olbis\u201d relating to the city\u2019s \u201ctax title liens,\u201d called upon him, and, in the course of the conversation, stated that \u201cthe lien could not be satisfied at that time but that the property would no doubt be taken over by the State\u201d for highway purposes, and requested a postponement of \"any foreclosure proceedings until they were sure whether or not the State would take their property,\u201d and that \u201cas a result of the conversation * * * no foreclosure proceedings were instituted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Discussion is not needed <em>to </em>demonstrate <em>the </em>lack of the elements of estoppel in this situation. Moreover, the obvious design of section <em>54:7-9 </em>of the Revised Statutes was to facilitate public improvements of the nature specified, by enabling the governmental authority to secure title to the needed land at its fair value, freed of all such municipal liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">A writ of <em>certiorari </em>will accordingly issue; and, since it was agreed on the oral argument that there should be a final determination of the meritorious question as if the writ had issued in the first instance and a return had been made thereto, judgment may be entered- \u2014 -upon the making of a return to the writ \u2014 vacating the resolution under review, with costs, and remanding the cause for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. The application for a <em>mandamus </em>may be renewed if necessary to secure further action upon the petition for apportionment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
