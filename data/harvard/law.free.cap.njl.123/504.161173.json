He procured a rule to show cause which was dismissed for failure to properly prosecute the same. He now seeks a writ and presents no reasons for the issuance thereof, as provided by section 5 of the <em>Certiorari </em>act. Examining prosecutor\u2019s brief, we have assumed that the reasons there stated would be his reasons for reversal. It might be pointed out that the brief offends rule 156 of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">The reasons assigned are, in short, that the New Jersey Housing acts \u2014 chapter 19 of the laws of 1938, <em>B. S. </em>title 55, chapter 14a and chapter 20 of the laws of 1938, <em>B. S. </em>title 55, chapter 14b, are unconstitutional because offending constitutional requirements with respect to the enactment of laws. The same reasons were presented in the case of <em>Romano </em>v. <em>Housing Authority of </em>Newark, 123 <em>N. J. L. </em>428, and were argued at length. We there determined that the points with respect to the unconstitutionality of the acts in question were without merit and warranted no lengthy discussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">The application for the writ will be denied, with costs to the respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
