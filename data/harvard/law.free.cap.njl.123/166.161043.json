It was but the enlargement of the duration of the contract \u2014 extra its provisions \u2014 and not a \u201cmodification\u201d\" of the contract itself within the intendment of paragraph 14 thereof. In common understanding, there is an essential difference between the two. The parties manifestly had in mind an alteration, change, or variation of the contract itself, and not a mere extension of its life upon the same terms and conditions. Compare <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>DePuy, </em>15 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>94; <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Gorenberg, </em>9 <em>Id. </em>463.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Moreover, it was beyond the power of the parties so to restrict the right of contract. It is always within the province of the contracting parties to waive a provision such as this, and to modify a written contract by parol, unless the agreement is of a character required to be in writing by a peremptory rule of law. <em>Headley </em>v. <em>Cavileer, </em>82 <em>N. J. L. </em>635. See, also, 66 <em>A. L. R. </em>649.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">And there was evidence tending to establish the making of the pleaded agreement extending the term of the contract, and that the officer of the defendant corporation who presumed to act for it in that behalf had authority so to do. The letter forwarded by defendant to plaintiff under date of December 30th, 1937, is <em>prima facie </em>evidential of the making of the second contract by the defendant corporation. The case made by the plaintiff is not fatally deficient as lacking in proof to show (a) \u201chow long the agreement was to continue,\u201d and (b) \u201cwhen, where, and under what circumstances the parties mutually agreed to continue the written agreement after its expiration.\u201d The communication referred to betokens a continuance of the contractual relation for an indeterminate period, terminable at the will of either party; and, nothing more appearing, that is a fair inference. It was therefore error to rule as a matter of law that there was no \u201clegal\u201d evidence of the making of the asserted extension agreement. Of the function thus exercised by the trial judge, more will presently be said.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">As to whether there was evidence of the claimed \u201cindebtedness,\u201d defendant invokes the rule that findings of fact on conflicting evidence in the District Court are not reviewable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>on appeal. But the difficulty is that defendant, without offering any evidence, moved \u201cfor a directed verdict\u201d in its favor on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that there was no evidence tending to show the use of the copyrighted matter \u201con any of the dates alleged in the state of demand,\u201d and the trial judge ruled that the \u201cindebtedness\u201d was not established by \u201clegal evidence,\u201d since \u201cthere was no proof as to exactly when the defendant operated the 'Bank Night\u2019 as alleged in the state of demand.\u201d This motion called for judgment on the ground that there was an utter lack of evidence to sustain a verdict for plaintiff in any sum within the issue framed, and thus there was presented the question of whether there was any evidence which, if accepted and given its fullest probative force, reasonably tended to sustain the pleaded cause of action, in whole or in part. <em>Sivak </em>v. <em>New Brunswick, </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>197; <em>Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>Merchants &amp; Manufacturers, &amp;c., Co., </em>122 <em>Id. </em>468; <em>Biczis </em>v. <em>Public Service Co-ordinated-Transport, </em>115 <em>Id. </em>407. The judge so considered it. And we are of the view that it must be resolved in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The letter adverted to serves to show, not only the extension of the contract term by mutual consent, but also the use by defendant of the copyrighted material under the extension agreement. And a witness called by plaintiff testified \u2014 so the settled case discloses \u2014 that \u201che had visited\u201d defendant\u2019s theatre \u201cat least six times during the months between January, 1938, and October, 1938, and that on each visit he observed that the defendant was advertising the use of 'Bank Night\u2019 by displaying advertising signs in the lobby and on the marquee of the theatre.\u201d Thus there was evidence of the use of the copyrighted matter on at least six days of the period embraced by the state of demand. It was therefore error to hold as a matter of law that there was no evidence to support a verdict for plaintiff in any amount whatever. In this situation, the trial judge did not perform his function of evaluating the evidence adduced in the resolution of the factual issue thereby raised. And so there was error in point of law remediable on appeal. <em>B. S. </em>1937, 2:32-204.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The judgment is accordingly reversed, and a new trial awarded; costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
