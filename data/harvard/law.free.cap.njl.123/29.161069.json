L. </em>1931, with the title \u201cAn act authorizing and requiring municipalities and fire districts to provide compensation insurance for volunteer firemen\u201d). Those statutory provisions are a part of chapter 15 of title 34 (Workmen\u2019s Compensation). <em>B. 8. </em>34:15-49 provides that \u201cthe commissioner, the deputy commissioners and the referees, appointed pursuant to section 34:1-57 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>this title, sitting individually or together, shall have exclusive original jurisdiction of all claims for compensation arising under this chapter.\u201d <em>R. S. </em>34:15-76 provides that all payments to volunteer firemen \u201cshall be governed by and be-subject to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d The jurisdiction of the commissioner is apparently recognized by the parties. Petitioner, for reasons that are not stated, names the Department of Labor and the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau as parties respondent herein. These agencies do not appear. A companion case, <em>In re George Mauroff, </em>according to the allegations of the petition, was heard and determined by the-commissioner. We entertain no doubt that the commissioner-had jurisdiction to hear and determine Mrs. Thirion\u2019s claim; and since he had original jurisdiction, that jurisdiction was, in the wording of the statute, exclusive. We are confronted with the question whether parties to an existing issue, ripe-for action, over which a statutory tribunal has exclusive-original jurisdiction, may, by co-operative procedure, by-pass-that tribunal and move initially into an appellate court. We-think that they may not. The purpose of the Declaratory Judgments act as stated within the statute itself, <em>R. S.. </em>2:26-67, is \u201cto settle and afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status and other legal relations.\u201d The parties hereto have no occasion to remain uncertain or to be insecure with respect to their rights. The claimant would doubtless already have institued her suit in the statutory way had not the petitioner undertaken to pay her the maximum statutory amount, namely, $20 per week,, pending the determination of this proceeding, without prejudice and subject to such change or modification as this court, may determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">We think that the legislature did not intend, by the-Declaratory Judgments act, to substitute an appellate court for a tribunal of original jurisdiction in issues that are ripe-for litigation by the usual processes. A contrary view would,, we apprehend, lead to great confusion in the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The petition will therefore be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
