O. D. basis or a time basis.\u201d 120 <em>N. J. L. </em>495.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">The first point made is that there was error in the denial of defendant\u2019s motion \u201cfor a direction of verdict and in rendering a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the sum of $300.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-13\">The second half of this specification does not embody a valid ground of appeal. It does not set forth a claimed error in point of law. <em>Biczis </em>v. <em>Public Service Co-ordinated Transport, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>407.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>The motion for the direction of a verdict was based upon the contentions that the proofs conclusively established an accord and satisfaction and mutual rescission, and that there was a lack of proof of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The claim of accord and satisfaction and rescission is based upon the acceptance by plaintiff of defendant\u2019s check for the deposit made on account of the purchase price, containing the following endorsement: \u201cIn full settlement \u2014 refund on deposit of furniture selected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">But this endorsement did not conclusively establish either defense. Yiewing the evidence in the light most favorable to defendant, jury questions were presented as to whether there was an accord and satisfaction or a rescission of the contract. The return of the deposit was not requested by plaintiff. The evidence lends itself to the inference that, whatever the intent of the defendant may have been in the return of the deposit by check so endorsed, plaintiff did not participate therein. The endorsement, without more, simply means that the check was accepted in satisfaction of the deposit made. It does not indicate an accord and satisfaction of plaintiff\u2019s claim for unliquidated damages arising from the claimed breach of contract, nor that the contract was to be thereby rescinded. As a matter of fact, it was not then known whether the breach of the contract would entail substantial damages to plaintiff. The intent of the parties is to be gathered from all the circumstances attending the transaction. <em>Decker </em>v. <em>Smith &amp; Co., </em>88 <em>N. J. L. </em>630.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">And we are also of the view that the trial judge applied the appropriate statutory measure of damages, and that there was evidence to sustain his award. He allowed for the difference between cash and time payments. And we think that the evidence presented a jury question as to the alleged differences between the furniture ultimately purchased by the plaintiff and that contracted to be sold by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">We find no merit in the specifications of error directed to the admission of evidence. The evidence admitted was clearly competent and material.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">The judgment is accordingly affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
