Each crime was alleged to have been committed \"on or about November 15, 2013.\" He was convicted on all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The appellant raised four issues on appeal. In Issue I, he argued his dual convictions in Counts 1 and 3 violated double jeopardy. In Issue II, he argued his dual convictions in Counts 2 and 3 violated double jeopardy. In Issue III, he challenged the denial of a pre-trial motion to dismiss based on subjective and objective entrapment. In Issue IV, he argued the trial court erred by excluding certain trial testimony. This Court accepted the State's concession of error in Issue II and vacated the appellant's conviction in Count 2. We affirmed all other issues on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In Issue I, we affirmed his dual convictions in Counts 1 and 3 under\n   <em>\n    Lee v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12365763\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/223/342/\">\n    223 So.3d 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 1st DCA 2017). In 2018, the Supreme Court quashed our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   and held that the reviewing court should only consider the charging document to determine whether multiple convictions for solicitation, unlawful use of a two-way communications device, and traveling were based upon the same conduct for purposes of double jeopardy.\n   <em>\n    Lee v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12682736\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/258/1297/\">\n    258 So.3d 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 2018) (\n   <em>\n    Lee II\n   </em>\n   ). Applying\n   <em>\n    Lee II\n   </em>\n   to Issue I in this case, we must also vacate the appellant's conviction in Count 1 as that count is subsumed within Count 3. Accordingly, the appellant's convictions in Counts 1 and 2 are VACATED . The appellant's conviction in Count 3 is AFFIRMED .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Lewis, Roberts, and Ray, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
