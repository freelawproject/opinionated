I respectfully disagree with this Court's decision. Montrell Jordan's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is based on the undisputed fact that defense counsel was romantically involved with a key witness for the prosecution at all stages of the lawyer's representation. Defense counsel, Akillie Malone, was residing with the lead investigator in the case against Jordan, Officer Lacarus Oliver, at the time of the pretrial, trial, and post-trial proceedings. Six months after Jordan's conviction,\n   Attorney Malone and Officer Oliver were married to each other. Because Jordan never was informed of this conflict, he had no opportunity either to waive the conflict knowingly and intelligently or to obtain other, conflict-free representation. Because this serious conflict of interest compromised the integrity of criminal proceedings against Jordan, I would find that it was presumptively prejudicial and denied him the constitutional guarantees of a fair trial with the effective assistance of conflict-free counsel. Accordingly, I would grant Jordan's application to proceed with a motion for post-conviction relief (PCR), reverse the conviction, and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 2. Jordan was convicted of depraved-heart murder and received a life sentence. He was represented by Lawyers Akillie Malone and Antwayn Patrick. At some point after the trial, Jordan discovered that Attorney Malone had been romantically involved with the lead investigator on the case. This investigator, Officer Oliver of the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, had taken the primary role in gathering evidence against Jordan, including an interview of him after his arrest. Oliver was a major witness against Jordan. The pretrial and trial testimony of Officer Oliver total approximately one hundred pages of transcript. At a pretrial hearing on a defense motion to suppress Jordan's audiotaped statement, Attorney Malone cross-examined Officer Oliver about Jordan's interview. And at trial, Attorney Malone cross-examined Officer Oliver about his investigation of the case, including Jordan's arrest, his interview, witness statements, a gunshot residue test, and the development of Jordan as the sole suspect. All the while, Jordan knew nothing of his lawyer's relationship with this key prosecution witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 3. According to an affidavit from Antwayn Patrick attached to Jordan's PCR application, Attorney Patrick-Jordan's other defense lawyer-had known of the romantic relationship between Attorney Malone and Officer Oliver during his representation of Jordan. He swore that neither he nor Attorney Malone ever had informed their client of this romantic relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 4. After Jordan's discovery of defense counsel's conflict, he filed his first application for a motion for PCR with this Court, and a three-judge panel denied the claim in a single sentence: \"[t]he panel further finds that the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails to meet the test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ] (1984) [,] and that the application should be denied.\" Jordan then raised the issue in his federal\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   proceedings. In his report and recommendation, Magistrate Judge F. Keith Ball found that the threshold issue was whether to apply the two-prong test from\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , requiring a showing that counsel's deficient performance prejudiced the defendant, or the test from\n   <em>\n    Cuyler v. Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182598\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/335/\">\n    446 U.S. 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182598\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/335/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182598\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/335/\">\n    64 L.Ed.2d 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980), in which the defendant is relieved of the burden to demonstrate prejudice and must show only that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected the adequacy of counsel's representation. Judge Ball found that, although Jordan's case involved a conflict of interest, the test from\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   should apply. This was because the United States Supreme Court has applied the\n   <em>\n    Cuyler\n   </em>\n   test only in cases involving conflicts stemming from counsel's representation of multiple defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 5. Applying the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   test, Judge Ball found that Attorney Malone's failure to disclose her relationship with Oliver to Jordan was deficient performance. But\n   Judge Ball made the additional finding that Jordan had failed to make any showing that he had been prejudiced by Attorney Malone's deficient performance. Judge Ball found from a review of the transcript that Attorney Malone had \"cross-examined Oliver ably.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   At the suppression hearing she questioned him vigorously as to why the tape recorder was not turned on during the time he read Jordan his rights and why Jordan had refused to sign the rights waiver form, and she challenged the inconsistency in his testimony as to whether Jordan asked the officers whether he needed an attorney. After Oliver's direct testimony at trial, which consisted primarily of a discussion of his interview with Jordan and reading from the transcript of the interview, Malone attempted to establish on cross-examination that Jordan had maintained his innocence during the interview in spite of Oliver's repeated efforts to pressure him into a confession. She also attempted to show that his investigation had been incomplete.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Because Jordan had not shown prejudice, Judge Ball found that he was entitled to no relief on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 6. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi adopted Judge Ball's opinion as the opinion of the court. The district court provided additional analysis of Jordan's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The district court found that the facts underlying the claim were troubling and that this Court's one-sentence adjudication of the claim was limited, but that our decision was entitled to deference nonetheless. The district court found that it was reasonable for this Court to review Jordan's claim under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   rather than\n   <em>\n    Cuyler\n   </em>\n   , because the United States Supreme Court has not expanded\n   <em>\n    Cuyler\n   </em>\n   's application beyond claims of conflicts engendered by multiple representation. And, in\n   <em>\n    Beets v. Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414351\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/65/1258/#p1265\">\n    65 F.3d 1258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1265-66 (5th Cir. 1995), an\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   decision of the Fifth Circuit had limited\n   <em>\n    Cuyler\n   </em>\n   to cases involving multiple representation. After finding no error in the application of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   rather than\n   <em>\n    Cuyler\n   </em>\n   , the district court noted its agreement with Judge Ball's finding that Jordan had failed to show prejudice, specifically, a reasonable likelihood that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different but for Attorney Malone's deficient performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    The instant case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 7. Jordan now brings his ineffective assistance of counsel claim before this Court in his second application for leave to proceed with a motion for post-conviction relief. Although his claim technically is time-barred, barred as a successive pleading, and barred under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   by the Uniform Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act (UPCCRA), I would allow his claim to proceed because, not only does Jordan assert the violation of a fundamental right, he has provided an arguable basis for the claim. \"[E]rrors affecting fundamental constitutional rights are excepted from the procedural bars of the UPCCRA.\"\n   <em>\n    Rowland v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7043906\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/42/503/#p507\">\n    42 So.3d 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 507 (Miss. 2010).

In\n   <em>\n    Bevill v.

Jordan has produced an abundance of evidence of an actual conflict. Defense counsel, Malone, was living with the lead witness against her client at all stages of the representation, and she married that witness six months after the trial. The interests of an attorney representing a criminal defendant and the State's lead investigator are diametrically opposed. Oliver's job was to build the strongest possible case for the conviction of Jordan, and Malone's job was to thwart that undertaking. I would find that, when defense counsel is in a committed romantic relationship with the lead prosecution witness, that is an actual conflict of interest. Therefore, no showing of prejudice is required, and Jordan is entitled to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 15.

The court stressed the need to avoid even an appearance of impropriety, and it recognized the perils inherent in this particular breed of conflict:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   As distinct from parties to casual social contacts, those who are involved in a sustained dating relationship over a period of months are normally perceived, if not in fact, as sharing a strong emotional or romantic bond. Such an apparently close relationship between counsel directly opposing each other in a criminal prosecution naturally and reasonably gives rise to speculation that the professional judgment of counsel as well as the zealous representation to which an accused is entitled has been compromised. No matter how well intentioned defense counsel is in carrying out his responsibilities to the accused, he may be subject to subtle influences manifested, for example, in a reluctance to engage in abrasive confrontation with opposing counsel during settlement negotiations and trial advocacy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 832-33,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=213%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20521\">\n    213 Cal.Rptr. 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). Although this case involves the prosecution's lead investigator rather than opposing counsel, these same considerations were present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 16. It may well be, as the magistrate judge and the district court found in Jordan's\n   <em>\n    habeas\n   </em>\n   proceedings, that a facial review of the cold record seems to reflect that Attorney Malone was highly professional and that she credibly cross-examined her paramour. But this Court cannot know what other areas of inquiry an independent lawyer might have explored on cross examination. We do not know what\n   was left undone and unsaid. Attorney Malone was sufficiently unscrupulous that she chose not to inform the court of a glaring conflict that placed her at odds with her client. Attorney Malone and Oliver lived together during the trial, and it is strains credulity to imagine that they never talked about Malone's impending examination of Oliver, especially considering that Malone lacked the professional integrity to inform her client or the court of the conflict. It is worth noting that Attorney Malone, not Attorney Patrick,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   cross-examined Oliver on both occasions. Even if Attorney Malone and Oliver never discussed the conflict, it was for the client to decide whether to waive it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 17. Certainly, Attorney Malone committed a grave breach of her ethical obligations by failing to disclose such a patently obvious conflict to the court, opposing counsel, and, of course, her client. Had the conflict been disclosed, Jordan would have been entitled to the appointment of substitute counsel.\n   <em>\n    Littlejohn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7481241\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/593/20/#p23\">\n    593 So.2d at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is unlikely that any defendant aware of the true state of affairs between defense counsel and the detective who had gathered the evidence against him would have chosen that lawyer to defend him. But even assuming Jordan would have and could have waived the conflict, waiver would have required the trial judge's participation by determining from Jordan's narrative statement that he knowingly and intelligently decided to proceed with counsel burdened by a conflict.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7481241\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/593/20/#p23\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As it stands, the substantial romantic entanglement between defense counsel and the State's lead investigator denied Jordan the effective assistance of counsel as a matter of state law.
