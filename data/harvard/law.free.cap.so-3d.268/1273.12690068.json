The district court determined that the only proper venue for this litigation, pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act, La.

The district court denied the motion for new trial in its judgment dated August 24, 2018. On October 1, 2018, appellants filed a motion for devolutive appeal, which the district court granted in an order dated October 11, 2018. For the following reasons, we dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This appeal arises from an adverse ruling on venue.

The motion for appeal was not filed until October 1, 2018. The June 29, 2018 judgment is not a final, appealable judgment. The proper procedural device to seek review of a judgment granting or denying an exception of improper venue is an application for supervisory writs. The motion for new trial cannot interrupt the 30-day period for filing an application for supervisory writs. The motion for appeal was not filed within the 30-day time period for filing an application for supervisory writs. Accordingly, this Court is unable to invoke its supervisory jurisdiction to convert the appeal to an application for supervisory writs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    APPEAL DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    La.
