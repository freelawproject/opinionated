The trial court simply was not presented with evidence sufficient to satisfy the burden placed on Mr. Tecklenburg by Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420. However, our affirmance does not preclude Mr. Tecklenburg from again seeking a determination of confidentiality provided that he sufficiently justifies the need for closure of the records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.420(e)(1) (providing that a petition to determine the confidentiality of records must (1) \"identify the particular court records or a portion of a record that the movant seeks to have determined as confidential with as much specificity as possible without revealing the information subject to the confidentiality determination\"; (2) \"specify the bases for determining that such court records are confidential without revealing confidential information\"; and (3) \"set forth the specific legal authority and any applicable legal standards for determining such court records to be confidential without revealing confidential information\");\n   <em>\n    Barron v.
