To adequately answer this question, we first provide a brief history of the proceedings below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   In 1997, following a jury trial, Appellant was convicted of felony first-degree murder, armed robbery, and armed carjacking. Appellant was a juvenile at the time that he committed these crimes. The trial court sentenced Appellant to serve life in prison without the possibility of parole for the murder conviction and two separate 112.7-month prison sentences for the armed robbery and armed carjacking convictions. The court ordered the 112.7-month prison sentences to run concurrently with each other but consecutively to the life sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirmed Appellant's convictions and sentences on direct appeal without opinion.\n   <em>\n    Purdy v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=725%20So.%202d%201137\">\n    725 So.2d 1137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 5th DCA 1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Over the ensuing years, Appellant filed several motions seeking postconviction relief. These motions were denied by the lower court, and the denial orders were affirmed on appeal by this court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless,\n   on May 21, 2015, Appellant filed a successive motion for postconviction relief based upon the United States Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Alabama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2469,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), where the Court held that a sentencing scheme that mandates a life sentence without the possibility of parole for a juvenile offender who commits a homicide violates the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Appellant argued that although his life sentence was final long before\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   was released, he is now entitled to relief from this sentence because the Florida Supreme Court recently held that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   was to be applied retroactively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Falcon v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882885\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/162/954/#p962\">\n    162 So.3d 954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 962-63 (Fla. 2015). The postconviction court agreed, summarily granted the motion, and set the matter for resentencing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On November 18, 2015, the court held the resentencing hearing. At this hearing, Appellant's counsel requested that a \"credit time served\" sentence be imposed, suggesting to the court that it could craft a \"sentencing scheme\" that would allow Appellant to be immediately released. The State countered that Appellant should be resentenced to serve fifty years in prison for the murder conviction. Pertinent to this appeal, the State also advised the court that it would need to address at this hearing or at the subsequent review hearing whether Appellant was also entitled to be resentenced on his previously imposed consecutive sentences for the armed robbery and armed carjacking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The court, after considering the factors set forth in section 921.1401(2)(a)-(j), Florida Statutes (2015), resentenced Appellant to serve forty years in prison for the murder conviction, with appropriate jail credit and prison credit awarded, but did not separately provide for a sentence review hearing in this new sentence. The court declined to hold the review hearing that day, advising Appellant that he would first need to file the necessary paperwork requesting the review hearing and, that at this later hearing, the court would determine whether \"[Appellant] can be released.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the court did not modify Appellant's sentences for the armed robbery or armed carjacking convictions, concluding that it did not have the discretion or authority to do so. As a result, Appellant's total or aggregate sentence was now 49 years, 4.7 months (the modified 40-year sentence for the murder conviction, followed by the 112.7-month sentences for the robbery and carjacking convictions, which remained concurrent to each other, but consecutive to the sentence for murder).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Consistent with the court's direction, the following day, Appellant filed an application for sentence review pursuant to sections 921.1402(2) and (4), Florida Statutes (2015). In his application, Appellant asserted that the court had the authority at this review hearing to modify his sentences for the robbery and carjacking convictions in addition to modifying his forty-year sentence for the murder conviction, based on the court's authority to correct an unconstitutional sentencing scheme. Alternatively,\n   Appellant suggested that the court could modify his sentence for the murder in such a fashion to effectuate his \"immediate release to society.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 18, 2015, the court conducted the sentence review hearing. After receiving brief testimony from Appellant, together with argument from counsel, the court specifically found Appellant to have been rehabilitated and that it reasonably believed Appellant to be fit to reenter society. Appellant's counsel reminded the court that in his application for the review hearing, counsel had indicated to the court that it had the authority at this review hearing to modify Appellant's entire sentencing scheme and not just the modified forty-year sentence for the murder. Alternatively, counsel suggested that the court could modify Appellant's forty-year sentence down to a ten-year prison sentence, arguing that because Appellant had been in custody for over twenty years, the additional time Appellant had already served could be applied towards his remaining 112.7-month prison sentences for the armed robbery and armed kidnapping convictions, thereby allowing Appellant to be immediately released from prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court first calculated that, at the time of the review hearing, Appellant had been in custody on this case for a total of twenty years, six months, and thirteen days. It then modified Appellant's sentence on the murder conviction to this amount of time served, to be followed by ten years of probation. However, the court again concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider modifying the 112.7-month prison sentences for the armed robbery and armed carjacking convictions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Tyson v.

The First District affirmed the new sentences, concluding that the forty-five-year prison term did not constitute a de facto life sentence in violation of\n   <em>\n    Graham.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelsey v.

We therefore hold that the lower court erred in failing to consider Appellant's aggregate 49-year, 4.7-month prison sentence at the review hearing and remand for the trial court to conduct a second review hearing to address whether to modify this sentence. If the court determines at this hearing that Appellant has been rehabilitated and is reasonably believed to be fit to reenter society, the court shall modify the aggregate sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 921.1402(7), Fla.

At the hearing on the postconviction motion, Appellant raised the issue of determining the applicable sentencing guidelines as to counts two and three, which the trial court declined to address, but Appellant did not raise any issues concerning his aggregate sentence. At the conclusion of the hearing, Appellant requested clarification on the trial court's ruling, but he did not object or argue to the contrary when the trial court stated that it did not believe it had discretion to modify or change Appellant's sentence on counts two and three. Moreover, when the sentences imposed in counts two and three were left undisturbed on resentencing, Appellant did not appeal the trial court's decision to leave those sentences intact. Subsequently, during the judicial review hearing under section 921.1402(2)(c), Appellant did not object when the trial court indicated it did not have jurisdiction to resentence him on those counts. During the judicial review hearing, and in his motion to correct his sentence under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.800(b), Appellant did no more than argue that he was entitled to immediate release based on his rehabilitation and fitness to reenter society and seek to reduce the first-degree felony murder sentence to ten years so that the sentences for counts two and three, running consecutive to the first-degree felony murder sentence, had already been completed. Appellant made no arguments concerning the aggregate length of his sentences. In fact, it was the State, not Appellant, who raised the issue of the trial court's lack of jurisdiction to review the sentences in counts two and three under section 921.1402(1). As such, the sentences in counts two and three are not subject to review.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fla. R. App. P. 9.140(e) ;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    <em>\n     Jackson v.
