Citizens filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted by the trial court. On appeal, Appellant argues that the evidence in support of Citizens' summary judgment motion was not properly authenticated in compliance with Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.510(c). In response, Citizens \"concedes that the evidence in support of [its] summary judgment motion was not properly authenticated in compliance with [FRCP] 1.510(c).\" Thus, Citizens agrees with Appellant that \"the trial court's ruling cannot stand.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \"[I]t is apodictic that summary judgments may not be granted at any type of hearing, absent the existence of 'summary judgment evidence' in the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Eco-Tradition, LLC v.
