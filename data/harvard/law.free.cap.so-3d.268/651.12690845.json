Code 1975, and was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Habel's sentence was split, and she was ordered to serve 30 days followed by 5 years' supervised probation. Habel was ordered to pay a $100 fine, a $100 crime-victims-compensation assessment, a $150 bail-bond fee, court costs, and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The State's evidence at trial tended to show the following: In February 2015, Habel alleged that her husband, Matthew, had sexually abused their two children, M.H. and S.H. Habel and Matthew were involved in divorce proceedings when she made the allegations. Deputy Eugene Nash of the Madison County Sheriff's Department, who was assigned to the National Children's Advocacy Center (\"NCAC\"), initiated a criminal investigation. Because the allegations involved possession and production of child pornography, Deputy Nash informed Special Agent Troy McCarter of the United States Department of Homeland Security about the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 16, 2015, Agent McCarter searched Matthew's house and seized several electronic devices. Agent McCarter testified that Matthew was distraught but extremely cooperative and that the search failed to uncover any evidence of child pornography. On April 6, 2015, Agent McCarter interviewed Habel; during the interview, he informed her that it was a crime to lie to law-enforcement officials. Habel then provided a sworn affidavit detailing her allegations against Matthew\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and signed the affidavit in the presence of Agent McCarter and Special Agent Derrick Moore.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Habel's affidavit, which the State introduced as an exhibit, had a heading stating\n   \"Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, State of Alabama, County of Madison\" and began with the statement, \"I, Sara Courtney Habel, being duly sworn, state the following.\" (C. 108.) The affidavit was four pages in length. Habel initialed the first page and signed each subsequent page under a statement that read: \"The contents of this statement are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. I have provided the above statement freely and voluntarily without any threats or coercion.\" (C. 109-11.) Agent McCarter signed each page; his signature on the second, third, and fourth pages appeared under a statement that read: \"Subscribed and sworn to me on 6 in the month of April in the year of 2015.\" (C. 109-11.) Pages two, three, and four were signed by the witness, Agent Moore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   December Guzzo, a child-forensic-interview specialist with the NCAC, interviewed M.H. on February 9, 2015. Guzzo testified that, during that interview, M.H. did not \"make any specific allegations about sexual abuse ... committed by her father.\" (R. 99.) Guzzo stated that during a second interview conducted on February 23, 2015, M.H. \"pretty much disclose[d] almost right away.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (R. 103.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Beth Jackson, a therapist and program manager at the NCAC, treated M.H. from May 2015 through February 2016. Jackson testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"[M.H.] told me that her mom made her feel uncomfortable by asking her to lie about what daddy did. And I asked her what that lie was and she said, 'To say that he touched me.' I asked her, 'Where did you, did you say that he had to touch you?' And she said, 'On my privates and on my bottom.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (R. 108.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   M.H., who was eight years old at the time of trial, testified that her father never touched her or S.H. inappropriately; that her father never touched himself inappropriately in front of her or S.H.; and that her father never showed her any \"naked people\" on his cellular telephone. M.H. stated that she had made up those allegations on her own and that Habel had not pressured her to lie about her father. When asked why she said her \"dad had done that stuff,\" M.H. shrugged her shoulders and responded that she did not know. M.H. testified that she did not want anyone to get in trouble.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Matthew testified that he never touched M.H. inappropriately; that he never touched himself in front of her in an inappropriate manner; that he never discussed \"masturbation, male or female, child porn, anything like that\" with M.H. (R. 78); that he never viewed child pornography; and that he never viewed adult pornography in the presence of his children. Matthew testified that, during M.H.'s last visit with Habel, which occurred two days before the trial,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[M.H.] stated that her mother asked her about the case and with, um, what she had talked about, uh, with the D.A. And [M.H.] said that she refused. She was asked again. And Sara [Habel] stated that-per [M.H.], Sara stated that, um, she wouldn't talk to her again if she did not tell her what she had talked about with the lawyers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"[M.H.] told me that she stomped her foot and said, 'No, I'm not going to tell you and you will talk to me again.' And\n   five or 10 minutes later [M.H.] said her mother talked to her again and she said, 'See, I told you you would talk to me again.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (R. 85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the State rested, Habel moved for a judgment of acquittal, and the circuit court denied her motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Habel testified in her own behalf and stated that she believed the allegations of abuse. On direct examination by the defense, Habel testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Q. Let me ask you did you, did you, in fact, ask your daughter to lie about her father?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"A.

No.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (R. 136-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   At the close of the evidence, Habel renewed her motion for a judgment of acquittal, and the circuit court again denied it. Habel was ultimately convicted of first-degree perjury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Habel filed a motion for a new trial alleging, among other things, that the verdict was contrary to the great weight of the evidence, that the State's evidence was insufficient to sustain her conviction, and that her conviction was contrary to the law. The circuit court denied Habel's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On appeal, Habel raises several issues. We address each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Initially, we note that several of the arguments Habel raises on appeal fail to comply with Rule 28(a)(10), Ala.

Crim. App. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In the statement-of-issues section of her brief on appeal, Habel contends that the circuit court erred when, she says: (1) it did not dismiss the \"first-degree perjury charge when [Habel] did not make [her statement] knowing it to be false, as it relates to the definition of first-degree perjury\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Habel's brief, p. 3); (2) it denied her \"appointed counsel at a critical stage of a proceeding in which she faced incarceration if convicted\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Habel's brief, p. 3); (3) it denied her \"volunteer counsel a continuance, preventing counsel from preparing for trial and providing [Habel] with competent counsel\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Habel's brief, p. 3); and (4) it allowed the State \"to have the child's therapists testify as to what the child said to them when the child could not waive the privilege of confidentiality.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Habel's brief, p. 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Aside from her claim that she did not knowingly make a false statement, Habel does not address these issues in the argument section of her brief. With respect to that claim, Habel's argument consists entirely\n   as follows: \"Sara Habel believed with all her heart that her children were being harmed; she still believes it. She did not knowingly make a false statement to discredit or have her husband charged, as argued by the State's attorney. (R-9.).\" (Habel's brief, p. 11.) In the conclusion section of her brief, Habel briefly references the remaining issues listed above; she does not, however, support her claims with citations to the record or to any legal authority whatsoever. Habel's arguments, therefore, are merely \"undelineated general propositions unsupported by sufficient legal authority or argument.\" McWhorter,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931998\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/142/1195/#p1236\">\n    142 So.3d at 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, these claims are deemed waived, and Habel is not entitled to relief on these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Habel contends that the State failed to present sufficient evidence to sustain her conviction because, she says, the false statement at issue was not made during an official proceeding, as that term is defined in \u00a7 13A-10-100, Ala. Code 1975, and as is required for a first-degree-perjury conviction pursuant to \u00a7 13A-10-101.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Habel claims that the State\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \"used [her] statement to law enforcement, notarized, to accommodate first-degree perjury. The criminal charge indicated that since the statement was notarized, it was a proceeding. An investigation is not a proceeding, and notarizing a signature does not make it one anymore than someone signing their name before a notary to complete a sworn pleading is a proceeding. The proceeding is one wherein testimony is taken or a person takes an oath. Notarizing a signature is affirming that person's identity, not swearing them in for testimony.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   (Habel's brief, pp. 10-11). According to Habel, \u00a7\u00a7 13A-10-100 and 13A-10-101, Ala. Code 1975, limit official proceedings to \"actual proceedings-i.e., grand jury, preliminary hearing, trial, ethics hearings-places where one would be sworn to testify.\" (Habel's brief, p. 10.) We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The indictment against Habel reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \"The Grand Jury of said County charge, that before the finding of this indictment, SARA COURTNEY HABEL, whose name is unknown to the Grand Jury other than as stated, did swear falsely in an official proceeding, to-wit: the criminal investigation into Matthew Habel, and her false statement was material to the proceeding, to-wit: she swore that her children had been sexually abused by her husband when they had not, in violation of Section 13A-10-101 of the CODE OF ALABAMA, against the peace and dignity of the State of Alabama.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   (C. 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   On April 18, 2017, Habel moved to dismiss the first-degree-perjury charge against her, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \"In response to the discovery request, the undersigned was given only an affidavit made to a police officer in the course of his investigation as the basis for one count of perjury in the first degree. The difference between perjury first degree and perjury second degree is that perjury first is made\n   <em>\n    under oath in an official proceeding\n   </em>\n   . The statement to police does not constitute a statement made under oath\n   <em>\n    in an official proceeding\n   </em>\n   . The indictment refers to the police report-which does not constitute perjury in the first degree, but, rather, perjury in the second degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \"There is either discovery that has not been provided to the defense, or this matter is due to be dismissed, because no sworn statement given in an official proceeding has been provided by the State.

In response, the State argued that a criminal investigation is considered an official proceeding because it is conducted by \"somebody that has been authorized to administer oaths and that intends that it will constitute a proceeding or an ultimate trial [on] the issue.\" (R. 10.) The State then presented evidence that Agent McCarter was authorized \"to administer oaths as part of his duties.\" (R. 12.)

According to Johnson, \u00a7 13A-10-123, Ala. Code 1975, requires that an official proceeding be pending before an accused can be convicted of intimidating a witness. This argument is meritless.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \"First, contrary to Johnson's assertion, the State proved that an 'official proceeding' was pending against him at which Joyner would be a witness at the time of his second encounter with Joyner on September 30, 2003. Section 13A-10-100(a)(5), Ala. Code 1975, defines 'official proceeding' as '[a]ny proceeding heard before any legislative, judicial, administrative, or other government agency or official authorized to hear evidence under oath.' Rule 2.1, Ala. R. Crim. P., provides that '[a]ll criminal proceedings shall be commenced either by indictment or\n   <em>\n    by complaint\n   </em>\n   . (Emphasis added.) As noted, Joyner filed a complaint against Johnson in the Dothan Municipal Court charging harassment, on September 26, 2013, four days before Johnson returned to the school on September 30, 2003.\n   <em>\n    This complaint commenced a\n   </em>\n   criminal proceeding against Johnson for harassment.\n   <em>\n    Thus, the State proved that there was an 'official proceeding' pending against Johnson, a criminal proceeding charging him with harassment\n   </em>\n   , at which Joyner, the victim of harassment, would be a witness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   932 So.2d at 982 (emphasis added).

Code 1975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The State introduced as evidence the sworn affidavit that Habel provided to Agent McCarter during the April 6, 2015, interview. Agent McCarter testified that he interviewed Habel as part of a criminal investigation and that he informed Habel at the beginning of the interview that it was a crime to lie to law-enforcement officials. Habel then provided a sworn affidavit detailing her allegations against Matthew and signed the affidavit in the presence of Agent McCarter and Agent Moore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Habel's affidavit had a heading stating \"Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, State of Alabama, County of Madison\" and began with the statement, \"I, Sara Courtney Habel, being duly sworn, state the following.\" (C. 108.) The affidavit was four pages in length. Habel initialed the first page, and she signed each subsequent page under a statement that read: \"The contents of this statement are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. I have provided the above statement freely and voluntarily without any threats or coercion.\" (C. 109-11.) Agent McCarter signed each page; his signature on the second, third, and fourth pages appeared under a statement that read: \"Subscribed and sworn to me on 6 in the month of April in the year of 2015.\" (C. 109-11.) Pages two, three, and four were signed by the witness, Agent Moore. Because Habel submitted a sworn affidavit to Agent McCarter during the criminal investigation of Matthew, her false statement was made during an official proceeding as that term is defined in \u00a7\u00a7 13A-10-100, Ala. Code 1975. Therefore, the circuit court did not err when it denied Habel's motion to for a judgment of acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Burke, J., concurs.
