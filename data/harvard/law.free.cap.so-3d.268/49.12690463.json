The judgment of the trial court described the proceeding as one to determine the boundary line between property owned by Alabama Power and property owned by Ray Keller, ostensibly as coterminous landowners. The record establishes, however, that Alabama Power and Keller are not record title owners of coterminous properties in some of the disputed areas. \"Parties to a boundary line dispute action must be coterminous owners, and equity is without jurisdiction in such a proceeding unless the complainant owns land adjoining respondent's at the disputed boundary.\"\n   <em>\n    Walls v.

To the extent the judgment purports to establish\n   a boundary line where Alabama Power and Keller are not coterminous landowners, we hold that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to do so and that, accordingly, that portion of its judgment is void. Therefore, we dismiss the appeal insofar as it pertains to that portion of the judgment. We affirm the portion of the judgment establishing a boundary line in that part of the disputed areas in which the parties are coterminous landowners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 28, 2016, the trial court entered a lengthy and detailed judgment, a portion of which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"First and foremost, this is a land line or boundary line case.

Mr. Nichols stated that he never hunted on the upper side of the gate because 'it was wildlife management area land.'

He said that at the end of 2006 someone took down twenty or more of the wildlife management area signs and stacked them at his hunting cabin. He said that he did not know where they came from and had been unable to learn from anyone else whence they came. Mr. Nichols said that he saw the trees where the old signs were broken off and that some of them could be matched up to the tree where they were removed, like pieces of a puzzle.

Mr. Fleming testified that he had moved the boulders which were blocking the road and that the boulders were located exactly where the\n   red line came down to the road. He said that he covered up approximately one mile of the red painted line, because the red marks did not represent what he understood was the true and correct line. He testified that he assumed the hunting club had marked it, and marked it erroneously. He believed that he was well within his rights as Mr. Keller's representative and contractor to remove what were erroneous boundary lines.

Mr. Fleming believes this to be the true line. Mr. Fleming further testified that when he obliterated the red paint marks (which were apparently painted by Alabama Power Company), that no old paint marks were present. He insisted that he only painted what he knew were fresh paint marks. He further testified that he would never paint over an old line, but that he would paint over a new line that he believed was erroneous. He stated that he would not remove a historic line, [but] it never occurred to him to call Alabama Power Company officials to discuss the fresh red painted line or the gate being bulldozed down.

He testified that he did not paint the west line of the Northeast Quarter of the Northeast Quarter at that time. Instead, he painted the west line of the Northwest Quarter of the Northeast Quarter in Section 31, which is land owned by Mr. Keller now and, at that time, his predecessors, the Allisons. While Mr. Cook's testimony is confusing about exactly what he painted and why, it is clear that he did not paint the boundary advanced by [Alabama Power] in this case and that he painted boundaries of lands that did not belong to his employer, Mr. Ware, or his successor in interest, Alabama Power.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"Mr. Cook stated that the line to paint was easy to find and that no one objected to his painting the line where he did in 1983.

This testimony is important because some signs placed along alternative boundaries for the subject property\n   are not in keeping with this Alabama Power method of erecting signs. The strong implication is, of course, that someone deceptively used management area signs and red paint to mark a false boundary, a false boundary which strongly favored Ray Keller's position in this dispute and in this litigation.

The caves, the creek bed, and the Bubble-Up are immovable objects that have withstood the test of time, the court cannot fathom any difference in these physical features from 1942 to the present. They are unchanged now and will be unchanged a hundred years hence, the acts of man notwithstanding. They are excellent, permanent monuments that simplify the court's decision. The court walked the boundary created without the benefit of any modern technology in the 1942 deed and reaffirmed in the 1953 deed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \"In addition, the court personally viewed the physical evidence on the ground, which evidence confirms that the court walk[ed] over and along the true and correct boundary. Signs nailed into and imbedded in trees, hacks and blazes in trees, old paint on trees, paint on rocks, all manner of fencing grown into old trees, fencing lying upon or buried in duff layer, various vintages of hunting club signs on the ground and in the duff layer, and various vintages of management area signs on the ground and buried in the duff layer run in concert with the physical features described above. These items show that generations of men, over 60-odd years, affixed items to the land consistent with an agreed and established boundary, that they placed these items in the exact area of the boundary, and that it is the same as the boundary claimed by [Keller] in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \"Further, at no time since 1942 has Alabama Power or any Alabama Power predecessor adversely possessed this rugged and remote ground so as to alter the historical and agreed boundaries. Alabama Power's claims to the contrary fail as Alabama Power's and its predecessors' acts on the land are sporadic and scrambling and do not satisfy the elements of adverse possession.

While the court believes that simple mathematics reflect that as little as 2.7 thousandths (0.0027) of the Alabama Power Company's tract is in dispute in this case, even if taking the Alabama Power Company's assertions as true, the court believes this argument is critically flawed in three other respects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \"First, the Alabama Power Company only has color of title to the disputed lands in the Northeast Quarter of the Northeast Quarter of Section 31....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \"Time considerations also apply to the Southern disputed parcel, which has been pastured, grazed, row cropped, and the like by Mr. Keller and his predecessors since before 1942, and for so long that any adverse use ripened into title decades ago.

Alternatively, Alabama Power sought to amend its pleadings to add the rule of repose as an affirmative defense if the trial court granted Keller's motion to amend the complaint to present a reformation claim. On April 2, 2015, the trial court conducted a posttrial hearing at which the trial court stated that it would allow Alabama Power to amend its pleadings to add the affirmative defense of the rule of repose if it allowed Keller to amend his pleadings to add a reformation claim.

Although Alabama Power is a grantee in a 1988 deed from Holland Ware that purports to convey all the disputed parcels, including the northern disputed parcel and the middle disputed parcel, we must apply \"the fundamental principle that one cannot convey more property than one owns.\"\n   <em>\n    Hinote v.

The trial court determined a boundary line as described in the 1942 deed in Alabama Power's chain of title and in the 1953 deed in Keller's chain of title. According to that boundary line, the northern disputed parcel and the middle disputed parcel were not included in the property conveyed in the 1942 deed. As a result, the deeds in Alabama Power's chain of title that follow the 1942 deed merely purport to convey title to the northern disputed parcel and the middle disputed parcel. Because its predecessors did not own those parcels, however, Alabama Power did not acquire title to the northern disputed parcel and the middle disputed parcel through its 1988 deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Keller claims ownership of the disputed parcels through his deed, the deeds of his predecessors, and adverse possession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The evidence in the record shows that the description of the property conveyed in Keller's 1988 deed does not include the northern disputed parcel and the middle disputed parcel. In accordance with the trial court's findings, Jim Davis and Annie Davis conveyed the northern disputed parcel and the middle disputed parcel as part of the property described in the 1953 deed to T.R. Allison, which is in Keller's chain of title. Alabama Power argues that the 1953 deed in Keller's chain of title did not convey the northern disputed parcel and the middle disputed parcel because, it asserts, the references to the government survey lines control over the courses-and-distances description in the deed. We need not consider this argument, however, because, as asserted by Alabama Power, the property conveyed by T.R. Allison to Earl\n   Allison, another predecessor in Keller's chain of title, did not include the northern disputed parcel and the middle disputed parcel. The record indicates that the 1969 deed recording that conveyance used a description referencing government survey lines. That description is consistent with the descriptions of the property conveyed in subsequent deeds in Keller's chain of title and in Keller's own deed, and the descriptions in those deeds do not encompass the northern disputed parcel and the middle disputed parcel. Therefore, the evidence in the record regarding Keller's chain of title does not establish that the northern disputed parcel and the middle disputed parcel were conveyed to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Keller alternatively asserted an adverse-possession claim against Alabama Power. \"Adverse possession becomes a perfect title on the theory that the\n   <em>\n    true owner\n   </em>\n   has by his own fault and neglect failed to assert his right against the hostile holding ....\"\n   <em>\n    Prestwood v.

Because Alabama Power is not the owner of the northern disputed parcel and the middle disputed parcel, it could not have ceded those parcels to Keller through adverse possession, and the trial court could not have granted such relief.

The judgment in that case established a boundary line and adjudicated adverse-possession claims regarding the entire disputed area. Our supreme court held that the only justiciable controversy in the case concerned the portion of the disputed area in which the parties were coterminous landowners. The supreme court reviewed and affirmed the portion of the judgment regarding an adverse-possession claim and the establishment of a boundary line in that disputed area.

Because the record in this case establishes that neither Keller nor Alabama Power own the northern disputed parcel and the middle disputed parcel, the parties are not coterminous landowners in those areas. Therefore, there is no justiciable boundary-line controversy regarding those areas, and the trial court lacked the jurisdiction to adjudicate adverse-possession claims as part of a boundary-line dispute in those areas.

In contrast, the record reflects that the claims of the parties did involve land owned by them in the southern disputed parcel. Therefore, the claims regarding property located in that parcel presented a justiciable boundary-line controversy. We hold that the trial court was not compelled to find that the doctrine of unclean hands applied in this case, and we affirm the portion of the judgment pertaining to property located in the southern disputed parcel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   APPLICATION GRANTED; OPINION OF MAY 5, 2017, WITHDRAWN; OPINION SUBSTITUTED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Pittman, Thomas, and Moore, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Thompson, P.J., concurs in the result, without writing.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    In the judgment, the trial court described the Bubble-Up as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n    \"There is an unusual natural feature on the disputed territory, which these parties call the 'Bubble-Up.'

Instead, the 1969 deed uses the following description referencing government survey lines:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n    \"The West half of Section 31; and the South half of the Northeast quarter of Section 31; and the Northwest quarter of the Northeast quarter of Section 31; all in Township 1 South, Range 6 East; in Jackson County, Alabama, and containing 440 acres, more or less.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Notably, the description does not convey any portion of the northeast quarter of the northeast quarter of Section 31 or any area north of Section 31, respectively comprising the middle disputed parcel and northern disputed parcel, as designated by the trial court.
