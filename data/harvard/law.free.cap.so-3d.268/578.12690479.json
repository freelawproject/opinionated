KING, JUSTICE FOR THE COURT\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   \u00b6 1. This matter is before the Court\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   on the \"Mississippi Bar's Petition for Acceptance of Irrevocable Resignation Pursuant to Rule 10, MRD.\" In its Petition, the Mississippi Bar requests that this Court accept the irrevocable resignation of Tacey June Clark and enter an order of disbarment. All procedural prerequisites have been met, thus we order the disbarment of Tacey June Clark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b6 2. On February 26, 2018, Tacey June Clark executed a Notice of Irrevocable Resignation. In the notice, Clark acknowledged a disciplinary matter pending against her before the Committee on Professional Responsibility (Docket No. 16-365-2) and averred that said disciplinary matter was the only disciplinary matter pending against her. Further, Clark stated that she did not desire to defend that matter and requested permission to irrevocably resign with prejudice from the Mississippi Bar. The Bar filed the instant Petition on March 15, 2018, requesting that this Court accept Clark's irrevocable resignation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 3. Rule 1 of the Mississippi Rules of Discipline provides that this Court \"has exclusive and inherent jurisdiction of matters pertaining to attorney discipline[.]\" M.R.D. 1(a);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Miss. Bar v. Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7007063\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/118/542/#p542\">\n    118 So.3d 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 542 (Miss. 2012). We apply de novo review to attorney discipline matters.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7007063\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/118/542/#p542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4. Pursuant to Rule 10.5 of the Mississippi Rules of Discipline:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [a]n attorney may tender an irrevocable resignation to either the Court or the Tribunal. Such a resignation shall acknowledge each and all disciplinary matters then pending, provide the docket number or numbers, state that the attorney does not desire to defend, and request permission to resign with prejudice from the Bar. Upon receipt of such a resignation, and any response that the Bar may elect to file, the disciplinary proceedings shall terminate and either the Court or the Tribunal shall enter its order accepting the resignation, revoking the attorney's license, and barring forever thereafter the attorney's right to seek reinstatement to the privilege of practicing law in this state. Such a resignation and order shall be considered disciplinary action, and the resignation shall be considered tantamount to the proof of guilt on the matter charged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   M.R.D. 10.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. After due consideration, we find that Tacey June Clark properly filed her Notice of Irrevocable Resignation in compliance with Mississippi Rule of Discipline 10.5, and that the Mississippi Bar is entitled to the relief it seeks. Based on the record before us, and consistent with the Rules of Discipline for the Mississippi Bar and our caselaw, this Court finds that Tacey June Clark shall be disbarred permanently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1. Tacey June Clark is hereby permanently DISBARRED from the practice of law in the State of Mississippi;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   2. This order shall constitute notice of permanent disbarment in this cause;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   3.
