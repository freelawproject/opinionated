In two of the cases were violation of probation proceedings based on new charges filed in the third case. We consolidated the appeals. As to the new charges, Defendant contends the trial court erred by: (1) failing to conduct a proper\n   <em>\n    Melbourne\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   analysis to a peremptory challenge by the State; and (2) violating Defendant's Sixth Amendment confrontation right by allowing the State to introduce a 911 call. We affirm on the Sixth Amendment issue without discussion. But because we agree the trial court did not comply with\n   <em>\n    Melbourne\n   </em>\n   , we reverse Defendant's convictions and sentences and remand for a new trial on the new charges. The ultimate question we answer in this case is whether the\n   <em>\n    Melbourne\n   </em>\n   procedure is\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   a three-step process, or a three-step process\n   <em>\n    if requested\n   </em>\n   . We determine that the\n   <em>\n    Melbourne\n   </em>\n   procedure is indeed always a three-step process. We affirm the trial court's judgment and sentences as to the violation of probation proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In Case Nos. 13011816CF10A and 13012248CF10A, Defendant was charged with violating probation, based in part on three counts of robbery with a firearm and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon filed in Case No. 14013212CF10A. The new charges proceeded to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During jury selection, the State exercised a peremptory challenge on Juror No. 10, an African-American male. At Defendant's request, the trial court asked the state for a race-neutral reason for the strike. The State responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The State does have a race-neutral reason. [Juror No. 10 ] indicated that he would prefer CSI evidence.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   Additionally, the Defense has stricken two black females in their first round of strikes. They've also stricken black individuals for cause. And this is --\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Cutting off the State, the trial court stated: \"All right. Okay. I find that to be [a] race-neutral reason. I'm going to uphold State's use of a peremptory on [Juror No. 10 ].\" Defendant did not make any further objection or argument at that time. However, at the conclusion of the jury selection process, when asked if each side accepted the panel of jurors, the defense advised the panel was not acceptable, in part because the trial court \"denied my\n   <em>\n    Melbourne vs. State\n   </em>\n   objection to the State striking [Juror No. 10 ].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The jury found Defendant guilty of three counts of robbery with a weapon, lesser-included offenses, and not guilty of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The court entered judgment and sentenced Defendant to concurrent prison terms for the three robberies. The trial court revoked Defendant's probation in the other two cases and imposed sentences in those cases. Defendant gave notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Appellate Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We review a trial court's decision to uphold or deny a peremptory challenge for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Truehill v.

In interpreting the true scope of the\n   <em>\n    Melbourne\n   </em>\n   procedure, we will rely on case law generated by\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Purkett\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, especially two decisions from the United States Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Step 3 of the\n    <em>\n     Melbourne\n    </em>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    ) Procedure\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant's appeal focuses on Step 3 of the\n   <em>\n    Melbourne\n   </em>\n   procedure. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   , Defendant contends the record does not support a conclusion that the trial court properly conducted Step 3. Specifically, Defendant argues the trial court did not review, analyze, or conduct any \"judicial assessment\" of the reasons given by the State for striking Juror No. 10 ; instead, the trial court summarily ratified the peremptory challenge. Additionally, Defendant argues the \"cold record\" is \"devoid of any indication\" that the trial court \"considered or weighed\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   relevant circumstances in deciding whether the State's strike was discriminatory.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The State responds, arguing a lack of preservation because Defendant failed to raise an issue of noncompliance with\n   <em>\n    Melbourne\n   </em>\n   below. As to the merits of Defendant's arguments, the State also relies on\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   , contending that when a defendant objects to the State's exercise of a peremptory challenge, and the trial court upholds the strike, the defendant carries the burden of persuasion that the State's strike was exercised in a discriminatory manner. The State contends the record shows the trial court complied with Step 3. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Lidiano v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8383205\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/967/972/#p975\">\n    967 So.2d 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 975 (Fla. 3d DCA 2007), the State argues that \"[t]he trial court is not required to orally perform its genuineness analysis or to articulate the basis for its ruling.\" Moreover, the State contends that because it pointed out, in providing its race-neutral reason for striking Juror No. 10, that the defense had stricken two black females in the defense's first round of strikes, after the State had twice accepted the jury panel including those jurors, the record reflects that the trial court was aware of and considered the circumstances relevant to determining if a strike was improperly discriminatory and implicitly found there was no pretext in the strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Spencer v.

Over the years, the case law has focused increasingly on Step 3 of the\n   <em>\n    Melbourne\n   </em>\n   procedure. The unresolved troublesome aspects of what Step 3 means and what it involves is perhaps best demonstrated by our supreme court's most recent opinion on the subject,\n   <em>\n    Spencer v.

That is to say,\n   <em>\n    Melbourne\n   </em>\n   imposes some procedural requirements as a\n   <em>\n    duty\n   </em>\n   on trial courts that do not require objections at each step to preserve the matter for appellate review; however, with regards to\n   <em>\n    factual accuracy of assertions by the proponent\n   </em>\n   of a peremptory\n   strike, the standard preservation requirements apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We conclude that at a minimum,\n   <em>\n    Melbourne\n   </em>\n   imposes a duty on trial courts at Step 3 to request a response to the proffered explanation from the opponent of a peremptory challenge once Step 2 has been completed.

It is not uncommon for trial court or appellate judges to ask questions of an advocate to test the strength of an argument. Judges are trained in the skills of neutrality, and we are confident that trial courts can engage in conducting a factual determination without becoming advocates, if questioning is needed to make a factual determination of pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The \"multiple ends\" the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Melbourne\n   </em>\n   procedure was designed to achieve should not be thwarted by the preservation requirements the dissent seeks to impose.

Unlike\n   <em>\n    Spencer II\n   </em>\n   , it is clear that the trial court did not request a response by Defendant to the explanation proffered by the State for the peremptory challenge. Instead, the trial court cut off the State while it was proffering its explanation for the strike and justification for its genuineness, and brought the analysis to an end with the statement, \"All right. Okay. I find that to be race-neutral reason. I'm going to uphold State's use of a peremptory on [Juror No. 10 ].\" On the record presented, we simply cannot assume that a genuineness inquiry was actually conducted in order to defer to the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Landis v.

The State contends that the record reflects the trial court was aware of and considered the circumstances relevant to determining if the strike was improperly discriminatory and implicitly found there was no pretext in the strike. We decline the invitation because the trial court cut off the State before it could point out that it had twice accepted the jury panel with those jurors when it exercised two peremptory challenges. We are satisfied that once the trial court decided the explanation was race neutral, it determined no further analysis was needed. In other words, the trial court prematurely curtailed the procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Because the trial court failed to comply with the duty imposed by Step 3 of the\n   <em>\n    Melbourne\n   </em>\n   procedure, we reverse the conviction and sentence, and remand the case for a new trial as to the robbery counts in Case No. 14013212CF10A. The violation of probation proceedings in the other two cases were tried without a jury, thus the error regarding jury selection does not affect the adjudication that Defendant violated probation in those cases. We affirm the adjudications and sentences imposed in Case Nos. 13011816CF10A and 13012248CF10A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   We further determine that our opinion in this case regarding the procedure for a\n   <em>\n    Melbourne\n   </em>\n   challenge conflicts with the opinions in\n   <em>\n    Brown v.
