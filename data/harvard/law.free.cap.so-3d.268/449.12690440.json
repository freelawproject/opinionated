Patrick Latrell Gray and Felecia Hannah Dotch petitioned the Attala County Chancery Court to allow Gray to adopt D.D.H. without terminating Dotch's parental rights. After consideration, the chancellor denied the petition. Aggrieved, Gray and Dotch appeal, arguing that their due-process and equal-protection rights were infringed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. After review, we reverse. The chancellor erred, as a matter of law, in finding that Mississippi Code Sections 93-17-3(4) and 93-17-13(2) (Supp. 2017) bar the adoption. As D.D.H.'s adoption by Gray is not barred by statute, it is unnecessary for this Court to perform a constitutional analysis of Sections 93-17-3(4) and 93-17-13(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. On August 21, 2003, Dotch gave birth to a daughter, D.D.H. Dotch and Gray have never been married, and only Dotch is listed on D.D.H.'s birth certificate. Near the time of D.D.H.'s conception, however, Dotch and Gray were in a romantic relationship, and both believed that Gray was D.D.H.'s father. Early in her life, D.D.H. lived with Gray and Gray's mother. When D.D.H. was old enough to attend school, she began to live with Dotch. During this time, Gray exercised\n   visitation with D.D.H. and continued to provide financial support to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. More than a decade after D.D.H's birth, Gray discovered that he was not her biological father. After this, Gray continued to visit and support D.D.H. The identity of D.D.H.'s biological father is not known. Currently, Gray and Dotch both are married to other people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Upon discovering that Gray was not D.D.H.'s biological father, Gray and Dotch petitioned the Attala County Chancery Court to allow Gray to adopt D.D.H. In the petition, the parties requested that Gray be allowed to adopt D.D.H. and Dotch be allowed to retain \"care, custody, and control\" of D.D.H. Gray and Dotch claimed that the adoption was in D.D.H.'s best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. At a hearing on the petition, the chancellor denied the petition for adoption under Mississippi Code Sections 93-17-3(4) and 93-17-13(2). In denying the petition, the chancellor stated, \"I think it may be [in] the child's best interest to be adopted. I think this statute ties my hands....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The order denying the petition (1) recognized that Gray had failed to join his wife, Shannon Gray, in the petition as required by Section 93-17-3(4), and (2) found that the petition's request that Dotch's parental rights not be terminated by the final decree was inconsistent with Section 93-17-13(2). The order also stated \"that although the Court may agree that it would be in the best interest of the minor child sought to be adopted, this Court is bound by the legislative requirement as found in Mississippi 93-13-1,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and therefore, the Petition for Adoption, should be, and it hereby is, DENIED.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. After denying the petition, the chancellor allowed an offer of proof. Dotch testified that D.D.H. was \"very strongly attached to [Gray] because he's the only father that's been in her life and been doing for her.\" She also stated that \"when [D.D.H.] was younger, she spent more time with [Gray and Gray's mother] than she did with me.... She cares a lot for him.\" Dotch also stated that Gray had always held himself out as D.D.H.'s father. Dotch maintained that she wanted to retain her parental rights after Gray's adoption of D.D.H. Gray testified that he had a \"[g]ood\" relationship with D.D.H. and that he had supported her financially since birth. Gray maintained that D.D.H. regularly visited him on two weekends out of each month. He also testified that his wife and D.D.H. \"get along good [sic].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Gray and Dotch both appeal the denial of the petition. On appeal, they maintain that Sections 93-17-3(4) and 93-17-13(2) violate their due-process rights under the United States and Mississippi Constitutions and their equal-protection rights under the United States Constitution. Gray and Dotch also assert that the denial of the petition violates D.D.H.'s equal-protection rights under the United States Constitution. Gray and Dotch properly served a copy of their brief on the Attorney General under Mississippi Rule of Appellate Procedure 44(a). M.R.A.P. 44(a). The deadline for the Attorney General to respond to the brief has passed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.A.P. 44(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9.

Mississippi Code Section 93-17-3\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13. The first section to consider is Section 93-17-3(4). Section 93-17-3(4) provides in pertinent part that \"[a]ny person may be adopted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter in term-time or in vacation by an unmarried adult or by\n   <em>\n    a married person whose spouse joins in the petition.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2093-17-3\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 93-17-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4) (emphasis added). The petitioners argue that Gray's wife should not have to join the petition, and the statute \"limits the rights of a married person to adopt without his/her spouse being joined as a party to the adoption.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14. Section 93-17-3(4) sets out requirements for an adoption, detailing the jurisdiction and venue for adoption proceedings and detailing the petition's requirements-such as the joinder of both spouses when married and a doctor's or nurse practitioner's certificate of the health of the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2093-17-3\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 93-17-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4). The section also governs home studies for adoptions, changing the child's name, and additional considerations for jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2093-17-3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15. Section 93-17-3 is unambiguous. The requirements are clear, and we see no reason why they should not be followed in the instant case. Simply put, Gray's spouse must join him in his petition to adopt D.D.H.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2093-17-3\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 93-17-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4). The plain language of Section 93-17-3(4) does not provide that the joinder of Gray's spouse means that she will receive any custodial or parental rights\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   or that she is adopting the child. It requires only that she join in Gray's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16. In an adoption proceeding, the best interests of the child are paramount, and the Court reviews adoptions to ensure the chancellor considered the best interests of the child.\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of D.N.T.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9145236\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/843/690/#p706\">\n    843 So.2d 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 706 (Miss. 2003) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of P.B.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11111869\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/787/1268/#p1277\">\n    787 So.2d 1268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1277 (Miss. 2001). The requirement to include the spouse on the adoption petition, even if the spouse is not the adopting party, enables the best interests of the child to be served. If the spouse is joined, the chancellor would then have the opportunity to consider and, if needed, question the spouse who regularly would be in the adopted child's life as a step-parent. Further, requiring the spouse to join provides the spouse notice of the adoption petition-as the final decree could possibly affect the spouse's rights and the inheritance rights of the spouse's children. Therefore, Section 97-13-3(4)'s requirement to include Gray's spouse in the adoption proceeding ensures that the best interests of D.D.H. are considered and should be followed in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Mississippi Code Section 93-17-13\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17. The second section before us is Section 93-17-13(2), which explains the effect of the final adoption decree. It states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (2) The final decree shall adjudicate,\n   <em>\n    in addition to such other provisions as may be found by the court to be proper for the protection of the interests of the child\n   </em>\n   ; and its effect,\n   <em>\n    unless otherwise specifically provided\n   </em>\n   , shall be that (a) the child shall inherit from and through the adopting parents and shall likewise inherit from the other children of the adopting parents to the same extent and under the same conditions as provided for the inheritance between brothers and sisters of the full blood by the laws of descent and distribution of the State of Mississippi, and that the adopting parents and their other children shall inherit from the child, just as if such child had been born to the adopting parents in lawful wedlock; (b) the child and the adopting parents and adoptive kindred are vested with all of the rights, powers, duties and obligations, respectively, as if such child had been born to the adopting parents in lawful wedlock, including all rights existing by virtue of Section 11-7-13, Mississippi Code of 1972; provided, however, that inheritance by or from the adopted child shall be governed by paragraph (a) above; (c) that the name of the child shall be changed if desired; and (d) that the natural parents and natural kindred of the child shall not inherit by or through the child except as to a natural parent who is the spouse of the adopting parent,\n   <em>\n    and all parental rights of the natural parent, or parents, shall be terminated\n   </em>\n   , except as to a natural parent who is the spouse of the adopting parent. Nothing in this chapter shall restrict the\n   right of any person to dispose of property under a last will and testament.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2093-17-13\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 93-17-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (emphasis added). The petitioners maintain that Section 93-17-13(2)\"limits the rights of a natural parent to retain his/her parental rights and allow the adoption of a child by a person that has a meaningful relationship with that child.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 18. Section 93-17-13(2) provides the general effect of the final adoption decree. Further, the first part of the statute notes the paramount concern in an adoption: the best interests of the child. It states that the final decree may contain \"provisions as may be found by the court to be proper for the protection of the interests of the child....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2093-17-13\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 93-17-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). It also states the effect of the final decree \"\n   <em>\n    unless otherwise specifically provided.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2093-17-13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Thus, Section 93-17-13(2) makes it clear that the effect of the final adoption decree can be tailored by the chancellor if found to be in the child's best interest. The Court has addressed the discretion of a chancellor to modify a final adoption decree under the language of Section 93-17-13(2), and although the cases are not completely analogous factually, they provide guidance to the instant issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 19.

Although none of the above-cited cases speaks to the issue in the instant case, the three cases provide us with some guidance.

The instant adoption is more in line with the holding in\n   <em>\n    In re P.B.H.\n   </em>\n   If determined by the chancellor to be in best interests of the child, the instant adoption would be joint and nontraditional with Gray adopting\n   <em>\n    as the father\n   </em>\n   and the natural mother retaining her rights\n   <em>\n    as the mother.\n   </em>\n   Further, as shown by\n   <em>\n    In re P.B.H.\n   </em>\n   , Section 93-17-13(2) does not prevent the adoption. In fact, Section 93-17-13(2) grants the chancellor the authority to grant the adoption by noting the importance of the best interests of the child and by providing \"unless otherwise specifically provided.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2093-17-13\">\n    Miss.

Gray has been in D.D.H.'s life since her birth, acting as a natural parent and providing support and care for her.

Under the facts of the instant case, if the chancellor-on remand-makes a finding that the adoption\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   in the best interests of D.D.H., the \"otherwise specifically stated\" language of Section 93-17-13(2) allows Gray to adopt the child and allows Dotch to keep her parental rights. Our holding is narrowly tailored to the following facts: (1) Gray has acted in loco parentis; (2) he is seeking to adopt and would be adopting as the father; (3) he is seeking to raise the child in concert with Dotch, the natural mother; (4) his spouse will be joined to the proceeding, and (5) there are no third parties to the adoption seeking to keep parental rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 29.

Thus, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 35.\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   WALLER, C.J., RANDOLPH AND KITCHENS, P.JJ., KING, COLEMAN, MAXWELL, BEAM AND ISHEE, JJ., CONCUR.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The chancellor recognized that \"the unknown natural father was served in the manner required by law and was called in open court and did not appear.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Gray's wife would merely assume the role of step-parent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The father was aware of the adoption within months of its occurrence, but contested the adoption only five years later.\n    <em>\n     Humphrey\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11840099\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/710/392/\">\n     710 So.2d at 392\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The mother had passed away.\n    <em>\n     In re P.B.H.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11111869\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/787/1268/#p1277\">\n     787 So.2d at 1270\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Also, \"[a]ny person who takes a child of another into his home and treats it as a member of his family, providing parental supervision, support and education, as if it were his own child is said to stand in loco parentis.\"\n    <em>\n     Griffith\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9182534\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/881/184/\">\n     881 So.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    186 n.1 (internal quotation omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    We also note that the biological father was properly served and failed to exercise his rights.
