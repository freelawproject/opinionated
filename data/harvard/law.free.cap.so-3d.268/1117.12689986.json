R.S. 14:64, and use of a firearm in the commission of an armed robbery, a violation of La. R.S. 14:64.3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant pled not guilty and, following a jury trial, was found guilty as charged (on both charges). For the armed robbery conviction, the defendant was sentenced to 45 years imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence; for the additional penalty of use of a firearm in the commission of the armed robbery, the defendant was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. The sentences were ordered to run consecutively. The defendant filed a motion to reconsider sentence, which was denied. The defendant now appeals, designating three assignments of error. We affirm the convictions and sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the early morning hours of December 11, 2013, Ivan Graham and Bryton Montelaro went to the house of the defendant, who was Ivan's cousin. Demarcus James and Aaron Hargrove were also at the defendant's\n   house. The men made plans to rob Jared Vincent, who sold marijuana from his apartment in Baton Rouge. Jared lived with his friend, Leonard Wyatt. Demarcus and Ivan texted Jared and set up deals to purchase marijuana. With Ivan driving a Dodge Ram truck, all five men went together to Jared's apartment. The defendant, Demarcus, and Aaron, who apparently were all armed, got out of the truck, while Ivan and Bryton stayed in the truck. A short time later, shots were fired inside Jared's apartment. Jared was killed, and Leonard was shot in the back, but survived. Demarcus had also been shot; he was dropped off that night at a hospital in Gonzales.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It appears Leonard's gun was taken from the apartment that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant did not testify at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR NOS. 1 AND 2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In these related assignments of error, the defendant argues, respectively, that the trial court erred in denying his motion to reconsider sentence and that his sentence is unconstitutionally excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 20, of the Louisiana Constitution prohibit the imposition of cruel or excessive punishment. Although a sentence falls within statutory limits, it may be excessive.\n   <strong>\n    State v. Sepulvado,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9606745\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/367/762/#p767\">\n    367 So.2d 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 767 (La. 1979). A sentence is considered constitutionally excessive if it is grossly disproportionate to the seriousness of the offense or is nothing more than a purposeless and needless infliction of pain and suffering. A sentence is considered grossly disproportionate if, when the crime and punishment are considered in light of the harm done to society, it shocks the sense of justice.\n   <strong>\n    State v. Andrews,\n   </strong>\n   94-0842 (La. App. 1 Cir. 5/5/95),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7444658\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/655/448/#p454\">\n    655 So.2d 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 454. The trial court has great discretion in imposing a sentence within the statutory limits, and such a sentence will not be set aside as excessive in the absence of a manifest abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    State v. Holts,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7574719\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/525/1241/#p1245\">\n    525 So.2d 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1245 (La. App. 1 Cir. 1988). Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure article 894.1 sets forth the factors for the trial court to consider when imposing sentence. While the entire checklist of Article 894.1 need not be recited, the record must reflect the trial court adequately considered the criteria.\n   <strong>\n    State v. Brown,\n   </strong>\n   2002-2231 (La. App. 1 Cir. 5/9/03),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108212\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/849/566/#p569\">\n    849 So.2d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 569.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The articulation of the factual basis for a sentence is the goal of Article 894.1, not rigid or mechanical compliance with its provisions. Where the record clearly shows an adequate factual basis for the sentence imposed, remand is unnecessary even where there has not been full compliance with Article 894.1.\n   <strong>\n    State v. Lanclos,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9536232\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/419/475/#p478\">\n    419 So.2d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 478 (La. 1982). The trial judge should review the defendant's personal history, his prior criminal record, the seriousness of the offense, the likelihood that he will commit another crime, and his potential for rehabilitation through correctional services other than confinement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    State v. Jones,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9589867\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/398/1049/#p1051\">\n    398 So.2d 1049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1051-52 (La. 1981). Even when a trial court assigns no reasons, the sentence will be set aside on appeal and remanded for resentencing only if the record is either inadequate or clearly indicates that the sentence is excessive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. Code Crim. P. art. 881.4(D) ;\n   <strong>\n    State v. Knight,\n   </strong>\n   2011-0366 (La. App. 1 Cir. 9/14/11),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7018714\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/77/302/#p304\">\n    77 So.3d 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304,\n   <em>\n    writ denied\n   </em>\n   , 2011-2240 (La. 2/17/12),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7017413,7017509,7017455\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/82/283/\">\n    82 So.3d 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On appellate review of a sentence, the relevant question is whether the trial court abused its broad sentencing discretion, not whether another\n   sentence might have been more appropriate.\n   <strong>\n    State v. Thomas,\n   </strong>\n   98-1144 (La. 10/9/98),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11666823\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/719/49/#p50\">\n    719 So.2d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 50 (per curiam).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   With a maximum sentencing exposure of 104 years imprisonment, the defendant was sentenced to fifty years at hard labor (45 years for the armed robbery conviction, plus 5 years to be served consecutively under the additional penalty provision of armed robbery with the use of a firearm) without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 14:64(B) and La. R.S. 14:64.3(A). The defendant argues in brief that his (cumulative) 50-year sentence is excessive because he was only 17 years old at the time of the offense, he was not the primary planner or major participant in the offense, and he will likely be confined for the remainder of his natural life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Considering the nature of the crime, and the fact that the imposed (cumulative) sentence was 54 years less than the statutorily allowed maximum sentence(s), we find no abuse of discretion by the trial court. The sentence is not apparently severe and is supported by the record. The defendant engaged in a course of criminal conduct that resulted in one victim being shot (but who survived), and another victim being shot and killed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    Knight,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7018714\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/77/302/#p304\">\n    77 So.3d at 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under these facts, it appeared the defendant could have faced a charge for second degree murder (and a second charge for attempted second degree murder). The trial court noted as much when, in sentencing the defendant, it stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   He was convicted by a jury of his peers for armed robbery; an armed robbery which he helped plan, which he participated in, and which ended up in a murder. And he could have just as easily, in my opinion, been charged with second-degree murder as he was with armed robbery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Accordingly, the 50-year (cumulative) sentence is not grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offense and, therefore, is not unconstitutionally excessive. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   These assignments of error are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 3\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In his third assignment of error, the defendant argues that a 50-year sentence without parole eligibility for a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide offense is illegal because it does not provide a meaningful opportunity for release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to the defendant, his 50-year sentence is \"effectively a life sentence\" without a meaningful opportunity for release. Thus, defendant argues, under\n   <strong>\n    Graham v. Florida,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    560 U.S. 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010), his sentence is illegal. The defendant relies on\n   <strong>\n    State ex rel. Morgan v.

According to the\n   <strong>\n    Morgan\n   </strong>\n   court, as applied to the 17-year-old defendant, a 99-year sentence without the benefit of parole was illegal because it denied the defendant a meaningful opportunity for release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.\n   <strong>\n    Morgan,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12362469\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/217/266/#p269\">\n    217 So.3d at 271-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, according to the defendant, he will have to serve the entirety of his 50-year sentence without any consideration for parole eligibility. Thus, the defendant avers, this court should vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing pursuant to the applicable parole provisions of La. R.S. 15:574.4(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <strong>\n    Graham,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    560 U.S. at 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    130 S.Ct. at 2034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Supreme Court held that the Constitution prohibits the imposition of a life without parole sentence on a juvenile\n   offender who did not commit homicide.

To conclude otherwise would be to sanction the harsher punishment of those deemed less culpable by the legislature than of those now indisputably entitled to parole-eligibility under present law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    Morgan,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12362469\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/217/266/#p269\">\n    217 So.3d at 275-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Accordingly, the\n   <strong>\n    Morgan\n   </strong>\n   court ordered the deletion of the defendant's parole ineligibility and ordered that he be designated as parole-eligible in accordance with La.

R.S. 15:574.4(D) to the defendant. Here, the defendant was sentenced to (a total of) 50 years imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of parole. We do not find that a 50-year sentence is an effective life sentence. Moreover, the defendant may be eligible for actual release after 30 to 40 years of custody (depending on \"good time\" earned and other factors).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.

R.S. 15:574.4, the legislature has specifically carved out an exception to parole eligibility consideration regarding the crime of armed robbery. Louisiana Revised Statutes 15:574.4(B)(1) provides, in pertinent part: \"No person shall be eligible for parole consideration who has been convicted of armed robbery and denied parole eligibility under the provisions of R.S. 14:64.\" Accordingly, unlike the defendant in\n   <strong>\n    Morgan,\n   </strong>\n   we do not find La. R.S. 15:574.4(D) to be applicable to the defendant herein, since the defendant's current sentence already provides, under\n   <strong>\n    Graham\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    Morgan\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    ,\n   </strong>\n   some realistic opportunity to obtain release before the end of his term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For the above and foregoing reasons, we affirm the defendant's convictions and sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    CONVICTIONS AND SENTENCES AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    There were six co-defendants, including the defendant, listed in the grand jury indictment.
