In our opinion in the instant case, we narrowly construed section 768.28(5), Florida Statutes (2010), to limit the sovereign immunity waiver to $200,000\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   when there are multiple claims arising out of the same negligent act(s) committed by the state agency. However, we acknowledge that a broader reading of the statute could allow a per injury limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because this issue may continue to arise in the context of mass shootings and other mass injury events, we certify the following question as one of great public importance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   WHEN MULTIPLE CLAIMS OF INJURY OR DEATH ARISE FROM THE SAME ACT OF NEGLIGENCE COMMITTED BY A STATE AGENCY OR ACTOR, DOES THE LIMITATION ON THE WAIVER OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY IN SECTION 768.28(5), FLORIDA STATUTES, CAP THE LIABILITY OF STATE AGENCIES AT $200,000 FOR ALL RESULTING INJURIES OR DEATHS, AS CLAIMS AND JUDGMENTS \"ARISING OUT OF THE SAME INCIDENT OR OCCURRENCE\"?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Warner, May and Forst, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    The statute was amended in 2016 to increase the cap to $300,000 for all claims or judgments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
