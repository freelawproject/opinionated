This matter is before the Court,\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   , on the amended formal complaint filed by the Mississippi Bar against Yvonne L. Hughes, a licensed Mississippi attorney. The Bar requests reciprocal discipline based on Hughes's disbarment by the Supreme Court of Louisiana on May 11, 2007, and asks that this Court order Hughes to pay the costs and expenses of filing the formal complaint and amended formal complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   \u00b6 2. On April 22, 2004, the Supreme Court of Louisiana issued a decision removing Hughes from judicial office based on the recommendation of the Judiciary Commission of Louisiana (\"Commission\").\n   <em>\n    In re Judge Yvonne L. Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    874 So.2d 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. 2004). The court's opinion related that Hughes had been a judge of the Orleans Parish Juvenile Court, Division \"C.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Commission had filed fifteen formal charges against Hughes based on her activities as an attorney and three formal charges based on her activities as a judge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 753, 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After the Commission's two-part hearing on the charges, it recommended that Hughes be removed from judicial office and that the record should be forwarded to the Lawyer Disciplinary\n   Board for consideration of whether she should retain her license to practice law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 758-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b6 3. The Supreme Court of Louisiana, which has exclusive original jurisdiction in judicial disciplinary proceedings, found that the charges filed by the Commission were substantiated by clear and convincing evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That court issued a forty-five page opinion, with an unpublished appendix, detailing its findings of Hughes's judicial misconduct and her unprofessional conduct as an attorney and judicial candidate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 746-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court found that, in Hughes's capacity as a practicing attorney, she repeatedly had taken money from clients and had failed to perform the services for which she had been retained, and then she refused to refund the fees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Out of the nine charges involving Hughes's failure to account to former clients and/or to refund unearned fees, the court singled out several incidents for discussion as particularly representative of Hughes's misconduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 775 n.16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 5.

But when Hughes failed to appear at Jones's guilty plea hearing, Jones was forced to hire his codefendant's attorney to represent him, despite the fact that he believed this created a conflict of interest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In her defense, Hughes claimed that she had taken part in plea negotiations and had arranged for the codefendant's counsel to represent Jones at the guilty plea hearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Not only did Jones deny any knowledge of that arrangement, but the assistant district attorneys involved with the plea bargain had no recollection of Hughes's involvement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Hughes did not refund the unearned fees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 6. In another matter, Troy Dews paid Hughes a $2,500 retainer to represent his nephew on criminal charges in federal district court in Mississippi.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Hughes agreed she would investigate the charges and visit the nephew, who was incarcerated in Jackson, Mississippi. Hughes neither made an appearance at the arraignment nor requested a continuance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Hughes did travel to Jackson, but never visited the nephew; instead, she attended a gospel concert and visited an ill friend.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Having discerned that Hughes had done nothing in the case, Dews spent six weeks begging for a refund, after which Hughes sent him a partial refund check that was returned twice for insufficient funds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At the hearing, Hughes conceded that she probably owed Dews money and that she never had given him an accounting.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Hughes explained she had not repaid Dews because doing so would not have stopped the disciplinary proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court described Hughes's excuse as \"especially disturbing\" and found that her misconduct had brought Louisiana's attorneys and judiciary into disrepute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 7. In another Louisiana incident, twenty-one days prior to assuming office as a juvenile court judge, Hughes accepted representation of Dorian Ferguson in a criminal matter pending in Jefferson Parish.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ferguson's family paid Hughes $700 toward the representation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Hughes appeared as counsel of record; but after she assumed judicial office, she abandoned the representation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When Ferguson contacted Hughes after she had failed to appear at a motions hearing, she said she had referred the matter to another\n   law firm that had agreed to handle the case for the same total fee Hughes had negotiated, $1500.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But when the family contacted the law firm, it demanded $3500. And Hughes refused to refund the $700 she had received from Ferguson's family.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 783-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 8. Next, the court addressed Hughes's misconduct regarding her acceptance of a $1500 retainer to represent Lana Turner's son on a second degree murder charge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Hughes spent $500 of the retainer on an investigator; but when she assumed judicial office, she abandoned the representation without informing the client or his mother.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Without obtaining permission from the Turners, she arranged for another attorney to take over the case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When Lana Turner demanded a refund, Hughes refused to refund any portion of the fee.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 9. The Supreme Court of Louisiana found that these and numerous similar charges involving Hughes's refusal to refund unearned fees or to account to clients had been established by clear and convincing evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 775 n.16. Its description of the other similar charges was contained in an unpublished appendix.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court found many other instances of attorney misconduct, including that Hughes had failed to maintain a client's files and turn them over to a new attorney, which had jeopardized the case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The supreme court found that, in connection with that matter, she had ignored a subpoena to appear in court, which the supreme court deemed \"egregious, absolutely unacceptable, and totally intolerable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, the court determined that Hughes had held herself out as a notary public after her notarial commission had been suspended.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 777-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court further found that, as a judicial candidate, Hughes had committed repeated, egregious campaign finance reporting violations resulting in the assessment of fines and fees in the amount of $49,400.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 775-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 10. After reviewing the voluminous evidence of Hughes's attorney misconduct, the Louisiana court said the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The evidence clearly and convincingly establishes that as an attorney, Judge Hughes time and time again took money from people who could ill afford to pay it, did minimal or no work to earn it, and then refused to refund monies she clearly had not earned. Preying upon her clients' lack of education and lack of sophistication in legal matters, Judge Hughes either ignored or cavalierly dismissed complaints that she had failed to perform the services for which she was retained, explaining that her work was all done behind the scenes and that her fees were all earned. However, she failed to produce any records that might substantiate her claims and failed to account to her clients for their hard-earned dollars.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Such conduct is inexcusable. Judge Hughes' documented failure to account to her clients, to return unearned fees even after acknowledging that refunds were owed, to appreciate the significance of holding herself out as a notary when she holds no notary commission, and to abide by the basic rules of law that govern all citizens, not just lawyers and judges (such as campaign finance laws and valid subpoenas) is persistent and public conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that warrants discipline. We find the Lawyer Charges were proved by clear and convincing evidence and establish a pattern of misconduct relevant to our determination of the ultimate sanction to be imposed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 11. Examining her actions in her capacity as a juvenile court judge, the Supreme Court of Louisiana found that\n   Hughes had abused her parole authority by releasing at least nine hundred adult arrestees from jail in a two-year period.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, the court found that Hughes had associated with convicted felons and had allowed several such persons actually to work at the court although they were not court employees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, Hughes had permitted several convicted criminals, not employed by the court, to use the court's computers to type judgments; she also gave them access to confidential juvenile records.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court found that Hughes had created a vast backlog in her preparation of judgments, causing unnecessary delays and even dismissals, and that she had failed to hold court at regular hours, which negatively had impacted parties, witnesses, and attorneys.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241888\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/874/746/\">\n    at 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because of Hughes's repeated wilful misconduct relating to her judicial duties that brought her judicial office into disrepute, conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, pattern of administrative incompetence, failure to respect and abide by the rule of law, and persistent pattern of conduct violating the Code of Judicial Conduct and the Louisiana Constitution, the supreme court removed her from judicial office, reserving to the disciplinary board the right to institute lawyer disciplinary proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 788-90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 13.

Hughes failed to appear.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based on its review of the evidence, the hearing committee recommended that Hughes be disbarred permanently and, upon review, the disciplinary board agreed.

Hughes is a licensed attorney in Mississippi and is subject to the disciplinary jurisdiction of this Court.

In imposing the sanction of permanent disbarment upon Hughes, the Supreme Court of Louisiana explicitly or implicitly considered all nine criteria utilized by this Court to determine an appropriate sanction for attorney misconduct. Hughes did not respond to the Mississippi Bar's motion for reciprocal discipline, and thus she has presented no mitigating factors for our consideration. No extraordinary circumstances compel, justify, or support variance from the sanction of disbarment imposed by the Supreme Court of Louisiana. Rather, the facts ascertained by the Supreme Court of Louisiana and the discipline imposed by that court after careful consideration of Hughes's conduct under the Rules of Professional Conduct fully support this Court's imposition of the\n   sanction of disbarment. Therefore, based on the record before us, the Mississippi Rules of Discipline, and our case law, this Court finds that Yvonne L. Hughes shall be disbarred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 19.
