The information alleged that each of these offenses occurred on October 10, 2013. After trial, the appellant timely appealed his convictions and raised three issues on appeal. We affirm the first two issues without further comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In his third issue, the appellant argued that two of his convictions violated his constitutional right against double jeopardy. Specifically, he argued that use of computer services to solicit a minor (Count IV) was subsumed by traveling to meet a minor (Count I) and that unlawful use of a two-way communications device (Count II) was subsumed by the other three counts. We affirmed these convictions under our decision in\n   <em>\n    Lee v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12365763\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/223/342/\">\n    223 So.3d 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 1st DCA 2017). In 2018, the Supreme Court quashed our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   and held that a reviewing court should only consider the charging document to determine whether multiple convictions for solicitation, unlawful use of a two-way communications device, and traveling were based upon the same conduct for purposes of double jeopardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Lee v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12682736\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/258/1297/\">\n    258 So.3d 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 2018) (\n   <em>\n    Lee II\n   </em>\n   ). Applying\n   <em>\n    Lee II\n   </em>\n   to this case, the appellant's convictions in Counts II and IV are VACATED . The appellant's convictions in Counts I and III are AFFIRMED .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Roberts, Ray, and Kelsey, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
