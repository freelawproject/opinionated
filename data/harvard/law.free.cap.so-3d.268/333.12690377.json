The Relator, The Howard Hughes Corporation (\"Howard Hughes\"), filed an application for supervisory writ, seeking review of the trial court's judgment denying its motion for summary judgment. In accordance with the requirements of La. C.C.P. art. 966(H),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   we ordered additional briefing by the parties and heard oral arguments. For the reasons that follow, we grant Howard Hughes' writ application, reverse the trial court's ruling denying its summary judgment motion, and render summary judgment dismissing Ms. Maddox's claims against it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 29, 2014, at about 10:45 p.m., Ms. Maddox slipped and fell while walking down a non-moving escalator at the Riverwalk Shopping Center (the \"Riverwalk\") in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Maddox went to the Riverwalk that night to deliver a set of keys to her daughter, who was working as the manager of one of the restaurants in the food court. To get to the restaurant, which was located on an upper level of the Riverwalk, Ms. Maddox took an elevator. While at the restaurant, Ms. Maddox helped her daughter take out the garbage to a back hallway where the restaurants in the food court place their garbage and grease traps. After taking out\n   the garbage, Ms. Maddox attempted to exit the Riverwalk using the same route by which she had entered. Although the mall closed at 9:00 p.m., other patrons were still present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As Ms. Maddox was leaving, she observed that cleaning machines, which the cleaning company was using, had deposited water on the floor. After discovering that the elevator was turned off, Ms. Maddox walked through the water to the escalator, which likewise was turned off. Nonetheless, she decided to walk down the non-moving escalator, using it as a flight of stairs. When she stepped on the third step, Ms. Maddox's leg went out from under her and she fell, sustaining personal injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Seeking to recover for her personal injuries, Ms. Maddox commenced this suit against, among others, Howard Hughes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Howard Hughes was sued in its capacity as the owner and operator of the Riverwalk and, by extension, its escalator. In her petition, Ms. Maddox alleged that Howard Hughes' is liable to her for its negligence as a \"merchant\" under La. R.S. 2800.6 and as the owner of the premises and, by extension, the escalator under La. C.C. art. 2317.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Ms. Maddox alleges that Howard Hughes may be held liable under the theory of\n   <em>\n    res ipsa loqitur.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After taking Ms. Maddox's deposition, Howard Hughes filed a motion for summary judgment. Following a hearing, the trial court denied the motion. In its oral reasons for judgment, the trial court observed as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [T]here are issues on both sides whether or not the turning off of that escalator and the subsequent fall of the lady was contributed to in some manner by which there was no posting of a sign of warning or that the escalator was wet in some fashion. And whether or not these matters contributed to her incident is something that the trier of fact should determine. We do not make a determination on the merits of the case here, nor do we make a determination as to whether or not the escalator was unreasonably dangerous. The trier of fact is going to have to determine whether ... there was some negligence on the part of the owner of this property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This writ application followed. As noted at the outset, we granted Howard Hughes' writ to address whether the trial court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment. For the reasons that follow, we answer that question in the affirmative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Summary Judgment Principles\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The summary judgment procedure is used when there is no genuine issue of material fact for all or part of the relief prayed for by a litigant. La. C.C.P. art. 966(A)(3) (observing that \"[a] motion for summary judgment is \"a procedural vehicle for dismissing issues of law and/or fact that are not in dispute\"). \"A defendant can successfully move for summary judgment if he or she can demonstrate beyond peradventure the nonexistence of a fact essential to the plaintiff's cause of action.\" Frank L. Maraist, 1 LA. CIV. L. TREATISE , CIVIL PROCEDURE \u00a7 6:8 (2d ed. 2018). The summary judgment procedure is \"designed to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action,\" and the summary judgment procedure is favored. La. C.C.P. art. 966(A)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Appellate courts review the grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , employing the same criteria that govern the trial court's determination of whether summary judgment is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Garces-Rodriguez v.

The standard for granting a motion for summary judgment is set forth in La. C.C.P. art. 966(A)(3), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   After an opportunity for adequate discovery, a motion for summary judgment shall be granted if the motion, memorandum, and supporting documents show that there is no genuine issue as to material fact and that the mover is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A shifting burden of proof is set forth in La. C.C.P. art. 966(D)(1), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The burden of proof rests with the mover. Nevertheless, if the mover will not bear the burden of proof at trial on the issue that is before the court on the motion for summary judgment, the mover's burden on the motion does not require him to negate all essential elements of the adverse party's claim, action, or defense, but rather to point out to the court the absence of factual support for one or more elements essential to the adverse party's claim, action, or defense. The burden is on the adverse party to produce factual support sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact or that the mover is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A genuine issue is one as to which reasonable persons could disagree; if reasonable persons could reach only one conclusion, there is no need for trial on that issue, and summary judgment is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

The existence of a defect may not be inferred solely from the fact that an accident occurred; rather, a plaintiff is required to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, the existence of a defect and that the defect caused the plaintiff's damages.\n   <em>\n    King v.

When asked whether she knew what caused her to fall, she replied no. When asked whether she saw anything on the escalator which would have caused her to fall, she replied no. When asked whether the escalator steps were slippery, she replied \"I can't tell you that one. I don't know.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We find that Howard Hughes met its initial burden of establishing that Ms. Maddox will not be able to meet her burden of proving an essential element of her claim-the existence of a defect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As provided for in La. C.C.P. art. 966(C)(2), the burden shifted to Ms. Maddox to set forth specific facts to show a genuine issue of material fact for trial. We find that she failed to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As Howard Hughes points out, outside of the escalator being turned off-non-moving-Ms. Maddox has alleged no other defect in the escalator that could have caused her to fall. Howard Hughes argued before the trial court that to accept Ms. Maddox's argument that all escalators that are turned off are unreasonably dangerous would lead to absurd consequences. Indeed, the gist of Ms. Maddox's argument is that a non-moving escalator is inherently defective. We find this argument unpersuasive and insufficient to withstand summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Ms. Maddox provides no factual support, expert testimony, statute, or case law supporting her allegation that a non-moving escalator poses a great risk of harm to an individual attempting to utilize it than would a set of stairs. She simply alleges that Howard Hughes should have known, and that it was reasonably foreseeable, that a patron might attempt to use a shut down escalator as stairs if the escalator was not blocked off and no warning sign was posted. She further alleges that Howard Hughes should have known that the use of a shutdown escalator would pose a great risk of harm to a patron attempting to walk down it. She also speculates that \"[t]he treads of the escalator not being the same as stair treads it is unreasonably dangerous to allow the escalator to be used in this manner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"[A]llegations [that a non-moving escalator is more dangerous than stairs], inferences [that since her feet were dry and it was the nearest exit to her vehicle, the escalator was the cause of her fall], and speculations [that the escalator treads were not the same as stair treads] are not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Indeed, Ms. Maddox argues that any danger posed to her by the wet and soapy floor had been removed by the rug she walked over before getting on the escalator.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    In her opposition to the summary judgment motion and to the instant writ application, Ms. Maddox characterizes the non-moving escalator as \"the simplest means of Plaintiff exiting to her vehicle.\" Inconsistently, she argues that \"there was no alternative route available to her\" other than the non-moving escalator. In her deposition, however, Ms. Maddox acknowledged that the reason she did not go back into the Riverwalk and take the traditional way out using steps was because her \"car was right down there at the bottom of the escalators.\" The record thus reflects that Ms. Maddox decided not to reenter the Riverwalk to go down the regular steps because her car was parked near the bottom of the escalator and that she had other exits available.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Because Ms. Maddox cannot establish a defect, she likewise cannot establish another element of her claim-cause-in-fact.
