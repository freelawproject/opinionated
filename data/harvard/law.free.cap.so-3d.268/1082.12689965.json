(\"Superior\") and Shelf Energy, L.L.C. (\"Shelf\"), dismissing Plaintiff's claims against the two defendants with prejudice. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 22, 2015, Plaintiff was allegedly injured when a metal oil tank he was cutting up for scrap struck him. At the time of the accident, Plaintiff was on the property of Lotaire Duhon (\"Duhon\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in Vermilion Parish, Louisiana. When the accident occurred, the Duhon property was subject to an oil and gas lease wherein Duhon granted certain mineral rights to Shelf. After the wells were no longer producing in paying quantities, Shelf plugged them and began to restore and clean the well site pursuant to the terms of its mineral lease contract with Duhon. In furtherance of its contractual obligations, Shelf contacted Rodney Quibodeaux (\"Quibodeaux\"), the co-owner of Superior, to perform the clean up operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   One aspect of the clean-up involved the removal of four large storage tanks that had been used during production. Quibodeaux then contacted Earl Doucet (\"Doucet\") to look at the tanks and determine if he would be interested in removing them for scrap. Doucet, who was ill, brought Plaintiff, his cousin, to the job site; after examining the tanks, Plaintiff agreed to remove the tanks from service, put them on a trailer, haul them, and sell the metal for scrap. As Plaintiff was using a cutting torch to sever one of the storage tanks, the tank rolled over the chocks that had been placed to secure it and injured him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff filed a petition for damages against Superior and Shelf,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   contending he suffered personal injury damages while he was performing storage tank demolition and scrap metal services on the Duhon property. After answers were filed to Plaintiff's petition and various depositions were taken, Superior and Shelf each filed motions for summary judgment, on April 5, 2018, and April 11, 2018, respectively,\n   seeking dismissal of Plaintiff's claims; both motions were scheduled for hearing on May 29, 2018. Plaintiff filed his opposition to the motions for summary judgment on May 16, 2018, thirteen days before the hearing date. Superior and Shelf filed a joint motion to strike Plaintiff's opposition for failure to comply with the fifteen-day mandatory deadline provided in La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(B)(2) and La.Dist.Ct.R. 9.9 of the Uniform Rules of the District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Initially, the trial court denied Superior's and Shelf's motion to strike. After hearing argument, the trial court granted Superior's and Shelf's motions for summary judgment and dismissed Plaintiff's claims against those defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff filed this appeal, contending the trial court erred when it granted Superior's and Shelf's motions for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Articles 966 and 967 govern motions for summary judgment.

The most recent amendment to Article 966(B) altered the deadlines for filing motions for summary judgment and oppositions thereto. 2015 La. Acts No. 422, \u00a7 1. Paragraph (B) now provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Unless extended by the court and agreed to by all of the parties, a motion for summary judgment shall be filed, opposed, or replied to in accordance with the following provisions:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (1) A motion for summary judgment and all documents in support of the motion shall be filed and served on all parties in accordance with Article 1313 not less than sixty-five days prior to the trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (2) Any opposition to the motion and all documents in support of the opposition shall be filed and served in accordance with Article 1313 not less than fifteen days prior to the hearing on the motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (3) Any reply memorandum shall be filed and served in accordance with Article 1313 not less than five days prior to the hearing on the motion.

Summary judgment is governed by La.Code Civ.P. arts. 966 and 967. Article 966 provides that while the burden of proving entitlement to summary judgment rests with the mover, if the mover will not bear the burden of proof at trial on the matter that is before the court on the motion for summary judgment, the mover's burden does not require him to negate all essential elements of the adverse party's claim, action or defense, but rather to point out that there is an absence of factual support for one or more elements essential to the adverse party's claim, action or defense. Thereafter, if the adverse party fails to produce factual support sufficient to establish that he will be able to satisfy his evidentiary burden of proof at trial, there is no genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    Hardy v.

The record clearly reflects Plaintiff's opposition was mailed to the trial court and served on the parties just thirteen days before the scheduled hearing on the motions for summary judgment, far short of the fifteen days provided in La.Code Civ.P. art 966(B)(2). Although, under La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(B), the trial court could have extended the deadline with the agreement of the parties, this condition was not met because Superior and Shelf objected to Plaintiff's late-filed memorandum. As an appellate court who reviews summary judgment matters de novo, we find Plaintiff's opposition untimely. As such, we consider Superior's and Shelf's motions for summary judgment unopposed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After reviewing the memoranda and attachments de novo, we find the trial court properly granted summary judgment in this matter.

As to the two exceptions to the general rule, the motions for summary in the present case showed there was no ultrahazardous work involved and Shelf retained no control or supervision of Plaintiff's work. Likewise, the undisputed facts show Superior neither exercised control over Plaintiff's work nor provided authorization for the work practices Plaintiff chose to utilize in his clean up operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Although there is not a per se rule holding that a repairman may never recover while he is repairing the thing he has been hired to remove,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celestine v.

In the present case, the undisputed evidence shows: Plaintiff had performed similar tasks prior to this accident; he previewed the work site and saw nothing to indicate that cutting the tanks would be unsafe; he admitted he thought he had all the equipment needed to perform the job and placed chocks on the tank to prevent the tank from rolling; he and his cousin felt he was qualified to do the work; and he was familiar with the condition of the tank before he commenced demolition. Moreover, the evidence shows that the tank collapsed when Plaintiff cut the tank with a welding torch, a method he chose to purposefully collapse the tank. Supported by well-established jurisprudence, we find the trial court properly dismissed Shelf and Superior on their motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    DISPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.

For purposes of this opinion, we will simply refer to Duhon as the owner of the property.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    As noted above, Plaintiff also named Duhon as a defendant.

Plaintiff has not designated assignments of error for us to consider. Rather, Plaintiff argues in brief that because of the language of the contract between Shelf and Duhon, he was a third-party beneficiary of that contract. With this as a legal basis, Plaintiff contends numerous genuine issues of material fact existed which would have made summary judgment improper.
