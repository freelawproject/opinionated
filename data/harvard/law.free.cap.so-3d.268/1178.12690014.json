Further, defendant has filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   supplemental brief arguing the ineffectiveness of his trial counsel resulting in his being forced to plead guilty. For the following reasons, we affirm defendant's convictions and sentences, and remand the matter for correction of the Uniform Commitment Orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual Background and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this case, defendant's convictions resulted from guilty pleas so the facts surrounding the offenses were gleaned from the bill of information. Here, the record reflects that, on or about July 19, 2017, defendant knowingly or intentionally possessed heroin with the intent to distribute in violation of La. R.S. 40:966(A), and\n   knowingly or intentionally possessed fentanyl with the intent to distribute in violation of La. R.S. 40:967(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 29, 2017, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney filed a bill of information charging defendant, Terry England, with one count of possession with intent to distribute heroin in violation of La. R.S. 40:966(A) (count 1), and one count of possession with the intent to distribute fentanyl in violation of La. R.S. 40:967(A) (count 2). At his arraignment held on September 1, 2017, defendant pled not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Omnibus motions, which included motions to suppress evidence and a confession, were filed by defendant. The trial court heard and denied the motions to suppress on November 9, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 5, 2017, defendant withdrew his not guilty pleas and, after executing a waiver of constitutional rights form, which was signed by defendant, defense counsel, and the trial judge, entered pleas of guilty as charged on both counts. After the trial court accepted the pleas, defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement. Specifically, the trial court sentenced defendant to fifteen years imprisonment at hard labor on count 1, with the first ten years to be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. As to count 2, defendant was sentenced to ten years imprisonment at hard labor. The trial court also ordered the sentences to run concurrently with each other with defendant receiving credit for time served. The trial court assessed fees for defendant to pay to the Indigent Defender Board, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, and the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office crime lab. Additionally, the trial court recommended defendant for participation in any and all self-help programs available to him during his incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 3, 2018, defendant filed an application for post-conviction relief, asserting ineffective assistance of his trial counsel. On May 7, 2018, the trial court dismissed defendant's application without prejudice and granted him an out-of-time appeal. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Law and Argument\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, defendant assigns one counseled assignment of error and one\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   assignment of error. In his counseled assignment of error, defendant argues the trial court erred in accepting his guilty pleas without further inquiry after he professed his innocence during the plea colloquy. Additionally, defendant argues the record does not demonstrate that his guilty pleas were knowingly and voluntary entered based on assertions he made \"in his application for post-conviction relief and in subsequent correspondence that his guilty plea was not a voluntary one.\" Defendant contends the trial court should have inquired further into the voluntariness of his pleas and, at the very least, asked defendant whether his \"decision to plead guilty was in recognition that it was in his best interest to do so considering the evidence against him\" in accordance with\n   <em>\n    North Carolina v. Alford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n    400 U.S. 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n    27 L.Ed.2d 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant does not move to have\n   this Court set aside his guilty pleas; instead, defendant requests that the matter be remanded for \"further inquiry.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The State argues that although defendant initially denied possession of the narcotics during the plea colloquy, defendant subsequently acknowledged his guilt and voluntarily continued with the guilty plea proceeding. Moreover, the State argues that since defendant acknowledged to the court that he had, in fact, committed the crimes to which he was pleading guilty, there was no need for the trial court to inquire further as to the voluntariness of defendant's guilty pleas. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under both state and federal jurisprudence, it is well settled that an unqualified plea of guilty waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings leading up to the guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, this waiver must be on the record, and the record must unequivocally show that the defendant's waiver was free and voluntary.\n   <em>\n    State v. Ursin\n   </em>\n   , 98-435 (La.

A guilty plea is constitutionally infirm if it is not entered freely and voluntarily, if the\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   colloquy is inadequate, or when a defendant is induced to enter the plea by a plea bargain or what he justifiably believes was a plea bargain and that bargain is not kept.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Trial counsel further advised that he had reviewed the waiver of rights form with defendant, and that defendant had initialed and signed the form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On the waiver of rights form and during the colloquy with the trial judge, defendant\n   was advised of his right to a jury trial, his right to confrontation, and his privilege against self-incrimination. Defendant signed the waiver of rights form, indicating that he understood he was waiving these rights by pleading guilty. During the colloquy with the trial judge, defendant also indicated that he understood that he was waiving these rights. Defendant advised that he was forty-five years old and had completed the tenth grade in school. Further, defendant expressed his understanding that he was pleading guilty to possession with intent to distribute heroin and to possession with intent to distribute fentanyl, and he was advised of the statutory definitions of those offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following a discussion during the colloquy regarding the minimum and maximum penalties for the charged offenses, defendant was asked by the trial judge to explain what occurred on July 19, 2017 that was causing him to plead guilty to possession with intent to distribute heroin and possession with intent to distribute fentanyl. At this juncture, defendant claimed that a \"certain person ... hid some stuff in [his] truck ...\" and attested that he \"didn't have these drugs.\" In response to these assertions, the trial judge stated that if \"[defendant] can't admit to a factual basis ...,\" she could not accept his guilty pleas and the matter would proceed to trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   BY THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Q.

Following a brief interruption in the proceedings, defendant and his counsel returned to the courtroom at which time the following exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   MR. REGAN:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Your Honor, I'm back here in the Court's presence with Mr. Terry England. I've had a chance to answer some additional questions from Mr. England at this point and the defendant wishes to plead guilty, take responsibility for the drugs that were in the car and take responsibility for the fact that he confessed to it on video tape when he was taken down to Maple Street, and would like the Court please [sic] to take his guilty plea pursuant to the plea agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   BY THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Q.

As to Count 2, you would be sentenced to ten years in the Department of Corrections.

The record reflects that defendant acknowledged reviewing the waiver of rights form with his attorney. The record also shows that defendant was aware he was charged with and pleading guilty to two drug charges. Further, in the waiver of rights form and by the trial judge during the colloquy, defendant was advised of his right to a jury trial, right to confrontation, and his privilege against self-incrimination as required by\n   <em>\n    Boykin v. Alabama,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1771759\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/238/\">\n     supra.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant signed the waiver of rights form, indicating that he understood that he was waiving these rights by pleading guilty. During the colloquy with the trial judge, defendant also indicated that he understood those rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   During his guilty plea colloquy and in his waiver of rights form, defendant indicated that he had not been forced, coerced, or threatened into entering into guilty pleas. Defendant was informed during the colloquy of the minimum and maximum sentences and of the sentences that would be imposed on each count if his guilty pleas were accepted. After the lengthy colloquy with defendant, the trial court accepted his guilty pleas as knowingly, intelligently, freely, and voluntarily made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Our review of the record, particularly the transcript of the guilty plea colloquy as set forth in full above, convinces us that, despite defendant's initial reservations to pleading guilty to the charged offenses, based upon his responses to further questioning by the trial court and without referencing his prior profession of innocence, defendant acknowledged that he did, in fact, commit the offenses for which he was charged. Further, we find that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered unqualified guilty pleas-nowhere in the transcript is it specified that defendant was making a qualified plea under\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   . Consequently, no further inquiry by the trial court was necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   We find no error in the trial court's acceptance of defendant's guilty pleas that would warrant remand for further inquiry into defendant's voluntariness in entering those pleas. This assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Pro Se Assignment of Error\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   assignment of error, defendant contends his counsel was ineffective for failing to call a key witness to testify at the suppression hearing and for failing to present exculpatory evidence to the court, which testimony and evidence would have shown that someone other than defendant was responsible for placing the drugs in defendant's vehicle without defendant's knowledge. Defendant argues that his counsel's ineffectiveness prejudiced defendant's defense and forced defendant to plead guilty to a crime he did not commit in order to avoid the risk of an unfair trial. Specifically, defendant claims that because of his counsel's failure to call the key witness to testify, for his advising the key witness to leave court on the day of the suppression hearing, and for his failure to present the alleged exculpatory evidence (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , an affidavit and deposition by the key witness), he feared that he was being \"rail-roaded\" by his counsel's incompetence and, thus, he pled guilty in order to avoid facing sixty years imprisonment. Additionally, defendant avers that despite his professed innocence, the trial court nonetheless accepted his guilty pleas. For these reasons, defendant seeks to have his convictions set aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 13 of the Louisiana Constitution safeguard a defendant's right to effective assistance of counsel.

On the date of the offense, July 19, 2017, La. R.S. 40:966(B)(4)(a) provided that first offense with intent to distribute heroin was punishable by a term of imprisonment at hard labor for not less than ten nor more than fifty years, at least ten years of which should be served without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence, and may, in addition, be required to pay a fine of not more than fifty thousand dollars.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, at the time of the committed offense, the applicable statute only provided for a restriction of probation and suspension of sentence for at least ten years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In cases in which a sentencing error by the trial court does not involve the omission of a restrictive term specified by the legislature as part of the sentence, but the imposition of limits beyond what the legislature has authorized in the sentencing statute, this Court will correct the sentence on its own authority under La.

Accordingly, we amend defendant's sentence on count 1 to delete the prohibition of parole eligibility and remand the matter for the trial court to correct the Uniform Commitment Order (\"UCO\") to reflect that defendant's sentence has no restriction on the benefit of parole. Further, we direct the Clerk of Court for the 24th Judicial District Court to transmit the corrected UCO to the appropriate authorities and the Department of Corrections' (\"DOC\") legal department.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
