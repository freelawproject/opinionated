See <em>Black </em>v. <em>Bd. of Revision </em>(1985), 16 Ohio St. 3d 11, 16 OBR 363, 475 N.E. 2d 1264. The provisions of R.C. 5717.05 require the common pleas court to consider the administrative record from the board of revision. They permit the court to consider additional evidence in its discretion, but do not require it to do so. <em>Black, supra, </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">The appellate court cited, and the auditor and the school boards rely on, the following language in the <em>Black </em>opinion at 14, 16 OBR at 365-366, 475 N.E. 2d at 1268:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-10\">\u201c* * * In effect, R.C. 5717.05 contemplates a <em>decision de novo. </em>It does not, however, provide for an original action or trial <em>de novo.* </em>* *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">That language simply means that the common pleas court should make its own independent decision but is not required to conduct an independent proceeding. It should reach its decision without any deference to the administrative finding. However, it should consider the administrative record, giving that record whatever weight the court deems appropriate, even if the court accepts additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">In this case, the trial court fully satisfied its obligations by causing its referee to consider the administrative record together with additional evidence. While the court and the parties may have termed the proceedings a trial <em>de novo, </em>the court actually accomplished an appellate function. The court did not begin the evidentiary process anew. It did not disregard administrative hearing evidence. Instead, it exercised its discretion most judiciously by permitting the parties to supplement the administrative record with additional evidence which could assist the valuation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-13\">The auditor and the school boards also argue that the court should have precluded the owner from presenting additional evidence. They contend that the owner did not show good cause for his failure to provide that information to the board of revision. However, the record does not indicate whether the owner had that information \u201cwithin his knowledge or possession\u201d at the time of the board\u2019s hearing. Hence, the court had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>reason to apply the preclusion rule in R.C. 5715.19(G), which applies when a claimant withholds information at the board\u2019s hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">Additionally, neither the auditor nor the school boards objected when the owner called its two witnesses at the referee\u2019s hearing. See Evid. R. 103(A)(1). They had adequate opportunity to discover that prospective evidence before the hearing, and demonstrated their readiness to respond with their own contrary expert evidence. Consequently, they cannot now claim that they were unfairly prejudiced by that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Having concluded that the trial court\u2019s action was procedurally proper, we consider the auditor\u2019s and school boards\u2019 complaints about the trial court\u2019s decisions. R.C. 5713.01 requires the auditor to determine the true value in money of \u201c* * * each lot or parcel of real estate * * *.\u201d The auditor and the school boards argue that these realty terms refer to permanent parcels defined on the auditor\u2019s records with separate parcel numbers. Consequently, they contend that the auditor, the board of revision and the courts must value each of those numbered parcels separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Their argument ignores the fact that the real property tax law uses the terms \u201ctract,\u201d \u201clot,\u201d and \u201cparcel\u201d interchangeably. For example, R.C. 5713.02 instructs the assessor to prepare a description of \u201ceach tract and lot of real property.\u201d R.C. 5713.03 directs the auditor to determine the true value of \u201ceach separate tract, lot, or parcel of real property.\u201d R.C. 5713.04 calls for a valuation of \u201c[e]ach separate parcel.\u201d It further provides that the tax-exempt part of a \u201cseparate parcel\u201d should be split away and listed as a separate entity. R.C. 5713.18 directs the auditor to replace the valuation for a subdivided \u201clot or tract of land\u201d with values for each resulting \u201clot or parcel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Numbered permanent parcels facilitate conveyancing and may serve other valuable purposes. However, there is no valid reason why their relatively arbitrary boundaries must always limit valuation practices for real property taxes. The true value for real property may well depend on its potential use as an economic unit. That unit may include multiple parcels, or it may be part of a larger parcel, on the auditor\u2019s records. The boundaries of that unit may change with time and circumstances. Thus, a separate tract for valuation purposes need not correspond with a numbered parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">This court has previously approved aggregate valuations for economic land units which contain multiple permanent parcels. <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. </em>v. <em>Fountain Square Assoc., Ltd. </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St. 3d 218, 9 OBR 528, 459 N.E. 2d 894; <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. </em>v. <em>Bd. of Revision </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St. 2d 398, 20 O.O.3d 349, 422 N.E. 2d 846. So have appellate courts. <em>Parsler </em>v. <em>Bd. of Revision </em>(Mar. 15, 1984), Franklin App. Nos. 83AP-126 &amp; 83AP-127, unreported; <em>Trebmal Constr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1986), 29 Ohio App. 3d 312, 29 OBR 411, 505 N.E. 2d 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>For tax valuation purposes, property with a single owner, for which the highest and best use is a single unit, constitutes a tract, lot, or parcel. Procedurally, a single complaint can challenge tax valuations for multiple parcels \u201cin actual physical contact with each other and with identical ownership and located in the same taxing district * * *.\u201d See D.T.E. Form No. 1; cf. Ohio Adm. Code 5717-1-09(B)(3). In that situation, the Department of Taxation exercises its authority under R.C. 5703.16 by permitting the complainant to state aggregate amounts for the current valuation, the complainant\u2019s valuation, and the proposed increase or decrease. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The decision whether the property serves its highest and best use as a single unit or as multiple units is generally a factual issue. Like other factual valuation questions, the answer to this issue rests within the sound discretion of the common pleas court that reviews the decision of the board of revision. <em>Black </em>v. <em>Bd. of Revision, supra, </em>at 14, 16 OBR at 365-366, 475 N.E. 2d at 1268; <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. </em>v. <em>Bd. of Revision, supra, </em>at 401-403, 22 O.O.3d at 351-353, 422 N.E. 2d at 848-849. An appellate court should not disturb the trial court\u2019s decision on those matters, unless the trial court abuses that discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">In this case, the trial court accepted its referee\u2019s finding that the highest and best use for each of the two apartment complexes was as a single unit. It also accepted its referee\u2019s valuations for each of those complexes, which the taxpayer\u2019s expert supported and the appellees\u2019 experts contested. Adequate evidence supported those factual findings, so we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Finally, the auditor and the school boards urge that the trial court erred by failing to apportion its total valuations among the individual parcels. Here again, they presume that the tax law requires ultimate valuations for tracts identified by an auditor\u2019s parcel number. When the tract contains property within more than one taxing district, the auditor must determine the value within each district. Cf. <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. </em>v. <em>Bd. of Revision, supra, </em>at 405, 20 O.O. 3d at 354, 422 N.E. 2d at 851. Otherwise, the auditor can assess property taxes for tracts which include more than one numbered parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">These two apartment complexes are each within single taxing districts, so the trial court\u2019s judgment was proper without apportioning its valuations among individually numbered parcels. The trial court did not abuse its discretion. We reverse the appellate court\u2019s decision and reinstate the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b42-10\">Sweeney, Acting C.J., Milligan, Cook, Douglas, Wright and H.
