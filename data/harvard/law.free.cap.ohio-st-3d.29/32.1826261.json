Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AfE\">The central issue raised is whether the requirement under R.C. 3321.04(A)(2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that parents must seek the approval of the school board superintendent for their home education program in order to obtain an excuse from the compulsory education laws, infringes upon the religious freedom of appellants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Appellants acknowledge, as they must, that the state has a compelling interest in the education of its citizens.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, appellants argue that R.C. 3321.04(A)(2) violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellants claim an impermissible infringement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>their religious beliefs because the approval requirement is not the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d that Ohio could have employed to achieve its interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Whisner </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St. 2d 181, 1 O.O. 3d 105, 351 N.E. 2d 750, this court applied a three-prong test to determine whether the \u201cminimum standards\u201d promulgated by the State Board of Education impermissibly infringed upon the right of parents of children attending a non-public school to the free exercise of religion. (See, also, <em>State, ex rel. Nagle, </em>v. <em>Olin </em>[1980], 64 Ohio St. 2d 341, 18 O.O. 3d 503, 415 N.E. 2d 279.)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">As applied to the facts of the instant case, that test can be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">(1) Are the religious beliefs truly held?<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">(2) Has it been shown that the approval requirement of R.C. 3321.04(A)(2) infringes upon appellants\u2019 constitutional right to the free exercise of religion?</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">(3) If both (1) and (2) have been satisfied by appellants, has the state demonstrated that its compelling interest in the education of its citizens cannot reasonably be achieved by means that would impose a lesser infringement upon appellants\u2019 right to the free exercise of religion?</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">If appellants satisfy the first two prongs of this test, and if the state fails to satisfy the third prong, then appellants must prevail. <em>Whisner, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">We find no indication in the record that appellants\u2019 claimed religious beliefs are not sincere. Thus appellants meet this threshold test.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-12\">However, appellants fail to demonstrate that the approval requirement of R.C. 3321.04(A)(2) infringes upon their right to the free exercise of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-13\">Unlike the compulsory attendance statutes of most states,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> R.C. 3321.04 specifically provides a home education exception. It acknowledges the right of parents to educate their children at home, and guards against the abuse of that right by requiring parents to obtain the approval of the superintendent for their home education programs. Despite the invitation from Superintendent Stiller to discuss their plan for educating Sara at home, appellants failed to submit a proposal requesting his approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-14\">This court will not speculate as to what result the superintendent would have reached had appellants submitted a proposal. We will not presume that the superintendent\u2019s actions would have been unconstitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>tional. <em>Yee Bow </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(1919), 99 Ohio St. 269, 273, 124 N.E. 132, 133, 12 A.L.R. 1424, 1427.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The case <em>sub judice </em>does not fall within the reach of <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Yoder </em>(1972), 406 U.S. 205, wherein the United States Supreme Court enunciated a standard consistent with our holdings in <em>Whisner </em>and <em>Olin, supra. </em>Here, as distinguished from Yoder,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> appellants have made a unilateral decision to ignore the plain requirement that an application for their home education proposal be submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Without an application by appellants and without a proposal to the superintendent, there is no way to balance appellants\u2019 right to the free exercise of their religion in respect to Sara\u2019s education against the state\u2019s interest, albeit by least restrictive means, in her education.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We therefore do not reach the third prong of the test in <em>Whisner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">We hold that the requirement under R.C. 3321.04(A)(2), that parents must seek the approval of the superintendent for their home education program in order to obtain an excuse from the compulsory attendance laws, reasonably furthers the state\u2019s interest in the education of its citizens and does not infringe upon the free exercis\u00e9 of religion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Nor are we persuaded by appellants\u2019 contention that there is an improper delegation of authority in the requirement that superintendents throughout Ohio make the initial determination as to who is qualified to give home instruction. The statute gives the superintendent an intelligible principle for his guidance and the desirable flexibility to accommodate home education programs that parents such as appellants and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>those similarly situated may wish to pursue. An arbitrary and capricious refusal by the superintendent can be measured and corrected in the appeal procedure provided by R.C. 3331.08. See <em>Blue Cross </em>v. <em>Ratchford </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 256, 259-260, 18 O.O. 3d 450, 452, 416 N.E. 2d 614, 617-618.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>\u201cIn case a superintendent of schools refuses to excuse a child from attendance at school for one of the reasons stated in section 3321.04 of the Revised Code, or refuses upon request to grant an age and schooling certificate as provided in section 3331.01 of the Revised Code, an appeal may be taken from such decision to the juvenile judge of the county, upon the giving of bond, within ten days thereafter, to the approval of such judge, to pay the costs of appeal. His decision in the matter shall be final.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Finally, the requirement, under R.C. 3321.04(A)(2), that the approval of the superintendent must be obtained before removing a child from a school to a home education program is not vague. Appellants knew that the law required them to request Superintendent Stiller\u2019s approval in order to educate Sara at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b62-8\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes and Douglas, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b62-9\">Locher and Brogan, JJ., separately dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b62-10\">Brogan, J., of the Second Appellate District, sitting for Wright, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-9\"> R.C. 3321.04 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">\u201cEvery parent of any child of compulsory school age who is not employed under an age and schooling certificate must send such child to a school or a special education program that conforms to the minimum standards prescribed by the state board of education, for the full time the school or program attended is in session, which shall not be for less than thirty-two weeks per school year. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-11\">t\u00ed* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-12\">\u201cExcuses from future attendance at or past absence from school or a special education program may be granted for the causes, by the authorities, and under the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-13\">\u201c(A) The superintendent of schools of the city, exempted village, or county school district in which the child resides may excuse him from attendance for any part of the remainder of the current school year upon satisfactory showing of either of the following facts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-14\">&lt;&lt;* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-15\">\u201c(2) That he is being instructed at home by a person qualified to teach the branches in which instruction is required, and such additional branches, as the advancement and needs of the child may, in the opinion of such superintendent, require.

Furthermore, many parents, even though they have a sincere desire to educate their children at home, lack the necessary training and facilities to do so.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McDonough </em>(Me. 1983), 468 A. 2d 977, at 980.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b61-14\"> See <em>State </em>v. <em>McDonough, supra; State </em>v. <em>Riddle </em>(1981), 168 W.

I believe that the determination to be made by the school superintendent as to who is \u201cqualified to teach\u201d pursuant to R.C. 3321.04(A)(2) is an improper delegation of authority contrary to the basic values underlying the principles of due process. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">R.C. 3321.04(A)(2) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-13\">\u201c(A) The superintendent of schools of the city, exempted village, or county school district in which the child resides may excuse him from attendance for any part of the remainder of the current school year upon satisfactory showing of either of the following facts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-14\">\u201c(2) That he is being instructed at home by a person <em>qualified to teach </em>the branches in which instruction is required * * *.

What must be the educational background of the teachers \u2014 must they be state-certified or does \u201cqualified\u201d allow less than that?</p>\n<p id=\"b62-16\">Today\u2019s decision forces the Schmidts to subject their sincerely held religious beliefs to the judgment of a school superintendent who is free to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>make the determination without guidance. I fail to see any language in the statute which provides the \u201cintelligible principle\u201d for decision-making espoused by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Even the majority recognizes that an arbitrary and capricious refusal can be made by a superintendent. However, it believes that such an unjust refusal can be simply corrected by an appeal to the juvenile court pursuant to R.C. 3331.08. What guidelines are provided for the juvenile court to review the qualifications of a \u201chome school\u201d teacher? This court has recognized that \u201c \u2018the courtroom is simply not the best arena for the debate of issues of educational policy and the measurement of educational quality,\u2019 * * * as well as the \u2018obvious fact that courts are not school boards or legislatures * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>State, ex rel. Nagle, </em>v. <em>Olin </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 341, 353, 18 O.O. 3d 503, 510-511, 415 N.E. 2d 279, 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">This statute fails to provide a superintendent with any guidelines as to who is \u201cqualified to teach\u201d and, in effect, permits a school superintendent to determine who is violating the law. Thus, I find it to be an improper delegation of authority contrary to the basic values underlying the principles of due process.

Our decision today, as in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whisner, </em>demonstrates simply that until such time as the State Board of Education adopts minimum standards which go no further than necessary to assure the state\u2019s legitimate interests in the education of children in private elementary schools, the balance is weighted, <em>ab initio, </em>in favor of a First Amendment claim to religious freedom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 354-355, 18 O.O. 3d at 511, 415 N.E. 2d at 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">R.C. 3321.04 provides in part that excuses from future attendance at or past absence from school or a special education program may be granted for cause by the superintendent of schools under the following condition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-11\">\u201c* * * (A)(2) That * * * [the child] is being instructed at home by a person <em>qualified </em>to teach the branches in which instruction is required, and such additional branches, as the advancement and needs of the child may, in the opinion of such superintendent, require. * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">This statute gives the school superintendent the unbridled discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>tion to determine if a home-schooling teacher is \u201cqualified.\u201d In fact, the superintendent admitted upon cross-examination that the statute provides wide latitude to school superintendents and different superintendents interpret and apply the code section differently. He testified the statute could be interpreted six hundred fifteen different ways by each of the six hundred fifteen superintendents of schools in the state. He further testified that the code section is not clear, is ambiguous, and needs clarification by the court so that parents and superintendents of schools will know what conduct is permitted and what conduct is prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">In <em>Roemhild </em>v. <em>State </em>(1983), 251 Ga. 569, 308 S.E. 2d 154, the Georgia Supreme Court held that the Georgia compulsory school attendance statute was not sufficiently definite to provide a person of ordinary intelligence, who desired to avoid its penalties by having his or her children attend private school, fair notice of what constituted a \u201cprivate school\u201d and, thus, was void for vagueness. The court also noted that the law failed to establish minimum guidelines as to what constituted a \u201cprivate school,\u201d so as to impermissibly delegate to local enforcement officials, judges and juries the policy decision of what constituted a \u201cprivate school\u201d in determining whether individuals had complied with law and was, therefore, unconstitutionally vague. See, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Popanz </em>(1983), 112 Wis. 2d 166, 332 N.W. 2d 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">As generally stated, \u201cthe void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson </em>(1983), 461 U.S. 352, 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">R.C. 3321.04(A)(2) is unconstitutionally void for its vagueness in that the definition of a \u201cperson qualified to teach\u201d does not afford a person of average intelligence what is required under the statute, and it violates the Due Process Clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions since it delegates unbridled discretion to a government official as to whether parents can exercise the fundamental constitutional right of teaching their child at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">If a statute or regulation is void on its face because it is impermissibly vague, an individual may refuse to comply with the law\u2019s requirements and still raise the law\u2019s facial invalidity as a defense in a subsequent prosecution under it. <em>Staub </em>v. <em>Baxley </em>(1958), 355 U.S. 313; <em>Thornhill </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1940), 310 U.S. 88; <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Griffin </em>(1938), 303 U.S. 444, 452-453.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and enter judgment for the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
